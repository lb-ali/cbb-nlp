_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
SMU - 71, Cincinnati - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by SMU. Coach Tim Jankovich, Sterling Brown,
Semi Ojeleye, Ben Moore.  
  
Coach, congratulations. We'll take an opening statement.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Thank you. Thank you. I don't even know what to say. What a
great day. What a great tournament. A lot of fun; lot of fun. And we played
terrific today, but the biggest thing for me is I'm so happy for these guys
and all of the guys on our team. They've been absolutely fabulous all season
long. They never cease to amaze me, including today, and I'm just happy for
everybody in our camp.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open to questions at this time.  
  
Q. Coach?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Yeah. These lights are hot. Hot lights. Hot lights.  
  
Q. How proud are you of the guys winning their second conference title
in three years? What are your thoughts on that?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Say that again.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts winning three tourney titles in three years?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I think it's really hard in a league like ours. This is an
outstanding league. Look at what we're rated year after year. Great teams,
incredible traditions, incredible coaches with amazing track records. This is
a high, high level basketball conference in The American, and for these guys
to be able to do that two out of three years, it's pretty incredible. Pretty
incredible, really.  
  
Q. Coach you go into the tournament on a 16 game winning streak, 26 out
of 27, and get a six seed. Can you talk about how you feel about where you're
seeded and -- you got to figure you're the hottest team going into the
tournament?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I really could start bitching and whining, I really could. I
hear -- I watch -- and I don't blame coaches for doing it at all. I don't
blame them because you always feel like our guys deserve better. I certainly
think they deserve a great number. But you know what the truth is? I don't
care at all. I could care less what the number is. They're just numbers. It's
like preseason rankings. They're just silly numbers. The Committee tries their
best. They're trying to assess everybody. It's a hard job. You know what? I'm
thrilled we're playing on Friday. That's my biggest thing. I thought that was
going to be really, really important. We're the last game in the country
today, if I'm not mistaken, and we're a long way from home.  
  
I wanted a Friday game. So you can have the number, but I wanted that one
extra day and so I'm really happy about it.  
  
Q. For the players, last year you had to sit out the post season. How
gratifying is it to come back and have a great year and to win a championship
and going to the NCAA Tournament?  
BEN MOORE: Oh, wow. It's very gratifying. I'm really proud of the team. All of
the players contributed. The coaching staff has done a good job. We just did
it for the fans. They've always come out and supported us, and we're really
thankful for them.  
  
STERLING BROWN: Same thing. You know, we're just grateful. You know, I mean,
it feels great. Not being able to last year, but this team, we fought every
game, and, I mean, you see the results.  
  
Q. What was the difference between today between Cincinnati and how you
were able to pick up that win and pull away in the second half?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I didn't hear you again. My ears are ringing from all of the
fans.  
  
Q. You know, what enabled you all to pull in in the second half against
Cincinnati?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Oh, oh, second half? I think we got in a really good rhythm
offensively against their switching defense. And it's not easy to play
against, and particularly not that easy when you don't really have -- you have
a ballroom walk through, and a little chalk talk. That's how you get to
prepare. You usually get to practice a little bit, but we didn't it on the
fly. Our guys did an amazing job of understanding it, and more importantly,
executing it. And I just thought we got into a great flow and confidence and
comfort level in the second half, and we just continued to execute and get
great shots. And, of course, the other end was outstanding, you know, really,
really from start to finish.  
  
Q. Sterling, you guys opened on an 11-2 run, you never trailed. Can you
talk about your mindset? I think you had six points in the opening run. Your
mindset getting off to a quick start.  
STERLING BROWN: You just said we had to get off to a good start, jump on them
early. From that, there was no looking back. We were ready for this game.
We've been thinking about it for the last two years. When we got that, we just
seized the opportunity.  
  
Q. For all of you players, it looked like it got easier and more
comfortable as the evening went on. What do you think that was even though you
played game after game after game three days in a row.  
THE MODERATOR: Semi, will you take that?  
  
SEMI OJELEYE: Can you repeat the question, please?  
  
Q. It looked like you guys got more comfortable as the tournament went
on. Why do you think that was?  
SEMI OJELEYE: I guess -- I don't know. We just had to take our time to get our
rhythm. Our chemistry is as high as any team in the country. It was only a
matter of time until we hit our stride in tournament play, so I guess we just
needed a little time to get it together.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach or the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Semi, can you just talk about your post season experience? I mean,
you come in here and win MVP, had three great games. So, what were you
thinking? Were you nervous at all coming into the post season? What was your
mindset in the three days?  
SEMI OJELEYE: It's a little different knowing that if you lose you go home.
But I love these guys, I love my coaches. They all give me confidence and
that's why I play for them. It's business as usual for me going into the
games. I'm just trying to help my team win.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious, given what you've seen from your team down the
stretch in the season. How confident are you you guys will be playing your
best basketball this coming week and how well-positioned is the team to make a
deep run in the national tournament?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I think I've just had -- because of them, for, I don't know, a
good part of two, three -- two and a half months, they've just given me so
much confidence, so, mine doesn't have to grow for them. I just keep being
amazed by what they do night after night. I'm really thankful that we did get
to play three games here, because tournament settings do feel a little bit
different than conference races.  
  
You know, you sort of settle into that conference race mode. You come to a
tournament, and sometimes it can be just a tiny bit disconcerting. And the
fact that we got to play three of them, you know, three hard games, three
high-level games, I think the biggest thing for me is I think it will feel,
you know, next week, much like it just did here. It's the same thing. It's
championship basketball.  
  
So maybe I gained a tiny bit more confidence just for the fact that they got
to experience all this. But I also want to say we've got Sterling and Ben
here, these guys came. We were -- they kind of bet on us. It wasn't going all
that strong. We were in our first year. They took a chance on us. They also
took a chance by staying through some really, really rough times that not many
athletes across the country ever experienced, nothing I've ever experienced in
all of the years I coached or played. And for them to just, you know, just to
keep going forward and forward, there would be a lot of adults that could
learn a lot from the way they handled things.  
  
And then for Semi to come in the midst of all of this and transfer. I mean,
that's what I think is the hidden thing. Those of us that have lived all of
this and known what these guys have been through, and the way they've acted
and the way they've competed, and the lack of whining, complaining, pointing
fingers, and all of that, and for them to have cut down nets in two different
-- in a week in a row, they're cutting down nets, and now we're getting to
going into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
That's why it means more than I can describe. This is not normal. This is not
just a bunch of guys that had a good year and they're going to the Tournament.
It runs deeper than that, at least it does for me for sure.  
  
Q. Sterling, can you just talk about how this team's confidence level is
going into the Tournament, 16-game winning streak, you know, 26 out of 27 or
whatever? Do you feel like you're the team to beat?  
STERLING BROWN: Our confidence is very high. We just go out there and do what
we do. We're gelling on and off the floor and it's showing. I feel like we're
going to make a good run in the Tournament. We got high expectations. We got
high goals and we've been accomplishing them since the beginning of the
season. But I feel like our confidence is pretty high.  
  
THE MODERATOR: SMU, congratulations. Thank you for joining us.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Thank you very much.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
SMU - 71, Cincinnati - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mick Cronin, Gary Clark. Coach, your thoughts on the
tournament and then on your post season path that you have in front of you.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Can I just do the tournament then we'll let him go, and I'll do
the interview?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Of course.  
  
MICK CRONIN: First of all, congratulations SMU. I've been telling people how
good they are for a long time. They made it look easy, which is hard to do
against our defense, really, really hard to do against our defense. That's a
credit to them, their talent, their execution. So, I give them all of the
credit in the world. They were just the better team today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take question for Gary.  
  
Q. Gary, why did they have so much success keeping you guys away from
the basket? That's their modus operandi. Did you try anything different to try
to get more shots?  
GARY CLARK: Going in, we knew they were like an over-help team. They're always
looking to help each other. A lot of times, we were trying to back-screen them
and set flares and so forth. They were just playing hard and executing their
defensive game plan.  
  
Q. Gary, can you talk about the start of the game? Obviously, you guys
weren't shooting the way you'd like. Did you guys feel like you were going to
win it at that point and where did you feel the game turned?  
GARY CLARK: Of course, as competitors, you don't think it's over at all until
the horn sounds. But when they're hitting shots, you've got to be able to come
together as a unit and get stops, you know? They're executing on offense, you
got to execute on defense and get stops in. We're scrambling around, trying to
cause havoc and get steals and deflections in. They just kept executing.  
  
Q. How disappointing is it to go into a tournament after a game like
that? Can you just put that behind you? I guess you have to. Does that make
you more determined to make a good run in the tournament or does it have any
effect at all?  
GARY CLARK: As a team, it's learning and more learning. We have to look at
film and prepare for our next game. Of course, you have to put it behind you
as a team and just know some of the places that we need help on, to fix it.
Because in the next couple games, it's just, you win or go home. There's no
room for error.  
  
Q. Are you going to talk about the Tournament?  
MICK CRONIN: We went on the board, and I just came in here, so I've had ten
seconds to think about it. I've told you everything I need to say about that
stuff. What I will tell you is -- it Kansas State and Wake we play the winner
of?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Yes.  
  
MICK CRONIN: We -- I haven't seen Kansas State. I think I only saw Wake play
Xavier for scouting purposes, so I don't know much about either one of them.
I'm just going to focus on basketball. We had an unbelievable year. We won 29
games. SMU won 30 games. I think it's pretty obvious that nobody was really
impressed with that. I don't know what else to say.  
  
With that being said, I don't want the story to be about something I say. You
know, we've had a great year, and I'm going to focus on coaching my team,
trying to go out there and win two games, for a third trip to the Pacific
Coast time zone in the last four years of the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you're one of, like, seven teams that have been to the NCAA
Tournament for seven straight -- for the last seven straight years. Can you
just talk about the program and the continuity you guys have had, and where
you feel this team is in that continuity?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, first of all, I appreciate you bringing that up. We take a
lot of pride in the consistency, because what I will expound upon is, the way
we try to operate our program is graduation is important; player development
is important; human development is important; continuity of players; loyalty
to players, four-year players a lot of times. Not that we wouldn't take a guy
that wanted to come if he was a McDonald's All American, and he was a one-year
player. But we don't believe in sacrificing what the University hired me to do
11 years ago, which was establish integrity, and a culture in our program, and
I remember it like it was yesterday. And I was well aware of that. So, it
hasn't been easy, because it's not easy to do, to get really good kids, to
graduate everybody, and continue to win. It's very, very to do.  
  
So, we take a lot of pride in the way we do things because we know how hard it
is. And people in our business know how hard it is. And I keep using the term
"we" because I have a great coaching staff. I have -- Antoine Jackson has done
a great job developing with us. And Larry Davis is a head coach. He just
happens to be on my staff. I doubled his salary so he came with me and Darren
Savino and I are on the same career path. He's a head coach. He's on my staff.
He just got derailed when things derailed for Fran Fraschilla in New Mexico. I
was fortunate to be able to scoop him up.  
  
It's a team effort, what we do. We take a lot of pride in it. It's not easy.
It's not easy to do it the way we do it. Winning is one thing. Winning and
graduating everybody and trying to have really good kids and representing our
University, and being a positive window to the world when people think about
the connotation about Cincinnati basketball. We've worked really hard to get
that into a positive light, and that's why we have -- we're fortunate we got
CBS following us around because I want people to realize the great kids we
have on our team.  
  
Q. Is there a downside, and what is it to having to travel that far to
get ready for these tournaments?  
MICK CRONIN: One of my best -- a couple of my best friends in the world live
on the West Coast, so maybe that's the good thing. They're going to be able to
come to the game. Here's the downside for us, and this is not just for us. My
players' families -- Troy Caupain, three of the four years, he and Kevin
Johnson and Zach Tolbert go to the NCAA Tournament, they're in Spokane twice
and Sacramento once. That's really not easy for their families to be able to
get to those games.  
  
Other than that, I mean -- and that's a big thing. But other than that, we
don't believe in excuses. So, that won't be talked about at all by our team.  
  
Q. Mick, forgive me, I missed the very beginning, but I wanted to ask
you about -- you talk about each game is unique, you said that many times.
What do you take out of today's game. Again, you won 29 games.  
MICK CRONIN: I think it's a great lesson and each game is unique. Because in a
seven-game series, you come out and miss the shots that we missed, especially
in the first half, and a team makes a lot of hard shots against you, and
they're good. You can't just come back. You can't just make -- they're too
good. You're not just going to get them to start throwing the ball away all
the time. You're not going to jump over them and get every rebound. They're an
elite team. So you're probably going to lose that game. That's what makes this
tournament that we're going in -- this tournament or any college basketball
environment, what it is. It's a one-game shot. It's a one-game shot and that's
important.  
  
The lesson we'll take from it is making sure at the beginning of the game that
you're ready to go. Because we dug ourselves a hole. I knew it was going to be
really hard to climb out against them. What happens is their confidence goes
up, we're missing, and ours get shaken a little bit, and you've got to try to
make sure you get off to a good start. Today, they were just a better team
today. They shot the ball in. They even shot guarded shots in. We didn't. We
missed a lot of open shots. They were the better team.  
  
Q. How about playing Friday/Sunday, versus Thursday/Saturday?  
MICK CRONIN: Tuesday?  
  
Q. Does that matter?  
MICK CRONIN: I think any advantage of playing Friday is out the window with
having to travel to the West Coast probably.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Congratulations. Best of luck
in the post season.

_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Cincinnati - 81, UConn - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: UConn is here. Joined by Rodney Purvis, Jalen Adams, Christian
Vital. Head coach, Kevin Ollie. We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
Coach, if we begin with your thought on the game please.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: First, I want to just thank our crowd for coming out and helping
us through the whole season. They didn't ever give up on us, I appreciate
that. It was a tough, hard-fought game. Our guys never gave in. I thought the
second half they came out and really fought. Just proud of them. Proud of our
seniors. They won a lot of games here and left this program better. And the
next thing they have to do is graduate, and that's going be probably one of
the happiest days they have here at UConn. And I want them to finish strong,
and let them know they always got a family here and I appreciate them to
death.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. This one's for Christian. What would you say is your biggest take-
away from the season, and what can you say that you learned from Rodney this
season?  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: I would say my biggest take-away is how to keep fighting,
never to give up, and what it really means to play for UConn. I learned a lot
from Rodney, and not only Rodney, but the other seniors as well, you know?
They've taught me discipline. They've taught me how not to be a freshman and,
you know, just how to be composed on the court at all times and fighting
through adversity. They did a really great job of being our captains this year
and leading us as a team, and that's something I'm going take through the rest
of my career here at UConn and I appreciate them.  
  
Q. This is for Rodney. Rodney, why do you think you got close a bunch of
times and weren't able to get over the hump? Why do you think that is?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I just think we needed to dig down a little bit more, get the
key stops that we really needed to get once we was in reach. Anytime we got
the game down to, like, four or five, I just think we would make a small
mistake on the defensive end and give them another shot at it, or we would
foul and they were going to the free-throw line, and that was it.  
  
Q. Rodney, obviously, the game was called pretty tightly. How did that
change the way you guys were playing and how did you -- obviously, they had a
deeper bench than you guys did, so how did you adjust when all those fouls
started getting called?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I think we did the best that we could as far as the foul
trouble and the different things of that nature. Of course, I can sit up here
and say I felt that we played good defense, and somehow we fouled, so, I don't
know. But the game is over with, you know? Like I said, the main thing we
wanted to do was just try to get stops and get timely stops.  
  
Q. Rodney, I want to know what was going through your mind when you left
the court for the final time. You seemed pretty emotional on the bench. What
was going through your mind at that point?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Probably that it was just my last time being in a UConn jersey.
That's about it.  
  
Q. Jalen, how difficult was it to have to sit at the end of the first
half with the foul trouble?  
JALEN ADAMS: It was tough. I see my guys out there fighting, trying to hold on
and get the lead, get back in the game, and I put myself -- I put the team in
a difficult position by getting those early fouls. So I'VE just got to learn
from that and stay solid and disciplined.  
  
Q. Rodney, this is for you. As you reflect on your time at UConn, a
couple things you're most proud of from the experience.  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just overall relationships I've built with my teammates,
coaching staff, peers around campus. That's it, really. Just the relationships
was a huge piece since I've been here at UConn. Of course, the basketball was
great. But it's nothing like the relationships that -- you meet people and
you're able to connect with them for the rest of your life.  
  
Q. Jalen and Christian, the team obviously went through so much
adversity, especially injury-wise this season. Did you talk about how that's
preparing you for what's coming next season, especially Christian. Obviously
you got some playing time that you might not have gotten otherwise.  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: To me, I'm just ready, you know? Whatever minutes was thrown
to me, obviously, you know, everyone had -- everyone's role increased through
the injuries that we got. So I'm just going to go into next year just with the
same confidence that I had this year and just ready to compete with my guys
again.  
  
JALEN ADAMS: I think the injuries were very unfortunate, but I think as a team
we learned a lot. Going into next year, we know, even if we're short-handed,
we can compete with everybody. We just learned the overall lesson to never
give up and keep fighting. I think that's the overall lesson and that should
carry on forever.  
  
Q. Rodney, you talked about this game last night and you said one word,
that you guys had to be tough. Is that essentially the kind of game you were
anticipating where you wanted to be physical, match them, for toughness, hit
them first, hit them back? Is that really the kind of game that you guys
wanted to play against them?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Yes, definitely. That's the only way you can really compete
with a team like Cincinnati, SMU guys, who just crash the boards nonstop.
They're a physical team. So the only way you can compete with those guys is to
play tough against them.  
  
Q. Rodney, correct me if I am wrong, you were at UConn, I guess you were
sitting out that year when you all won the title, correct?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Yes.  
  
Q. When you were sitting there watching, what was it like in the locker
room in that group, given what you experienced before and how did that affect
that title run?  
RODNEY PURVIS: It was great. That team had a lot of veteran guys on it,
Shabazz, Boatwright, all those guys were great leaders -- Niels Giffey, Tyler
Olander. All of those guys have been through a lot over the course of their
career. Shabazz, Niels, and Tyler, they all won a championship before, so they
all knew what it took. All of those guys were great guys. Shabazz was a just
great leader himself. He didn't have to say much, even though he did. Guys was
going to follow his lead. So that was the main thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seeing none, gentlemen, thank you. Excuse you to the locker
room.  
  
And we'll continue to questions for Coach Ollie.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of the same question I had for the players. Obviously
this wasn't the season you were anticipating, first losing season
Connecticut's had in 30 years, but how does it prepare this team going forward
with the adversity you faced? How will that help?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I think adversity always helps. It's just part of life. You've
got to fail to succeed most of the time. So, we looking at it as disappoint --
a moment in our career, my career, my players' career that you got to get
better from. You build off of it. One thing I know, they didn't give up in
that locker room and they didn't stop believing. They didn't stop fighting.
This is not a basketball lesson, this is a life lesson for some of these guys.
That's what it's going to be in life. Life is going to punch you sometimes and
that's just how you respond.  
  
I thought they responded great. I tried to be positive throughout the whole
season, try to coach them and prepare them as best as possible, and I thought
those guys played hard for me. But most importantly, they played hard for what
is on the front of their chest.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to play, or coach this game when it's so choppy
with stoppages whether it's called that way or played that way?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It's just tough substituting, you know? But I guess the Refs did
the best job that they possibly can, you know? You see 46 free throws, 31 free
throws, in one half. So, I don't know if a lot of people was watching that
game, I mean because it's just all free throws. So, that's not how basketball
is supposed to be played.  
  
Q. Kevin, just kind of follow up on that. When Nick was in, he talked
about in Cincinnati, assuming it was with Xavier, he said ugliness occurs when
you don't call every foul. And I don't want to get you in trouble with
officiating, but were you surprised that it was called as tight as it was?
Because it seemed like everything was called today. I'm wondering if that was
tough to work through?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Like I said, it was a tough game played. We don't have a bench
anyway. We're short-handed, but just trying to shuffle guys in and out. I
thought our guys fought through adversity, just some unfortunate calls, just
didn't go our way. So, I mean, it's the game -- that happens sometimes. You've
got to make adjustments. We didn't make the adjustments today, I guess.  
  
Cincinnati, I give Mick a ton of credit, though, so it's not just the Refs; I
mean, they put our guys in position to foul. So, we have to show more
resistance, but that's a good team, it's going to be a great Championship
game, and both of those teams are going to represent the American Conference
very well in the tournament.  
  
Hopefully our guys learned from this, how to play on a championship level, and
I thought we did that in the second half. But, of course, it's hard to win a
game when a team goes to the free-throw line 46 times. Credit to them, they
made them. In the second half they made 28 out of 31.  
  
Q. Coach, tough loss here tonight. I often believe that when your team
has to compete, they best take on your demeanor and your personality out there
on the court. Can you speak to how proud you are of this unit despite injuries
and how they fought tonight?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah. Like I said, I'm proud of them. That's not even the word.
I'm just -- I know they got better, you know, throughout the year. They could
have made every excuse in the book, but they never did. They came to practice.
I mean, sometimes we had practice with four guys, and, you know, anybody knows
my practices, we practice full. And we have four guys trying to play with
walk-ons and everything. So I'm just have pride in those guy. I love them.  
  
Those seniors, they didn't miss a practice. Just the energy they brought and
the leadership they brought was just something that I'll always cherish. You
know, everybody can say we had a losing season in 30 years -- I don't know
what it is. I think you said 30 years. But at the end of the day, I know those
guys got some brothers for a lifetime and, that's the thing I pride myself on
from UConn. We're going to keep fighting, we'll going to be right back, and
we'll be back better than ever. And I truly believe that.  
  
Q. How did guys like Christian and Vance benefit from the extra playing
time they had this year because you were short-handed?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I thought they benefitted well. They came in, they was thrown to
the fire. It wasn't like I was able to take them out or anything like that.
They just fought. They kept getting better and better and better. What
Christian did today, that's UConn basketball right there. That's the type of
players I want, just fighting, scrappy. I got to calm them down a little bit,
but I'd rather calm you down than try to stir you up. And that kid, I don't
ever have to stir up. He got's super confidence, going in and getting nine
rebounds and he went to get some man rebounds. That's what our guards do. He
has a bright career ahead of him.  
  
I thought Vance struggled in the first half a little bit, taking some ill-
advised shots, but then settled down in the second half and started playing
solid. Everybody from 1 through 8, we had this year, 1 through 6, we had --
three quarters of the season, they played tough, and I appreciate them for
that, and they didn't make no excuses.  
  
Q. How you going to replace the guys -- how are you going to replace
Rodney, two big guys up front. That's a lot of experience leaving. What do you
feel you need to happen to be able to pick up the slack for those guys next
year?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I mean, you just got to work. Every team is going to lose
players. At the end of the day, you go into summertime, you be selfish, you
get in the gym and try to get better. You can't replace Kemba; you can't
replace Shabazz, you can't replace Amida because they're their own entity. But
you can replace them -- not replace them, but you can get better because of
their presence, learn from them, and then whoever is coming back that's
putting on a UConn jersey, have a different mindset, have a championship
mindset.  
  
Every season is different. Those guys got to come back, they've got to work,
they've got to be coachable. They've got to get in the weight room. They got
to get a nutrition plan. They got to finish well in school. There's a lot of
things they got to do. Emotionally, spiritually, physically, everything got to
change. Because you can't be the same person you was today. You got to be
something different tomorrow.  
  
Hopefully, they got their lessons from me and hopefully they get their lessons
from all of the resources around our great program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Coach Ollie, thank you.

_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
SMU - 70, UCF - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Sterling Brown, Shake Milton, and Ben Moore and head
coach, Tim Jankovich. Our format, will be the same as it's been through the
tournament. We'll take an opening statement from Coach. We'll take questions
for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, welcome. If you'll give your thoughts on the game and advancing to the
Championship, please.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: That was a long walk. I've got to catch my breath. So impressed
with Central Florida. All year long, the job Johnny's done, their tremendous
defensive team, and the way they adjust, you know, when the big fellow's in or
when the big fellow's out. I think they're a great defensive team. Here late
in the season, yesterday, today, they were as good offensively as I've seen
them all year. So, they made us play our best. They made us play awfully hard
for 40 minutes, and I was really impressed.  
  
But I'm most of all so proud of our guys bouncing back from the ending. You
know, we played very well yesterday for 34 minutes or so, and then really had
a rough ending. So to bounce back from that and really looked like the team
that we've seen all year. I'm really proud and happy for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. Sterling, what happened after 'Gu drew that tech. How did that change
that game and what did that do for you?  
STERLING BROWN: We just had to pick it up and come out aggressive. We've got a
game plan that we've got to execute. Everybody, they was locked in. We came
out and did what we had to do.  
  
Q. Shake, can you talk about that whole sequence? I mean, neither of the
teams had led by more than six points, then there's the steal underneath
against Tacko Fall, the three-pointer on the other end, technical foul, and
all of a sudden, it's a ten-point ball game. Was that the turning point for
you guys. Did you feel like you had it at that point.  
SHAKE MILTON: I don't know if we felt like we had it. I just felt like
whenever things get a little rough or it get down to crunch time, our team
does a good job of coming together, especially being led by these two seniors.
They make it pretty easy to tighten everything up. I think it really showed on
the defensive end, the way we were rebounding helping each other, and also on
the offensive end, moving the ball an getting good shots.  
  
Q. Yesterday, Semi, was really good for you guys all game. Yesterday it
was really you guys doing all of the work. What was different today for you
two?  
SHAKE MILTON: I mean, with this team, everybody stays ready. So, it doesn't
matter whose night it is. Everybody is unselfish as well. If you're hot, we're
going to get you the ball. I think from Semi to Jamin and then Jarrey,
everybody does a good job of sharing the ball and makes sure the right person
gets the ball and gets the good shot.  
  
Q. Ben, I think both teams, I think each team had like ten points in the
paint. You guys had ten three-pointers each. So, what was happening inside
that led to such a dearth of scoring in the middle?  
BEN MOORE: I think both teams were locked in defensively because come around
to tournament time, that's the most important thing. So both teams were
playing hard on the defensive end and we were tried to keep it out in play.
That was a big key.  
  
Q. You guys had been playing mostly zone all season. What challenges
especially were they bringing especially in the first ten minutes that were
causing you guys trouble?  
BEN MOORE: I mean, I think one of the biggest keys to their zone defense is
Tacko sitting in the middle. So you've got to get adjusted to that because
playing against a 7'6" guy is always tough. I think we did get adjusted. The
coaching staff did a great job getting great plays. It was good.  
  
Q. You guys have more wins than any other team in program history and
Sterling, or, Shake, can you address what that means to you guys to have this
many wins, you know, and obviously going for another championship tomorrow?  
STERLING BROWN: It's definitely a great accomplishment. We just go out every
day and try to play hard. We're definitely not done. We have one more tomorrow
and then the NCAA. It's a good accomplishment, but we know we're not done. We
got a bigger goal that we're trying to accomplish to add to those wins.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
We'll excuse the student-athletes to the locker room then, thank you,
gentlemen. At this time we'll take questions for Coach Jankovich.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: They leave me by myself. Is that what they do? They just leave
me hanging? Figures.  
  
Q. Coach, this team, I don't think had a single preseason vote in the
A.P. poll, and here you are with 29 wins. Can you talk about what it means for
you guys to get to this stage and be fighting for a Conference Championship?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Well, I would say first, bad voting, bad voting, bad early on
voting which is -- I always say -- and I'm messing with you.  
  
Is there anything less important than a preseason vote, right? But what I do
want to say is, you know, the name of this game that we're in is winning. The
name of the game is winning, and these guys are incredible winners. I'm just
-- I love being with them. I love what they stand for. I love the fact that
they have been a part of the most wins in the school history. And it's not an
accident, because that's really what they play for and I know you --
supposedly we're all playing for that. You know what? We live in a day and age
where that's not necessarily the case. I hope we win, but I hope I do really,
really well, too. Maybe as long as I do really well, things pretty good.  
  
There's a lot of sacrifice and giving and unselfishness that goes into being a
great team. It's not that easy. It's not swimming and diving, it's not tennis.
It's a group of guys that were all very, very, very good players in their own
right. When they come together, and everybody's keeping stats, and who's the
leading scorer, and all of those kind of things, and to get an entire group to
actually give themselves to say -- you know what's the most important and
second-most important thing is winning. And that's what these guys have been
all about, and that's why I've said for about the 17,000th time this year, how
much I love coaching them, because their thoughts are pure. They are a little
bit throwback. They are a joy to coach.  
  
Q. You know, yesterday you talked about today would be a good time for
guys to step up outside of Semi. How pleased were you, and how important is it
going forward to have production out of guys like Sterling and Shake like they
had today?  
TIM JANKOVICH: It's very important, but it is who we've been as you well know.
It's who we are. We are not a one-man team. We have a lot of great one-man
players on a given night. I can tell you that. You know what? If some of these
guys played maybe on a different type of team or maybe a team with not quite
as much fire power, you know, they would have more of those nights.  
  
And that's kind of what I'm saying. They sacrificed for the one common goal
and they know, they're mature enough to know some nights it's me, and some
nights it's you, and some nights it's him. And we've seen countless times when
different people, it's their night, and I think it was hat Ben said, whoever's
night it is, we try to feed the hot hand and we do it willingly. And it's just
-- it's a beautiful thing.  
  
I thought we played so unselfishly. I thought we were just -- not a bone in
our body that was not, you know, cut in with all the right thoughts. I loved
our ball movement. I loved a lot of things we did. And having said that, we
still couldn't get away from them for the longest. They played great and they
were so prepared. Their defense is always great, but offensively, they've just
gotten better and better. A lot of guys are stepping into a whole different
role for me. A lot of the guys that normally score, they score, but good
balance from them, and it was a really, really good win. I think Central
Florida might be as undervalued or underappreciated or unknown of a tough out
as anybody in the country. I've been saying that for the longest time. I
really have. I've been watching them. I've been watching their defensive
numbers and watching them grow. And that's why I'm so happy about today.  
  
Q. Coach, Ben Moore didn't score a point today but in the last day, he
was instrumental defending Matt William, shut them down in the second half
last time you played them. You put him into today switching him around on
guys. How big of a contributor is he on the defensive end?  
TIM JANKOVICH: He's great. He's one of our best defenders. You could argue --
if I said he's our best defender, I'd have a whole bunch of guys mad at me on
our team, because we have a lot of good defenders. But he's in the discussion,
for sure, every single night. So whether he scores or whether he doesn't, he
always plays well for us. He shot the ball really well over the course of
conference season. He's hit a number of countless big shots. He guarded --
you're right, he guarded Matt Williams tremendously when we played him there.
But the problem is, couldn't beg Sterling off of him today so -- didn't want
to go against a senior that's begging for that challenge. And he did a great
job and wasn't fouling. And he just -- but I would have had 100 percent --
obviously, from experience, 100 percent having Ben guard him the whole game.  
  
Q. Coach, four of your starters played 35 or more minutes and Sterling
Brown played all 40. How big of a concern is rest or lack thereof going into
the third straight day of the game?  
TIM JANKOVICH: You know, kind of big. Kind of big. But we made the decision. I
was even asked before we came here, how do you approach the tournament, and I
also said, I thought this -- a conference tournament for our team, because of
our numbers, in a lot of ways, was even a bigger challenge than the conference
season.  
  
I know that a lot of things can happen with injury and illness, but at least
you have a couple days in between to rest and prepare. Here we're working on
such short numbers, and if we were fortunate enough, which we are, to play
three games in three nights, I felt like this could be as hard as anything
we'll do all year, particularly, you know, we're going to have a great
opponent in the Championship game. It's a huge challenge.  
  
Obviously, in the NCAA Tournament, you'll play some outstanding team, but at
least they give you a day to rest if you're fortunate enough to advance. So
this -- I said it before and I agree now, that this is going to be a very,
very, very big challenge for us tomorrow. Having said that, no excuse.  
  
Q. Sterling in particular, really locked in today, defense, offense.
What did you see out of him especially in the second half when he really kind
of took over a little bit?  
TIM JANKOVICH: He was just great, you know? He was just great. He played
great. He played like a tough-minded, highly motivated senior that he is. You
know? He wants both ends. He wants the toughest guy, he wants to rebound it.
He wants to shoot it. He made some terrific assists, I thought. He drove the
ball hard. He found people, timely passes. He was just outstanding, I thought.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more? One final question? Coach, congratulations on
advancing. We'll see you tomorrow.  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Thank you very much.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

### [Nick Banyard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32987)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
SMU - 70, UCF - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: UCF is here, we're joined by head coach Johnny Dawkins;
sophomore, B.J. Taylor, Nick Banyard. Same format as yesterday. We'll ask for
an opening statement. Couch, your thoughts on the game, please?  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought it was a hard-fought gam. I thought we lost to a
good team. They're a champion in that league for a good reason. I thought they
made a lot of big plays when they had to. They defended very well also.
They're a very good team. They played well tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for B.J. and Nick.  
  
Q. B.J., neither team had led by more than six points before the
sequence when there was the steal from Tacko and the three-pointer on the
other end and technical foul. Could you describe what happened especially with
the technical and did you feel that was a turning point?  
B.J. TAYLOR: No. It wasn't the turning point. Like Coach said, give SMU a lot
of credit. They're a good team and they played really hard tonight, so give
them credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you guys can you just talk about this season? You went
under many people's radar and finished the season with 21 wins which is, you
know, the second best record programs had in over a decade. Can you just talk
about the growth of this team this year and how you feel -- where you feel you
guys are right now?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I just want to thank the seniors, Matt -- Matt Williams, Nick,
and Tank, for everything they've done for the program. I mean, they were the
leaders of it. Me and Matt were the captains, but they were the leaders of it.
They set a great foundation and established a great culture for what you said
it was going to be in the future. I can't thank them enough for what they've
done for our team this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nick, take that was well. Your thoughts of the season in
general?  
  
NICK BANYARD: I definitely think we improved as a team and as people on and
off the court. Looking back at the beginning of the year, this team now, we
definitely would be able to beat the team that we started with. That's always
a positive. That's how you want to look at it. That's on the court and off the
court. We definitely grew as people, matured and definitely will help us later
on in life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more from the student-athletes? Okay, gentlemen, we'll
excuse you to the locker room. Thank you for coming.  
  
At this time take questions for Coach Dawkins.  
  
Q. Coach, SMU had been doing such a good job with Ojeleye inside. I
think both teams had ten points in the paint and it turned into a three-point
shooting contest for a while. Was that kind of the strategy to try to control
the inside defensively, and, you know, were you happy at where you were for
most of the game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I think both teams are really good defensively. You can
tell that by our field goal percentage defensively for both of our programs.
So it's going to be hard to score. It's going to be a game you have to grind
out. You have to find opportunities and open looks when you can get them.
Usually it's not going to be in the paint, it's going to be on the perimeter.
Give them credit. I think they made a number -- a few more threes than we did
tonight. That was the difference in the ball game. That and free throws.  
  
I think both teams did a good job of competing. There's a reason why they were
champions this year. They've been the most consistent team throughout the
season, them and Cincinnati, and I'm just proud of our kids for the effort
that we gave tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about B.J. Taylor and what he means to this team?
There's a point there, I think with like three minutes to go where he
basically tried to shoot you guys back into the game. Made a couple three-
pointers in a row and got this thing close again. The mentality that he has on
the court?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, he's a winner. You know, B.J.'s a winner, and he's a
terrific leader and, of course, he's made a lot of big plays for us in a
number of our games down the stretch, and he's someone that we've been able to
count on. So I'm looking forward to continuing to coach him and continuing to
watch him develop, because he is a great spirit, and he has a chance to be a
terrific point guard.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this game just ended and you still might have some
games to play in the future, but how would you assess this season from UCF
from the beginning to now?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's hard for me at the moment because I'm very disappointed
our season has come to an end in the regular season and in our conference
tournament. Looking from where we started, I'll say -- as Nick mentioned
before, I think this team today, in March, to beat the team back in October,
for sure. And that's always what you want to see happen. You want to see
growth and development in your young men on and off the court. And I can say
we've actually seen that with this group, so I'm very excited about what they
were able to accomplish, even though it wasn't, you know, our ultimate goal.
The things they were able to accomplish this year, you know, I'm proud of,
because I know how hard they worked to put us in position to have these
opportunities.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I had asked B.J. about this, but did you see what happened on
that whole sequence where the technical foul, and it went from a six-point
game and ended up --  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I didn't really see the play. I was calling the time-out and
he has to make the call. I was getting his attention to make the call. I was
looking at the Ref to make sure the call was called. I didn't see what
happened. But it's basketball. Guys come competing, and that play is probably
one, I think, in our game now because the coaches have to -- the player has to
call it. Everyone now is making plays on the basketball, while the player's
trying to make the call. So when that happens there's going to be a lot of
guys, a lot of congestion in that area.  
  
Like I said, I didn't see what happened. I just know it's an awkward situation
that the coach can't make that call because then it alleviates all of that
opportunity for guys trying to steal the ball while the player is calling time
out. So I think it eliminates a lot of the contact that you see right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Dawkins, thank you.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: All right. Guys, take care.

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Troy Caupain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28621)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

### [Jacob Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30829)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 81, UConn - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: And Cincinnati is here, welcome Gary Clark, Jacob Evans, Troy
Caupain and head coach, Mick Cronin.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Obviously, a hard-fought game, which only makes you better.
Congratulate Kentan Facey, Amida Brimah, and Rodney Purvis on a great year.
Those guys play extremely hard. That's what college basketball is all about.
They never give in. They had unbelievably bad luck with injuries this season,
and I have great respect for Kevin and his program, how hard those guys play.  
  
That being said, our guys performed today, especially some of these guys
sitting next to me. Kyle carried us a lot offensively this year, and he was
obviously a nonfactor today with foul trouble, but we've got a lot of answers
on this team, and they haven't gotten a lot of attention. I would say the same
thing about SMU. They got great players as well. I was happy, extremely happy
for these guys that they were able to perform on this stage today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. For Troy, I guess, you played in a lot of games. Have you ever played
in a game quite like this with so many stops and so many whistles? How proud
are you and your teammates for doing so well from the line?  
MICK CRONIN: Are you trying to insinuate that UConn got cheated? Okay. I'm
just checking.  
  
TROY CAUPAIN: We've been in a couple games, hard-fought games. Last year was
filled with them. This year had a couple of them. Just being able to make that
same play, that winning play, getting defensive stops, rebounding the
basketball, and then focusing on free throws. We do drills in practice. It's
all about making them. If you don't, you've got to run, so I'm glad we stepped
up to the line and did what we were supposed to do at the line today.  
  
Q. Gary, what happened to your tooth?  
GARY CLARK: It was already, you know, chipped from earlier in the year. But I
think Amida -- like his head went into my mouth on an offensive rebound.  
  
Q. Whose head?  
GARY CLARK: Brimah. I remember Coach always yelling at me not to swallow it
the first time, so I just tried to run over there and give it to somebody.  
  
Q. So you had experience getting your tooth knocked out and that paid
off today?  
GARY CLARK: Yes.  
  
Q. Where did you get the free throw stroke you had today?  
GARY CLARK: Just concentration. Coach has been on me all year just to focus,
stay with my same --  
  
TROY CAUPAIN: Routine.  
  
GARY CLARK: -- routine, and just focus and lock in.  
  
Q. Did you lose part of the tooth or all of it?  
GARY CLARK: Just part of it.  
  
Q. Troy, how excited are you all to get another shot at SMU and to keep
them from one of their second titles in three years?  
TROY CAUPAIN: Excited that we get another opportunity to play on Sunday. I'm
glad we get the opportunity to play them once again. We're just going to focus
on the scouting report and focus on the little things and come in and play
well and perform on Sunday.  
  
Q. Troy, for you in particular, how gratifying is it to win this after
what happened last year?  
TROY CAUPAIN: It's my first time beating them since my freshman year in the
Conference Tournament. So individually, it's exciting. Something to talk about
with my family or something. But I'm glad we got the win. We had a great year.
Don't stop now. Having an opportunity to beat UConn at XL Center is a great
feeling, but it's time to put this one behind us and focus on tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jacob, you've had a couple of big offensive games in a row now. Is
there anything you attribute that to in particular? You've had a good year,
but you've picked it up here in the last couple days, obviously.  
JACOB EVANS: Well, you know, I just feel like if I'm aggressive -- I try to
pick my spots and it's just March, so it's just time to perform.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If there's no other questions we'll excuse the student-athletes
to the rocker room.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Cronin at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see with Brimah and Gary Clark? What did you --  
MICK CRONIN: I did not -- last week I saw him throwing a flagrant elbow that
wasn't called. That's why his tooth was loose, but I did not see whatever
happened today.  
  
Q. Coach, how well do you feel you all are playing right now and what
did you -- and what do you see at SMU given what you've seen this weekend?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, yesterday's meaningless, come Sunday. So when Saturday
becomes yesterday in March, it's all a one-game world. Michigan State looked
unstoppable last year. They got to the NCAA Tournament and lost to Middle
Tennessee State. None of that matters. You better be ready to play if you're
trying to win a tournament.  
  
That said, SMU, in my opinion, is one of the best teams in the country.
They've proven it all year. They are extremely hard to play defense against,
because of their intelligence level. They're extremely well-coached. They've
got veteran guys and their talent level is high. They've got guys that can
make shots, and they really pass the ball to each other. They totally play to
win. They do not care who scores. They're just trying to win the game. They've
got some unbelievable winners on their team. My respect for their personnel is
why I voted four of them First Team All League.  
  
Q. Mick, you alluded this in your opening statement about not getting
much from Kyle, but still gutting out a win. How much does that say about --
you talked about this before -- the balance that you have and weapons that you
have. Is this like a testament of the overall strength of your team?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, you've got to try to develop it as much as possible. This
year we played with ten scholarship guys with Cane Broome sitting out for next
year. So, it's been a -- I've been constantly preaching to our bench that
they're going to be the key to any run we make in March if we make one because
games like this happen. Foul trouble happens to a guy like Kyle. Jacob had
foul trouble for awhile as well. Another team starts playing really well
against you. Obviously Jalen Adams really was breaking us down at will in the
second half. You've got to have some answers. You've got to have some guys
perform off the bench and in different spots. Quadri was very good for us.
Obviously Jarron Cumberland, he's like another starter. I think it's going to
continue to be a big key for us if we're going to continue to advance.  
  
Q. [ Inaudible question ]  
MICK CRONIN: I would say Adams was able to do what he did because he's really
good. He was not healthy last week, at least not totally. He definitely got
his explosiveness back. He's just a really, really good player. He's like
Barry Sanders with a basketball out there. His change in direction and
explosiveness is just tremendous.  
  
Q. Mick, you figured going in, their .500 record --  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, their record meant nothing.  
  
Q. I was going to say --  
MICK CRONIN: They were 2-0 coming in today.  
  
Q. You figured they're going to throw everything at you, hard physical
game. Is that good for you to see at this point? How did you take it?  
MICK CRONIN: I think the worst thing in basketball is to get false hope. You
play teams that do not challenge you or do not have the personnel to challenge
you or do not physically challenge you. So, I think sometimes you can fall
into bad patterns as a team, and you start to have success in ways that are
not going to happen when you play a quality team. So, playing UConn on the
road with Vance Jackson back in the line-up, with Jalen Adams healthy,
obviously we knew what was coming today. It just makes you better.  
  
Q. Not trying to insinuate anything here are, but does the flow of the
game kind of get wrecked when so many calls are being made both ways?  
MICK CRONIN: Let me say this, those guys are paid a lot of money. If there's
fouls on any team, they should be called. In the last two or three weeks, all
around our league, there's been a lot of stuff going on that needs to be
called. It's a basketball game. So whether it's an elbow -- on teams, it needs
to be called.  
  
You're talking to a guy that was part of a horrible incident a long time ago
where stuff was not called and stuff escalated. And it was a terrible,
terrible scene for two great universities. That stuff needs to be called. Any
foul needs to be called. If it's a foul, it's a foul. You always have a
choice, then don't foul. So I thought -- those aren't easy games to officiate,
but you know what? Sometimes those guys play a lot of money, and both teams
play zone and nobody touches each other, and they get to go to dinner. So
today they had to earn their money.  
  
Q. What did you all -- going back to the preview of tomorrow's game,
what worked well for you all in that first game against SMU that may not have
worked as well in that second game?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we played really well in the second game. We led until the
ten-minute mark -- the last 15 minutes we scored ten points. That's because
they're really good on defense. They were at home, their intensity level
ratcheted up. Much like a team like Virginia, if they force you to just shoot
all jump shots, you're going to lose. It's fool's gold. So you've got to find
a way to get some lay-ups an free throws, whether it's off the post-up, the
drive, the second shot. But it's not easy against them. There's a reason
they're as good as they are. Their players are very smart too.  
  
It's really hard to break their defense down. The first game we made a lot of
shots early, same as the second game. But I would say, I think too many
coaches say we didn't do this, we didn't do that. They're really, really good.
They took a lot of stuff away from us. They made it really hard on us to score
inside. It's a credit to their players. They stepped up and got the job done,
just like we did the first time. I'm just a big believer in performance, and
we're going to have to perform really well to win them all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on advancing. We'll see you tomorrow.

### [K.J. Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32940)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

### [Jeremiah Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32941)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UCF - 84, Memphis - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Joined by Coach Tubby Smith. Student-athletes Dedric
Lawson, K.J. Lawson, Jeremiah Martin.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach and take questions from the
student-athletes and dismiss student-athletes from the locker room.  
  
Coach, if you give your thoughts on the game and your season as a whole,
please.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, I first want to commend Central Florida. They shot the
lights out today. They were focused and ready. We got off to a good start. It
was hard. We had a tough time defending the three and that was our downfall.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time,
please.  
  
Q. K.J., with the way this season ended, some people say this team kind
of lost its way. How would you describe -- did this team quit? I mean, how
would you describe the way these last two games have gone for you guys?  
K.J. LAWSON: I think this team gave their all this whole season. We went out
there and tried to compete every time out. And I just think, you know, we just
didn't win the games we was supposed to win at home, and we just put ourself
in a tough situation at the end of the year. But, you know, it was a great
year and we all played hard. All the guys got in the game, so nobody quit.  
  
Q. Dedric, I know you're sick of these questions, but I've got to ask.
Is this your last game in a Memphis uniform? What's your -- have you made a
decision yet?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: No, I haven't made a decision. I was too focused on the season
and trying to further along our season, so this is just something that hasn't
been discussed yet between me and Coach and my parents. So, it was just -- I
was just focusing on this game going into post play.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, you guys got off to a pretty solid start in this one. What
do you think went wrong there five minutes into the first half? What did you
guys do poorly, defensively, and what went wrong offensively. I think you
missed 15 shots in a row at one point?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: I just think -- we was getting the shots that we wanted. I
mean, we weren't making them, and then we had a couple of defensive
breakdowns, consecutively, and they was making their threes. And they had just
kind of got to a run, and they had stayed on it. And this wasn't our best
effort.  
  
Q. For Dedric, the last two games, 71 points combined, losses. Does that
surprise you? You know Memphis basketball and know how well the team competed
at the beginning of the year. Embarrassing, surprised? What's your reaction?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: It's definitely surprising. No one plans to lose by 30 in both
games. Of course, it's disappointing for the guys that -- this is from me and
from the guys, just the sense of pride of planning the game of basketball, and
losing by a combination of 71 points. It's kind of embarrassing, but as long
as you give it your all, that's all you can ask for.  
  
I know every guy on the team played to the best of their ability, and when
guys are making shots and we're not making shots, of course it's going to hard
for us to win. At the end of the day, I'm proud of my teammates and I loved
playing for them these years. It's been a great year. It's been a great year.
That's all you can hope for.  
  
Q. K.J., all of a sudden you guys played your hardest. What was the
difference between this group at the end of the year and the group of guys
that was there in January, and December, when you guys were playing pretty
well?  
K.J. LAWSON: Like he said, we just didn't make shot. They got 26 bench points.
I think everything else is dependent on the end. We had more points than them
in the paint and off turnovers and second chances and fast breaks, but they
benched points, beat us by 12, and we let a shooter get rolling. They got a
guy into a groove early.  
  
Q. I mean just in general, you've lost six, seven games --  
K.J. LAWSON: That's basketball. Win or lose, you're -- you can play the game
to win or you lose. We lost. We lost games. Nobody expected us to win 19 games
anyway, so we went out and gave it our all at the beginning of the year and at
the end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Gentlemen, thank you, we'll excuse you to the locker room. And we'll take
questions for Coach Smith at this time.  
  
Q. What do you think the last couple games --  
I mean, they all said they gave it their all.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Yeah.  
  
Q. It felt like --  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, we hit the wall. We just hit the wall, simple as that. We
logged a lot of minutes, played guys a lot of minutes early in the season. It
was probably my fault. I should probably have developed more of a bench, but
we went through a stretch there without some real inside presence, without
Chad. And then when Chad came back, we really didn't get the -- really the
lift that we needed.  
  
And when you're not making shots, and you're worn down, your shot changes, so,
again, I don't think anybody ever quit, we just got outplayed, outshot by
them. We were defending extremely well, and that's something we had a real
problem with was defending the three, late, and especially in the last few
games. That's been costly for us, especially with, I think the last game, they
had about 14 or 15 threes, and today they had 14 threes. You're not going to
win games allowing people to -- again, that's where you see the -- what did I
say, the -- not energy level, but the size and the bulk, and the disparity
when you run up against teams like SMU and Central Florida. We just got to get
some bigger and stronger players.  
  
Q. I hate to ask this, but there's rumors and whatever, but I'm curious,
are you happy at Memphis, and take out the media, the fans, were you happy
with how this season went overall?  
TUBBY SMITH: I'm never happy when you lose. Nobody's going to be -- but, yeah,
we just -- we hit the wall there. We're pleased with what things -- things are
going. I think we hit it in the -- other than the last six games, I think
we're heading in the right direction. Probably started right here when we had
a 17-point lead against Connecticut, and -- but I was hoping that we would
respond better and be a little more patient.  
  
I think -- again, that's what happens when you're fatigued and you're worn
down. You can't sustain that level of intensity, and then you break down
psychologically. And, you know, we didn't -- again, we got some -- even guys
that haven't played much, like Keon Clergeot, just in practice, you're going
hard and practicing. I don't know what else we can do other than -- because I
thought our guys competed every day in practice, just needed to be more
competition in practice so they can get better.  
  
Q. Going forward this offseason, like you said yesterday most of these
guys will be back. What will be your focus this offseason to get this group
back on track to the way they are playing?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, stronger. That's one of the things you saw. I think, again,
we had -- you really didn't have a lot of time to be in the weight room, and I
think that's where you see the -- the difference in physicality of opposing
teams that are a little more mature and maybe more experienced. But, again,
with all of these guys that are underclassman, we only -- we didn't start a
senior, and then we had Christian Kessee and Chad Rykhoek. That's where we'll
start to focus right away.  
  
We probably had a period there when we first took the job, we didn't get on
the weights like we should. We really hadn't -- really didn't have a strength
coach until later and I think those things probably -- that makes a big
difference.  
  
Q. Coming out of a time-out with about three minutes left, K.J. and
Dedric were laughing a little bit coming out of the time out. Does this team
--  
TUBBY SMITH: In the what, in the last --  
  
Q. In the last three minutes, coming out of a time-out. They were sort
of laughing. Did this team -- did winning and losing matter enough to them?
Did you establish --  
TUBBY SMITH: I would hope so. Nobody wants to lose, so if -- and attitudes
about winning and losing, having some pride, those are the things we'll talk
about, and those are the things that we need to instill in our players.  
  
We hope we had, but, as I said before, when adversity sets in, you're not sure
how guys are going to respond, or how they're going to act or how they're
going to behave. You hope they behave the right way and you hope you've taught
them how to -- about that. But sometimes, it takes time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more for Coach, please.  
  
Q. What will you -- you know, what will you take as the positive? What
did you think you established this season that you can take going forward with
this group?  
TUBBY SMITH: Well, I think, you know, when I look at the youth, and the -- and
inexperience, we've had some good wins and we've had some bad losses. You
know, last two games were bad losses, but we were in every -- pretty much most
of the games until the last two games. We had a great chance to win here
against Connecticut. We had a good chance to win against -- we played poor at
home, but we lose to Houston at home. I think we had some good runs. I think
just in the end, the lack of experience -- because I've done enough to know we
had the same issues at Texas Tech. We had young players, we got hammered by
45. You've got to establish something good somewhere. So, we have to --
sometimes you have to take the bitter with the sweet and hope guys will come
back and look at this game and say, you know what? This is not going to happen
again and that's what you have to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Smith, thank you.  
  
TUBBY SMITH: Thank you.

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Galen Robinsin, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32968)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 74, Houston - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by Houston coach, Kelvin Sampson, and
sophomore, Galen Robinson Jr. We'll take statement from Coach Sampson.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: I don't have anything to say. It's getting late. If there's no
questions.  
  
Q. [Inaudible]?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: You know, let's be honest. Connecticut did a great job tonight
feeding off that crowd. Their crowd was tremendous. You know? That might have
been the toughest crowd we played in front of all year outside of at SMU and
at Cincinnati. I thought their kids, that crowd, really buoyed them and they
did a great job. They really fed off that crowd. That was a huge, huge deal
for them having played last night, you know?  
  
Q. You called a couple time-outs, you trying to tell the guys to settle
down?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, we got up 20-9. I thought we -- we needed to get in the
paint. Shooting too many threes during that stretch. We're not at our -- we're
not a shoot threes off the dribble team, you know? We're a ball movement team,
and we played to the third side and penetrate and kick and then we shoot our
threes there. I thought we were a little impatient at that time. That's
probably why I called those time-outs.  
  
Q. Did that prevent you from going back inside?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, we don't throw it to them anyway.  
  
Q. Galen, can you talk about the crowd, trying to counter that. Trying
to fight the crowd in the second half?  
GALEN ROBINSON, JR.: I remember a couple times I was trying to call plays and
people couldn't hear it. My teammates couldn't hear it. So I had to try to act
like -- act what I was trying to call, like, but, they played a major factor,
gave them energy and they fed off of it pretty well.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Huge advantage. Huge advantage.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Is that it for the questions?  
  
Coach, thank you.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Michael Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32932)

### [Kentrell Barkley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32877)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
SMU - 81, East Carolina - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Coach Michael Perry; freshman, Elijah
Hughes; sophomore, Kentrell Barkley. Same format as yesterday. We'll take an
opening statement from Coach and questions from student athletes.  
  
Coach Perry, your thoughts on the game please.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: It was an unbelievable game, obviously. To be able to play
against the No. 12 ranked team in the country and have the type of game that
we had against them, and battle and compete the way we did, says a lot, speaks
volumes about our program. But speaks more about these kids up here and the
guys in the locker room.  
  
We didn't win on the scoreboard, but we certainly did win in the hearts and in
the hearts of ECU supporters and also our competitors. We won in a lot of
different ways. We moved the program forward and our culture changed, and it's
been changing, and it certainly changed tonight. We put ourself in position
where we can play with and beat the elite teams in this league and elite
programs, and these guys made a statement. They've changed the culture of our
program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes, please?  
  
Q. Kentrell, you had 22 points in the second half. What changed for you
and the team trailing by 18 points with 7 minutes left?  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: In the first half, I kind of attacked a little bit and they
didn't fall. So I wanted to stick with what I was good at. If I was open, be
offensively aggressive in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for student-athletes, please?  
  
Q. Elijah, can you talk about that run and the three-pointer when you
tied the game at that point? Did you guys feel like the momentum had totally
shifted to your side and just what lead to that second-half run?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Really just energy from each other as teammates, energy from
the bench. We just had more juice. Things were going our way, so we kept doing
what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Elijah, can you talk about the press, or both of you, actually, can
you talk about the press that happened in the second half? When did you guys
decide that that might work, and how well has that worked for you this
season?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Well, we always found success with that press. We kind of sped
them up like we wanted to, and we got out on transition, and we just converted
off the press. So, that really gave us a lot of energy, too. The steals,
deflections to turn the ball over for them. That was just good.  
  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: And it was also a different look. We got Deng Riak on the
ball. He's aggressive. He's long. And being aggressive, and when we got the
steal, it was off to the boards at that moment.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: Certainly changed the momentum of the game. We started the half
out making some shots, but we weren't necessarily getting stops. They were
making twos. Not necessarily threes, they were making twos. They cut into the
lead significantly. We decided to go with a change for defense. Take them out
of rhythm. Also speed the game up. Open the floor up a little bit. Have better
spacing for driving lanes and have better spacing where we could spread out
for threes.  
  
We thought changing it up would take them somewhat out of sequence, and we
have some success with it, and it worked pretty good for us there. But more
importantly, it changed the tempo of the game, and once we started seeing them
looking at the scoreboard, we thought we were really going to make some
strides here.  
  
Q. Kentrell, this is a team that had beaten you by 31 points and 40
points and you're down 22 at halftime. What was it about this team you didn't
just say, okay, we had a good kind of end to the season and this is it. What
made you guys hang in there?  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: The focus was, we're trying to do something different. We're
trying to change the coaching, we're trying to build a legacy, and I don't
think you can possibly do that without going 150% out on the court. That game
was just like, you got to put it all out there, win or lose, you got to give
your all, and just play hard, play basketball, and don't go out without a lot
of heart.  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: To piggyback on that. Kentrell has the biggest heart in the
country. He's not going to go out like a chump or sucker. He's going to go out
like a champion like he is. With him leading the pack, leading all of us, is
something special. That's how you're go on a run like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll excuse Elijah and Kentrell back to the locker room.
Thank you, gentlemen. And we'll take question for Coach Perry, please.  
  
Q. Coach Perry, could you talk about Kentrell's game? I mean, he's been
battling the left knee for a while. You're down that much at halftime, and he
comes out and scores 22 points in the second half.  
MICHAEL PERRY: Nothing seems to amaze me anymore when it comes to Kentrell
Barkley. We call him junkyard dog. He literally is that. He scores in a lot of
different ways. He's one of those guys that's very difficult to prepare for as
a coach, because of how effective he plays, and he contributed in so many
different ways, whether it's in transition, whether on the offensive glass,
shooting threes, dribble drives. And some of that you really can't prepare for
because so much of it is just effort. Then what he does -- not only what he
does individually, and also he makes plays. He finds open guys, makes plays,
makes other guys better, but most importantly because of the intensity that he
brings, and the energy level he plays, it's contagious for our program. And
other guys now are playing harder. Seemingly their DNA is one in which is
cool. They now beginning to show a lot more emotion and play with more emotion
because of the impact he's had on our program.  
  
Q. Can you address -- you had mentioned that you guys had been trying to
change the culture. Obviously, you have a young team. Could you talk about
what this game does for you going into next season?  
MICHAEL PERRY: A lot of those guys that are out there are going to be back
next year. We got some outstanding players sitting out as well. We're really
excited about the future of the program. But most importantly, we wanted to
kind of change the approach, not just think about competing, not just think
about, you know, playing well, not think about individual success as well, but
about winning.  
  
And showing we can win against the better teams in this league, that we can go
out there with an opportunity to win and think about the big picture, that it
wasn't necessarily about the win that particular night as much as about
building the program and everything we do. Not just wins and losses, but the
way we approach practices, the way we conduct ourselves when we're in
airports, the way we are on campus in terms of academic commitment, study
hall, going to class. We want to win at everything we do. Those are the signs
and traits that you need to have guys committed to to be a successful program,
and that's what these guys are finally buying into.  
  
Q. Coach, just to follow up on what your players addressed, the two
regular season meetings and how, judging by the final score, it seems games
got out of hand. This was on the brink of getting out of hand, what is
different? Why were you able to come back?  
MICHAEL PERRY: We're a different team now. That's the difference, we're a
different basketball team now. We had a chance to go through the fires and
compete; sometimes get knocked down and get back up. But we have to learn
along the way there's no harm in getting knocked down. You heard the quote
often it's how you get back up that matters and can you get back up? And
that's what they've done. They've gotten back up. They've been knocked around
and got back up again, and they finally got to a point where they're tough and
they're not going to run home; they're going to fight. That's what they did
tonight.  
  
It's a different basketball team SMU saw tonight than the last time we saw
them and even the time prior to that. That's saying a lot for this group.
That's saying a lot for them. They've come a long way in a short period of
time and continue to move forward, but I couldn't be prouder of them. It was
an honor for me to be able to coach this group. It's -- I mean, it's just
pretty special.  
  
And first, for me, I want to thank Coach Lebo for having the faith in me to
coach this team, to lead them, and our athletic director, Jeff Compher, to
have the faith and confidence in me to lead this group. It was an honor, it
really was. It was an honor to be able to coach this group and I'm really
privileged to be able to have the opportunity to spend time with them and
coach them. And for those guys to take to my voice, says volume about the type
of guys they are. A lot of class and character in the locker room.  
  
Q. Did you have a chance to talk to Coach Lebo? Did you get him on the
phone?  
MICHAEL PERRY: Not yet. I saw a text to all of us, I'll reach out to him
later.  
  
Q. What did he say?  
MICHAEL PERRY: Unbelievable comeback, great job, and proud of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Perry, thank you.  
  
MICHAEL PERRY: Thank you.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Rodney Purvis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28564)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 74, Houston - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, UConn is here. We're joined by sophomore, Jalen Adams;
senior, Rodney Purvis, head coach, Kevin Ollie. Gentlemen, we'll follow the
same format as yesterday. We'll ask Coach Ollie to give an opening statement
and.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: I thought it was a great game. First of all, I just want to thank
the crowd. They were awesome. I could feel the energy. I know our players fed
off it. In the second half they made their run, and we kept telling our
players to resist their runs. And they came out and scored the first six
points in the second half, I think, the first seven, and we came back with our
6-0 run. And then we played really disciplined basketball down the stretch. I
was very proud of that. We out-rebounded them and we played a great offensive
game, sharing the basketball, getting our shots, and I'm very proud of these
guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. Rodney, can you tell us what happened there when you -- the charging
call, you were down for a while and back to the locker room. How were you hurt
and you were able to bounce back pretty quickly I guess.  
RODNEY PURVIS: I kind of just got the wind knocked out of me a little. I told
the trainer I needed just some time to catch my breath. It was nothing major,
though.  
  
Q. Jalen, it seems like each game, you've gotten a little bit more of
your game back. Tonight it looked like the pull-up was there for you that
hadn't been there the last few games. Do you feel even though you're not able
to rest, that you're actually getting healthier and getting your game back
with each day?  
JALEN ADAMS: Yeah. I think I'm getting a lot more healthy game by game. I
think my teammates are doing a great job being able to present me with some
possessions. I think the pull-up is there, but just taking what the defense
was giving me.  
  
Q. Did you both just talked a little bit about your offensive execution
tonight? That's some of the best ball movement you guys have had all year.  
RODNEY PURVIS: Yeah. As far as the offensive end, we knew we had to execute
and get good shots. We was giving up good shots for great shots, and the main
thing with us was just taking our time and just making the right play.  
  
JALEN ADAMS: Exactly what he said. Just giving up good shots for great shots.
People being unselfish and making that extra pass. That's what helped us the
most. Just getting it to the lane and kick-out. We knew the defense was going
to start getting it, working to get open shots.  
  
Q. Rodney you got down 20-9. What turned it around for you when you went
on the big run?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Defense. We knew if we got stopped, we was going to be able to
get back in the game, stop them in transition. Just try to run them off the
three-point line, and we was able to do that on the defensive end. Once we got
to the offensive end, we just executed and made the right plays.  
  
Q. I guess one more for Jalen. How important were the contributions of
the two freshman tonight, especially in the beginning of the game when you
guys were struggling a little bit, they were able to hit shots?  
JALEN ADAMS: The freshman stepped up huge for us in the first half and second
half. Starting with Vance Jackson, he came in the game and when he got that
dunk that helped us get up to the first half lead. And then in the second
half. C.V., he stepped up with some huge shots and defensively, his energy led
us on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Jalen, at the end of the second half, it looked like you ran to the
bench and grabbed your calf. Was that just a cramp? Looked like you got it
rubbed a little bit.  
JALEN ADAMS: Yes. Just a cramp.  
  
Q. A quick second one. The second half battle between you and Rob Gray.
It looked like you guys were matching shot for shot. What did it mean to rise
above? Looked like you were more efficient with your shot taking. What did it
mean to rise up and match every shot for your team?  
JALEN ADAMS: I don't want to get into the one-on-one matchup. As long as our
team got the W, I'm happy. I was just taking open shots, my teammates were
finding me, and I was able to make great shots.  
  
Q. What did you think about playing Cincinnati again and what do you
need to do different in the first two games?  
JALEN ADAMS: We're looking forward to the match-up. They got us twice in the
regular season, so we're looking forward to it. We know we have to come out
with energy, we can't be passive, we have to be aggressive right out of the
gate.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: I just think we have to be tough. That's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take one or two for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. I believe it was you in Houston after the game there, you said you
were hoping you would see them again in this tournament. I am just wondering
what your feeling was after that game, and what was different tonight, just in
terms of playing them?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think that loss in Houston hurt us a lot because we worked so
hard in the first half, and we just let them out-tough us in the second half.
Just to get the W today meant a lot. We knew we were going to get the match-up
eventually, and we just came out and corrected the errors we made in Houston.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the crowd again tonight?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Yeah. The crowd was amazing tonight. They were a huge part of
us making that run in the first half, you know, just bringing that energy
really helped us get us over the hill, over the hump.  
  
JALEN ADAMS: The crowd was amazing. It's good to be playing in Hartford for
the tournament. They just give us that extra boost to play harder.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes to the locker room. And we'll
take questions for Coach Ollie.  
  
Q. Kevin, Rodney alluded to it. The 26-6 run at the end of the half. How
much did the defense play a role? Looked like it clamped down in that
stretch?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah. That was everything. Gray got off to a great start. We
wanted to make him see all five guys in contested shots, and then we got him
off of his game a little bit and was able to rebound. That was our number one
key going into the game. Rebounding. Not letting them out-tough on the
backboard and then we're going get some opportunities to be very efficient on
the offensive end.  
  
I was very proud of the guys stepping up and making the choice to hit all
night.  
  
Q. You talked about the discipline your team had. Have you seen that
growing as the years have gone along as far as having that poise to close out
games?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I see it sometimes and then it goes somewhere. I don't know where
it goes. I think it goes to East Hartford or something like that. And then it
comes back, but you're playing with some guys that's -- you know, you had some
injuries, and then you have some young guys stepping into their roles. And
then Jalen playing a different role and Kentan coming in.  
  
You know, as the winning -- the poise went, sometimes the poise was there. The
thing that I really prided our guys on and admire about them, they always
stuck together and that's a beautiful thing. So, we have some ups and downs.
People say this about us, say that about it us, but one thing they didn't let
it affect their locker room and their bound, so very proud of these guys bond.
We wanted to make it to the weekend. We're here at the weekend. Now we got two
more games to win and we're not tired.  
  
Q. Kevin, you ended up with 12 assists on 24 baskets, but the first half
I think it was 8 out of 12. It seemed like they had a lot of patience tonight
and was really moving the ball well?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah. They did. We had to do our walk-through through the
ballroom and didn't have a lot of time to prepare and do a shoot-around. We
seen some things the first game, that we could exploit this game. I think they
did a great job executing the game plan. When you get in the post season, it's
all about executing, no more excuses. Pretty much preaching to our guys. We
can't have excuses anymore.  
  
I think what allowed us to do that is our rebound. If we can rebound, we get
to give ourself a chance to get down the court and have the ball move before
the defense. I think we did a real good job rebounding. Guys was finding each
other. When Jalen gets in that mode, when he got the pull-up game going, we
was just trying to flatten the defense out and let him make plays. Rod was
phenomenal, once again on the defensive side, he took the challenge, stopping
Dotson and Dotson is the one that really killed us back in Houston in that
second half. I was proud of Rodney, defensive effort, again, last night with
Thorpe and this night with Dotson.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a late game tonight and quick turnaround for a game
tomorrow. How do you get your team prepared for that?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We deserve this. All of the stuff we've been through this year. I
mean those guys are not tired right now. We deserve being here on a weekend.
We played hard. We played together and them guys believing over there. So,
we're going to go out and go hunting and hopefully we can do it all together
and play and share the basketball.  
  
The only thing I'm going to write on the board tomorrow is rebounding. That's
pretty much the game. If we don't rebound, we're losing, so, and we're going
home. So hopefully they made the choice again and they definitely made the
choice tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say with your young guns, with Christian, Vance
and Jalen, they had 47 combined points tonight. Really stepping up in the
first half for the freshman and Jalen in the second half.  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah. I was very proud of them. Once again they started with the
defensive end. I think Jalen alluded to it. C.V. was great on the defensive
end, stepping up. We was feeding off his energy. And then Vance was making
some shots. To come in get 12 points off the bench was huge. I think we got 14
off the bench and he had 12 of them. They had two points off the bench, which
was great for us and gave us a great advantage.  
  
The one thing I do like is us getting to the free throw line. Jalen, last
game, this game. One of our goals was to get there 22 times. I think we got
there 22 times this game and last game we really got there a lot. We want to
keep focusing on attacking, attacking, attacking. We can't settle for threes,
we can't settle for contested three, especially tomorrow. You didn't do that
against Cincinnati. So we want to get that ball inside. That's not just
throwing it to the bigs, that's penetrating, kicking and getting it to the
rim.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

### [Semi Ojeleye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32933)

### [Sterling Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26983)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
SMU - 81, East Carolina - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by SMU head coach, Tim Jankovich; junior,
Semi Ojeleye; senior, Sterling Brown. Format, we'll take an opening statement
from Coach Jankovich, then the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on the game, please?  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: Sure. I really liked the first half a lot. I liked the seven or
eight minutes of the second half, not so much. The way it went down the
stretch.  
  
But first of all, I've got to give East Carolina tremendous, tremendous
credit. We had had two very, very, very good games against them before, and
had some big leads and for them to not -- to not fold and play the way they
did the last 12 minutes or so, I thought was just amazing. And, you know, it
would be easy, I could get negative, but I actually think this was a complete
positive for our team, I really do. Totally disappointed in our rebounding.
100% disappointed in that; I thought it was awful.  
  
But -- could get down on our turnovers. But that part -- we needed this. We
really did. We haven't been in a scramble situation for quite some time, and
this is tournament time. You need to feel this. I think it was great. I really
couldn't have scripted it much better, honestly. Now, we'll have to do a lot
better in some areas, but for me, it was great to be tested down the stretch
like we were today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes only at this
time, please. Raise your hand.  
  
Q. Semi, you kind of took over there with four minutes in the game. What
was the -- what kind of changed with you in that last stretch?  
SEMI OJELEYE: Just too much -- found me in good spots. I felt like I had a
couple good looks. The ball was going up. Like Coach said, they're a good team
and I felt like they were coming back, so everybody was just looking to score
and be aggressive.  
  
Q. Semi, it's elimination from this point forward, essentially. So, what
do you think you can take from this game, and apply it going forward, when you
guys are in a tight game. How you need to handle it?  
SEMI OJELEYE: We can't forget what's gotten us here. Our defense, our
rebounding, our transition defense, stand together, stand unified. All of the
little things that Coach talks about in practice, they show up in big games.
Especially this time of year, you can't take teams for granted. Can't let
teams back come on you like we did today. I think we just need to stick to our
principles and help us continue to advance.  
  
Q. Semi, in terms of this team going through a tournament game, you
experienced that at Duke, what do you think was different about it, and do you
think that going through that was significant for this team, at this time?  
SEMI OJELEYE: Yeah. I think we've had a good year so far, and everything's
been kind of going well for us all year. But being in a tournament situation
with tournament pressure realizing that if you lose you go home, it's
different. I think being battle-tested with this group is important for us and
getting the win tonight is great moving forward.  
  
Q. Sterling, if you remember back to 2015 when you were playing this
same team in the same situation, they hit some timely threes, just some lapses
in defense. What did you take from that situation two years ago, and applying
it to now when they started to come back?  
STERLING BROWN: Man, it don't matter what I took, they did the same thing.
They came back. We just got to -- like Semi said earlier, stay with what we
were doing all season. We got a little loose, and thankfully we come out with
a win, but tomorrow we got to come and bring it.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, Coach, you mentioned you hadn't been in a
scramble situation for a while. What is that like for you guys as players
going through some games earlier this year?  
SEMI OJELEYE: You know it's coming eventually.  
  
You're not always going to blow teams out. You hope you do, but that's not
going to happening, that's not realistic.  
  
Coach always says it during time-out, this is where you want to be. As
competitors, that's what you like. You want to be in close games, and that's
the time you really have to lock in and focus.  
  
Q. What was talked about in that final time-out with a little over a
minute left?  
SEMI OJELEYE: Sticking to our principles, doing what we've been doing all
year. Staying tight on defense, defensive rebounding, and getting a good shot
on offense.  
  
Q. Sterling, this was you-all's first tournament game since 2015, that
UCLA game. What was it like to be back in the post-season and not being
sitting at home watching it this time?  
STERLING BROWN: It felt good. It felt good. We got a chance to sit out there
and play for a championship. I felt like everybody came prepared. We didn't
play as good as we wanted to, but we'll bounce back tomorrow.  
  
Q. Semi, in terms of being out there in the tournament scenario for the
first time in a couple years, a large portion which you had to sit on the
sidelines, was there an extra added bit of motivation for you, and do you
think that helped power what you were able to do down the stretch when you
were taking over this team?  
SEMI OJELEYE: Definitely sitting out and watching tournament situations, you
imagine yourself in that situation. Not treat to every game the same. If I
don't come out ready for a game, it's going to show and I'm not going to be
successful. You have to have the same mindset, same aggression, same respect
for the opponent every game, not matter if it's tournament or regular season.  
  
Q. Semi, you were named the Conference Player of the Year. Yesterday you
came out and had a career scoring night, double-double this season. Do you
feel you have to lead this team at this point? Are you the guy who needs to
take it on your shoulders when it get tight? What is your mindset?  
SEMI OJELEYE: We have a lot of great players, one through -- I don't know
however many --  
  
TIM JANKOVICH: A bunch.  
  
SEMI OJELEYE: Everybody can come out and have a great game, you know? If you
look at the stat sheets all year, everybody's had huge games, double-doubles,
big scoring nights. Tonight it happened to be me. I try to lead the team in
other ways, just trying to talk to everybody, keep everybody calm, keep
everybody's minds focused.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have one or two more for student athletes?  
  
Q. Sterling, watching Semi that last few minutes, is that something
you've seen before this season or did he hit something you haven't seen
before?  
STERLING BROWN: We've seen it a numerous amount of games, him step up, and
make big shots, lead us to a victory. It's something he does. And we're happy
and we're proud of it, and we are going to keep riding it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student athletes to the locker room at this
time. Now, we'll open for questions to Coach Jankovich.  
  
Q. Tim, how would you describe --  
TIM JANKOVICH: A lot of bright lights.  
  
Q. How did you describe their body language when it got to within one
possession?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Not great. I didn't think our body language was great certainly
to start the game, but that was a little understandable. It's an early -- it's
an early game. It's -- you know, it's an afternoon game, the crowd is not
revved up yet. It's 11:00 our body time. I can understand that when they'd
already played a game. And then you could see that we really -- we looked like
ourselves for the next, what, 15 minutes for the half, then got a little
complacent, obviously, and allowed them to get their head up. I think that was
the biggest lesson as a take-away.  
  
But I didn't like the way, the look, although, we were calm enough. But I've
seen grittier looks on these guys' face than we did there. That's why I say I
think, honestly, I mean it sincerely, this is the best thing that could have
happened. We needed this. This will help us. Not that I'm saying, boy, wasn't
it great in all areas? No, we needed some of the feelings that we had today.
We needed to know that next time this happen, how we're going to sort it out
better.  
  
Again, we haven't -- this has been my concern. We haven't been in very many of
these situations at all. And something else, I mean, I don't know what it is
about East Carolina. You mentioned earlier, a couple years ago we played them
and they made how many -- they must have made 15, 16 threes in that game. It
felt like they made 100,000 down the stretch in this game. I do not know what
it is about this building nor playing us that makes them just become one of
the great shooting teams in the country. But, you know, I give them so much
credit.  
  
My gosh, they could have folded it up and they would not go away. I thought it
was critical that the few times they did miss, they chased down their
offensive rebound. So, the one thing that I'm really, really, really not
pleased with was our rebounding. Hopefully we can get that fixed and look more
like we normally do.  
  
Q. Tim, whenever Semi transfer from Duke, or transferred to SMU from
Duke, is this the kind of game you thought he might have at some point, going
for 36 and 9 of that coming in the last four minutes?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Yes, yes. He's capable obviously. He's had so many big nights
for us. But he said it best, he had -- he was tremendous, and he's capable,
but we've had a bunch of guys. That's one of the beauties of this team, is
that -- and I love that, because I think when you're preparing for someone, if
you just -- everyone focuses on one guy, and he has to carry you, then I think
you're a little bit easier to prepare for. At least I feel like what if that
guy has a bad night, but we've had so many guys have big nights.  
  
He was amazing, by the way, Semi was amazing today, obviously, and he's so
valuable. I did think he's capable. I think he's capable of doing it again.
But I also feel we have some other guys that could have a break-out game.
Tomorrow would be a good time for that.  
  
Q. Coach, how much do you think the second half had to do with this team
not being in a tournament scenario in years. And specific to the way you can
learn from it, what are things you think you can take specifically and
implement in situations like this moving forward that are going to be
helpful?  
TIM JANKOVICH: That's a great question and hard to answer. Hard to know what
part of the -- of the emotion -- I think I would have said if the whole first
half, we'd have looked really scattered, then I feel like that's -- we haven't
been in post season for a long, long time. But we played our way into looking
pretty normal to me.  
  
Our first half was pretty normal, other than the first five minutes. I didn't
think we -- I thought our defense was really, really poor, but I don't think
we'd woken up yet. Second half, for me, I don't think it was about the post
season, I think it was more about -- my best guess is, you know, we had had
two great games against them before and won by wide margins. And I think --
psychologically, I think they let down just for a few minutes, not the whole
half, just a few minutes, which allows confidence to build.  
  
I think that's the biggest takeaway from this game. We talk about it all of
the time. We had a lot of big halftime leads. You can't feel like that's
enough at halftime, and they just kept pecking away and pecking away and just,
you know, a little bit here, a little bit there. The lead just kept shrinking
and shrinking, and we never turned the tide. We never turned the tide. Just
when we were about to, we coughed it up a couple times then put ourselves in a
position where, basically, it's a possession, it's a possession, it's a
turnover away from going home in this tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned the run from here to the ring.  
TIM JANKOVICH: Absolutely. In fact, at lunch or dinner, or whatever we're
getting ready to have, yes. That's why I love it. We can start talking about
the way we handle it psychologically, the way we executed or lack thereof, of
a press offense, of the way we didn't space the floor, the way we maybe didn't
find the grid on our defensive end that we needed to have, the mistakes we
made on the defensive end. There were several, several, down the stretch, just
mistakes that we don't usually make those, you know? I mean, so we were not
very impressive, you know?  
  
More mistakes in a five-minute period than I've seen in four, five games. So
absolutely we will talk about that. But I have faith in these -- I have a lot
of faith in this group. They're bright, they're mature, and they're
competitive, and when you're that, you want to hear those things. You want to
learn from a performance like that. I'm just glad it's something that I think
we can draw from.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the rebounding. You weren't pleased with it.
It's an area you've been pretty good in all year?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Pretty good? I think we've been -- I think if there's one
thing, we've been a great rebounding team all year long, and we were really,
really bad today as a rebounding today. Now, very fixable, or I hope. Needs to
be, better be, or we're not going to be having this conversation, about how we
barely squeaked by, but we have been a great rebounding team.  
  
Q. So, concern level after that, pretty low, considering?  
TIM JANKOVICH: I'd say a moderate concern. I'll tell you after the next game.
How about that? If you get two in a row, then I think we're starting to trend.  
  
Q. Coach, in your four losses, the opposing teams had 12 three-pointers.
ECU had 13 today. Might that be an Achilles' heel here and how do you address
that in terms of perimeter defense?  
TIM JANKOVICH: Well, I guess what I would say is you have to give up
something. You're either a defense -- a defense, in my opinion, can only be --
you can be strong outside or you can be strong inside. But I don't think you
can be incredibly strong on the perimeter and incredibly strong on the
interior, unless you have a 7-foot-something shot blocker on the inside that
takes away ten feet, but that's a whole other story.  
  
So, for most of us, it's very difficult to be that way. So you have to make
some decisions in your philosophy, and also with your team, you know, with
your personnel, to determine, are we going to be better off trying to be
strong in one area and give this up, or we're going to try to make sure we're
over here? Yes, it could be an Achilles' heel, but so could it be for anyone
else that tries to play the way we do. You could reverse that and say, my
gosh, you guys, stretched out all over the floor, you try to turn it over, and
take away everybody's three. Now you're going to be incredibly foul prone; now
you're going to be rebounding prone, penetration prone. If you look at our
team with the numbers that we play, I didn't feel we could ever survive a
season if that's where we were vulnerable. Yes. It showed up today. If a team
can hit enough threes, it will be tough on us.  
  
I also know there's -- you know, in NCAA Tournament, you know, it's not always
easy to just hit a ton of threes. There's some nerves and there's some
pressure. Sometimes it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen to us, but, yeah,
you do have to give and take, and sometimes that's what we give up.  
  
Q. Coach, we've seen some other teams try to do it this season, maybe
not as aggressively as East Carolina did today, but what do you think of the
press they threw at you in the last four minutes, and how did you --  
TIM JANKOVICH: How bad would I be if I said their press wasn't good and we
just didn't execute? I thought their press was great. They had a lot of heat,
had athletes and had hands all over everywhere. I thought they did a
tremendous job putting us on our heels. I love when teams press, not today so
much. But normally, it's a real positive for us or teams I've coached before.
I actually looked forward to it. I've got to give them credit.  
  
At the same time, having said that, I thought our execution was brutal. I
didn't even recognize what we were doing a good part of the time, and, you
know, we probably panicked a little bit, which is great, because hopefully
we're not going to panic the next time. We learned a lesson. You slow down and
you make some smarter decisions. We made -- we probably made five poor
decisions down the last four, five minutes against the press.  
  
So, their press was good and we were really bad against it, but I'm not --
again, a trend. I'm not worried, because I believe we know what we're doing, I
think we got a little out of sorts. Kind of lost our mind a little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jankovich, thank you, congratulations. See you tomorrow.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

### [Corey Henderson, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32957)

### [Sterling Taplin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32958)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Cincinnati - 80, Tulsa - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take an opening statement from Coach Haith.  
  
Coach, give us your thoughts on the game, please.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you. I want to gave Cincinnati a lot of credit. They are a
really, really good team. I mean, I'm excited to watch their run in the NCAA
Tournament. I think they're -- they got a lot of good talent and they played
the game the right way.  
  
I thought our guys in the first half, we were playing extremely hard. I think
we just had some nerves and we missed a lot of shots around the basket, hit
some open threes. I think we just -- we were playing extremely hard. I thought
in the second half obviously we shot the ball better but we continue to play
hard. So I'm proud of how we finished the game, 40 minutes of this game
against Cincinnati, who I think is extremely, extremely talented.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sterling and Corey at this time.  
  
Q. Sterling, did you feel some of that nerves maybe in the first half
obviously it didn't affect you all's effort. Do you agree what your coach said
about nerves?  
STERLING TAPLIN: Oh, yeah. It was a little bit shaky coming in. We came
together and said we got to play. We got to play for each other and we want to
be here, just play hard.  
  
Q. You know, it seemed like the effort was there for the whole game. I
know that's something that maybe hasn't always been there. Was that something
you guys really were determined to do in this game?  
STERLING TAPLIN: Yeah. Effort and playing hard was our key things, to come
into this game, and Cincinnati is a great team and it's a learning experience
for us, but effort and playing hard are definitely the things that we talked
about coming into this game.  
  
COREY HENDERSON, JR.: That's every game.  
  
Effort and coming in and playing hard. That's what we focus on, you know,
every game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Take questions for
Coach Haith.  
  
Q. Coach, you said in your opening statement that Cincinnati plays the
game the right way. What did you mean by that?  
FRANK HAITH: Well, they -- defensively, they're terrific. They stay between
you and the basket. They play great help defense. They block out. They
rebound. You know, they've got -- I've been in this league playing against
Mick's teams and teams been watching from afar. I think now they've got really
talented offensive players. They can really shoot the ball. They can play
inside out with Washington, and he and Clark are just a load in the paint.
They've got -- they got no weaknesses so to speak. I've always respected
Mick's team, how hard they played and how they competed. Now, I look at their
perimeter talent with Jacob Evans, and the true leader that Troy Caupain is,
I'm excited to watch their run in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Mick was asked a lot when he was in here about the offensive
improvement you just alluded to. As a coach, how do you approach them
defensively? What do you try to stop?  
FRANK HAITH: First of all, you don't want to give up paint points. You've got
to defend the paint and then you've got to contest their shots. You play the
percentages. When they get the ball in the paint, and Clark can back you down
or Washington can post up and score in there, it makes it really tough. So you
try to take that away, but then when you double them or do something to try to
take that away, they are good passers. They throw it out. And you have Jacob
Evans and Troy Caupain making shots and Kevin Johnson. That's tough to defend.
When they're making shots like that, they're going to be hard to defend.  
  
Q. You lost by 19, you gave up 19 second-chance points. How many of
those offensive boards hurt?  
FRANK HAITH: They hurt a lot. And I thought we guarded their first shot
sometimes very well. But they -- they kicked us on the boards, and you look at
the point production out of that. And that's something we've got to grow. You
look at a couple losses this year we've had, that's been something that's hurt
us throughout the year. And physical block-outs, the mentality of blocking out
on that end, is important and we've got to get better at that.  
  
Q. There was a moment with, I think, six minutes left, and you-all were
down like 20 points and you still have guys diving on the floor. As a coach in
that situation, that has to be something you want to see?  
FRANK HAITH: It is. That's something, Kelly, we have to build on. I'm really
excited about the future of our program. What we had to do this year is really
just start a team from scratch. Ten new players. And I told Pat this, too,
being our only senior. He's had two tough situations. Last year he had to come
into a team that's a veteran team and find his niche and fit in, and he helped
us get to the NCAA Tournament. Then he had to come to this year's team and
nurture ten new guys. That's tough for his two-year experience at Tulsa, but I
think he handled it well.  
  
With that said, I think now the building and the foundation has been set for
the future of our program. Will Magnay, Junior Etou, Martins Igbanu, all those
young guys on the front line, T.K., are going to get better. Jaleel, Corey,
Sterling, all going to get better. I'm excited about our future. I wanted us
to continue to play hard today and continue to lay that foundation.  
  
Q. You had two shots the first half, two points, scored the first six
points for you in the second half. Was there more concerted effort and what
were they doing? You had 16 points in the last five games?  
FRANK HAITH: Junior Etou? They did a good job on him. I think Junior struggled
a little bit handing the ball in traffic. They kind of ran a couple guys at
him. We've got to get Junior to be more forceful when -- because he's our
front-line guy and that's something he's got -- in the future he's got to be
more consistent with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks so much for your time. Appreciate it.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [Matt Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16298)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UCF - 84, Memphis - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UCF. Can we welcome Coach Johnny Dawkins; B.J.
Taylor, sophomore; and senior, Matt Williams. Our format is we'll ask for an
opening statement for coach Dawkins and take questions for student-athletes.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on the game.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought we played one of our best games of the year to be
quite frank. From start to finish, I thought we defended. We've hung our hat
there all year long, and I thought our guys really focused throughout most of
the game and had a great defensive effort.  
  
Offensively, I thought it would be combined with really good execution, and
especially during the middle portion of the game where we were able to opened
up a lead after our guys made a lot of connecting plays. They played well
together. They shared the basketball, and we're fortunate to get the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes. Raise your hand.  
  
Q. Question for Matt. Matt, in terms of the way you guys are playing
right now, some of your best ball of the season, do you think you've put
yourself in conversation for an NCAA bid, and do you follow that type of thing
closely, where you are relative to the bubble, things like that?  
MATT WILLIAMS: As a team, we try not to focus on the future. We take one game
at a time and go from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
I'll throw one out. B.J., if you would, this is a tournament that UCF had not
had a bit of success in in recent years. Won the opener in 2014, but have gone
one-and-out the last couple. What was the difference today to get past a solid
Memphis team.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: I think like Coach said, we hang our hat on defense and we came
out. They got some points early, but then we locked in on our defense. That's
where we got all our momentum from is getting stops in. That's where we hang
our half. As long as we get stops, we know we're going to be in ball games.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. When Tacko goes down with two fouls
early in the game, is there any sense of pressure, added pressure when it goes
down? Your big man, your defensive player, goes down or do you guys come
together as a team and how do you make that rally?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Tacko is a huge part of what we do defensively, but we have a
great belief in our team, and Chad Brown, he came in and give us great minutes
like he always does. There's nobody that plays harder in the country than Chad
Brown at the center position. We have a great belief in him. We know that he's
going to do what he does, and he's going to help us get stops just like Tacko
does. He just does it in different ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Matt, your thoughts same question?  
  
MATT WILLIAMS: Just to complement on what B.J. said, we play defense
collectively. We have a group of guys. We all hang our hats on defense. We
don't really worry about offense the much. When Tacko went down, we just look
at it as next man up and keep going with our defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Okay. We'll dismiss again the student-
athletes. Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Am I dismissed also?  
  
THE MODERATOR: You can stay, Coach. Have a few more.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought I was dismissed, too. Hey, guy, remember what we
talked about. Good job, boys.  
  
Q. Coach, similar question to your player, I'm curious whether you are
following the bubble conversation and whether a win like this puts you in
position on the bubble or you think you need to win tomorrow or is that not a
focus for you?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: That really hasn't been a focus for us as you can tell what
our players just said. What we want to do was play our best basketball down
the stretch of the season, and we think we're doing that. We think we're
playing, you know, our best basketball when it matters the most, and that's
something that we were working towards, and I'm happy to see our guys
continuing to do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, I'll ask you if you would preview tomorrow's match-up
with SMU. I know you just got off the floor. What do you see when you see the
Mustangs.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We played them one time this year. I saw a very talented team
that's well-coached, and they're the champions in our league, so they are a
very good team.  
  
Other than that, I hadn't really watched them too much since that game and
that's been a while ago. I just know they have some talented kids, some
talented young players and, like I said, they play the right way. They play to
win. That's why I think they've been so successful. We're going to study them
tonight. Try to learn as much as we can to compete against them tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Congratulations, Coach, see you
tomorrow.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Thanks, guys, take care.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Kyle Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27796)

### [Jacob Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30829)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Cincinnati - 80, Tulsa - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, gentlemen. Joined now by Jacob Evans and Coach Mick
Cronin from Cincinnati. We'll be joined by Kyle Washington.  
  
Coach, if you would lead us off by giving your thoughts on the game and
advancing to the semifinal round, please.  
  
MICK CRONIN: First of all, I want to congratulate Tulsa on their season. In my
years, over 20 years in college, I've never seen a team lose nine seniors
before and have to play one guy that played last year in the rotation, Pat
Birt. So, I thought their kids played extremely hard all year, and they got
tougher. They learned how to battle, and they're going to be a formidable team
next year.  
  
For us, I thought it was a tale of two halves. I thought our defense was
excellent in the first half. In the second half, our offense carried us,
especially Kyle Washington in the low post, but he and Jacob both had very
effective games. Like I said, defensively, we're not at our best in the second
half. Give Tulsa some credit. They kept playing and made us keep playing until
the end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for Jacob if you would.  
  
Q. Jacob, I think you guys hit something like five your first seven
shots at three-point range and led for all but 17 seconds in this one. Was the
plan to try to get a big early lead on this team then you guys went inside the
second half? Did you change strategies there?  
JACOB EVANS: Well, coming out of every game, we always try to establish our
inside game. It's just depending on how the defense is playing us, the way we
dictate where we take our shots. They were packing it, so we got some open
looks.  
  
In the second half, we just got to take what the defense gives us. If they
want to pack it in, we'll shoot open jump shots. If they want to close out on
us hard, we can either play downhill or blow by or feed our big guys, like we
did Kyle.  
  
Q. Jacob, in terms of your offensive efficiency, you guys have been much
better shooting the ball this year than you have in the past. I'm wondering
whether that at some level that took some of the pressure off defensively and
not having to just win on the defensive end because you guys are able to score
as well as you do now?  
JACOB EVANS: We work real hard in the offseason on our offensive as a team,
also individually. But we still have the same mindset defensively as in trying
to lock down every team we play.  
  
Q. Kyle, did you want to come out and make a statement, not just win but
make a statement how you won today. Because you pointed towards the post
season so much.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Yes, we did. We kind of want to do that every day, every day
we practice, every day we play, but that's just the way our team is. We just
want to keep on proving how good we are as a team collectively. We just want
to keep winning, you know? Post season, regular season, but definitely we had
an emphasis on the post season for sure. We want to do well and make deep runs
in all of the tournaments we enter.  
  
Q. Kyle, in a lot of ways it seems like you were the missing piece for
the Cincinnati team. Does it feel that way to you, and has this fit been what
you thought it would be when you came in?  
KYLE WASHINGTON: Sometimes people try to spin it that way, but when Coach
called me when I was about to transfer, I just wanted a place where I could be
told the truth and be able to have an opportunity to compete at the highest
level. So, if people want to say that, that's fine.  
  
But, I mean, it's been a collective group effort the whole year. People have
stepped up at different times when I haven't stepped up, and I've stepped up
at different times when people were absent. So, you can spin it either way.
I'm just glad to be with this team. Because we're a great cohesive unit,
honestly. We deserve to be in these moments and we want to be in these
moments. I'm just happy that I'm in a great place to be able to develop my
game.  
  
Q. Jacob, a lot of teams use conference tournaments as preparation for
the NCAA Tournament. This team has not won a conference tournament since 2004,
conference USA Tournament. Is it a little more important to you guys to take
down the nets here? Obviously, you want to prepare for the NCAA as well, but
how much more important is it to you to get this one?  
JACOB EVANS: Well, we're competitors and we want to win everything we're in,
whether it's a tournament where it would be in the summer, it doesn't count.
Like even at practice, we're competing red versus black, and we also have
three seniors that have never cut the nets down, and we just want to get one
for them.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle. Kyle what allowed you to be so dominant in the
second half? 15 points, not a missed shot between field goals and free throws.
Was it game flow, game plan? Particularly in the second half you were pretty
dominant.  
KYLE WASHINGTON: This may sound weird, but, honestly, it was me not worrying
about offense. When I try to dominate positioning and just understand where
I'm supposed to be at every time -- I mean, Coach will co-sign on this, like
he always does, and he will tell me all of the time, when I don't worry about
offense, that's when I flourish. If I can do that every time, maybe I'll have
that result every time.  
  
I mean, I just want to be focused and close a good Tulsa team out. They can
sneak up in the second half and we just wanted to win. I just wanted to be
part of that effort.  
  
Q. Jacob, specific to the offensive improvements you were talking about
over December, what were the areas you were looking at getting better at? When
you break it down, it seems you guys are more efficient in just about every
area. What were you focused on in particular this summer?  
JACOB EVANS: Myself? I was just focusing on being a multidimensional player,
not just being a jump shooter. Being able to attack the rim and finish the
contact or draw fouls when I know I can't score.  
  
Q. Jacob, in terms of your experience with Coach, and, you know, what
that's been like, you know, since you came back from this layoff, do you feel
or see any sort of difference in terms of your experience with him? Do you see
anything different emotionally, anything differently in terms of coaching, or
not?  
JACOB EVANS: Well, I can definitely see the hunger, the hunger, and I can hear
it in his voice at practice, see it in his eyes during the game. And I felt
like it's really starting to carry over to us as a team. It's putting us in
that hunger mode, especially since it's March, it's really time to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes.  
  
MICK CRONIN: You were talking about when I was out, he wasn't on the team. He
was only a sophomore. That was a couple years ago.  
  
Q. Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up to questions for Coach Cronin, please.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been emphasizing offensive rebounding lately. I know
you've been talking about it. Once again, a strong effort in that category.
Can you talk about what -- how that makes your team better? How key that is
for you, let's say in the post season especially?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we tried to explain to guys there's multiple ways to score,
and this team, we have multiple options. So, first it start with us, with not
turning the ball over, because then you get a shot. We have five guys that can
make shots and score. But then it becomes every time you get it, the more
shots you get, the more opportunities you have to rebound. So we lead the
country in fewest turnover, steals against our team, which allows us to get
more rebounds. We've had much better rebounding teams, but we didn't shoot the
ball the way we shoot the ball. We didn't pass the ball the way this team can
pass the ball.  
  
But we're trying to make sure, in the last month or so, that we still have the
same mentality of getting three people to the glass, at least. Offensive
rebounding is about numbers. If you just send one or two, you're not going to
be successful, so, that's really been our -- something we focused on is
getting our second, third, and fourth rebounder to the rim so we have a chance
to keep balls alive. You're just -- there's multiple games, I can tell, you we
wouldn't have won if we didn't have second-chance points.  
  
Q. Coach, just to jump off of that point --  
MICK CRONIN: Sure.  
  
Q. You've been consistently a top 15 defensive team year after year.
This offense is a relatively new thing this year in terms of being the top 35
team nationally. Has it changed what you need to do defensively that, again,
your ending possessions more with made shots, and does that -- does it make it
easier to find that rhythm on the defensive end?  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, yeah. I think what you were alluding to earlier, Kyle's a
humble guy. He is exactly what the doctor ordered for our team. But Jacob as
well, you know? I said this in -- at the American Media Day, when Gary and
Troy were voted unanimous First Team All League. I said, well, if they are,
we're a lock because they struggle to be our best two guys in practice because
at times, it's Kyle and Gary.  
  
Kevin Johnson's had a great, great senior year. I knew what Jarron Cumberland
was capable of as well. It definitely takes pressure off our defense. To be
able to make runs in tournaments, you have to be able -- you have to have a
game, like tonight, our second half, our offense carried us. We gave up 36
points in the second half, but we scored 40. You're right on the money. We're
just more capable. We have more weapons. It's just not scoring, the passing as
well. It is skilled players. Our talent level is a little bit higher across
the board and on the bench as well.  
  
Q. Nine players played at least 11 minutes tonight. Can you talk about
how big of an advantage that is when the goal is to win three games in three
days to have that much depth in this tournament?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we all get 13 scholarships. I always said this about the
bench. You're allowed to play them. You've got guys over there in uniform.
Coming here tonight, I don't know if you watched me on the bench, I kept
checking the stat sheet. My goal was to keep everybody under 30 minutes
because we ended the season on a Sunday. And if we were lucky enough to end
the season again on a Sunday, there's a chance you can play Thursday at noon
in the NCAA tournament.  
  
So, definitely was a game plan to make sure we tried to keep everybody under
30 tonight going in. But I will tell you, my message to my team all week has
been, the key to our March are the guys who do not start. We have really good
players. They're younger, Tre Scott, Nysier Brooks, are freshman; Justin is a
freshman, obviously Jarron's -- I think he won sixth man of the year in our
league, he's a freshman. I keep telling Quadri, he won a game for us and he's
going to win another game for us. You have to try to keep those guys engaged.
Got to practice and develop those guys. And you've got to give them some
minutes. It's definitely important. Hopefully it plays out, but you've got to
win Saturday to get to Sunday, where maybe it will matter a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, specific to the passing that's been going on this year. Jacob,
Troy, Gary, all three of them, have significantly increased their assist
percentage over last year. Is there any difference schematically you've seen?
Is this a developing of players? I was asking Jacob about it earlier. Is there
something specific that you have implemented that's lead to this --  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, yeah. Well, one is Kyle is an offensive -- it's easier
getting an assist when you throw him the ball. That's one. Two would be Gary's
ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter this year. So, we're not a
predictable team on the offensive end. We can bring our big guys out plus
they're a problem inside. And the guys, we try to teach the guys how to be a
problem for our opponents. Some people can't -- struggle to deal with us
inside. Some bigger teams may struggle when we invert and bring our bigger
guys outside. Ball movement is obviously -- you talk about it all you want,
but you can't run a free-flowing offense if you don't have the talent and the
guys that make decisions. You've have to give up a lot control as a coach. We
practice it all of the time. I just want the ball moving and they've got to
read and play together. We've been working on it since last April.  
  
You say why haven't you done that before? You have to have players that can do
it. You have to have five guys that make shots and make decisions. That's way
I thought we got a chance to get better, this team, because the more you do,
it the more comfortable they'll get it. We have some things we'll do
structurally, but we try to let them keep playing and read the defenses. We
think that's made us harder to deal with. You can't load up on this or that.
We don't just try to jam the ball to Kyle. If you take that away, we have many
other ways to beat you. I just try to teach them to read what other people are
trying to do to us and then use that against our opponent.  
  
It's a never-ending learning process when you coach that way. I think it will
be a huge weapon for us in March, that, and I've told them I want them to keep
on playing. Don't walk the ball up the floor and start looking at the clock
and late clock play. It's our opinion, we have great players on our team,
let's go play. We don't want to play the game in the 50s. We think that gives
our opponent a chance to beat us.  
  
Q. And just to follow that up, that's another thing you can do which is
the numbers, I assume?  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, yeah, talent and numbers.  
  
Q. Collectively, you're in the tournament every year but it seems like
this team is better set up to make a deep run. When you see even a game like
tonight when you talk about the defense carries you the first half, offense in
the second half, does that -- does a team that's able to do that, given you a
getter chance?  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, absolutely. It's just like a team that's got one or two
scores. If they have a bad night, you're going home. You got to be able to
dance every dance that they play to win the award at the dance ball. You got
to be able to slow-dance, you got to be able to do it all. Okay?  
  
So -- and those are the teams that keep marching on. You're not going to be
able to win the same way. Because you're going to run into a match-up that
they're able to take that away from you. You have to be able to do something
else. The last part is we have different guys that carry us at different
points in the game. So Jacob gets hots, Troy early, then Jacob, then it's
Kyle. Like Gary Clark didn't really -- he led us in blocks and deflections
tonight but didn't really get going offensively. In the last game in
Connecticut, he was a dominant offensive player.  
  
Teams with more weapons have a better chance. They're not relying upon one way
to win a game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach. Thank you, congratulations. See you tomorrow.  
  
MICK CRONIN: I appreciate it.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Rodney Purvis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28564)

### [Amida Brimah](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32196)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 77, USF - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Rodney Purvis and Amida Brimah. While we
wait for Coach Ollie, we'll take questions from the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rodney, given that it's getting late, the game's very close. You know
your situation, your career is going to end if you lose. What's going through
your mind down the stretch when it was really -- you think the game was really
on the line?  
RODNEY PURVIS: That's definitely not the first thing I'm thinking about is my
career coming to an end, so I'm just trying to get a win. That's not even in
my mind. I mean, going into the game, we know what is at stake as a team. None
of us want our season to end right now, so that was our mindset the entire
night. Coming out in the second half, we got off to a little, slow start, but
we just got it going.  
  
Q. Rodney, would you say this is the best game of your career, 30
points, no turnovers, 9 from the line?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I'm not really sure -- I know I played a pretty good game, but
I'm just happy we got the win. I didn't know I had no turnovers, so I
appreciate that.  
  
Q. Amida, could you address kind of the same thing? You made a couple
big defensive stops towards the end. They got within two several times,
including late with Thorpe. What was going through your mind, knowing this
could be the last game of your career?  
AMIDA BRIMAH: I just -- you know, it was just another free throw. What came to
my mind, I just had to knock it or at least make one of the two.  
  
Q. Rodney, how much were you guys feeding off the crowd?  
RODNEY PURVIS: My fans are huge for us. Any time it's time to get down and get
a big-time stop, to have those -- to hear those guys in the stands going crazy
for us is definitely a momentum boost for us, and we're just happy to have the
best fans in the world.  
  
Q. Rodney, can you talk about the defense on Thorpe? You obviously made
that big block near the end, he fouls out, and you guys go on a 10-1 run to
close the game out. Can you talk about how important that sequence was toward
the end?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Definitely. He definitely kept them in the game. He had some
big-time shots, and I knew I was -- well, the coaches was telling me to guard
him, so I just had to guard him, and I was just able to work them a little
bit. Pick them up a little bit. Get up under him, get some steals and get some
blocks. I don't think I had many blocks this season, so I'm excited about the
two blocks I had today.  
  
Q. Rodney, what is it about this tournament? I think you're averaging
close to 17 points a game in 8 games in the tournament in your career?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I think we just locked in as a team. Like I said, the season
ending -- coming into the game knowing this could be the last game is
definitely not in the back of my mind. I just know what's at stake. We just
locked in as a team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. For Amida, this is a team that you guys beat handily during the
regular season. Obviously they played a lot better. Did you see a different
team? They hit a lot more shots and seemed to be obviously better than
before.  
AMIDA BRIMAH: It's March. Every team steps up their game. You can't
underestimate any team. I want to give thanks to the fans. They did a great
job today, and we appreciate that.  
  
Q. Rodney, you're playing Houston next. What do you remember about the
games you played against them during the regular season?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just transition. That's going to huge for us tomorrow, getting
back in transition, and getting stops on the defensive end.  
  
I think it will be -- both teams are likely to get up and down, so I think it
will be a good up-and-down game tomorrow. The main thing for us is getting
rebounds, getting stops, and getting back in transition.  
  
Q. Amida, could you just talk about what your mindset is in this point
of the season? Obviously you're a senior. One loss and it's all over. What are
you thinking about on the court? What is your mindset as a senior?  
AMIDA BRIMAH: I always try to come on the court playing at a level 5. It's
tournament time. It's March. You've got to put your intensity higher than
you're used to playing during the regular season. I've just to take it one
game at a time. That's how I think, one game at a time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes to the locker room.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Get off your feet. Make sure you-all get hydrated. See you-all in
the morning. Okay?  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Kevin Ollie. If you give an opening
statement first.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Just happy with the victory. Everybody wants to advance in this
tournament. I give credit to USF. They played a great game. Thorpe was
tremendous. We got a 14-point lead and kind of got lackluster there and had a
couple turnovers. We've just got to learn and grow from it. I think we'll do
that and hopefully have a better game execution-wise on the offensive end
tomorrow.  
  
If you give turnovers to Houston, that's what they feed off of. We got to make
sure we do that and make sure we play with intensity and hopefully come out
with a victory tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Ollie?  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about Rodney's performance tonight? Obviously a
career high in points. He was playing pretty good defense as well there,
especially down the stretch. Do you attribute -- I mean, he plays well a lot,
but obviously, he's a senior in the tournament. Did he give you the kind of
effort you were looking for today?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Oh, yeah. Definitely. If anybody follows Purv, he played some of
his best basketball in this tournament and in the NCAA Tournament. We had one
game last year. We had two games last year. Just did a wonderful job. When we
needed a big play, he came up with it. I was so proud of him taking a
defensive challenge. That's what we've been trying to get him and convey to
him, because he's probably one of the best defensive players laterally moving
his feet. He did a great job, took the challenge, and played a wonderful game
on the offensive and defensive end. And if he wants to play basketball after
this, that's what he's going to have to become. He's going to have to become
that great two-way player on the defensive end and the offensive end, you
know, just appreciate his effort.  
  
Q. Coach Ollie, I know you touched on in your opening statement about
what you need to do differently tomorrow against Houston. You played them
twice this season, came out on the losing side both times. What do you think
you need to focus on with your team tomorrow?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Rebound and transition.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win, of course. Can you talk a little
bit about the confidence level going into tomorrow, tonight, based on purposes
and performance and really coming together and meshing well as a team tonight.
Do you feel as those your team's performance level tonight will be able to
match Houston's aggressiveness tomorrow?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We can't play like this and expect to advance. We can't have 16
turnovers. We've got to shoot the ball better. We've got to execute on the
offensive end. Because if you want to play good defensive transition, you have
to do well in the offensive end. That's offensive rebound and that's playing
with more execution.  
  
So, we're going to have to clean those things up. Like our grit. When we need
a stop, when we need a big-time defensive effort and defensive plays, our guys
stepped up, so I really appreciate that. But we have to play a better game to
advance in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kevin, the numbers aside. How important was it to have Jalen out
there for as long as he was out there to hold things together?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It was great. You know, we got to keep them out there. We don't
have too many guys on the bench there, so -- and he's been saying he wants to
stay in the game. Because if he sits out too long, his ankle stiffs up, so,
it's just good to have him out there. He has to play a better foregame, read
pick-and-rolls a little bit better. We'll go back to the hotel and break down
his pick-and-roll space and hopefully get that better against Houston.  
  
Q. Was part of the game to attack the basket? You got a lot of foul
shots by getting to the basket.  
KEVIN OLLIE: You can probably ask any coach in America. That's always the plan
to attack the basket, get to the free-throw line. You control the game like
that. You can get them in foul trouble. Our biggest foul was against Thorpe.
That's taking it at him, getting him in foul trouble, and getting him out of
the game. I think the last three minutes gave us a real boost and a real
advantage. That's always the top key, attacking on the defensive end and
offensive end, and trying to move with purpose and get downhill. Our guys did
a real good job of that.  
  
When you get to the free-throw line, you have to convert. I think the only one
-- CV had that one for five, but everybody else shot the ball very, very well
from the free-throw line, so I'm very proud of that effort.  
  
Q. On three-point shots, how do you defend against Houston?  
KEVIN OLLIE: You have to play better pick-and-roll defense and better one-on-
one defense, and all five have to control the pick-and-roll. It's not two
players. It's not the guy with the ball, not the defensive guy. It's the guy
setting the screen. It's everybody low, everybody getting out and playing
defense like UConn is able to do, and hopefully we can have them miss some
shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach. Congratulations.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Coach Michael Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32875)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

### [Kentrell Barkley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32877)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
East Carolina - 80, Temple - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student athletes, after questions
from the student athletes we'll excuse the student athletes from the locker
room and take questions for the coach. Tour outs on the game?  
  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: Obviously, it's a big win, not only for the team but for
our program. In so many cases we're playing in the league with very rich
tradition and not just good basketball teams, but really good basketball
programs. And historic programs, obviously, Temple one of the winningest
programs in college basketball history.  
  
For us, it isn't just a win simply for our basketball team, our current
basketball team but a win for our program, because you're going against
outstanding coach, outstanding team, and, you know, great, great tradition, in
one of the best programs in the country and that's the way it is most nights
we line up in the league. So our guys are very determined to throw themselves
into the fire, into the mix with the teams particularly with the programs that
are the elite in our conference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again we'll take questions for the student athletes. Raise your
hand if you have questions for student athletes, please.  
  
Q. Kentrell, obviously you had a big game today. Is there anything
special that was working well for you. How did you play this well?  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: Just kind of keeping -- the main thing, the main thing, come
out and do the things that we know we do well. And for me, I was just trying
to stay involved, do my stuff which is rebounding, and stay in attack mode.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student athletes?  
  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: I would like to add really quickly, with Kentrell,
particularly. When the team goes out early and they come back on the floor,
come back into the locker room, probably about the 12-minute mark, he came in
limping and very obvious limp. I went to the trainers and said what's going
on. I haven't seen him. He went to see him and one of the other assistant
coaches said he was limping coming off the floor. There was a minute we
weren't sure he was going to be able to play.  
  
The trainer got a hold of him are the starting doing a few things, put him on
the bike right before the game started. We weren't sure we were going to have
him on the floor. For him to dial up a performance like this is outstanding.
Literally, he was dragging. He looked like The Mummy walking into the locker
room. At the 12-minute mark, when he was able to turn it around, with a heck
of an effort, after clearly being in some pain.  
  
Q. Inaudible question  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: Good question.  
  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: My right knee, is my jumping knee, so a lot of jumping off
is -- like, I think I have tendonitis in it and when I jump too much, it's
like a sharp pain. So when I press down on my knee, I can like barely feel it,
so, I just did a little treatment and got some stuff on it, helped me out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student athletes?  
  
Elijah, if I can give one you to, if you can talk about the upcoming matchup
with SMU, obviously a team that had a pretty good year and had a pretty good
performance against your guys last time out. What do you expect to do tomorrow
to get the win against the Mustangs?  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: We just got to lock them defensively. Once we do that, we get
the rebound, we get our transition, I feel like we're as good as anyone in
this league. And we just got to -- we lock in offensively and defensively,
attack, get to the paint, and create plays.  
  
Q. Kentrell, you were obviously feeling it today. Did you take it upon
yourself to really take it at them, knowing that, seems like they couldn't
stop what you were doing?  
KENTRELL BARKLEY: Well, I had a huge pep talk with one of the assistant
coaches. The talk was about trying to build a legacy here, trying to do
something that's never been done here, just dialing in and focusing on the
next play. Just give it our all. Don't give up. Give 150 percent all you can
every game. That was the focus coming into this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student athletes?  
  
Okay. We'll excuse the student athletes to the locker room and Coach Perry
will take questions from the media.  
  
Student athletes, if you would please exit to your left through this door
here. We'll take questions for Coach Perry. Please.  
  
Q. Coach, you shot a lot better from beyond the arc than you have in the
season. That and your ability to defend them beyond the arc. Did you think
those were two of the keys today?  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: Obviously, when we can make threes, that's a tremendous
plus for our team. It's been frustrating. In some cases the three-point
shooting, because we have guys that can shoot the ball well and they've
struggled during the course of the year being able to shoot it. We had some
nights which the guys shoot it well, some nights they don't. We just haven't
had the consistency that we have that we would expect with the type of
shooters that we have. Because we have some guys that can really shoot the
ball.  
  
And the numbers are consistent and all that you're working on in practice, but
being to do it in games consistently has been a bit of struggle for us, and
that's probably reflected in our three-point shooting percentage. But we're a
lot better shooting team than what our numbers indicate.  
  
Defensively, I said it a few times, we've grown from a team that was known for
the offensive execution, three-point shooting, and to a team that's known for
stellar defense, one of the tops in the country in terms of defensive field
gold percentage. We're anchored by Andre Washington. But even when Andre is
not on the floor, he's able to impact our team and make them value defense
more.  
  
We were able to play a small lineup tonight when Temple went small, and our
guys were very tenacious, very aggressive, scrambling on the floor. A big part
of it has been, with Dre back there, he's giving them a lot more confidence
being able to be aggressive defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach Perry, please?  
  
Q. Coach, your thought's on tomorrow's match-up, please?  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: Wow, I was hoping I wouldn't hear that. I am trying to
enjoy this a little bit more. It's like one of those comedy skits. The good
news is we won. The bad news, you've got SMU. They were a really good team. We
were joking about it, they beat a lot of teams in the league like somebody
owed them money. They are really, really good. I think Coach Lebo said their
top five guys this early in the year, could very easily be First Team All
Conference, and they were pretty close to it this year between the first and
second team. Almost all of their guys are represented in the All Conference
team.  
  
They are good at every level, every facet of the game defensively, offensive
execution. They have guys that can score in multiple ways, multiple position
guys. Outside of praying, we've got to figure out some other things that we've
got to do to show them some different looks. But one thing we're going to do,
we're going to be competitive. We're going to show up to fight and be ready to
play. And we're going out with the intention of winning a basketball game.
Because when we go lace it up, and we wear the EC uniform, that's what we're
going to do, try to win.  
  
We have a formidable opponent, almost an impossible opponent to face. We're
ready for that challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Final question for Coach Perry?  
  
Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH MICHAEL PERRY: Thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

### [Pat Birt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32889)

### [TK Edogi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32890)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Tulsa - 66, Tulane - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: As student athletes get settled, we'll take an opening
statement from Coach Haith. After the student-athletes are done, we'll dismiss
them to the locker room. With that, Coach, your thoughts on today's game
advancing to the next round, please.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you. I thought our guys competed hard. Playing these guys
on Sunday, I was really disappointed in our effort down there, and I thought
we came back. We had a great mindset, great focus, and defensively, we were
really, really good. We just didn't make shots early in the ball game during
the first half, but we still maintained our defensive focus and thought that
was the key to the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, questions for the student-athletes, please raise your
hand. We'll get a microphone you to.  
  
Q. For T.K. and Pat. What was the difference Sunday versus tonight, was
it defense, was it effort? Both those things?  
TK EDOGI: I think we wrapped up our defense today. We were really disappointed
we lost to them and just know we wanted to get them back today.  
  
PAT BIRT: Also, I think we moved without the ball a lot better. We had a lot
better movement. Last game I noticed we were a little stagnant. It was hard to
be aggressive on drives. Defense was staying. Today it opened up the gap for
everyone, and opened up the offense for us as well.  
  
Q. Pat can you talk about you had a stretch where you made several
shots? Were you feeling it at that time., I know later you got into foul
trouble. What do you remember at that time?  
PAT BIRT: Like I said, we were just moving the ball really well. I was able to
get open shots and it was going in. Like we said, just moving out the ball.
There was times we didn't make shots, but even when we missed those shots, the
fact we moved out the ball, it was easy for us to get offensive rebounds,
which is what he did all game. So, we needed that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes, please? Okay.
We'll let the student-athletes get back to the locker room.  
  
Now we'll open up to questions for Coach Haith.  
  
Q. Frank, I know you did a lot of hard work the last few days. Was it
nice to see that paying off here tonight?  
FRANK HAITH: I spoke to TV and talked about just that. We got back Sunday and
we went to work. Even yesterday, we went hard at Hartford and competed. It's a
mindset we have to continue to establish with these young guys. Understand how
hard you have to play. Understand the toughness part of it. That was the thing
that was disappointing about Sunday. We didn't have the right mentality. I
thought our guys really embraced it, and when we came out, the first
possession defensively was really, really good. We set the tone from that
point on, in terms of how we were going to play the game in terms of our
intensity.  
  
There have been times all year where we had good possessions, and then when
adversity hits, we've let up on the defensive end. I don't think that
happened. Maybe a couple possessions we lost some principal things, but I
thought our effort was good throughout the ball game even when we weren't
shooting the ball in the first half. Our defense kept us where we needed to be
until the shots started to fall in the second half.  
  
Q. I thought Junior had a pretty crucial sequence late in the game,
where he drove to the rim, had a basket and on the other end took a charge. It
seemed everybody had moments like that but it came at the right time?  
FRANK HAITH: It was a great team effort. He's our guy. When the game's the
line and we need big plays, we want him to step up and made those kind of
plays. He had a heck of a drive in there on his left hand, good finish. And
then he sprinted back and took a charge. Those two bang-bang plays were really
big for us.  
  
Junior has been growing into that role, understanding he's our guy. He's our
go-to guy, and I think he's had some growth throughout the year in terms of
doing that.  
  
Q. I know that you haven't probably had a chance to really process this,
but I'm going to ask you about your next game. What are your thoughts about
playing Cincinnati again?  
FRANK HAITH: This time of year, you just want to continue to play in post-
season play, and we get a great opportunity to play one of the best teams in
the country. You know, they're well-coached, they are very talented. We're
going to have to play, you know, a really -- we have to play well to win, and
there's no question that I anticipate them playing. That's how they play with
great intensity. We have to have the same kind of intensity that we had
tonight tomorrow night against a very talented team.  
  
Like I said not just one of the best teams in the conference, but one of the
best teams in the country. Our guys have to embrace it and look for this
opportunity?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for coach? Coach, thank you.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Coach Fran Dunph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32882)

### [Shizz Alston, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32883)

### [Obi Enechionyia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28852)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
East Carolina - 80, Temple - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the athletes from the locker room. Coach, if you
would, your thoughts on the game and tour thoughts?  
  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I certainly want to give credit to East Carolina.
They obviously did what they needed to do to win the game. Barkley was a
handful. He made a couple of great, great plays in the first half which I
thought set the tone. Two second-chance opportunities that hurt us, then we
got ourselves back together, we had the ball a couple of times in the second
half, maybe. I think it was 53-52. They had a chance to take the lead and it
meant a lot to us emotionally. And conference-wise, it didn't happen for us.
They made the right shots at the right time and they didn't play as well as we
needed to down the stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student athletes. We have issues with
the microphone. So take questions and raise your hand and we'll go you to.
Mark?  
  
Q. Obi, your reaction on today's game? It just seemed like you dug
yourself into a deep hole that was too tough to come back. Just your thoughts
on today's game.  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: We didn't do what we needed to do on the defensive end. That
said something for us, what it is. They shot 50% from the field, and our goal
is to hold them at 40, so, I think that's the biggest thing, today is the
defense.  
  
Q. Shizz?  
SHIZZ ALSTON: Same thing, our defense, we usually hit those shots, we didn't
hit them. We were down one and a chance to go up and we missed the chance to
go up. We just didn't hear the shots.  
  
Q. Shizz, you know, your defense -- the defense has not been great this
season, some which I saw today which I didn't see too often, go-byes, whether
Sheppard getting by the guards, Hughes -- what is it that you were giving up
penetration that you might usually see.  
SHIZZ ALSTON: Them guys are crafty with the ball. We just lost focus a couple
times. Because we got go-byes -- sometimes we're up too far on them, they just
got by us, but nothing to focus.  
  
Q. Would it be fair to say Barkley was playing harder than everybody
else out there to some degree?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: We got 16 rebounds. A lot of times we didn't, a lot of times
we didn't. So, just a lot of different plays like that, that we should have
made and we didn't. He had a good game.  
  
Q. Obi, would a game like this, the way the season went, tough losses,
you guys should have played better, et cetera?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Yeah. There were a lot of games this season, we didn't play
as well. Potentially we should have played well, and we didn't. This is just
another one of those. This is a team we should have beat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Shizz, what was the conversation afterwards with Dan. He must have
been frustrated at the end and it was just the postgame with Dan and Mark?  
SHIZZ ALSTON: These guys, I love them. They did a pretty good job. Every game
wasn't perfect, but they gave us what they had. I love and appreciate the
leadership.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student athletes to the locker room. Just exit
to your right and cross, go through the door to this side on my left.  
  
We'll open to questions for Coach Dunphy. We have our audio issues fixed and
we do have a microphone.  
  
Q. Fran, you know, it was a one possession game for a long stretch, for
maybe a one or two position game. You had the stretch where you put Dan and
Obi on the bench together. That's where you see you made the run. Did you look
like -- you changed it up, but the next time out, did you look like you feel
like you could have managed those substitutions a little different?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I thought they were very tired. That's what our --
the advice was, to just give them a quick blow, and that -- we have been doing
that during the course of the season at times, but actually, asked him that in
the game in the first half. I would have liked to stay with them a little
longer, but I thought they were tired and hoped the other guys coming in would
stem the tide. I am not sure how many minutes we played without them and
exactly what the time frame was.  
  
. We had two chances to take the lead. We didn't come up with either one of
them, they made two big, big shots on us. By the time we got those guys back
in the game, but we had our chances again, after that. We just didn't make the
plays we needed to.  
  
Q. Fran, you talked about, you didn't make the plays needed to. Is that
basically been the story this season, play here, play there, just --  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah. I think so. I think we talk about it a lot. The games
change on a play. We had a runner in the lane I thought that would have gotten
us over the hump later in the second half, but it didn't happen and they
stepped up and made shots like they needed to.  
  
Our defense needed to be better. We were -- I thought we were really well-
prepared. They didn't do anything that we didn't expect, but they did step up
and make a couple of great shots. We missed a couple of assignments that
allowed them to have a clearer look than I would have liked to.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a lot of players, young players, in this game, who got
minutes, a couple freshman who got their first post season tournament
experience. What positives can you take away from their play and the young
guys how they played?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah. For the most part, they did what we were asking them
to do. I thought Damion Moore had really good plays. Q. Rose is going to be an
outstanding player. Alani Moore had an open jumper away from our bench in the
second half that I felt very was confident was going to go down because of all
of the work and time that he's put in.  
  
I think the three of them are terrific player, terrific guys, and we're
anxious to see how their futures will be at Temple University, but proud of
them all.  
  
Q. Fran, same question I asked Shizz. Is that more go-byes that the
guards game up than you would have expected?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: There's quickness. Sheppard is pretty good out there. We
did a lot of switching out front. There was probably an abundance of it that
we would have liked to cut down on. We got to our bigs a few times. There was
some foul shooting. We were pretty decent in the first half. We kept them off
the line in the first half and in the second half. We fouled late for obvious
reasons. I thought they got to our bigs too much. But a couple of those threes
were killer delays for them as well. They gave four for seven on threes. They
were very efficient on threes in the second half. We gave up too many of those
looks, and some of that is led by getting in the gap and driving and kicking.  
  
Q. Obviously, you got to the foul line a lot early. Was that an emphasis
and then as the game wore on, maybe the guys, did they settle too much for
--  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Well, again, we're a three-point shooting team. I would
love us to be a team that can get it to the rim and make plays at the rim. We
had a couple plays at the rim that I thought we just didn't finish, a couple
of them in transition. But we're always trying to get it down on the block and
see if we can't play out of there and kick out and get open opportunities and
get ourselves to the foul line, but we obviously didn't do that enough today.
Damion Moore got himself down there a document of times. He didn't play that
many minutes in the second half either.  
  
Q. Fran, can you talk a little bit about how many young player did play
this year, and maybe how that bodes for the future?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: I certainly like our future. We -- those three freshman,
Shizz, and Ern being sophomores out there. We're going to have four new guys
come and join us next year and probably the biggest thing is Josh Brown
joining us as well, so, that's the -- I think we're in very good shape, and
I'm excited about what the future holds and -- because of how many minutes
those guys got, the kind of play that they had, and the new guys coming, but
most of all, Josh Brown.  
  
Q. Josh's absence this year --  
THE MODERATOR: I appreciate Shawn's question, but revision is history. We
don't have him. There's not much we can do about them. When he is in there
he's great at keeping people in front of him. There's not that many go-byes.
That and his leadership are critical things. I thought Dan, Mark, and Mike did
their best as seniors on this team to help us, and I think Shizz did a lot of
really good leadership things for us, that helped our team this year.  
  
Q. Fran, generally, on the season, did the guys not make as much
improvement, as you would have -- expected, as, you know, in-season
improvement?  
A. Well, I think the younger guys -- I think Damion Moore made great strides
throughout the year. Quinton Rose made great strides throughout the year. I
thought Shizz played so many minutes, but I think he had a really solid year
for us. Obi had a unbelievable beginning, a little bit of a downturn in the
middle, and then I think he picked it up in the end of the year.  
  
We played really some good basketball teams this year. I was proud of our
efforts in so many different ways. The only thing I would have liked to have
done better is on the defensive end and been a better defensive team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach. Thanks for your time.  
  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Okay. Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Mike Dunleavy, Sr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32895)

### [Malik Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32896)

### [Cameron Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30599)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
Tulsa - 66, Tulane - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: And Tulane is here, joined by Coach Mike Dunleavy, Malik
Morgan, and Cameron Reynolds. Again our format, we'll take an opening
statement for Coach, and we'll take questions for the student athletes after
which we'll dismiss the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, with that, your thoughts on the game, please and your season as a
whole.  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Well, first off, I was pleased all year long how hard our team
played, and tonight was no different. I thought they really battled. They gave
it their all. We had two seniors that played their last games for us, and they
did a great job and all throughout the whole year. But I felt like the last
six, seven games this season, our team really made the move that I was hoping
that they would make at the beginning of the year when we pointed towards
peaking towards the end of the season in the conference tournament.  
  
Then we had a night tonight where we didn't shoot the ball great. We missed
some shots that I think we can make, and we got behind. But like I said, our
guys played hard. We defended, I thought, really well. Made them miss shots,
and it was a real battle. We came back and took the lead in the second half,
you know, just didn't connect when we had a couple. They made a couple threes
midway at the end -- second half of that second half, and kind of got the
cushion that they needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes. We have a
microphone. Raise your hand, I'll throw the first one out -- go ahead.  
  
Q. For Cameron, Malik, could you reflect on the season in the way you
want to, for each year just to look back? What that meant to you?  
MALIK MORGAN: I felt like the season didn't go the way we planned as far as
wins and losses, but I definitely thought we gained a lot of knowledge through
Coach Dunleavy and his system. And being able to play these last six games the
way we played, I think it will leave momentum next year for the guys
returning.  
  
CAMERON REYNOLDS: Also the same. I think we picked up a lot of knowledge and
we learned a lot about the game outside of just scoring, and more inside of
the tunes of defense and talking to each other and schemes. And I think that
we all grew with that knowledge, and I think that's going to benefit us next
year, so we're going to come back strong.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thank you for your
time, gentlemen. Dismiss you to your locker room.  
  
Coach, I'll throw a question out for you as well. This is a team you faced
four days ago with a different result. Is there any difference between the
team you saw, both from your team and the opponent, then until today.  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: You know, they -- they're a tough group. Obviously, they lead
our league in free-throw percentage. That's where I thought they had a chance
to win the game tonight. The first half, they had a good -- they did a good
job making free throws, and they have guys who can stretch the floor. They got
some good looks.  
  
But I thought, defensively, I would have been happy at the end of the game if
you told me, they're going to shoot 38% for the game and 6 for 19 from the
three-point line, I would have thought we had a chance. We had a lot of good
looks that we didn't make, and, you know, like I said, we came back, played
hard, which has been the trait of the team all year long.  
  
Defensively, we worked at it. Unfortunately, that first half, we had so many
big guys getting in foul trouble. Sitting on the sidelines, I was just trying
to figure a way to get through that half. Then we did, but then Ryan Smith,
who has been a real solid player for us all year long, picked up quick fouls
again in that second half. And I'm disappointed for him as a senior that he
really didn't get a chance to play his last game the way he would have liked
to, but, like I said earlier on, the year for me was really positive. I really
enjoyed it.  
  
I think our guys worked extremely hard, and they improved as a group, and, you
know, happy that individually, Cam Reynolds worked hard, was the most improved
player in our league. I think Malik Morgan improved a lot as we went along for
the year. His last six, seven games, I think he averaged 13 point, 8 rebounds,
and close to 5 assists a game. We had guys making, you know, upward moves and
their ability was starting to show out for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You answered my next question, reflecting on your first year
back at the college game. Anything you would like to add what it was like for
you to be in college and on campus?  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Yeah. I -- it really turned out to be what I hoped it would be.
I love to teach. I got a chance to get on the floor. I spent a lot of time
with our guys and really felt like they improved a lot, and, you know, now
I've got to get out and hit the recruiting trail and start making that happen
as well for us. And I think our team is going to be one that's going to get
better over the next couple of years, and hopefully we can win an AAC
Championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Thanks so much, Coach.  
  
MIKE DUNLEAVY: Thank you.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Murry Bartow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32908)

### [Michael Bibby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32909)

### [Geno Thorpe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32910)

  
_Hartford, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 77, USF - 66  
  
MURRY BARTOW: I want to say congratulations to UConn. Kevin does a great job
with their team. I thought we defended hard. I thought we rebounded hard. I
thought our guys really competed. When you look at the first two games, we
lost by 21 at home. We got blown out in Storrs, and tonight the game went
right to the wire. We defended hard. We rebounded hard. You know, we made two
more baskets than they did, so it really came down to fouling and free throws,
and that's where the game was really won. But very proud of my team. Great
effort, just really proud of my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please?  
  
Q. Geno, you hit that three-pointer and it's down to two points, then of
course of the foul, and you're out of the game for the final three minutes.
Can you talk about what was going through your mind when that whistle blew and
did you think that that might have been the key play of the game?  
GENO THORPE: Well, during the play, I was trying to be aggressive, trying to
get to the basket and penetrate, try to find a teammate or find a shot for
myself. The foul was called and I didn't think it was an offensive foul, but
it was the ref's decision and that's what it was.  
  
A. Geno, can you talk about this team's effort. Obviously you did not have the
season you guys wanted to. You could have mailed it within the first game of
this tournament. You were within two of a team that beat you by a lot. Can you
talk about the team's effort tonight?  
  
GENO THORPE: I'm really glad about our effort tonight. We come to practice
every day, we work hard. We stay after practice and put up shots. Our hard
work was paying off. Like Coach said, we rebounded the ball pretty good. We
controlled the pace of the game really good. It was unfortunate the way the
ending happened, but like Coach said, I'm proud of our guys.  
  
Q. Michael, can we ask the same questions of you, your thoughts on the
team's progress through the year and battling back against a team that had a
pretty good performance the first two times out.  
MICHAEL BIBBY: Can you repeat that?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sure. Your thoughts on this game today. A one-possession game
down to the final minute against a squad that had good success against you the
first couple times out?  
  
MICHAEL BIBBY: Like Geno said, I thought we competed to the very end of the
game. Coach Bartow, Coach Strick and Coach Serg came up with a great game plan
and executed most of the game. They're good players. They are UConn; they're
going to score. They came up with a great scheme to try to stop them and slow
them down. I mean, it came down to the wire. Like Geno said, I'm very proud of
how we fought.  
  
Q. Geno, obviously you guys wanted to win tonight.  
GENO THORPE: Yeah.  
  
Q. You have no seniors on this team. Could you talk about the future and
putting this behind you guys and hitting the reset button at this point?  
GENO THORPE: We want to continue to work hard. Try to evaluate ourselves, do a
self-assessment on ourselves, and see what we can improve on and things we can
get better at. So the following year we can come back stronger and better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes to the locker room and I'll
take questions for Coach Bartow.  
  
MURRY BARTOW: You guys done?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
Q. Coach, can you address that as well? Obviously, you've made it known
that you want this job permanently and want to be considered for it. But can
you talk about where you feel this team is right now? Did they make some
progress towards the end of the season, and do you feel that the future is
going in the right direction?  
MURRY BARTOW: I thought we fought through a lot of adversity. You've got to
give these players a lot of credit. I thought they had every opportunity over
the last four, five, six weeks just to quit. They faced a lot of things, a lot
of adversity behind the scenes, and I just give them a lot of credit, a lot of
praise. They continue to battle and fight and scrap and compete, practice
hard, good attitude. Good energy. You know, I've been part of a few bad teams
and a lot of times on a team that's losing, at some point, they'll quit.
They'll quit. Or in a single game, they'll quit.  
  
Man, these guys just -- I'm not sure why, but they really, really battled. So,
I think we've got a chance to be good in the future. But I'm really proud of
these guys. They made what -- we're so much -- we couldn't have played -- the
game we just played, we could not have done four, five, six weeks ago. And
UConn, again, blew us out by 40, three weeks ago, and we came in here tonight
and went toe-to-toe with them and competed hard, and I'm really proud of these
guys.  
  
I think we made unbelievable improvement. I think anybody that watched that
game, and saw our -- has seen our team really over the last week and a half --
we played Central Florida. We had a shot to beat them at the buzzer, or late
in the game, seven seconds to play. About a week ago, we played Temple well
and we played pretty well tonight. So in our last three games, it doesn't show
on the scoreboard, but we played pretty good basketball. Played pretty good
basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Bartow?  
  
Q. Do you think the pro-UConn crowd kind of fueled the underdog
mentality of your team? It wasn't what you considered a neutral court game? Do
you think that energy --  
MURRY BARTOW: No. I totally agree with that. I think players like to play in
front of a good crowd and the crowd did get energized. Obviously it was a very
pro UConn crowd. I think it did fuel our guys some and gave them some energy.
Again, when you're down, you're losing and losing and losing and down 13 in a
half, that can quickly go to 25. And next thing you know it's a one-possession
game, they're right there at the very end. So very proud of our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Coach, thank you.  
  
MURRY BARTOW: Okay. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [JeQuan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28596)

### [Justin Tillman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30597)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 70, VCU 63  
  
WILL WADE: Give Rhode Island credit. We fight, we're hard to kill, but we just
could never get over the hump. Gave up two big offensive rebounds in the
second half that really hurt us from cutting the lead even further.  
  
So obviously disappointed, but proud of the fight that we had. Proud of the
regular season that we've had, and you know, hasn't been easy. 26-8's pretty
good. We've got to, you know, get back and get ready to go to the Big Show and
see if we can make a little noise.  
  
But you know, give Rhode Island credit. They are very physical, they are very
long. Their two wings, Terrell, Terrell and Matthews have been phenomenal here
in the tournament, and you need your best players to play really well. And our
best guys have played well, and their best guys played really, really well
today. So give them a ton of credit.  
  
You know, we'll see where we end up and get back and getting to go.  
  
Q. For each of you guys, it was really rough the first, ten, 12 minutes.
Was there any lingering effects, heading to overtime last night, did you sense
you were a little flat coming out or was it just their interior defense was
that good?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: I'd say it was a miscommunication on defense. We wasn't doing
our normal bumps and communicating well enough, and they were getting some
open looks early and knocking down the three ball.  
  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: Same thing, just communication. That's it.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you forced just six turnovers on them. Does
that kind of backfire a little bit for your game plan to have them that
controlled in the halfcourt?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: Yeah, that starts with the guards, including me. We've got to do
a better job of guarding the ball and speeding them up. You know, they were
playing comfortable a lot today in the first half. I feel like the last ten
minutes when we realized that we were down and had to play catchup; that's
when we kind of started turning it up on defense and guarding the ball. But
it's going to take 40 minutes if we want to win championships.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it not being able to convert and finish at the
rim?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: I think it was really big. It was really frustrating. We just
couldn't finish.  
  
Q. Any nerves between now and 6 o'clock, or do you guys feel like
regardless of the outcome today, you're in pretty good shape and you made a
good case for yourselves.  
JeQUAN LEWIS: We're in good shape. We're just going to wait and see who we
got, where we go.  
  
Q. Similar question. How frustrating was it not being able to got all
those shots go down? Y'all had 23 offensive rebounds I think and 14 second-
chance points.  
WILL WADE: I mean, you know, it deflates you a little bit. It shouldn't, but
it's deflating when we miss so many right there around the rim.  
  
Like I say, give them credit. Iverson is long; Martin. We're usually doing
that to everybody else but they are the one team that's as long and as
physical as we are.  
  
I think that was a big deal, but they hit six threes in the first half, and we
gave them four uncontested threes. I think that was as big a deal as anything
is letting them get going. They are like us: They are a real streaky team
shooting the ball, and they shot the ball really well this weekend in
Pittsburgh.  
  
I think letting those guys get going from three, and our inability to just
convert around the rim really ultimately did us in.  
  
Q. What was the mind-set of not starting Justin Tillman in the second
half?  
WILL WADE: I thought Hamdy played really well, and he was drawing fouls,
because he's so physical down there. So I was trying to keep their bigs in
foul trouble to start the half, and we made it obviously a big point to throw
it inside to start the half.  
  
And so I was trying to get those guys in foul trouble where we could play it
out, maybe at a little bit, you know -- play it out against their backups with
maybe our starters.  
  
Q. The six turnovers in comparison to the 14 in the regular season what
did you see as the difference there?  
WILL WADE: I mean, you know, they have got good guards. I thought Dowtin did a
really good job tonight. He handled our pressure a lot better. He was a little
bit shaky when we played them at their place. I thought he did a good job
handling the pressure.  
  
And the couple times, I mean, we were just -- there's three or four steals we
had, we were just a step. We were just right there and couldn't really --
couldn't really grab them.  
  
Q. How bad did Matthews hurt you down the stretch? He had a killer three
late, right at the buzzer.  
WILL WADE: He made big plays. He's the guy they go to late in the game. They
have gone to him all year late in the game. Those two wings, him and Terrell,
are both big, physical guys, and they are able to rise up and can get their
shot off over us. So those guys are good players.  
  
Q. Anything like you can take away from this matchup that you can
translate to the NCAA Tournament, teams just as big as Rhode Island?  
WILL WADE: It's not just how big they are. It's the length -- I think they are
No. 2 in the country in block percentage, in the country, No. 2, right, in the
country, in block percentage. I don't know who is No. 1. I don't know if we'll
play them.  
  
They present some unique, you know, challenges for your team, and so it's not
just the ones that they block. There's so many shots that they affect at the
rim where your guards are fading away and you've got to finish. You've got to
have tough finishes.  
  
We're typically the team that's able to do that because we're usually long.
But that's been our issue both times we've matched up against them. If you
don't bury a bunch of threes, it's a tough, tough road to hoe.  
  
Q. First thing you mentioned when you were discussing Rhodey yesterday
was the rebounding and you lost that war by 17 last time and you got it this
time; was it more chalk it up to misses?  
WILL WADE: You get 23 offensive rebounds, looks good on a stat sheet. That's a
heck of a lot of misses, you know.  
  
So you know, it was -- our guys did a good job. We went hard to the glass. But
we just -- I mean, you've got to convert a few of them, too, but we didn't
convert nearly enough of them.  
  
Q. JeQuan mentioned miscommunication on defense. Is that why so many
guys were open on the threes early on?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, we weren't bumping right in the matchup. We weren't bumping
right. We didn't get our bumps right and that ended up leaving some guys --
leaving some guys open.  
  
But they had a good plan. They knew where our weak spot was in the zone and
they went right to it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Hassan Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32943)

### [E.C. Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28611)

### [Jared Terrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30558)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 70, VCU 63  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously grateful, thrilled with the win. You know, to be able to
-- just everything we were carrying into the game, all the talk about us,
which, you know, with the bubble and the preseason expectations and the
injuries that went on during the course of the year; to be able to kind of
keep ourselves, our heads above water until we got healthy, late, and to be
able to go on the run that we went on late in the year once we got healthy,
the resiliency we showed the whole year.  
  
And then to get to this point, and then to beat a team or a program like VCU,
one of the top college basketball programs in the country, irregardless of
conference, consistently an elite-level college basketball program coached by
one of the best young coaches in the country, some amazing players, VCU.  
  
When you play in the conference championship game and you beat VCU, you just
earned that trophy. We just earned that trophy, and that's because of the
special group of guys that I got to coach here; a resilient, tough, group of
winners.  
  
Q. For all three of you, Coach Hurley just kind of briefly mentioned
about being on the bubble all season. But for all three of you, how much does
that weigh on your minds like throughout the season and even coming into the
tournament?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: I think at the beginning, it got to us a little bit. We were
thinking about that rather than just going out there and playing basketball
and just winning games.  
  
But as the season progressed, we start worrying about that and start focusing
really on each other. We came here into the tournament on a roll. We took care
of business. Made history.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: Yeah, definitely was a little pressure earlier in the season,
but as the season went along, just forgot about it and just knew we had to win
games. We came here and how are focus was to win the Championship to get in
and we did it.  
  
JARED TERRELL: I think a lot of our focus towards the end of our season,
started focusing on each other and just blocked the outside noise out. We were
able to make plays for each other and do what we set out to do at the
beginning of the year.  
  
Q. For all the guys, was there any moment where you guys maybe doubted
yourselves during the season when you had some ups and downs?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: I mean, we have doubts, you know, we lose faith a little bit.
But I think it just made us stronger. I think without those lumps in the
season, we wouldn't be ready for what we just did, so nah.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: Yeah, we definitely lost a little hope with some games we lost.
But the way we bounced back to come out and win this championship today just
feels great.  
  
JARED TERRELL: For me, I just think it was just a little adversity we faced.
But it's nothing that we haven't seen. We were just able to bounce back and
respond how we always have, and to pull this out is just undescribable.  
  
Q. E.C. and Jared, you have just six turnovers against a team that
thrives on miscues. Just talk about the patience and the ability you had to
keep control of the ball.  
E.C. MATTHEWS: We knew they was going to pressure us in the full court. Coach
brought up a good game plan on how to handle that. We just had to be patient,
make moves and just attack it.  
  
JARED TERRELL: I think we just let the game come to us, and we didn't try to
do too much with the ball, dribbling. When we need to pass it, we passed it.
And when we needed to drive, we drove it and made plays for each other.  
  
Q. I heard you say you were a little afraid of heights as you were
heading up that ladder. Were you reluctant to go up there a little bit?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Thinking about it, I never did this before, so that's a good
and bad thing. But yeah, scared of heights.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, but for Hass specifically because you're going
to be graduating this year, did you guys talk about the bubble in the locker
room? Did you talk about the field? Did you talk about you guys potentially
being one of the last teams in and one of the first teams out, or was there
just a focus game by game by game to just win each game in front of you?  
HASSAN MARTIN: I wouldn't say we talked about it but it was definitely in the
back of our minds. Like I said, our focus was to come out and win it, so we
had no choice but to get to the Tournament and that's what we did. It was
definitely in the back of my mind, and I know it was in the back of their
mind, too. But we really just didn't want to say much add pressure to us, so
we just went out and played our butts off.  
  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Today, this morning, we watched -- Coach made us watch a video,
"The One Shining Moment," and besides that, that was probably the only time we
actually talked about the bubble and everything.  
  
Q. They were just in here saying that you guys do what they do to them,
what they usually do to other teams. What is it about your style of play that
you think allows you to be successful against a team like VCU?  
JARED TERRELL: Just coming into the game, Coach just wanted us to play tough
and just strong, because that's exactly what they do. They are scrappy. They
claw, fight, scrap, do whatever they have got to do to pull the win out. I
think we did a good job of handling it, rebounding, getting loose balls out on
the floor, just making all the tough plays; as well as our defense being on
point and being able to make shots. It just all added up.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: Like he said, they are really scrappy and they like to bully
teams. Our mind-set was to come out and try to beat the bullies today, and
that's what we did.  
  
Q. Do you feel like with the year that you guys had last year with you
being out the entire season, and you had your fair share of injuries last
season, but do you feel like this moment, cutting down the nets and
everything, do you feel like this is maybe a year too late to be here?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: God don't make mistakes, man. That's all I've got to say.  
  
JARED TERRELL: Everything panned out how it's supposed to. It just made us
stronger and it made us more together, and it just worked out how it was
supposed to.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: I just think it made us be able to handle any type of situation
that losing two of the best players last year and coming back strong this
year, we were ready for anything that we faced this year, and that's why we
won the Championship.  
  
Q. Jared's steal late in the game, how big a play was that?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, listen, Will is a great coach. Our league is filled with
great tacticians. It's not a -- some leagues are filled with tremendous, you
know, recruiters. The Atlantic 10 is filled with some tremendous tacticians:
Will, Archie, across the board, some great coaches.  
  
These games, get won by players making winning plays, coming over and getting
a big deflection or making a big steal. You know, finishing or scoring in the
last eight minutes of the game, having closers. It was kind of like, a little
bit like the Davidson game. It was such a critical moment. VCU was surging and
then that steal there just got the momentum back and just gave us a lot of
confidence.  
  
And that's where these games are won. These games are won by players, and you
hope you're able to recruit, nurture and develop guys to become winners that
make winning plays.  
  
Q. The six turnovers, was there a tactical adjustment to that or was
that the guys making plays?  
DAN HURLEY: You know what, we went to school. We went back, when we played VCU
the first time, we didn't see a lot of that pressure and we didn't have a lot
of time to prepare for it. You know, we looked a little bit at some earlier
season games, people that had success when they pressed more.  
  
So what we tried to do is take a little bit more of like a one-three-one
approach against it. So we had three guards that could handle it and we tried
to put Kuran Iverson as much as we could in the middle as a big target, and we
just tried to big space him out and avoid trapping situations. But for the
most part this year, we have been a team hasn't turned the ball over a lot.
Yeah, we've had some moments where we've had some bad games, but consistently,
we've been pretty good with the ball.  
  
Q. What's the significance of this win for the Rhode Island program? Is
this a program-changer for you guys?  
DAN HURLEY: I think it is. I think URI has a lot of potential. We've got some
real great tradition going back to the 80s and 90s, and you know, it's a great
basketball state with us and Providence and Bryant and Brown. We've got an
amazing arena, and I think we needed a win like this. We needed a bid to kind
of set our fan base on fire and take things to the next level in terms of
everything: You know, commitment, getting donors excited.  
  
It's huge for a place like ours that has the potential to compete with the
VCUs and Dayton every year because of some of the things we do have in place.  
  
Q. I'm sure you knew that we were going to make a run at some point;
when Kuran and has soon get into foul trouble there, what's it like during
those minutes just trying to weather that Storm with those guys sitting on the
bench?  
DAN HURLEY: It obviously wasn't ideal, because those two guys are tremendous,
tremendous players. They anchor one of the best defensive teams in the
country.  
  
But we're deep. I mean, we're not a team; we're a program. This is who we are
now. Seniors will graduate and the next guy is going to step up. We hope to
just continue at the top of the conference. You see a guy like Cyril Langevine
as a freshman, Jeff Downtin as a freshman, 24 and 27 minutes in a game of that
magnitude with what was on the line; it just speaks to the strength of the
program in terms of the players.  
  
Q. Both times you played VCU, you were able to contend Alie-Cox to only
a couple points. Was that the plan going in both times? Was that the plan to
contend him?  
DAN HURLEY: For us, it was three guys that we focused on defensively here. You
know, Jon Williams and JeQuan were the two guards that we wanted to put most
of our focus on. Especially Jon Williams, man. Jon Williams, he's a game
changer. When he comes in off the bench, he changes things the way he attacks
the rim.  
  
And then Mo Alie, he's been a dominator in this league for years, and you
know, we're fortunate that we have the front court to stand up to a guy of his
pour and dominance.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that this is who you can be when you're healthy.
How much did being in sort of a desperate spot late in the season contribute,
as well?  
DAN HURLEY: I don't think it had anything to do with it. People -- we got off
to a good start this year beating Cincinnati. Obviously we lost that game to
Duke, and then beat Belmont, and then lost those tough back-to-back games at
Valpo and Providence. And then listen, we got hurt. You see what injuries do
to teams across college basketball. It's not an excuse. It's reality.  
  
Just the way we've played the last, you know, six weeks or however many games,
has just everything to do with has soon Martin finally being healthy and then
Jarvis Garrett, at least getting to the point where we could play him 15, 20
minutes a game, which gave us another quick creator and the change of pace
back, kind of at the point guard position.  
  
We just got healthier. Our focus was great. We played hard the whole year. We
got crushed after the Fordham loss. We just were inept offensively. We played
hard as heck that game. They shot like 34 percent from the field and scored 52
points. We were just in a funk after we let Dayton off the hook late in that
game.  
  
Q. Similar question. If you had been healthy all year, is this the team
you would have expected to see?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, I mean, you know, the whole what if thing; we could have
played that game last year, too. E.C. is a special talent. Hassan Martin, if
he was healthy the whole year, I think him and T.J. Cline, would have been a
heck of a race for Player of the Year, with Jaylen Adams and a couple of the
other great players in this conference.  
  
You know, so I just think we got so much resiliency from what we went through
last year, what we went through at different parts of this year; and I just
think that that came to the forefront late in the year when we got healthy.  
  
And then when we got to Pittsburgh, we were loose, but man, we were locked in.
These guys, every video, every practice, these guys carried themselves like
pros. They weren't going to leave here without that trophy.  
  
Q. In the three games, you only trailed for 43 seconds total. Didn't
trail today, at all. You just said your guys were obviously locked in. What
was it like to play from in front the whole time? How much more comforting was
that for your guys?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, it's a lot easier -- some of those road losses, you know,
like PC, Valpo, Houston when we played without Hassan, we were down in those
games late; down five with 50 seconds to go, and it's a much more stressful
situation. You obviously played -- we played with a lot of confidence here
because we were able to jump on people. We were able to jump on teams early.  
  
We showed -- a guy like E.C., before we got out here, I texted him late,
probably about two o'clock in the morning after that Davidson comeback before
we got out here. It's like when he drove and dunked that ball, something
changed for him. In this tournament, he's locked like that guy that NBA people
love, scoring at a pretty high clip while only taking ten, 11 shots.  
  
I think you win when you have guys playing at a first-team all-conference
level or at a Player of the Year level; and in this tournament, we've had guys
play like first-teamers and Player of the Year types.  
  
Q. Just playing with the intensity that you guys have right now, you
talk about competing with the Dayton and the VCUs, but do you feel like this
is a team right now that can pull one of those runs off, Elite 8, Final
Four?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, listen, obviously you hope to get matchups. The NCAA
Tournament probably has a lot to do with match-ups. It will be the first
tournament I'll coach in, or first NCAA Tournament I'll coach in. I think
we're built to compete.  
  
We are an elite defensive team, and we have the type of wing players in Jared
and E.C. that have the ability to carry us for different points. We have
inside strength. We have shot blocking. We have depth. We play as hard as any
team in the country. I think we're well prepared.  
  
You know, and I think we've just developed a culture that we will -- we will
be ready when we play Thursday or Friday.  
  
Q. Obviously this will be a place that will be special for you because
it's where you won the A-10 tournament, but just your thoughts as Pittsburgh
as a venue?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, there's a couple things. My best friend and -- I've got my
father and my brother, my coaching tree -- I didn't work for a college coach,
so my coaching tree is my father and my brother. And then there were a couple
interesting things here.  
  
When I was at Wagner, we came and beat Pitt here. That win, when they were in
the Top 15 or Top-12 in the country when I was at Wagner, we beat them here
and that kind of launched my career, my brother's career.  
  
And then we stayed in the same hotel that we stayed in when we beat those guys
when I was at Wagner, and then my room number here was 1115. My brother wore
11 in college, and I was 15 in college. Obviously a lot more people know his
number than mine.  
  
But there was some omens, and I just, you know, I felt really good coming in
about how we were playing. You know, I don't want to leave Pittsburgh. I love
it here.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Mo Alie-Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28628)

### [JeQuan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28596)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
VCU 87, Richmond 77  
  
WILL WADE: Well, just another great game between VCU and Richmond. Thought the
last eight minutes of regulation, really last six minutes of regulation,
overtime, we post well in the paint. We out rebounded them by 16 and scored 56
points in the paint. That's our formula. I felt really good when it got to
over time with Cline having four fouls, we knew there would not be a whole lot
of resistance down there. Just made some plays when we needed to, so we were
fortunate and made some plays and we'll take it. On to tomorrow.  
  
Q. The three-point in overtime -- what was the play call?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: Coach drew the play in the time-out. We actually run it a lot.
But we just executed a little different, and I shot it.  
  
Q. JeQuan, did you feel like you needed to get that shot off quickly,
and Samir I thought played very well today, and sort of held you guys in the
game for awhile. Could you talk about how he played?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: Yeah, I had shooting in my mind before the play even started. I
wanted to put that on my shoulders and my teammates, I felt like my teammates
wanted me to, as well, and as for Samir, he's a great player, he's a great
scorer. We're going to need that from him. He's able to do that -- he's
capable of doing that every game, if he just comes out, play his game. He's a
great driver, getting to the rim and finishing. He's great at rebounding his
own misses. He's scrappy, you know, and if Samir keep playing like, we're
going to do good things.  
  
Q. Mo, yesterday against George Mason, you weren't able to score, but
first half today, you had eight points. Was the game plan going in to get you
started early?  
MO ALIE-COX: That's always the game plan. Against Mason, I saw a lot of double
team. I just affected the game different ways: I had four assists, a couple
turnovers, but I just try to spray it out quick.  
  
Today they didn't really double team me. So I knew I had one-on-one on the
inside. Once I take my first shot, I'm probably feeling it, so I just kept
going to the basket every time I got the ball and I had success today.  
  
Q. Mo, looked like when Cline was in foul trouble and out of the game,
y'all were still having a hard time scoring in time and looked like it got a
little frustrating at times. What changed that allowed y'all to start getting
engaged in there? And two, you had to guard Jones on the last shot. Talk about
that switch a little bit.  
MO ALIE-COX: Well, for the first question, we were getting good looks. I got
to the front of the rim twice. I just faded away a little bit on it so I just
came out real quick. Hamdy came in, gave us a big boost and scored six
straight and got a big rebound and I just came back and finished it off.  
  
The last shot, that's a situation we worked on for the past two weeks in
practice on-switching out, Cline is at the screen, and I knew I had one-on-
one. And I'm very confident in my foot speed and lateral movement to stay in
front of the guards. I just tried to make it as difficult as possible and he
couldn't get over me.  
  
Q. How big was it to have the crowd involved as much as they were?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: It's big time. We love Ram Nation. They love us, too. Their
energy gives us a little energy when we're tired. We press a lot, and when we
feel down, we look up to them, they are on their feet and they are cheering a
lot, and we feed off that and we appreciate it.  
  
Q. Other than Melvin and a couple other former players, this will be
your fourth straight appearance in the A-10 championship game. Getting to the
championship game over the past four years, was this one tougher than previous
games, or is it just business as usual?  
MO ALIE-COX: You mean, to get there? This game kind of felt like the Richmond
game that we -- the year we won it. It was just a similar game just like this,
came down to the wire. It was a similar paths, but we just tried to take it
one game at a time. You know, every game is different, so we just try it come
out and do what we do, and hopefully we'll end up with a good result.  
  
JeQUAN LEWIS: Yeah, I'm with him. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You guys just played at Rhode Island. Rhode Island seems to be
playing pretty well right now. What are your thoughts on what the game will be
like tomorrow?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: I feel like it is going to be fun. It's going to be up and down.
It's going to be physical. They have really good guards. We have really good
guards and they have good posts and we have good posts. Should be a fun game.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: It's just going to be a physical game. They play gritty. We play
gritty. They out-toughed us the first time we played them. We've just got to
match their physicality and keep them off the glass because they got the best
of us the last time we played them. I think if we do well on the glass, it
should be a good game.  
  
Q. Samir makes that baseline drive in the end, you're down six and he
goes baseline for that, and when you turn, you gestured to the bench. What was
the significance of that?  
WILL WADE: I was gesturing because we have to drive the ball and get it in the
paint, and we kept shooting all these mid-range jumpshots. We probably shot
more mid-range jumpshots today than we've shot in the last month. We kept
shooting all these terrible shots and I just -- if we just drive the ball in
the paint, they will foul you or you will get a layup.  
  
We scored 56 points in the paint. All you have to do is drive it in there. So
that's one reason Samir was really successful today. He just put his head down
and drove the ball in there. Johnny was really good for us, too, because he
could get pieces of the paint and drive it in there.  
  
So I was just explaining -- well, gesturing, explaining, however you want to
-- I mean, get the ball inside. Whether it's off the -- we talk about feeding
the post a lot, but you can drive it in there, too. I mean, Samir is good
driving that thing in there.  
  
Q. You talked about it a little bit earlier today about Cline getting
into foul trouble with a little under six minutes left. Was that the turning
point of the game? Is that where the momentum really shifts?  
WILL WADE: They are a different team when they are in foul trouble, no doubt
about it. Their whole offense runs through him. He's a point-center. Their
whole offense runs through him. You know, no knock on their other guys, but it
was a pretty significant drop off when you go from the Player of the Year in
the league to some of their other guys.  
  
But Coach Mooney did a good job managing again. He went really small on
offense and we had to adjust a little bit and we had to play small, and then
he took advantage of some of our mismatches. He posted Buckingham and Sherod
-- he posted Buckingham twice and Sherod once on some of our smaller guys
because we had to have our other big guy who was in the game locked up on
somebody else on a shooter.  
  
It was a little bit of a back and forth with all that. It was critical when he
got in foul trouble.  
  
Q. How big was Samir and Hamdy?  
WILL WADE: They were both great. I mean, they both do their work in the paint.
So when we need to get the ball in the paint, we need to play paint ball, you
get that ball in there to those guys and let them go to work, and they are
phenomenal.  
  
And the other big point was we quit turning the ball over. We had 11 turnovers
with I think seven and a half, eight minutes left; we only had two turnovers
in the last eight minutes and overtime. So all we have to do, with the way we
offensive rebound the ball and the way we play, if we just get the thing on
the backboard, we are pretty good and we finally just got the ball in the
paint and got the ball on the backboard. Oh, wow, I didn't realize Johnny had
seven assists. That was good.  
  
Q. You mentioned Samir would drive in there. He's an aggressive player
and he's also a three-point shooter. Does he just instinctively drive the ball
in there or did you have to tell him?  
WILL WADE: No, he's a driver more than a shooter. He'll tell you that. He got
mad at me when I was making him shoot all these shots all off-season. He said,
"I'm not a shooter, you're not going to make me into a shooter."  
  
I said, "Well, you've going to have to shoot because you're not going to be
able to drive. This isn't high school basketball. People will play way off of
you." His instincts are to drive it. I almost have to yell at him to shoot it
when we want him to shoot. I thought the corner three to tie it was a big one,
as well. He played at a high level for us.  
  
It's good we are getting some contributions. Yesterday Derry (ph) really
helped us and today Samir helped us, and you're going to need that as we go
down the stretch here.  
  
Q. Seemed to me like Samir not just helped you, sort of kept you in the
game?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, he went on a 6-0 run by himself when we got down six. Samir
made many huge contributions for us. Really efficient game for him today.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the biggest category is that you have to work
on for tomorrow's game?  
WILL WADE: They just punked us in Rhode Island now. They just absolutely
punked us. They had our offense pushed out to halfcourt. They just obliterated
us on the glass. I've forgotten what the final numbers were. It was ugly. It
was bad. It was at least 12, 15 on the glass and we just got a Nile lighted.
And we weren't strong in the paint. We didn't finish well in the paint. We
gave ourselves a chance to win. We were the under four media -- we fouled them
when we were down two and we tried to run through a pass and we fouled them.
They hit the free throws and it was over from there. We gave ourselves a
chance to win. We just didn't do enough. We've got to do a really good job on
the glass. We have to do a really good job finishing in the paint. They are
the one team in the league that is, you know, as or more physical than we are
and as big and strong as we are down low, and that's the one team in the
league, it's mono-a-mono tomorrow. I know JeQuan said the game is going to be
up-and-down. I doubt that. It's going to be a tractor pull. It's going to be
low-scoring and it's going to be a grind-it-out type of deal. It's on us, and
so we'll need to be ready. They play a ton of zone.  
  
We got a little discombobulated there in the first half at Rhode Island, but
we will be ready. We'll go back and rest and prepare as best we can. This
tournament, all the teams we've played, we've played them recently. We played
George Mason last game of the regular season, and played Rhode Island their to
last game of the regular season. And Richmond we're familiar; we played them
twice this year. So it has made it a little bit easier.  
  
Q. How big is depth coming into this tournament? Do you feel like they
are as deep as your deep?  
WILL WADE: Oh, they are deep. They are bringing the kid, Christion Thompson,
and Leviton (ph), he's a man down there. He's a freshman. Akele, they played
him a lot more. They didn't play him when we played him the first time but
they played him a lot more today. They are deep and good.  
  
I'll say this, if I'm going to rant -- not going to get you into all my
numbers but they are an NCAA Tournament team whether or not they win or lose
tomorrow, I'm telling you, and they can beat somebody when they get there. So
they need to be in win, lose or draw tomorrow. They are big, they are
physical. When you get to the tournament, when you get to the Tournament, this
is why Rhode Island could win games in the Tournament. You get to the
Tournament, the biggest difference between the so-called power five and the
so-called Atlantic 10 is the big guys. You've got to have good bigs. You've
got to have good bigs and we have got good bigs, and they have got good bigs,
and that's why they can win when they get there. You're physical and you've
got good big guys and you can block shots and affect things around the rim,
you're pretty good. You're pretty good and that's why when Rhode Island gets
in, they can make a run.  
  
Q. VCU has a tournament title appearance streak that predates the move
to the Atlantic 10. What does it say about VCU as a program where they can go
from a CAA where they are consistently --  
WILL WADE: This is their fourth straight won in the Atlantic 10, fifth
overall. They have been in the Atlantic 10 five years -- how many is this
overall, five in a row? Seven in a row in the championship game? Wow.  
  
Well, pretty good. We're consistent. We're consistent. You know, I do want to
say this. I told our players this. But we appreciate all our fans coming. I
told our guys this morning. I said, guys, I said we've got blue collar hard-
working folks. These people sacrificed a lot to come here and watch us play.
There's people that don't take summer vacations to come here and watch us play
in the conference tournament. And so we owe it to them. There's nothing more
they would like than to sweep Richmond, I know that. I know that. It's good,
good for everybody in town. Food tastes a little better.  
  
So I told them, I said, we owe it to these guys to give them all-out effort.
There are people that have sacrificed to come here and help us, and it helped
us. It's like a home game in there. It's like a home game in there. You have
3,000 or 4,000 of your own people there, and I'm sure we'll have even more
tomorrow. But those people sacrificed to come here and watch us play. The
least we can do is lay it on the line for them and show them how much we
appreciate them and care about winning and getting it back to the
championship.  
  
We're happy to be in it. This is our fifth time in the Atlantic 10, as you
told me. We only won it once, so it would be nice to cut the Nets down again.  
  
Q. It was such an emotional game, especially down the stretch there.
What did you say to start the overtime, to not let a letdown happen?  
WILL WADE: I felt good ones it gets to over time. The team who forces over
time wins 72 percent of the time. So I felt good when I got to over time. I
liked our chances. I liked our chances in overtime because of their foul
trouble, and you know, quite frankly, that three just kind of -- you could see
it. You could see it. You knew they were going to have to hit a crazy shot in
regulation to beat us, and they didn't hit a circus shot in regulation, I felt
good. Mo didn't score the other day -- Mo helps us so much defensively. How
many other five men can you switch on to a guard who is, what was he, second-
team, all league, guard, Jones, something like that? All-league guard and just
bottled up, shoot a fadeaway, 18-foot contested jumpshot over somebody like
that -- he's a freak of nature. That's why he's going to play in the NFL or
wherever he wants to play.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Nick Sherod](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32992)

### [De'Monte Buckingham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32993)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
VCU 87, Richmond 77  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Really proud of my guys and how hard and well we played.
Couldn't be more proud.  
  
Q. You're freshmen. You had excellent games today. Did you enjoy the big
stage? And Nick, you were in the low post at times and you were posting people
up. You made the three to give you guys a three-point lead there at the end.
Just go through, if you could go through your feelings on the entire game.  
NICK SHEROD: Obviously it's a big stage. Biggest stage we ever played on. It
would have been a lot better if we would have came out on top. Being in the
post, it's just what Coach wants me to do. Whatever helps the team win, that's
what I'm doing to do. We did that a little bit this year and I was pretty
comfortable down there.  
  
DE'MONTE BUCKINGHAM: Yeah, same, what he said. I just feel like we played a
great game today. I feel like we battled so much. We gave it our all and left
it on the floor. Surprised we didn't come out with the win.  
  
I'm so proud of like my teammates and how we battled today and just did what
we had to do and what Coach was tell us to do. But it's all good. We just
going to keep working hard and keep pushing each other to the sky.  
  
Q. You both have interesting connections to VCU with family members.
What does this rivalry mean to you guys?  
NICK SHEROD: We both grew up in connections. We have family in Richmond. This
rivalry means a lot to us. We know about the emotion and we know about the
passion and the intensity of the rivalry.  
  
So honestly it's an honor to be able to put on a Richmond jersey and play in a
rivalry game like this. Obviously it's tough being in this position, but not
many freshmen get this opportunity to play for your hometown team in a rivalry
like this. I'm pleased that Coach gave me the opportunity to play here.  
  
DE'MONTE BUCKINGHAM: Yeah, same. I'm blessed that Coach Mooney gave us the
opportunity to come here and play right away and just have that trust in us.
We have so much love for our coach. He just believes in us every moment of the
game. Just tells us, just go get it and play with your heart and play with
your all and we just try to give him that heart and show him that we have that
love for him and just play each and every day and try to go hard for him each
and every time.  
  
Q. I just wondered if you guys could talk about playing a year under
T.J. Cline. He's almost like a coach out there on the court. Just how big,
having him there with you a year, will be torward your future development.  
DE'MONTE BUCKINGHAM: I would say playing with T.J., it's incredible. He knows
what to do on the floor. He knows what to say all the time. I feel like down
the road he would be an outstanding coach because he's always talking, just
telling us, go right here, go right there. I feel like he's always dialed in.
I feel like T.J.'s career is going to be incredible when it's all said and
done.  
  
NICK SHEROD: For him, it's more the stuff people don't see, off-the-court
stuff. Him inviting us over to his apartment, checking up on us, that kind of
stuff; that you can't quantify how much that means to us.  
  
So I mean, I feel -- I couldn't feel worse that we weren't able to get this
done for him and ShawnDre' and the other seniors. He'll never know how big of
an impact he's had on us.  
  
Q. It's not unusual after a game like this when the season ends that
seniors are brought out to address the media. You guys both are freshmen. Do
you feel like you guys are the leaders of the program as you go forward now
and where do you see the program going?  
DE'MONTE BUCKINGHAM: I wouldn't say me and him are the leaders of the program.
I feel like it's the whole team down the line from the coaches all the way to
the strength coaches and managers and all that. I feel like we all got to be
on the same page and I feel like we've all been on the same page and I feel
like down the road, we'll be fine. Just keep doing what we're doing and keep
having that heart and intensity in each and every practice to just be strong
and play hard all the time.  
  
NICK SHEROD: Yeah, we just try to step in and help our team win. I think that
one of the big things that was stressed to us when we came in was they didn't
want to have a season like they had last year.  
  
So just come in, working hard every day and doing the things it takes to help
win, I think that -- I wouldn't say we are leaders, but just we try to set an
example and try to do what we can do push this program forward.  
  
Q. With about six minutes left in the game, T.J. Cline got into a little
foul trouble, and ended up getting his fourth foul. Do you think that was the
turning point of the game?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Not really. He had foul trouble the whole game. He got a second
one really early in the first half. So I think getting his fourth there, I
don't think that was a turning point. I thought we played really well without
him. That's something that's been hard for us this year.  
  
But I thought Kwesi really gave us a lift tonight and then when we went really
small, I thought we were able to be effective. I don't necessarily think that
was the turning point. I think, you know, T.J. didn't have his best game. But
we need him on the floor, so not having him is always negative, but I thought
we responded to that pretty well.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what your seniors have meant to you, and what
these two guys mean to you now?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, well, the seniors have been incredible. I think you
probably can tell by watching them play how much they have put into it, how
much they care, how hard they play. They have been great to me personally,
great to our program, and I deeply care about them and wish we could have --
wish we could have been playing tomorrow.  
  
And then I think the freshmen we have, and I'll include Grant in that; this is
a great class for a number of reasons. I mean, the fact that De'Monte and Nick
are from Richmond, I think it's like our seventh and eighth local player that
we recruited. Those three guys are going to form a great class for years to
come.  
  
Q. You seem to churn out good scorers and guards since you've been at
Richmond. Where do you think these guys are in terms of how far along are they
compared to some previous greats you've had as freshman?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I would say that they are a little bit different in terms
-- they were more physically ready to come to college or to play in college
basketball as freshmen. They are both strong and they are both extremely
competitive.  
  
So we've really had some really good freshmen and some good guards. I think
these guys, because they are bigger and stronger, they might be a little more
versatile and I would tell you this: Those guys really, really work hard.
There's not a day goes by that they are not getting in the gym extra and
putting more and more effort into it. I think they have special careers ahead
of them.  
  
Q. You're reading my mind here, Coach. Their versatility, Nick was on
the perimeter today, or Nick was in the low post. De'Monte, I think you've
talked about perhaps he could even be a point guard before this thing ends.
What is it about them that enables them to do so many different things? And
they are not huge guys.  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, first I think they have a tremendous feel for the game,
and you know, just great instincts for basketball. So that enables them to
play different parts on the floor. And then I think they have the skill set to
match. They both can do everything we need: Dribble, pass and shoot, they are
competitive and they defend. I think their versatility comes from those two
things.  
  
Hopefully as they grow, we can really take advantage of their versatility even
more, because I think that's pretty special for them and I think that's
something that can benefit them personally and ourselves as a program.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Jack Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28594)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 84, Davidson 60  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Congratulations to Dan Hurley and his Rhode Island team. They
knocked us to the mat very early. They played a terrific basketball game. Even
though we got knocked to the mat, our guys didn't stay down. We got knocked to
the ropes. We didn't stay on the ropes. We kept coming back and kept fighting
and fighting.  
  
And I will treasure a lot of memories from this particular year, and one of
the most poignant will be the way this team kept fighting back no matter how
much they have been hit and no matter how many times they got knocked down.  
  
It was an incredible honor to coach these two guys on my right. I wouldn't
trade them for anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Coach Hurley talked about the game plan coming in for you
specifically, trying to funnel you to the rim and take advantage of the fact
that you would be playing your third game in three days. How did you feel
physically and did you sense that that was what they were trying to do as far
as their game plan for you?  
JACK GIBBS: It's the end of the season. Everybody has had their bumps and
bruises, and the season takes it toll on you, but you can't make us excuses
for that. They had a great game plan and like Coach said, they hit us early.
We fought back, but they are a good team and wish them the best of luck
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What about their team defense? Coach McKillop talked the other day
about them and Dayton being among the best man-to-man teams around. What about
just their collective effort defensively?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I think they did a good job of forcing us to play outside the
paint, just to force everything up above free throw line extended. They really
tried to make things difficult for us to get into the flow of our offense, and
I think that disrupted us a little bit.  
  
Q. Jack, I know the postseason, still you guys might have more games to
play, but are you able at this point in time to kind of look back on your
career, or is it more kind of short-term memory at this point?  
JACK GIBBS: The last four years here have been the best part of my life, and I
wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. The fans that came today, the
fans back home, the school, just the community as a whole, is something that's
real special, and you don't find it in a lot of places in this country.  
  
I mean, I'm proud of the decision I made to come here, and I know that I may
not ever wear Davidson on my chest again, but it will be in my heart forever
(tearing up).  
  
Q. As far as Jack's performance, it seemed like he kept trying to go
against what they were doing, and the effort didn't really stop --  
BOB McKILLOP: Sorry, I can't hear you.  
  
Q. Did you think Jack, if you kept trying to push against what they were
doing and have success, but it wasn't really coming, did you think he was
going to break through at any point as far as his individual performance?  
BOB McKILLOP: I don't understand what you're asking.  
  
Q. Given what they were doing to him defensively, I guess what did you
think of how he did against what they were trying to do.  
BOB McKILLOP: Okay. I got it. It's something he's faced all year long, and
clearly three games in three days, makes it even more difficult to respond
with the kind of magnificent sense that has been such a part of his career.  
  
You know, we weren't even sure he was going to play in the tournament after
the game on Saturday, last Saturday against Rhode Island. And he'll never make
an excuse, but you walk outside the media room, and there's his mom in a
wheelchair battling cancer.  
  
This guy's got a lot of his emotion drained from the success, but the
adversity that he's faced health-wise, family-wise, throughout this season and
last. For him to even respond to get out on the court and fight like he did,
he played 36 minutes, had 17 points; that's a model of excellence right there.  
  
Q. Entering the tournament, why was it in doubt that he might not
play?  
BOB McKILLOP: He has a meniscus problem in his knee that was exacerbated what
happened on a couple of collisions and a couple of falls in the Rhode Island
game on Saturday.  
  
Q. You had it down to ten the second half, and hit that wall for about
nine minutes between the field goals, and they had the quick spurt; what did
you see in that?  
BOB McKILLOP: It's remarkable when you look at the final score and you look at
the way they just pummeled us; you're right on the money there. It was at ten,
and when we needed that stop, when we needed that made basket, when we needed
even that made foul shot, we didn't get it. There was one point where the ball
just bounced out of our hands right into them, and they got the rebound and
put it back in. That's pretty tough to overcome a double-digit deficit. And
Rhode Island, a, shot the daylights out of it; and b, defended the heck out of
us.  
  
As Payton and Jack alluded to, we tried to get deflation, we tried to get the
ball penetrating the foul line, but we had a difficult time doing that.  
  
Q. Jack moved into third on the career list today. Where does he belong
in your mind as far as Davidson basketball history?  
BOB McKILLOP: Well, there's no doubt he'll be a Hall of Famer and there's no
doubt that his number will be hung at some point in the future. So he's going
to go down in the history of Davidson as one of the greats, and that's pretty
good company when you figure Steph Curry and Fred Hetzel and Derek Rucker and
Dick Snyder and Brendan Winters are part of that greatness.  
  
Q. In a game like this where both teams' styles are so different, is it
important, is it key to see whoever can impose their will on the other
first?  
BOB McKILLOP: I think the imposition of will is a big factor in the outcome of
games as it starts the game. I thought that was our advantage yesterday. I
thought that Dayton replicates Rhode Island in many ways, and I thought going
in, as I looked at those two teams, Dayton probably shot the ball better from
three; Rhode Island probably protected the rim better.  
  
Today Rhode Island shot the ball from three, protected the rim, and as Dayton
did to us yesterday, really got into us and pushed us away from the basket.  
  
So as we were able to impose our will a little bit yesterday, clearly Rhode
Island imposed their will in the opening four minutes of the game. You know, I
think when Kuran Iverson made the three, I think it caught us a little bit --
like he had not been shooting it that well, and he knocks that three and put
us on our heels. Anytime a team makes threes, it puts you on your heels.
Sometimes you hurry up to catch up, and the combination of their superb
defense and our sense of urgency with trying to catch up was just lethal.  
  
Q. What's your sense now looking ahead, and obviously Selection Sunday
dictates stuff, but as far as your postseason fate?  
BOB McKILLOP: What is who?  
  
Q. What is your sense of where you guys -- what you guys will do as far
as postseason tournaments and whatnot, NIT or something.  
BOB McKILLOP: I see no chance for us in the NIT. Yeah, I don't think that
we're a candidate for it. I don't think so.

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Hassan Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32943)

### [E.C. Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28611)

### [Kuran Iverson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32983)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 84, Davidson 60  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously played the game at a really high level defensively, shot
it well. I've said this for awhile now, for the last, you know, several weeks,
last ten, 12, 13 games, this is who we are when we're healthy. We're that type
of defensive team. We have the ability to be that explosive on offense, and
that was against, obviously, you know, a team playing their third game in
three days.  
  
But that's a tremendous basketball team with one of the very best coaches in
college, and you know, those two guys, Aldridge and Gibbs, you know, two
amazing players.  
  
So thrilled to win. Thrilled to get a chance to play for a championship
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Where is the confidence level right now, when you guys have a game
like this?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: I think we just now are hitting our ceiling. We believe we're
the best team in the conference, and every game, we're just going out there
trusting each other. Like I said yesterday, just making more winning plays
than everybody.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: A win like that against a team that's really tough, our
confidence is really high right now, but still got to lock in and focus on the
next game and try to win it.  
  
Q. Was there a challenge in facing these guys a third time? I mean,
those two first games were pretty close. We had a lead I think and you guys
were able to climb back. Anything different this time around?  
KURAN IVERSON: We played them three times, so we know what they are capable
of. They have great players on their team. We just tried to stay locked in on
defense. Ball screen coverage was a big factor in the game and ball pressure,
and we just tried to stay with it.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: I think we just tried to control the game for the whole 40
minutes because both teams in the past, we were down by, what, nine or so. So
the key was just to control the game for the whole 40 minutes, and we did a
really good job with the scout, because we knew what they like to run. The key
was to stop Gibbs and Aldridge.  
  
Q. For E.C., the way you guys shot the ball, particularly from three in
the first half, what's it like when you see those first couple shots go down,
how much more confidence does that give you guys going forward?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Like you said, you see the first one go down, and that's all we
really need. You know, we work on our shot a lot in the off-season, and Coach
gives us confidence to shoot good threes. So once we see one going down, that
gives us more motivation to make more.  
  
Q. You've gotten off to fast starts two days in a row. What has led to
those starts coming out of the locker room?  
HASSAN MARTIN: The way we come out and defend. We've got to come out and
really attack them on the defensive end and really rebound the ball. Today our
offense was clicking right away, so that really helped us.  
  
Q. How close are you guys going to watch this game, or does it matter
who you play? Does it matter more what you guys do, as opposed to who your
opponent is tomorrow?  
HASSAN MARTIN: We've just got to lock in, no matter who we play, we're excited
to see both of them. Both are really good teams. Still got to keep our same
focus, and play defense and rebound, and hopefully our shots will fall and
just do a really good job, and I think we'll be fine, whoever we play.  
  
E.C. MATTHEWS: We respect both teams that's playing. So you know, whoever
wins, you know, we're going to have a game plan for that, and tomorrow we're
going to leave it all out on the court.  
  
Q. Just four years ago, you guys came into the program, and now here you
are, you're going to the A-10 title game, this is a goal that you set out for
you guys. What's it like to just finally have that opportunity and be playing
in this game on Sunday?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Really blessed. This is what we talked about four years ago,
and to be like finally here, you know, we can really taste it. We're not there
yet, so we know we have a lot of work to put in and we're going to be patient
and we're going to get a lot of rest. We're going to look at it as another
game even though it's not and be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: Yeah, we've been talking about this since I got here, and I
have the opportunity to make it to the championship, that's real big, and I'm
just real excited to play.  
  
Q. You guys started 9-for-12 from three in the first half. Was that part
of the original game plan or something that developed as the game went on?  
DAN HURLEY: No, it wasn't the game plan. We were more comfortable shooting
today than we were yesterday from the perimeter, and this is kind of who we've
been. We've been kind of -- I thought we'd be kind of a 37 percent three-point
shooting team this year. Because, you know, E.C. can shoot it, and Jared can
shoot it and Jarvis shot 52 percent from three last year in league games.  
  
So I think we went into the year thinking we'd be a better shooting team than
we were over the course of the year. But what's happened to us in games this
year is we've had games like this where we've been on fire, and then we've had
some games where we haven't been able to throw it in the ocean and then our
defense has carried us.  
  
If we just shoot it pretty good, we're very hard to beat because of our
defense.  
  
Q. What was the plan against Jack Gibbs and how well did you execute
that?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, it was similar to what we were going to try to do with
Jaylen Adams. Obviously there was a lot of attention to him. In ball screens
we were really blitzing him. We were willing to give him shots at the rim
today, because we knew just, listen, he was banged up coming in. That guy is,
you know, just a total warrior, one of the best players I've ever coached
against. We really just wanted to try to funnel him to the rim, because we
knew he probably didn't have the same pop in his legs that he's had for the
last two games here.  
  
So we just wanted to chase him off the three-point line, and just keep Payton
Aldridge and Gibbs under 30 points combined, which was what we wanted to do
yesterday with Mobley and Adams.  
  
Q. You mentioned Davidson's legs and playing three games in three days.
With that in mind, how important was it to get up early and maybe did you
think that because they were tired, they wouldn't be able to make a run at you
in the second half?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, any coach that says their game plan was to get ahead early
in the game, is lying to you guys. No one has any idea how their team is going
to start a game. We just were ready to play today. We've been playing great
again in the last bunch of games since we've gotten healthier, and then I
thought we did a pretty good job today managing the minutes with guys. We
didn't have anybody play 30 today. So hopefully that will mean for us that we
will be pretty fresh tomorrow.  
  
Q. With the way specifically Jeff was playing, setting up shots to open
guys with your three-point shooting and breaking the trap at the top of the
key in the second, what do you make of his performance today?  
DAN HURLEY: Just tremendous. Tremendous. Again, that's a guy coming from a
high-level high school program, coming from a great family, a top-level
student. He has the character and the composure and the nerve to -- and the
nerves, to play in games like this, and deliver as a freshman point guard,
playing on I guess a bubble team in the semifinals of a conference tournament
here with a chance to play for a ring tomorrow.  
  
But you know, he's been doing that for us since Jarvis went down. That guy is
a baller and he's just going to get better.  
  
Q. How do you stay locked in going into tomorrow?  
DAN HURLEY: I think it's going to be pretty easy to be locked in. You know,
we're going to go back and we're going to follow the same routine that we did
yesterday with our guys. It's just going to be a matter of being able to come
out and play well again and make shots again. We're going to play hard. We're
going to play as hard as any team in the country. We're one of the best
defensive teams in the country, both guarding and at three-point line and
blocking shots. It's just going to come down to, you know, can we have another
good offensive game; can we -- I don't know if we're going to have to shoot 12
from 23, but can we have another good offensive game. If we can, we'll
probably have a chance against both teams.  
  
Q. You also have a chance tomorrow to not only win the A-10 but get to
the NCAA Tournament. It's what you pictured for the program when you took
over. Are you looking forward to the opportunity to be in that game
tomorrow?  
DAN HURLEY: It's exciting. I was a high school coach seven years ago, and
coached at Wagner for two years. Turned that thing around quickly. Got to the
semifinals of the conference tournament in year two and lost to Robert Morris.
There's a lot of heavy lifting that's went into the first two years here,
taking over just a little bit of a mess. Then that third year, when these kids
were babies, when E.C. and Hassan and Jared and Jarvis were freshmen,
sophomores, we won 23 games. Last year E.C. tore his knee up and Hassan Martin
missed half the year which blew up our season. So here we are, where we
thought we might have been last year, with the chance to do something great.  
  
Q. How strong is the motivation to take it out of the select committee's
hands tomorrow and just go out and win yourselves a championship?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, listen, we said to our guys yesterday before the
tournament started, the one thing we did say, when we recruited you, E.C. and
Hassan in particular, Kuran, we never promised them we would win the Atlantic
10. We never promised them we would play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
What we told them was we would give them a great chance to do those things.
You know, when they wake up tomorrow, they are going to have a great chance.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [De-Riante Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32953)

### [JeQuan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28596)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
VCU 70, George Mason 60  
  
WILL WADE: You know, I thought we got off to a really good start, which is
something we've been working on, is making sure we got off to a good start. I
thought we did a great job there. And then obviously in the last, you know,
six minutes of the game, we work on that stuff all the type. We talk about
that being winning time.  
  
We executed in those final six minutes, and you know, when we were making
threes like that, that scoreboard adds up pretty quickly. That was a big help.
But was proud of our guys. I thought JeQuan really stepped up down the
stretch. I think he was one of six until the last -- or one of seven until
last ten minutes or so.  
  
Like a senior, he closed strong. And it's nice to have De'Riante back. He
played really well. I thought Burgess did a nice job. I thought Hamdy was in
major foul trouble, but Hamdy made two huge plays for us, getting the
offensive rebound and getting fouled, and then he got a huge defensive rebound
in between three folks.  
  
Give Mason credit. They are a really good team. You know, Marquise Moore, 17
rebounds after having I think 19 last night, something like that. I mean, they
are a good team. Coach Paulsen does a phenomenal job. They had all sorts of
junk defenses for us tonight, some stuff we hadn't seen during the regular
season. And it took us a little bit of time to adjust, but our guys did a good
job.  
  
Q. Foot injury you and you go three for three from downtown. How does it
feel now after advancing?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: It feels fine. Glad to be back out there with my guys and
having fun.  
  
Q. You've made a living attacking the paint this year but just how
different does it feel when those threes start falling for you guys?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: It opens up the court. Teams are starting to double down on Mo,
Tillman and Hamdy, they are really good bigs, and when we're hitting shots on
the perimeter, it's hard for teams to do that and it just opens them up for
easy buckets.  
  
Q. What was the difference there in the last eight minutes for you?
Coach mentioned the junk defenses. Were those slowing you down? Was there
something you saw that changed things for you there the last eight minutes?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I just thought I'd be more aggressive. We were settling a lot
for perimeter shots and Coach was just staying on us about getting in the
paint. So we just ran plays to get us driving downhill and get paint touches.  
  
Q. In the first half, you turned to the media and you said, "I've got
another three in me." Can you take me through what was going through your
mind? And turned around again and said, "I told you so."  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: I told my guy Tim that. I knew I was open, Samir kept
coming off the screen and it was either pick your poison, help off of Samir
and leave me in the corner for a three, and we got a lot of shots early this
week in practice and it showed tonight.  
  
Q. Struggling a little bit from the perimeter last few games. Take me
through your mind-set, and how big it was for you just to make a shot out
there finally to kind of break that ice.  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I've been very optimistic lately. That's been my worry this
whole season; just overcoming adversity, not really thinking about it.  
  
Yeah, I missed six shots in the first half but I just followed through with my
routine and kept shooting it. Eventually I knew it was going to fall.  
  
Q. Moving on to the semifinals tomorrow, and obviously you play the
winner of the George Washington, Richmond game. Which team do you feel you
matchup better with?  
WILL WADE: Good question. I mean, they both present totally different
challenges to you. You know, George Washington is smash-mouth and they have
got Cavanaugh and obviously Richmond has the Rookie of the Year, or the Player
of the Year in the league. They spread you and you've got to be really good
defensively against them.  
  
Both of them present different challenges, and whichever one of them wins
tonight, we'll do our best to prepare for and be ready tomorrow at 3:30.  
  
Q. Obviously the guys see the results from Dayton, but how do you get
that out of their mind and just focus game by game?  
WILL WADE: Well, we talk about it. You know, to win a tournament, you've got
to win the first game, and I've always said, I think the first game is the
most difficult one to win. It's the hardest one to win. It's a one-time -- you
know, the team, Mason got to play last night.  
  
Now if you keep winning and you're the team who played the first night,
obviously it works against you with how tired you get. But that first night
when the other teams played for a little bit, that's why I think it's hard
sometimes when you have that bye to get going.  
  
I was proud of our guys at the start, but give Mason credit. They are a tough
bunch. We couldn't knock them out at our place on Saturday. We kept throwing
punches and punches and punches, and we couldn't knock them out. They came
back and came back and they cut to three or four, and tonight, same thing. We
gave them the best we had at the beginning and it was 12-2, and I don't think
we scored for eight minutes or something like that. Those guys don't go
anywhere. They are a tough, tough -- a tough, tough, out.  
  
Q. They had your big men bottled up, doubling and making it really tough
for them in there. How big was it to find somebody to make a shot, with Doug
--  
WILL WADE: It was huge. I mean, it loosens things up. I thought Doug's three
was a big three. You know, it's big. I thought our guys did a nice job
passing. I thought we found Burgess a couple times. We missed a couple passes
where we would have been open and we just, we fumbled the ball. You know, they
had a good game plan. They had a really good game plan. They always do.  
  
Q. How much of that early stretch for JeQuan is him not wanting to shoot
you guys out of the game, and how much of that is him being patient?  
WILL WADE: Well, I think sometimes he passes good shots up, and I wish he'd be
more aggressive sometimes. But you know, part of that is probably on me. I
mean, they hear "pound it in the paint" in their sleep. I'm relentless about
that.  
  
So they know, especially early, I have a quick hook if you don't get that
thing in the paint. Sometimes they probably, you know, don't spend enough time
throwing -- you know, looking for their own stuff.  
  
But we find a good balance usually as the game goes along.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Denzel Gregg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32942)

### [Jaylen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32871)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 74, St. Bonaventure 63  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: I give all the credit to Rhode Island. I thought they did a
really good job offensively and defensively. They are more physical than us
and we had a hard time scoring the ball. We tried to change things up and one-
three-one, two three, man-to-man, try to fool them, and at times, it worked,
but they just -- you know, they hurt us inside from an offensive standpoint,
and we didn't have much resistance. One of our weaknesses is we have young
guys inside and they took advantage of that.  
  
And then their defense was really effective. They shocked the ball screens,
and when we had open looks, we needed to knock those open looks down and we
struggled in that area, as well. But you know, Rhode Island is a really good
team and hopefully they get to the NCAA Tournament. But all credit goes to
them. They played really well.  
  
Q. Can you explain a little bit how tough it is to deal with those
horses inside? They were big and strong and tough.  
DENZEL GREGG: They are good players. We struggled with that all year, the
bigger bigs, and it showed tonight. Credit goes to them. They played really
well. Hassan for 10, he had a great night.  
  
Q. They didn't do anything really that surprised you; right? You knew
what was coming?  
DENZEL GREGG: Yeah, they didn't do anything new. It's just hard to guard. It
is what it is.  
  
Q. It was also kind of a carbon copy from that first game in Kingston in
terms of what they did to you guys offensively, really trying to hound you and
Matt. They held Matt to no field goals today. They made you work for your
points. What did they do defensively? How hard was it going against that again
today?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: It's more of the same. I don't think they did anything knew.
They were just more physical than us. Something that we've got to work on in
the summer. I think we turned the ball over too much, me personally, and I
think we've just got to get better from here.  
  
Q. When Matt gets shut down like that, how much more difficult is it for
you to carry this offense?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I mean, other guys hit shots. I think Idris played well today.
Denzel gave us a lift. But it's something that as a leader, I'm willing to
shoulder. Today they weren't falling, and they beat us up and they got one
today.  
  
Q. They have always been a hard team for you guys to score on, they are
a hard team for everybody to score on. They make it so you don't maybe get a
lot of the shots that you want. What do they do to sort of take you out of
that offense, just from -- you know, as a team.  
JAYLEN ADAMS: They played a real physical plan of basketball, and I think
today we handled it a little differently. In the first game, I think we
handled it a little better but today we weren't able to stick the open shots,
and that really hurt us because when you can't hit open shots, they can
pressure you even more. And I think that was a big problem today.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, obviously not the outcome you wanted this
weekend. I'm not sure where maybe the NIT conversations is with you guys right
now. Do you feel like that's still a possibility, or do you feel like the
season maybe came to an end today? Has that gone through your mind at all?  
DENZEL GREGG: It's March. Anything can happen. A lot of basketball left to
play for other people, and we're just waiting, see what happens.  
  
Q. You were down six at halftime and got a really good response, within
three minutes you're back ahead. You're encouraged, I would think at that
point.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we took the lead. But Rhode Island is a good team and they
came back at us. We got the run coming out of the half and that was what we
wanted. But they answered it. And then it was back and forth, and had just
such a hard time guarding them inside. They got too many easy baskets. And
everything that we got, you know, it was a struggle.  
  
But like I said, give them credit, just like Jay and Denzel alluded to. They
were a really good defensive team. They are physical and they make you work
for everything and we had a hard time getting good looks, and when we got the
good looks as Jay said, we missed some shots, too, against a good defensive
team like URI, you've got to make those.  
  
Q. You can relate to the position Rhode Island finds itself in. Are you
optimistic that the committee will treat Rhode Island better and the league
better?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I have no idea. I have no idea. No idea. No idea. You know, they
are deserving of going to the tournament. You know, they are a really good
team and hopefully they get a chance.  
  
Q. You've got 20 wins. If you could talk to the NIT committee, what
argument would you make for your team?  
MARK SCHMIDT: We're good. We came in fifth in the Atlantic 10. We've had some
good wins. We get great crowds. You know, and I think we're deserving of that.
But you know, as every coach says, it doesn't matter what I say. But we have a
very good team, and they are deserving of playing in the NIT, and hopefully we
get that chance. If not, that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. As a guy with some Pittsburgh connections and you had your fans make
a little shorter trip here than what it is to Brooklyn --  
MARK SCHMIDT: It's terrific. I said that in the Media Day back in October.
This is a great venue. You know, they pulled out the red carpet for us.
Pittsburgh is close to my heart. My wife's from here and I coached here for
six years. It's a great city. They have done a fabulous job here, and
hopefully we can come back.  
  
Q. You knew what was coming and you talked about it yesterday, just
because they are so physical.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Were you at times, did you feel like defenseless trying to coach,
because you can talk strategy and X's and O's, but there's certain points in
that game you could do nothing against them to stop them.  
MARK SCHMIDT: We tried to trick them. They are just more physical than us.
They are men inside and we had young guys trying to battle, and they fought,
but they were just out-matched. We need to do a better job offensively of
scoring the ball a little bit better.  
  
But here it was hard defensively. We go into the one-three-one and they just
seal us, and when they get the ball in the middle of the zone, it was really
difficult. But yeah, you just try to do the best you can, and our guys fought.
But they were, at times, overmatched, physically.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Jalen Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32899)

### [Marquise Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32897)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
VCU 70, George Mason 60  
  
DAVE PAULSEN: You know, we're really disappointed, heartbroken. The guys in
the locker room obviously were devastated, and it's really hard for me as a
coach, especially having these two guys up here, Jalen and Marquise, because
these guys have given everything they have had. They have really, really,
really bought in, fought exceptionally hard, and proved tremendously. They
poured everything they had out on the court and so we're disappointed.  
  
But I thought we really, really competed. I thought we played really well. I
think we had VCU on their heels. We wanted to have some of their guys that
maybe aren't their leading scorers beat us, and for 32 minutes, they didn't.
In the last seven or eight minutes, they made some big plays. We just had some
empty possessions.  
  
But I don't think I've ever been proud of a team in defeat, and the guys have
made a lot of progress. You know, we'll get a chance to reflect on this and
figure out our next steps.  
  
Q. Marquise, in the tight game with about six, seven minutes left, what
do you think the difference was down the stretch?  
MARQUISE MOORE: I think they had -- they made timely shots. Like Coach said,
the guys we wanted to make plays, did make plays in the late game, and that
was really the difference.  
  
Q. You guys held Tillman and Alie-Cox to seven points, and Tillman in
particular had given you a ton of trouble earlier in the year. How were you
able to bottle them up tonight?  
JALEN JENKINS: We put emphasis on it, during film, during shoot around. You
know, that was obviously one of our, you know, keys to get a victory, keep
them off the glass, especially with us being a team that plays four out, one
in. We had a huge disadvantage in height.  
  
So when he came in the game, we wanted to make sure that if they drove the
lane, they had to finish, and we wouldn't rotate over and give guys like
Tillman and Alie-Cox easy dunk-downs to get them going.  
  
Q. You guys from your freshman year to now, the program has really
changed back to a winning program. What does it say about what you guys have
done to be a huge part of turning things around like that, to get Mason back
to a 20-win team?  
JALEN JENKINS: It hasn't been easy, but it's kind of been -- it's been fun,
especially like the last three years. Obviously last year, we only won 11
games, but there was a lot of potential in the team that we had.  
  
And this year, I think we just, you know, it manifested. From it springboarded
when we were in Florida and we started the nine-game win streak, and after
that we got into conference play and we kept winning and losing, winning and
losing, and finally we strung, I think it was three or four wins together, and
then from there, we just, we kept going. It's been fun.  
  
Q. When you look back on this season, what will you take from it?  
MARQUISE MOORE: Just the progress we made, how we all came together as one,
fought every day. Stuck together through the ups and the downs. Just really
became a family out there. That's what I'll remember the most.  
  
Q. With such a young group, aside from these two guys, will you try to
keep playing this season, one of the secondary tournaments?  
DAVE PAULSEN: We're going to evaluate that. You know, we're going to try not
to make an emotional decision right now. You know, our hope, and maybe you get
an NIT bid; that's going to be a hard thing. We'll evaluate one of those
second -- one of those other tournaments. But I've got a little time to
reflect on it.  
  
Q. When they were going on their run, what is your process on calling a
time-out, and do you think you should have called one a little bit earlier?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, you know, we only had two left, because we had to burn two
in the first half, and I wanted to try to get one after a basket. And we had a
couple good looks. You know, Marquise got deep penetration -- and you know, I
thought maybe he got fouled. Obviously that wasn't the call.  
  
But we had a couple of good trips down, but they came up empty. Hindsight
being 20/20, yeah, but we needed -- we played the last two minutes because we
were pressing the trap without a time-out. You know, you'd like to think even
last night, we're in a similar situation; that you could get a basket and get
a time-out, set your defense, and go on a run. Obviously it didn't happen that
way.  
  
Q. How do you take like an 11-win team, lose a guy like Shevon, and turn
it into a 20-win team with such a young roster like that? What was the big
difference this year from last year's team?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Well, I think the two guys who were up here, you know, were a
big part of that, a huge part of it. You know, that's not how they maybe, you
know, they came and were recruited by one coach and the change and it took a
little time for them to figure out who I was and what we wanted to do.  
  
And these guys, from maybe January last year, Marquise and Jalen, really,
really bought in and helped lead a really young team. And they played at a
really high level.  
  
You know, I think Otis Livingston and Jaire Grayer had really, really good
sophomore years, and those guys have played a lot of minutes. Jaire especially
in the conference play really elevated his game. When they are all clicking,
we had four guys, even though Otis and Jaire are only sophomores, they played
a lot of minutes. They have a veteran presence.  
  
And our freshman group, they improved. I think as a group, you know, that
practiced hard virtually every single day was bought in. So I think the buy-in
from the guys was really a key.  
  
Q. Saying all that, how do you look at the immediate future now stepping
forward?  
DAVE PAULSEN: You know, I think the future's bright. I think most important
thing is the foundation and the culture that you create. I think we made
tremendous strides in that in terms of how hard we work, our attention to
detail, our coach-ability, things like that.  
  
You know, I think we played -- you know, you're going to have two sophomores
that will be juniors next year and five freshmen who played a lot or at least
a decent amount. I think we've got a couple good kids that have signed that
are having really tremendous senior years.  
  
We're going to need -- you know, we're going to miss these two guys, there's
no question about it. But as your question said, we're worried about replacing
Shevon, and I think you want to build your program where tradition never
graduates. Players graduate, but your tradition never graduates.  
  
Q. We saw Daniel get some minutes today. What do you see from him in the
future?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Daniel played really well tonight. You know, Daniel, to be
honest with you, we didn't even know if he would be able to play this year. He
wasn't able to do anything all last year after knee surgery. He wasn't cleared
to practice until probably mid-October.  
  
There was uncertainty whether or not, would he last the whole year. And some
days he could move better than others. His knee is still not 100 percent. I
thought all year long, he gave us tremendous job defensively and on the glass,
and he's a work-in-progress offensively.  
  
So really, I don't know what his ceiling is, because I don't know what it's
going to be like when he gets a couple weeks off and he can heal, and what
kind of progress can he make. You know, I don't know where he's at in terms of
his athletic potential in terms of how well the knee will continue to recover.

### [Shawndre' Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26721)

_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RICHMOND 70, George Washington 67  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I thought it was a really, really hard-fought game. We
played GW three times this year, and you know, they made some adjustments and
played incredibly hard tonight.  
  
I thought they played a great game. I thought we played a very good game. You
know, and we were finally able to defend -- our numbers aren't good for the
game, but we were finally able to defend, I thought like the last seven or
eight minutes. Made some really big defensively plays. Obviously the one at
the end being the most important.  
  
So really pleased to win the game, and looking forward to the game tomorrow.  
  
Looked like on the last play or inbound -- take me through how you got back up
top and what happened.  
  
KHWAN FORE: I know once they got it in, they wanted to get Bolden coming
around for the screen. We had seen that before in previous games, so I was
just on the alert for that, and I just went in to help once Watanabe got the
ball, and I just took a chance and got the steal.  
  
Q. You heard Coach mention about the seven to eight minutes at the end
with your defense, specifically not being able to allow Cavanaugh to get off a
shot at all. What does that say about your defensive intensity and mind-set in
those last seven or eight minutes?  
T.J. CLINE: I think it just shows our heart that we have. We know when it the
comes down to the last few minutes down to the wire that, we need to man up
and make defensive plays. You know, credit him. He played really, really well.
He shot the three well. He was doing well down low. And we knew we couldn't
let him continue doing that, so I thought we did a really good job of locking
in on him and kind of making sure he didn't get any post touches, and if he
did, there was kinds of people around him to crowd him.  
  
Q. T.J., I know it's probably the third time I think you've scored in
single digits this year, but you still win, and all three of those games
you've won, does it show that you can win without scoring 15, 17, 20 points a
game?  
T.J. CLINE: Absolutely. We have very capable scorers on this team. Down the
line, there's no one who is not a scorer or not a threat. Khwan is
unbelievable. Shawndre', we know, our star; Bak; Nick; no one is afraid to
score and no one is afraid to shoot the ball, and we have confidence in all of
our players.  
  
Even when I'm not going or they are doubling or I'm not getting shots off,
there's no problem with that as long as we win the game, and everybody else
kind of picks up the scoring load.  
  
Q. Khwan, you made two very important baskets down the end. Take me
through the mind-set on those two, one drive down the lane I think and another
one, very critical.  
KHWAN FORE: Oh, yeah, seeing that Steeves had ran out like, past the three-
point line, and again, I was just being aggressive and just used my quickness
and just beat him to the rim.  
  
Q. Obviously round three with VCU, your thoughts on having to play them
again?  
SHAWNDRE' JONES: It was a good opportunity for us. We have to play them in
order to get where we want to get and that's the A-10 championship. The last
two games were hard-fought. We came up short and hopefully we can get this
one.  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Can I ask a question first? Is John O'Connor not here? Thanks.  
  
Q. T.J., I think he took one shot in the second half if I'm not
mistaken, right, and you were still able to maintain the lead and hold it.  
CHRIS MOONEY: You know, I really think the credit goes to T.J. I think he's
the Player of the Year in the league and I don't think he took a bad shot in
the game; and is being double-teamed and guarded by every single player, and
he's still passing the ball, you know, immediately. He's trusting his
instincts and he's making the passes, and to have eight assists in a game,
it's pretty normal for him.  
  
But for a 6-9 guy, to make those decisions so quickly and not be worried about
his points or stats or anything like that, is really, really impressive, and
he's just such a unique player. So he can impact the game in many, many ways.  
  
I thought he played a good defensive game today. I thought he played a great
offensive game. If we had shot the ball a little bit better, he would have had
even more assists, but I thought he played a great game.  
  
Q. 21 lead changes, what did it take for you to finally gain some
separation?  
CHRIS MOONEY: I don't really feel like we did, ever, to be honest. I thought,
you know, they went zone and Nick Sherod hit two threes mand I felt like we
were doing pretty well. They come down, I think Cavanaugh hit one of the
threes, and you know, what felt like it could have been like a 10-0 run was
about a 10-9 swing, is all.  
  
So they played incredibly hard. I thought they were extremely motivated. They
were certainly ready to play. Good game plan. And so I think it was really
hard for us to pull away. I think finally in the end, you know, we had one
more defensive stop in us, and we didn't play well defensively throughout the
game but I thought the last seven minutes we did and that last play by Khwan
is a really big time play.  
  
Q. He said y'all had seen an alert somewhere, and they called time-out
-- did they switch what they were doing to what you saw?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I thought they had -- Shawndre' actually guarded the man
coming off the screen. We're in a difficult situation there because of the
sides, is that much more notable when it's so close to the basket and the ball
is coming in. We fouled twice. We had the two fouls to give but then they got
the ball under the basket. I don't know whether that was the best strategy or
not. And we were fortunate because we didn't want to switch to put Khwan or
Shawndre' on one of the big guys. We were fortunate, we made them inbound the
ball past the top of the key. That was the most important part of it, and then
Khwan I think just, he's so quick and has such good instincts; to steal the
ball like that was a really big, a really big play.  
  
Q. Talk about his defensive ability a little bit. Everybody knows about
his offensive capabilities and jumping and quickness and all that.  
CHRIS MOONEY: He's a great defender. He's able to apply pressure without
getting beat by his offensive player, and that's pretty rare. You know, we
actually don't have a ton of that, and he provided a lot of it, and so since
he does, he's that much more critical to our defense and was able to apply
pressure, keep his body in front, and then come up with some big plays. I
think he had seven rebounds, as well, you know, just played a terrific game.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on VCU, since we have round three now.  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, more size. So much quickness, Lewis, and the guards are
very quick and they are also good ball handlers, and they really -- you know,
for us, there's no secret they are trying to pound the ball inside.  
  
So we are going to have to do something to combat that. Hopefully our
skillfulness and sense for the game and speed and all those things show up in
the game, as well. But we need to figure out how to make it so that they don't
have too, too many points on the paint.

_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
DAVIDSON 73, Dayton 67  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, congratulations to Davidson. Hard-fought win. They are a
terrific team. Two of the premiere players in our conference. It's no surprise
that they are able to do some damage in this tournament with those guys.  
  
And for us, we've just lost an edge about us defensively, which has cost us
here in the back six, seven games. We were winning a lot of them.  
  
So it's kind of hard to tell, but we are spotting teams 15 points, getting
down 13 points and it's hard to claw your way out of it. To these guys'
credit, we fought very hard and I thought our second half was much better than
our first. And to have a lead under four, that last four-minute segment of the
game is usually the one that we hone in on the most: Find a way to win last
four minutes and you're going to win the game, and I believe we gave up three
threes in two minutes. So that was probably the deal breaker. Jack Gibbs, give
him credit, he made two tremendous three-point shots as they keep moving
forward.  
  
For us, one loss, a couple down moments here at the end shouldn't define our
season. We're the regular season champions and we've dealt with so much in the
off-season and during the season, then our resiliency has led us back to the
NCAA Tournament, which is a credit to these guys over here and their
improvement.  
  
We'll wait and see where we're going and what's going on, and then from there,
I think we all know how desperate we'll have to be to find a way on the
biggest stage against the best teams in the country to find a way to win. The
losing stings a lot more, but we didn't lose a game for about a month and a
half, and you can't really forget all the good things that have happened to
the group, as well. Just unfortunate that we didn't play our best today.  
  
Q. How do you regain the defensive edge? Is it something that you take
responsibility for yourself, be a leader and get the team to regain that edge
on defense in?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: It's my job to get my teammates ready. Got to have more of a
mentality; we keep letting guys individually score a lot of points and we just
have to play a better team defense.  
  
Q. For both guys, got a lot of open looks today but seemingly didn't
fall in for you guys. Were you happy with the way the offense was running and
the looks that you were getting, and it's just a case of the ball wasn't
falling for you today?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: First half, we didn't run our offense too well. I think we got
it going in the back eight minutes of the first half, and from there we
continued to push on. But we got ourselves into too deep of a hole.  
  
XEYRIUS WILLIAMS: Just you can't really stop. You're doing what the offense is
built off, getting open shots, but they are just not falling. They are just
not falling.  
  
Q. What have they done this year to be such a more complete team and a
tough defensive team, and not just a team that can burn you from deep?  
ARCHIE MILLER: They have good size. Good size at the five, in particular. They
have three guys that play in there. Physical around the basket. They have had
moments defensively against VCU and Rhode Island where they can really be
physical around the rim. They are different and they are more aggressive with
ball screens and whatnot, the guards make passes. They don't just let you get
downhill and get layups.  
  
We've played them twice. I think our offense is fine. We missed some open
looks. I think we missed three, kindergarten layups in the first half. One of
those ones, like, wow, how did that one not go in. And it happens. We missed
three of those. I thought we had some really good looks, Charles and Xeyrius
both had threes in the first half that didn't go. Second half was a much
different story. I think we scored the ball 42 points, percentage is 51, 46
from three.  
  
I think the big thing for our team and the big thing that's a big success
within our offense, is we're like top five, maybe top six in the country in
getting to the foul line. We shot ten foul shots today. We average about 25
free throws a game, and you know, when you don't have the opportunity to get
to the line like we did today, sometimes you've got to really be perfect from
the outside; or you've really got to be perfect in your field goals, because
we generate a lot of points from the foul line, which today we didn't get
those points from the foul line.  
  
Q. With having the double bye coming into the A-10 tournament and now
having a significant amount of time off before the NCAA Tournament, how do you
handle those extended breaks, and then to go into a single-elimination
situation?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We are just going to make sure we're ready, wherever the NCAA
places us next week, ain't going to end up like this.  
  
XEYRIUS WILLIAMS: Like Scooch said, make sure we come to practice every day
and just keep an open mind about everything.  
  
Q. You're a veteran player in this league and so is Gibbs. What do you
think of Gibbs?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: He's a real good player. He's real dominant in the offense and
you let a player like him get going tonight, results going to happen like it
did today.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, this is a couple losses in a row, how do you guys
kind of wipe these losses and not let them sink in too much and take a fresh
mind-set into the tournament?  
XEYRIUS WILLIAMS: Think of it as moving on to the next play, the next game.
Just keep an open mind and be ready to bounce back.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Try not to dwell on it too much. Next game, whoever we play,
doesn't really have an effect on the two of us back-to-back. Be ready for the
next one, forget about this one.  
  
Q. I just wanted to know if you could comment on the Flyer fans. They
made it feel like a home game out here tonight, and how much you thought they
helped sort of bring you guys back when you dug that hole early.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, kind of thought moving the tournament to Pittsburgh would
help us. It clearly did. It felt, like you said, a home environment. I think
the times we made runs and the times the games got emotional and good things
were happening, you got a feel in the arena what it would have been like. To
advance in this tournament would have been special for our fans and our
players to play in front of them, because the games and pressure would have
started to get a little bit bigger and the crowd would have played a bigger
role.  
  
The crowd definitely played a big role for us and we had some emotional runs
in the second half, and I think you got a chance to feel what it would have
been like. Unfortunately we couldn't stay in it long enough to keep them here.  
  
Q. How was Darrell? He took another hard shot in the second half?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I have no idea. I think he said he was fine on the bench. I
didn't see him. He was with the doctors and Mike, he's getting hit pretty high
on the floor with some blind screens which are completely legal, and he's not
aware right now that they are trying to step up and get him. He's got to do a
little better job of navigating that, and hopefully he'll be fine. I think he
was good on the bench in the second half at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Obviously a shorter run than what you wanted but can you give us your
impressions of the A-10 tournament in Pittsburgh, your hometown and what you
thought of it.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Oh, it's a really nice setup. I think from the hotels to the
accessibility of the arena for the fans, it's much more comfortable to move
around, I'm sure. And the longer that you're here, you're going to be in a fun
environment. I think the arena is top-notch. They did a great job of setting
it up.  
  
This tournament, starting the rest of the day, going into Saturday and Sunday,
will have a special feel. It's been a check mark. It's been a real plus.
Pittsburgh's done a great job. They said they would when we talked to them.  
  
Q. On the last two of Gibbs' three, did you feel like your defense was
in place and it was an incredible shot?  
ARCHIE MILLER: They made two really incredible shots, the step back in the
left side, another step back on the right side and one foul. You know, we've
been in some situations where guys have been dominant. We've done a better job
of making them pass. And especially the last one, we had a broken coverage, we
should have trapped him and made him pass, and then he kind of strung Kyle out
to the corner in the left side to give him the lead. That's another one where
I think we had an opportunity to Corral him on the sideline and make him pass.  
  
That's what you've got to do with a guy like him because he is fearless, and
we weren't able to have Charles on him late in the game for the length, his
fourth foul, and Kyle was able to get a couple shots over the top of Kyle, all
contested, though.  
  
Q. How do you think being a senior-led team, how do you think that will
help you in not dwelling too much on these losses and getting back on track
for the tournament?  
ARCHIE MILLER: We don't dwell on losing. We dwell on improvement, and we have
another opportunity. The next one is a fresh start, man. It's going to feel
like a million dollars. There's nothing like the Tournament. Nothing like
having your name called. These guys will go for the fourth time in their
career.  
  
So they will be excited to play, but at the end of the day, you know, our
desperation, our toughness, some of the things that got us here, they are just
not as intact, and it's hard to get back sometimes. But we'll work at it. We
don't really worry about losing this time of year. You're worried about
finding a way to get one more win, and that's what we'll do.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the early portion of the second half when you guys
were making your run, you limited Davidson in ways that you had not in the
first half. What was different for you guys defensively starting the second
half?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, I think in the second half to start, we were much more
engaged. I think we had more pressure on the ball. I thought we were much more
detailed off the ball, and just in terms of being able to be where we're
supposed to be and get there. They are tough to guard now; there's a reason
they are so hard to guard defensively, when you're guarding that motion. And
they missed some. They missed some ones maybe they made in the first half. We
were able to get some stops, we started the first four minutes 10-2 and got
right back in the game.  
  
Other than one break down offensively in the second half, we only turned it
over six times, so not giving them transition. We scored in the second half,
so it was easier to defend them a little bit, but they are a good team. You
know, just watching them on film, they are in every game. They have lost some
leads this season that I know they probably shouldn't have, one of which was
probably ours and Davidson. The last couple days, they are fighting like crazy
to hold on to these leads and responded in the last two games.  
  
I think Gibbs and Aldridge, you can make the case both of them could be could
Player of the Year in our conference. They have two guys that can do that,
especially in the postseason; they get on a run and they get hot.  
  
Q. You said the last couple games here, you've kind of lost some of your
toughness and tenacity and stuff like that. Why is that?  
ARCHIE MILLER: You know, I can't really explain it. I think a lot of it's
focus. I think when you have sort of the emotional win that we had at home,
sort of like put us in a situation where things were okay, I think our team's
always at its best when things aren't okay; when you need to have your back
against the wall; when you have to have a chip on your shoulder, and we've had
to play like that for so long.  
  
And it seems like here of late, maybe the last couple weeks, the chip has not
been there as much, because we've sort of gotten some things done here down
the stretch that have given us a chance to sort of take a deep breath. Can't
do that.  
  
The Tournament will put the edge back on you because some of these guys won't
play another game for us when it's over. You hope it's really focussed in
right now. They will be excited to go to work and prepare for the hardest game
of the season, and that edge, that desperation to not want to be done,
hopefully that will give us a little kick in the butt and give us another shot
in the arm where we can get on a run.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Jack Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28594)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
DAVIDSON 73, Dayton 67  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Two big plays there down the stretch by Jack Gibbs, no surprise,
four years of big plays from Jack Gibbs. And yet the team defensive thought
was extraordinary. We got stops. The rebounding was off the charts, and a game
that we fought for 40 minutes. This is a very good Dayton team, a team that I
think is dangerous as heck in the NCAA Tournament. So we are very pleased to
have a victory in this quarterfinal round of the A-10 tournament.  
  
Q. Jack, talk about especially that last shot where you stepped back on
Davis and hit it and just kind of what you were thinking and how you set it
up?  
JACK GIBBS: Well, I just kind of wanted the ball in my hand at the end of the
game, try to make a play. Tried to get some separation on the shot and luckily
it went in.  
  
Q. Jack, you guys were in this position before against Dayton. You were
up by 13 with 7:42 left. What allowed you to finish this game and why is the
outcome different than the last one?  
JACK GIBBS: I think down the stretch of the season, we had a lot of close
games, lost a couple in overtime. I think just learning how to finish a game
off, I know in the past, we let teams speed us up and forced us into turnovers
and bad shots and that gives them run-outs on the other side of the court, so
I think just kind of stay poised under pressure. I know Dayton is a good team.
We knew they were going it make a run towards the end and just kind of keep
your cool and make the plays that we need to make down the stretch. I think we
definitely learned from past games. I guess it paid dividends here.  
  
Q. Jack being what happened on that sequence, maybe a two-minute stretch
and you threw your mask and there was a bit of dialogue with the referees?  
JACK GIBBS: It's March basketball. Things are going to get heated and I mean,
it's just, I mean, it was a hard-fought game and it was a battle. So that's
all I really have to say about that.  
  
Q. Peyton, you guys led most of the way, and then they get the three
point lead late, first off, how is the team feeling at that point, and then
kind of comment on Jack's two shots.  
PEYTON ALDRIGE: Yeah, we were fighting the whole game. We thought we had
control of the whole game, so we wanted to -- they made a run and we now they
were going to make a run so we wanted to stay poised and stay under control. I
mean, he's unbelievable. He wanted the ball in his hands and he made two big
shots for us.  
  
Q. Drew was just telling us, Peyton broke the building's scoring record
yesterday and you broke it today. The coach was saying yesterday that you guys
like the city, the venue so far, but I guess you're really settling in.  
JACK GIBBS: I couldn't let him have that for too long (laughing) no, but it's
a great place to play. I mean, we're shooting the ball pretty well right now
and we're excited about the outcomes of our last two games and we're looking
forward to tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. At the end of the press conference said, you talked about what Dayton
would do, wanting to speed everything up and make everything a challenge. How
do you feel your team did in terms of execution in that area?  
BOB McKILLOP: I thought we were very good in the first half and that's how we
built our lead. Early on we set the tone with Jack shooting two layups on curl
plays. Peyton got a great backdoor cut coming out of a time-out. So we opened
up the court and got cuts, and in the second half, they made our cuts
difficult.  
  
And that's the great talent of the Dayton defensive team. I think they are a
tremendous defensive team, and that's why I think they can be a dangerous out
in the NCAA Tournament, because they defend, they certainly can shoot it, and
they can attack you at five positions.  
  
Q. Jack, one of four now, to get 2,000 career points. Maybe how would
you define his journey to get to this point and what he's been able to do to
be one of those four?  
BOB McKILLOP: Well, I'm just delighted there's still time left on the clock
for him. You coach a long period of time and you get an opportunity to coach
some very special talents and young men. I've had that great gift given to me,
and Jack has just been an extraordinary young man, as well as a great talent
for me.  
  
Q. What did you see on the play when he ws knocked to the floor?  
BOB McKILLOP: You know, that's why I'm not a referee. I saw the body go down,
the mask come up and I saw him setting a screen. Usually that play is someone
maybe hits him above the shoulders, and the tape clearly revealed that it was
not above the shoulder. It was below the shoulders.  
  
Q. You guys had a 12-point lead at halftime but they missed a lot of
close looks. How helpful is it for you to have a guy like Gibbs, who has been
big in those moments and can hit those big shots?  
BOB McKILLOP: You know, we saw that yesterday with Peyton Aldridge, and today
we saw that with Jack Gibbs. Boy, there was some Dayton shots that rolled in
and rolled out, especially down that stretch when we were able to maintain the
lead. They were so close to going in, and just fell off the rim.  
  
In our loss to Rhode Island and our loss to Dayton earlier, within the past
two or three weeks, we were in that same situation where those shots, those
loose balls rolled off our fingerer and rolled off the rim. It came in our
direction today.  
  
Q. Two-part question. What's key now in getting the guys ready as far as
physically for tomorrow, and do you feel like things -- I mean, you guys are
playing well at the right time?  
BOB McKILLOP: You know, we pride ourselves in being a team that learns its
lessons because there is focus and there is a sense of care about listening to
what they are told, following the script. And I thought today and yesterday
were perfect examples of what we learned from the Dayton overtime loss and the
Rhode Island overtime loss. We were in this same position last year. We had
beaten La Salle and Bonaventure, emotional upset overtime game.  
  
So now we're almost in the same situation. Let's see if we have been able to
learn from that and put that to good use as we prepare for whoever we play
tomorrow.

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Patrick Steeves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32966)

### [Tyler Cavanaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30539)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RICHMOND 70, George Washington 67  
  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I want to give credit to Richmond. That's a talented team,
some really good players. I think Shawndre' Jones and T.J. Cline are one of
the most potent duos in this league. They are really tough to prepare for;
they are really tough to guard. I think our guys did a really good job of that
for vast majority of that game.  
  
T.J. Cline only got nine shots, eight points. Obviously he does what he does;
he got his eight assists and five rebounds, so he kind of filled the stat
sheet there. But we thought we did a really good job on him. Yuta did a
tremendous job. So that's a talented team. It's a talented team, and I thought
we competed, I thought we battled for 40 minutes.  
  
I thought the game came down to a couple plays here and there that the ball
didn't bounce our way or they hit some big time shots. But there's a reason
that they finished third in this league. This is a very talented league and
that's a very talented team.  
  
So proud of our guys the way we battled and proud of our guys the way we
finished the season. My hope is that we have more basketball to play. I think
we deserve it. I think that coming into this game with a 94 RPI, winning six
in a row and beating teams like Daytons and Bonnies, and I think we got some
pretty good wins under our belt. I think we deserve to have our season
prolonged, but again, obviously that's not my decision. But I just hope for
these guys that we have an opportunity to continue to compete and continue to
grow as a unit.  
  
Q. On the last play, what was your mind-set? You guys had battled and
battled and battled the last few minutes. Did you feel good about that last
possession off the time-out?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: I wanted the ball but they put two on me. I should have
popped out to the wing and got it, but I don't know. They made a good
defensive play.  
  
Q. You had three blocks tonight, and you guys as a team held the Player
of the Year to eight points. How did you think you guys did defensively?  
PATRICK STEEVES: I think we did really well defensively holding them below 45
percent, really focusing on T.J. Cline and trying to limit his touches and get
the ball out of his hands.  
  
Yeah, I mean, we can't really ask to be in a better position against this team
than down one with the ball out-of-bounds and seven seconds left and two time-
outs. Just didn't fall our way, I guess.  
  
Q. Could you kind of describe this journey at the end of the season
where you've gone through six games, all wins, beating Dayton, winning this
first A-10 game but then losing this in kind of heartbreaking fashion?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Yeah, we really found our stride late in the season. Made
good plays. We beat good teams. I mean, six in a row, that's big for us. We
battled last night. We were resilient against a good Saint Louis team. Thought
we had this one tonight. So it's tough.  
  
Q. What did you draw up at the end on the last play? Was it geared
towards Tyler or were there other options?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Yeah, it was geared towards Tyler. We run a play where we kind
of leg whip them and roll the ball in, and just let him wheel and deal close
to the basket. We knew he would have a guard on him because T.J. Cline was
guarding him at the time. So Buckingham, who is a pretty tough kid, 6-4, 6-5,
whatever he is; we knew we would have size advantage, so we would leg whip
him, because it's a play we have.  
  
But they did a good job. I think they brought a second guy to him, so Tyler
couldn't get the rock. But the second option is to throw the ball over the top
to Yuta who was being guarded by Joe Kirby, who we knew was 6-1 or whatever it
is, or the plan was, can't get him to Tyler, just go right over the top to
Yuta; and he just had the ball on his right side to kind of drive to the
middle with his left hand which is his strength. And only down one, we want to
either try to get to the basket, get fouled; we didn't want to shoot a
jumpshot. We wanted it to be a bump-and-grind type of play.  
  
I think the pass was kind of further out than Yuta expected for some reason.
Usually when we run it, we want to get it tight and be able to turn the
corner, but he was all the way outside the three-point line, and when he drove
it, he did a good job of digging off the opposite wing. They got a hand on the
ball.  
  
Didn't really see the play. O haven't seen it on a replay or anything like
that but I think they got a hand on the ball and Yuta was unable to get to the
rim. And then we were trying to have another guy space out as a last option
for a jumpshot, and they made a good defensive play, taking away our first
option. And when we got the ball to our second option, they made the good
defensive play at the end.  
  
Q. Defensively for them, what changed, maybe in those last seven or
eight minutes? Tyler was held without a shot for the last 7:34.  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, they went to their zone, and they did a good job of just
kind of staying on top of them, and you know, we had some pretty stagnant
possessions there where we took some last-second shots. And they did a good
job of switching, especially defenses, and the way they play, you never know
if they are in a matchup zone where we could screen them or within our
traditional zone. So they did a good job of masking what they wanted to do,
and that made us stagnant a little bit.  
  
We got a couple good looks. We ran a play for Jordan, he knocked it down and
we ran another play late and we scored on it. So we found our stride in it, so
we did a better job late. But there was a couple possessions there that they
did a good job of staying topside on Tyler, avoiding us.  
  
You can't just sit there and kind of just look for him and look for him, just
wasting time, seconds off the clock. Credit to them; they did a great job of
taking away our best player. I think we did the same to them on the other end.
So kind of like a chess match and they won the final -- they had a good final
move there.  
  
T.J. Cline, eight points, three-for-nine shooting. That's a really good team.
I thought our guys did a pretty good job overall.  
  
Q. Whether or not there's more basketball to play, how do you feel the
team has progressed since you got the interim tag since Game 1?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Leaps and bounds, exponentially. Look at guys like J.B. who
has turned himself into a pretty good Atlantic 10 guard. He couldn't remember
two plays in a row when he first got here, you know what I mean, so he's
improved classically.  
  
Pat Steeves found his stride. He got healthy. He went through, suffered and
injury and came back stronger than ever; had monster games.  
  
Jordan Roland took a major jump this year in production and confidence. I'm
looking for him to become a really good player in this league. I think he has
a great off-season of work ahead of him. I think he could be really, really
good in this league.  
  
You look at down the line, we have really talented freshmen: Smith, Toro,
Marfo, are all going to get better in the off-season. They are a really good
team. Watanabe and Jaren Sina are going to be some really experienced players.
Jaren is going to be a fifth-year guy.  
  
So we've improved. We finished the season on a six-game winning streak.
Assists, our offense, everything was clicking. We just grew gradually
throughout the course of the year and it shows in our stats and we improved
defensively from being one of the bottom teams defensively in the league to
being top five or top six or whatever it was in terms of field goal defense
and points allowed.  
  
We finished the leading league play as the best three-point shooting team. I
remember we aren't there earlier in the year. We weren't shooting the ball as
well. So we improved. We improved. Our guys came to work every day. They
trusted the process. They stayed the course and we just kind of chopped wood.
We just kept chopping wood. We just kept getting and better. Win or lose, our
plan was to keep getting better and better and we did that all year I thought.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Hassan Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32943)

### [E.C. Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28611)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
RHODE ISLAND 74, St. Bonaventure 63  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously thrilled with the win over a team like Bonaventure 11-7
in conference, and with those two tremendous guards, and Denzel Gregg who has
developed into a tremendous forward player, and as incredibly as good of
coached team as you can play. Obviously the difference in the game was on
defense overall. And then, the two guys to my right who kind of came in
together, and played I thought a really, really high level today. So great
win. And then obviously got to turn the page quickly and get ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys beat Bonaventure in regular season. How much do you follow
--  
E.C. MATTHEWS: It was pretty simple with us. We emphasized making winning
plays and we made more winning plays than them. We got the results we wanted.
It's the same with any other team. We're not really focused on them. It's more
about us and the mind-set we have.  
  
HASSAN MARTIN: Just the key was just to be real physical down low and use our
depth to an advantage, and just really rebound and defend like we've been
doing these past games, and we've been really successful. That's about it.  
  
Q. You only trailed once today for 19 seconds, and you made a three and
went on a run after that. Can you speak to the way you responded and took
control of the game quickly again?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: We've been through a lot this whole season. So I mean, that
comes out when a team makes runs or things go bad. We look at each other and
we just know we've been there before. We just relax and we believe in each
other and trust each other.  
  
Q. When you guys have a size advantage like do you over the Bonnies, how
much do you take it upon yourself to sort of be the guy inside in the paint?  
HASSAN MARTIN: Just got focus really on catching the ball when they lob it and
going up strong to the basket. They didn't have that much size, so when the
guys lobbed it, I was just there to finish it.  
  
Q. Kind of just answered it but this was a carbon copy to that first
game with Bonaventure in terms of what you guys were able to do inside against
them, really for you personally, just having your way in both games what in
that matchup, what is it in that matchup that allows you to have that success
inside against Bonaventure?  
HASSAN MARTIN: Just footwork and technique, the way I feel them up the lane,
and just the guard looking for me. They've just got to trust me when they lob
it, and I've just got to catch it and finish.  
  
Q. Against Davidson in the regular season, it seems like you did a good
job of bottling them up, especially Gibbs and Aldridge, and the second game
being closer. What's it going to take tomorrow to have a similar result as far
as being able to bottle both of them up?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: More winning plays. Davidson is a good team. I'm pretty sure
Jack Gibbs and the rest of them are going to fight hard tomorrow. So we're
going to have a game plan. We're going to listen to Coach, but our motto is
just making winning plays.  
  
Q. What did you guys make of that result of Davidson taking Dayton out,
and having to play Davidson for a third time and not having a chance to play
Dayton for a third time?  
HASSAN MARTIN: Either way, we've got to come out and play no matter who we
got. So we've still got the same focus. Davidson is a great team. Just got to
come hungrier than them. The way we played these past few games, we've been
really successful. Just got to handle adversity well during the game and I
think we'll be fine.  
  
E.C. MATTHEWS: What he said.  
  
Q. Did you notice any difference between the St. Bonny you played in
January and the St. Bonny you played tonight?  
DAN HURLEY: No, you know, we're just probably a little bit healthier. Jarvis
-- I don't know if Jarvis played in that game. I can't remember; had so many
guys miss games this year. He was able to help us. He only played 16 minutes
today.  
  
So probably the one difference in the game is that we're just a lot healthier
team, and I think just our depth showed in the game. They were playing
freshmen versus we've got men, especially in the front court.  
  
Q. St. Bonaventure is playing a lot of different defenses, switching it
up. How did you guys sort of stay focused on what you wanted to do?  
DAN HURLEY: You know, we were -- obviously we spent, we didn't practice Sunday
or Monday. But then Tuesday and Thursday, we worked on Bonaventure, mostly
against the two-three and the one-three-one. And I thought we handled the one-
three-one incredibly well today, throwing over the top on the weak side versus
their smaller guards matched up with Kuran and Hassan, and we used Wednesday
to get ready for UMASS. We spent two of the three prep days getting ready for
the Bonnies and their zone.  
  
We turned the ball over, a lot, but I thought we consistently got pretty good
shots and shot 55 percent from the field. So I liked how we attacked the zone
today; patience.  
  
Q. I'm sure you expected them to make a run coming out of the locker
room. They take the lead. When E.C. makes that shot and you guys go off on
your own run, can you talk about how big a swing that was there in the game?  
DAN HURLEY: I mean, you could almost anticipate what Mark was telling his team
right there at the half. They were down six, and they probably in all fairness
probably should have been down more like 16 to 18. The free throw line, we had
a little flashback to some free throw struggles, and then obviously we missed
a couple Bonnies (ph) there, transitioned Jared, missed the layup, missed one
or two others.  
  
We knew they were going to come out and surge a little bit because I think
they felt fortunate to only be down six. We're a resilient team. Dealt with a
lot of stuff the whole year, dealt with the preseason expectations and then
just dealt with a couple guys being down for extended periods of time.  
  
You know, so we're resilient and gritty. There was no panic. I was pretty
comfortable that we would respond.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you needed this win to keep the at-large bid in
play or alive?  
DAN HURLEY: I think that that's obviously on the periphery. I think we knew
that Bonny's represented a top hundred win for us; neutral site, another top
hundred. I think that probably came into the focus as I was walking out on to
the court a little bit, because you see Davidson beat Dayton, and Davidson
moves into the top hundred. And so now you're accumulating a chance today to
pick up three top hundred wins and improve your resumé.  
  
Since we landed here and since we started practicing earlier in the week, all
we're thinking about is taking this one step at a time and trying to win a
championship, and not put it in the hands of a bunch of people that we've
never met.  
  
Q. You were just talking about health and you guys seem like you're
hitting your stride at the right time; do you feel like you're hitting your
stride at the right time?  
DAN HURLEY: Again, I think early in the year, you know, we beat Cincinnati in
a high-level, Top-25 matchup with a lot at stake at Mohegan. And you play Duke
and you lose to them, and you beat Belmont at home. And then you go out and
you play two road games back-to-back that not a lot of people at that time of
year are willing to play at Valpo and at Providence.  
  
And at Providence, Hassan, he tears his quad and you see how important he is
to us. The guy's a monster. You know, if he was healthy, he would have had a
chance to get Player of the Year in the league.  
  
So I think it's as simple as we just got healthier late in the year. After the
Fordham game, we hit rock bottom. We had the devastating late loss to Dayton,
and bottomed out against Fordham, and just decided at that point, these guys
decided they wanted to bear down and have a chance to be great, late.  
  
Q. The combo of Jaylen Adams and Matt Mobley are pretty lethal in the
league, but you really knocked them out of their comfort zone. How you were
you guys able to do that?  
DAN HURLEY: We were trying to follow the ball -- we were willing to give up
the tough twos, the contested mid-range jumpshots to Andoh and Gregg and
Ayeni. We were willing to give those up. Obviously we just wanted the ball out
of Adam's hands as much as we could. We were staying a long time on those ball
screens, hedging them hard.  
  
Jared Terrell obviously didn't have a great offensive game today, but I mean,
he held -- I voted, you know -- I had Matt Mobley as borderline first-teamer
in this conference this year. This guy's been amazing. Jared, to hold him to
no field goals in the game, that's a major, major effort. Our pregame goal was
we felt if those guys didn't combine, we wanted to keep both guys under 30
combined, and we were able to do it.  
  
Q. What's your early impression of the Davidson matchup, and Jack Gibbs,
in particular?  
DAN HURLEY: It's still fresh in our minds. We know we had to Storm back in the
second half to win both games. So they are playing right now with a little bit
of that magic. You know, Jack Gibbs and Payton Aldridge are as good of players
as you'll have to face in this league.  
  
Bob McKillop is as good a coach as you'll have to face in this league, and
they have kind of got that Cinderella feeling right now. You know, we know
what they do. They know what we do. It's going to be, I'd imagine, a hard-
fought game, semifinal A-10 game.  
  
Q. You've spoken before about seniors, wanting to extend their career
when you get into a conference tournament, and it looks like Jack Gibbs is
desperately trying to extend his career. What do you do when you face an
opponent like that who is talented and also has mind-set right now?  
DAN HURLEY: You try to do obviously some of the same things we did with Mobley
and Adams. He's so clever. I was able to watch, just waiting for our turn to
get out there. I was able to watch what he did down the stretch, and man, that
was cold-blooded, what he was doing out there. I mean, he closed in a hostile
-- somewhat of a hostile environment versus the best team in the league, and a
high-level defensive team.  
  
So we know what we got tomorrow. We've got our hands full. We easily could
have been 0-2 versus those guys this year, so our guys and our staff, you
know, has as much respect for the challenge with Davidson as we do with anyone
we'll play in this league.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Matt Mobley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32870)

### [Jaylen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32871)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
ST. BONAVENTURE 73, UMass 60  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: I thought we played well. I thought our zone was really
effective. I thought early on, we started man and Massachusetts got us a
little bit on the rebounding. But in the end, we out-rebounded them by one. I
thought those two guys up here really controlled the game. Played well. Shot
the ball well. Distributed the ball well.  
  
You know, when we get that third and fourth guy scoring the basketball, good
things can happen, and I thought with David coming in and shooting the ball
well and Josh, that gives us two more guys that they have to guard. We knew
UMASS was going to play that triangle and two, and they did.  
  
But I thought our role guys did a very good job of stepping up and making some
shots and taking some pressure off of Jay and Matt. I thought we did a great
job of defending, getting to the three-point line, and when we get to the foul
line, we're a good foul-shooting team most of the time and shooting 88 percent
was a big key, as well.  
  
You win, and now we look forward to playing Rhode Island, a great team
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much did having seen what they did defensively just six days ago
help you guys be prepared for facing it today?  
MATT MOBLEY: Like Coach said, we knew they were going to triangle and two, and
there were going to be other people open, and knocked down shots early, forced
them to get out of it.  
  
Q. Having shot as poorly as you did on Saturday, does this feel like a
little bit of a redemption?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, still didn't shoot that good from the three, for me
personally, but yeah, felt we played better than game two. That included you,
Nelson, both of you and Nelson, and that group really seemed to do pretty
well. R together and sort of extend it where you were able to take that
18-point lead. Just what was it about that lineup, that group, that allowed
you to do that?  
  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Gave us another ball handler. He was able to stick shots. I
think he came in and hit a three. He played well and he just kind of took some
of the pressure to handle the ball off of us.  
  
Q. Matt, what was it like to get the first couple of shots to go down
for you, because Saturday was a bit of a struggle. Confidence builder?  
MATT MOBLEY: Yeah, I wanted to come out early, knock down a few shots to get
me going, get our team going, and I was able to do that early on. So it helped
us and it gave us a little momentum.  
  
Q. (Off-mic).  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I mean, it's tough to beat any team three times. They kind of
know what we do. We know what they do. Comes down to who is tougher. We came
out and we rebounded well today. We defended and when you play a team three
times, there's not much X's and O's, because they are going to be on
everything that you do. I think we came out, we competed and we fought.  
  
Q. You guys, the two of you combined for only three made baskets just a
couple days ago against this team. Obviously today you were more closer to
what you normally would be. What do you think was the main difference there?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: I mean, I think we were a little bit more aggressive early. We
saw the triangle and two in the past. It kind of slowed us down. But like I
said, when you play a team three times, you know what they are going to do. We
expected it and worked on it all week and we came out ready to go.  
  
Q. You're going to have a stiffer test tomorrow with Rhode Island. You
got a little sloppy there; Mark was not thrilled with about six minutes left
or whatever it was. What needs to be done to boat a team like Rhode Island?  
MATT MOBLEY: We've got to take care of the ball, first game, they beat us up
on the boards, too. We've just got to take care of the ball, play aggressive,
don't get too stagnant; they will be denying halfcourt. We just have to be
aggressive and knock down shots.  
  
JAYLEN ADAMS: Just more of the same. A team like Rhode Island is really
physical. So I think we've got to rebound, make shots and hit free throws, and
we should be fine.  
  
Q. Kind of saw a little bit of a blueprint today where you had four
double digits scorers and close to a fifth with Denzel and played pretty good
defense all game. How important is that going to be to see throughout the rest
of this tournament here if you guys are going to keep advancing?  
JAYLEN ADAMS: We understand the most important things is we've got to defend.
Shots are not always going to fall for us, but if they are in the going if
fall for us, they are not going to fall for the other team. I think we came
out in the right energy and we have to have more of the same tomorrow, have to
be ready to defend.  
  
Q. Mark, the last two games, you held them to their lowest point totals
of the season. Do you feel like as much as you preach defense, this is a great
time to be doing that?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we're playing much better. You know, we're more committed.
I think our zone is helping us. We rebounded the ball well today. We forced 18
turnovers and we had 19 points off of turnovers.  
  
So our defense was really a catalyst today, and it has been for a few games
and hopefully it needs to be if we're going to beat a team as good as Rhode
Island tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is it over simplifying that saying beating the two-three --  
MARK SCHMIDT: Beating who?  
  
Q. The two-three.  
MARK SCHMIDT: The two-three zone? It's not really a two-three zone. I won't
give away too many secrets, but there's a lot of things to it.  
  
You know, so it's not -- my former boss, Skip, used to say, two-three zone is
a "hands-up, Harry and hope they miss." We don't have a two-three, hope-they-
miss-zone. It's a little bit more man-to-man principles.  
  
It's like anything, man-to-man or zone, you try to make -- shoot contested
shots, keep the ball above the fall line and if the ball goes in, try to get
it out of there. It's the same principles but it's a little bit different than
the hands-up, Harry.  
  
Q. You held UMASS to 60 today and 56 on Saturday. What was it UMASS did
that you needed to do to stop them defensively and was there anything that you
told your guys, we need to do this in order to stop them?  
MARK SCHMIDT: One, we have to keep them out of transition. They are a good
transition team; keep them out of halfcourt, and you have to take care of the
basketball. Bucky was talking about me getting upset a little bit. We got
lackadaisical with the ball a couple times, and that's when they got out and
had dunks and got some shots.  
  
You have to keep them out of transition. And their jump shooters, they are
huge. Compared to us, they are mountains. The game can't be played below the
foul line. We needed to keep it above the foul line, and I thought for the
most part, we did that.  
  
Q. You talked about the importance of having your third and fourth guys
in there, and today it was third, fourth, add Kaputo, fifth, probably six or
seven, where it wasn't just those two guys. If you play that way -- seems to
me if you play that way, it's anybody's game.  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, the more guys that we can get involved in our offense,
scoring the basketball, the better it is. You know, as Jay alluded to, it
takes some pressure off of them. You know, when we get that -- the third guy
is really important. But once we get that fourth guy and then Nelson comes off
the bench and hits that big three; you know, and Denzel only had eight, he's
usually a double-figure scorer. But I thought the keys today were from an
offensive standpoint were Josh and David, they did a really good job of
knocking down those mid-range jumpshots. That's what we need to do.  
  
Q. Jump shoot in practice --  
MARK SCHMIDT: I took over that. My assistants had it the last game, so I took
it over and that's why it was so much more effective. No, we got good
shooters. Denzel hits the first one and Dave hits the first one, and like
anything, once you make that first one, the rim gets a little bit bigger. Once
you miss a couple, then it shrinks and becomes a mental game.  
  
Q. This ties in with that, but that lineup at the end of the first half
really did seem to give you a boost with Nelson, Jaylen and Matt playing
together. We haven't seen that a whole lot. How happy were you with that?  
MARK SCHMIDT: We went there because we had foul trouble. Idris had two and
Denzel had two, and he was the other three man, and the concern -- and it
worked today but the concern is we have three little guys out there and it's
hard. Jay is playing the three and the rebounding part of it, and we didn't
get hurt.  
  
I thought -- you're right, we made a little run there. But in the long run, if
you go to that lineup too much, the rebounding part of it will kill you. But I
thought we did it, and Nelson really did a really good job of coming in, not
just of hitting that three but he did a good job of controlling the ball and
making some good decisions.  
  
Q. The other day we were joking a little bit, about who gets the
advantage when a team is able to play, and then Rhode Island hasn't played and
now you have, but UMASS played yesterday, and it didn't really help them. What
do you make of it now?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I said all the time, when you're 18 to 22 years old, you should
never get tired. When you're dead, you can rest. So it's just go out there and
play. We'll go back, get hydrated, get a meal in us, walk through some stuff,
and come back out and hopefully we can play well.  
  
There's no guarantees. Rhode Island hasn't played here, hasn't shot here; they
rested. But we've shot here, we're not as rested. Who knows. We made that
point against UMASS. Who knows. We're just going to go out there and play our
best and see what happens.  
  
Q. I've asked this before in some of these rematches with teams
throughout the year, but what's the biggest thing, that's what you're probably
going into tonight, but the biggest thing that needs to be different from that
first meeting with Rhode Island?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I thought we defended decently. You know, I think they blocked
15 shots against us. You know, we didn't shoot the ball well. They out-
physical'ed us I thought. We've got to play better. You know, physically, we
have got to play better. We've got to match them more on the backboard. We've
got to take care of the basketball.  
  
They are polar opposite of what you saw today with UMASS with the zone and
triangle and two, and being out in the passing lanes and being aggressive and
using their athleticism and their size.  
  
So we have to play a little bit differently. But I thought Game 1, they
manhandled us at times, and you know, you can't win doing that.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Marquise Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32897)

### [Otis Livingston II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32898)

### [Jalen Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32899)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
GEORGE MASON 82, Fordham 71  
  
DAVE PAULSEN: I mean, that was pretty unbelievable. I don't know that I've
ever been a part of that big of a comeback that late in the game, and you
know, everything had to go right for us, and I give our guys just a tremendous
amount of credit for their grit, for their resolve, for not getting rattled,
for making big plays, and obviously that energized us in the second half.  
  
The one thing I'll say about this team, there were stretches in the second
half, it was ugly, from us. And we've had that a few times during the year.
But the one thing I'll say about our guys, whether we're playing pretty or
we're playing ugly, we fought every single night this year, and it was good
for them to be rewarded.  
  
You know, these three guys obviously were huge but a lot of guys made just
little extra energy plays. I thought Jaire Grayer, who is not in here right
now, a couple big offensive rebounds and keeping possessions alive when he had
maybe not played his best. That's what you have to do, all the time, but
certainly when you get into tournament time is you're not always going to have
your A Game, but you can always have your A Effort.  
  
Q. Take us through that last minute, including the free throws at the
end.  
MARQUISE MOORE: Coach told me to be aggressive in the last minute to 30
seconds. So I got to the rim, got fouled, had two free throws, pretty much
blew it. But Jay fought for the offensive rebound, so thankfully we got that,
and then O made a huge play driving and kicking to Jay. And Jay came up with a
huge finish.  
  
Then going into overtime, we felt like we had the momentum and we just wanted
to come out and just play hard, play together and just play smart, is what we
did.  
  
Q. Can you describe what the play call was coming out of the huddle on
the final play in regulation, and walk us through what happened?  
JALEN JENKINS: Honestly, I for got. I'm not going to lie to you. O got the
ball and Coach told us in the last minute, just be aggressive. Caught it,
ripped through, and he got by his man. And we do lunge moves every day; as
boring as they are, we do them every single day, and I was in the lunge spot,
O ditched it to me, and a simple layup.  
  
Q. The transition from last season to this season, what led to the
success you guys had for maybe those that are not as familiar, and for you to
take that success and bottle it into a game like this to have this kind of an
outcome?  
MARQUISE MOORE: Really just shows our maturity, our resilience. We grew up a
lot over that last year, just coming together as one. We learned how to fight.
We learned how to stay mentally and physically tough. We just showed that in
that overtime period and the last two or three minutes of that game, we just
stuck together through adversity and was able to come up with the win.  
  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Pretty much what marquis said. We took a lot of losses
last year. We had a lot of like -- it was -- we just went through a lot as a
team last year. So I think we really just grew up a whole lot like Marquise
said, and I think we see that this year with how we're playing when it comes
down to making those big plays.  
  
Q. Otis, a lot of times in a situation like you were in at the end of a
clock, at the end of a game, you see guys rush shots before the clock goes
off. How were you able to kind of show that poise, know how much time you had,
to even make a pass to Jalen so he could tie up the game?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: I don't know, I just, I don't like to rush. I like to slow
the game down for me for myself. I saw that the lane was like wide open, so I
knew that was going to be there and at that point it's just a matter of
knowing what all your options are going to be.  
  
So I just drove and I knew I had a finish or a pass to Jalen, so when I went,
his man came up so I knew it was just the pass to Jalen. So just staying calm
and just thinking the game and just slowing down a little bit.  
  
Q. Playing VCU, what are your thoughts after fueling to them twice?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: I'm really excited. We all are, you know, we want to play
them again and we're really looking forward to that, to say the least. So they
are a great team, and you know, we just have to learn from the last game and I
think we should be fine.  
  
Q. What is it that you have to learn from the last game against VCU?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: Stay poised I think. You know, we got what we wanted on
offense when we made two or three passes. We got to the rim any time we wanted
to. We got the shots that we wanted when we played the right way on offense.  
  
I think just staying patient on offense, and on defense, just locking in and
playing with the edge, like how we played near the end of this game today. We
were really like sharp on defense to close out the game.  
  
So staying patient on offense, making it move, and then on defense, really
locking in and playing with the edge.  
  
Q. Wondering your strategy after Marquise misses the first free throw.
Do you want him to make it or miss it? What's the strategy?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Well, truthfully, all year long, whatever I've told him to do,
he did the opposite. So I told him to make it so that he would miss it so that
we could get the rebound.  
  
No, you know, I told him to make it because there was still like six seconds
left, right, and that's a long time. So we could foul and if he makes it,
we're down one, you still have time to race it up to the rim. They miss some
free throws.  
  
But we also -- and I give credit, Dave Fisher said to me, because Jalen had
sat for awhile was we were pressing and we were going smaller, to get Jalen
for the rebound. I've got a great stat, and oh, let's get Jalen there in case
he misses it and jail kept it alive.  
  
Then we ran kind of a special out-of-bounds play, and that would have been
fine, like if Otis was free for a three. I had confidence in him to go for the
win.  
  
One of the things somebody said, what was it he learned. Like in a lot of our
losses, he has kind of rushed stuff and tried to make a great play, and he was
really poised and calm and just he made the right play. And so that was really
great, and not only for us to win tonight's game, but what we have to do if
we're going to play better against a really good VCU team tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Did you sense it slipping away in that last minute and a half or so?
Could you kind of see it in your players' body language?  
DAVE PAULSEN: That we were in danger of losing? Yeah, yeah, big time, yeah.
You know, I mean, it's so fickle all year long, the game, but certainly we get
to March. So there must have been three late shot clock, desperation, three-
pointers that Fordham hit. Hawkins hit one, Anderson hit one, and I think
there was another on, like late. Like we guarded incredibly well and they hit
them. And you're like, Ohhhh, you know. And then they missed some free throws,
and that's the crazy thing.  
  
But you know, the big challenge for this team, and this was a great step, was
how do you handle adversity. Because everyone's a great player when things are
going well. You know, I don't think we handled it that well for stretches
there in the second half. But you couldn't have done a better job in the last
men or whatever it was.  
  
So that's something we can grow from.  
  
Q. After the VCU game the other day, you said you petitioned to have
Tillman graduate with the rest of the guys. He is going to play tomorrow
night. What do you have to do to stop him --  
DAVE PAULSEN: He is?  
  
Q. Yeah, I think he will be.  
DAVE PAULSEN: Darn.  
  
Q. What changes do you think your team has to make?  
DAVE PAULSEN: We have to grow. I don't know if that's going to happen
overnight. We have to try to find a way to keep him off the glass. Now he made
some really good like jump hooks and like offensive post plays, you know, that
if, boy, I mean, was really impressive.  
  
But it was his offensive rebounding, and again, we play with four guards.
We're small. We've been a good rebounding team all year long. We've led the
conference in rebound margin but we struggled to keep VCU off the glass. I
think they only got eight offensive rebounds in that game but every one seemed
to lead to a basket.  
  
You know, we've just got to find a way. But he's a handful and he's not the
only one. Mo Alie-Cox and JeQuan Lewis and the rest of the group, it's a
veteran group and you know, they defended at a really, really high level.  
  
Q. You guys have lost twice to VCU this year. What's one thing you have
to do differently to beat them tomorrow?  
DAVE PAULSEN: Well, one, we have to keep them off the glass; and two, we can't
turn it over. And Otis touched on it; so that was good. So hopefully somehow
that message got through and it translated.  
  
When we did move the ball against VCU, we had some good shot opportunities and
when we tried to come down and like make a great play early on, and there's a
fine line. Now I thought tonight, in trying to move the ball, we played
tentatively and we played on our heels for stretches of time against a Fordham
zone. So it's a fine line of being aggressive and being patient. There's more
art than science to playing offensive basketball, and hopefully again, the
last, whatever, six minutes, will be a springboard for us.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Jeff Neubauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26822)

### [Joseph Chartouny](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30527)

### [Javontae Hawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32894)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
GEORGE MASON 82, Fordham 71  
  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Again, I thought it was a great March basketball game, both
teams played very well. And I give George Mason a lot of credit down the
stretch. They made a couple big shots.  
  
These two big guys to my right really played well today and gave us a chance
to win. We were down by five at halftime and our guys fought and competed and
took the game, and then we just weren't able to make free throws down the
stretch.  
  
Q. What was the --  
JAVONTAE HAWKINS: Just stay positive, we were down five at the half. As the
leader of the team, just brought the guys together and stayed positive. It's a
game of runs, so we just had to made a run, and we made a run the second half,
had a chance to win.  
  
Q. What was working for your game, especially in the second half? You
were on fire and you hit that long three fading away. What was going through
your head at that point to get you guys ahead?  
JAVONTAE HAWKINS: Just the momentum on defense we had. That's what got my
offensive game going. That's what got others going. The momentum we had on
defense getting stops and just being scrappy on defense.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, how do you guys, you know, what went wrong in the
last minute or so?  
JOSEPH CHARTOUNY: I think the problem was we just allowed them to do whatever
they want every time they were driving. They were either getting calls or
finishing at the rim. So yeah, that's it.  
  
Q. You mentioned the free throws down the stretch, the two front ends
missed by Antwoine but was there anything else down the stretch, the final 30
seconds?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, so defensively, I wouldn't have done anything different,
other than the loose balls/loose rebounds. We didn't come up with them. Not
only at the end of the game but throughout the game and you look at the
rebound margin, that does -- sometimes a rebound margin didn't really tell the
tale. In this game where we only got seven steals, it really is an important
number.  
  
So we didn't get loose rebounds, loose balls down the stretch but when you
miss two front ends and then Chris missed one, as well. So we left five points
at the free throw line; those are costly.  
  
Q. How do you want your team to play that last second shot? You don't
want to foul. You want to play tight enough defense that you keep them from
getting it but you don't want to put them at the line, either, so what do you
tell your team?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, so they took the ball a long way in 3.5 seconds, however
many seconds it was, they took the ball a long way. Meaning with a two-point
lead there, we are not going to play zone, because a three beats you. In that
situation on the basket out-of-bounds, we're going to play man every single
time. And Livingston drove the ball from 29, 30 feet away, got all the way to
the rim and dropped it off.  
  
So what it comes down to is guarding the ball better. Better one-on-one
defense in that situation. But you have to give George Mason credit. They
didn't just jack up some shot. They were really patient and attacking at the
same time.  
  
Q. Just talked with Javontae, really willed you guys back in the second
laugh to get you ahead. Just the one-year graduate transfer but you've known
him for many more. Now that the season is unfortunately over, what did he
bring to the program this career?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Well, you look at how he and Joe played, as far as the talent
level that they have; how they played today really sums up a lot about our
program, a lot about Javontae. Those two guys are very good Atlantic 10
players, and it showed today. So that's the main thing he brought is not only
athleticism but a level of talent where he was able to lead us in scoring and
then also guard at the other end.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Jack Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28594)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
DAVIDSON 82, LaSalle 71.  
  
BOB McKILLOP: I was hitting the ball well today, made some puts. Helped that a
very hard-fought game. I looked at the stats in the first half, I think it was
16 assists and three turnovers. I thought we built a comfort level until La
Salle elevated the level of their defense in the second half and forced us
into turnovers and sped us up. I think they then got transition baskets, and
that put us on our heels.  
  
We've been on our heels in several games this year in the last four to five
minutes, and I think we've learned some lessons, because we made some big
plays at the crunch time that we needed to make. It was just a great learning
experience for our guys, to be put in that position again, and to show what
they have learned in a short period since the Rhode Island game, since the
Dayton game, since the St. Bonaventure game. So I'm very pleased with our
victory.  
  
Q. You've opened the A10 tournament against LaSalle eight straight
times. What effect does that have this time around, as far as familiarity?  
JACK GIBBS: I wouldn't say it was very familiar. They have a lo of new
players, and we just want to treat it like every game we want to come out and
play our game no matter who the opponent is. It's no like it's another game.
It wasn't really a familiar thing just kind of coming in.  
  
Q. What was the key, they cut it to three. What was the key in fighting
back at that moment and kind of regaining control?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Like Coach said, they sped us up a little bit there to cut
down the lead. We wanted to stay patient, and I really think it started on the
defensive end. We got stops that allowed us to get in transition and flow a
little bit and get some open looks. Jack had the breakaway, easy two points.
It was just getting stops and just settling down a little bit.  
  
Q. And for both of you, can you describe, you had the steal, you ripped
it away, you went down, laid it up and he followed with the dunk. Can you
describe that play?  
JACK GIBBS: They tried to throw it in the post and we were taught to get our
hands up and make it a difficult pass. I ended up catching it and I moan, I
wasn't trying to make the layup. I actually saw him coming so I was really
throwing off the backboard. I don't know if you can throw that down as an
assist. He followed the play. He didn't give up on it, and he dunked it.
That's a big play. Brought some excitement and energy to our team when we
needed it and helped us pour through the rest of the game.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I know Jack is going to be attacking the hoop hard and they
are going to be blocking shots so, I just was trying to follow up and just
glad it came off.  
  
Q. Jon Axel could have been up here for what he did with points and
assists. How would you describe he was able to dish the ball so effectively
today?  
JACK GIBBS: He's big part of our team. He's a great guard and he sees the
floor very well. When he's shooting the ball, he's very tough to stop. You've
just got to keep him out of foul trouble. But he's a good player and he
definitely brings another dimension to our team, along with Kishawn, with ball
handling and kind of giving them different looks with point guards, rather
than me bringing it up every time and I think it makes our team tougher to
guard, especially when he's making shots.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround, Dayton tomorrow. How do you make sure that you're
ready for that challenge, and they haven't played yet.  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, we're just going to make sure we get back, make sure
we're ready.  
  
JACK GIBBS: We played them a couple weeks or two ago -- I mean, they are a
great team, they are No. 1 in the conference, for a reason, so I mean, it's
going to be a tough battle, but we're looking forward to it. That's why we're
playing in the A-10. You know it's going to be a tough game no matter who
you're playing against on the court. We're excited about it and ready for the
challenge.  
  
Q. From three, La Salle in the first half especially, seemed to be
hitting the two guys, which names I'm blanking on. You guys, from a defensive
standpoint, is it more kind of like, they are going to get their shots and you
just need to limit them in other ways, or how do you approach that?  
JACK GIBBS: Ideally they wouldn't make any threes but they are good shooters.
We have a lot of great players in this league, and sometimes they are going to
make shots.  
  
So it's just trying to make it as difficult as they can to find shots, find
open looks and try to keep them out of a rhythm so this doesn't snowball into
them barraging us with threes.  
  
Yeah, just try to make it as difficult as possible. But they hit some tough
shots today and I mean, hats off, I think it was Price and Powell, pretty good
shooters.  
  
Q. Coach, just describe the ball movement in the first half, I mean, 16
assists, that's already more than you average per game.  
BOB McKILLOP: We had great rhythm and great flow. Credit our assistant coaches
with the dress rehearsals that we had on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in
terms of, it's like a Broadway production. You practice dance steps and then
you put it all together, and the music goes on and the dance looks wonderful.  
  
Well, we rehearsed our dance steps on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, in terms of
cuts, whether it was slip and a screen, whether it was bowl and a screen, back
cutting, front cutting, and there was a natural flow to it.  
  
And all of a sudden, they started putting a little bit more pressure on us and
elevating their pressure instead of being able to pass the ball, we were
dribbling it. And the dribble prevented us from seeing the open cuts of the
dance steps that we were making. And that's as simple as it gets. If you want
to be a great offensive team, you'd better be able to see the dance steps
being danced.  
  
Q. How big were Jon Axel's threes in the first half?  
BOB McKILLOP: Well, two of them were with five seconds or less on the clock.
We call those daggers. Those are the kind of things that a defensive team is
good for 25 seconds and boom, they play the whole session, and they give up
that three; so incredibly big.  
  
Q. Jon Axel did have a career-high in 16 points today. Can you talk
about what his role was in the offense today and how you'd like to see that
develop going forward?  
BOB McKILLOP: I thought his role offensively was multi-faceted, whether it was
handling the ball as a secondary point guard, whether it was hard cuts, which
he made a lot of, whether it was making the shots, which he did a superb job
of.  
  
But let's not look past his defense. I thought his defense was pretty darned
good, as well. For a freshman to be charged with the responsibility of
defending a scorer like Jordan Price is highly unusual. That's the kind of
confidence we have in Jon Axel.  
  
Q. For a noon game on a Thursday, it seemed like the atmosphere was
pretty solid out there. What can you say about Pittsburgh so far?  
BOB McKILLOP: The Atlantic 10 is a tremendous conference. Incredible
conference. I watched tournaments unfold during this last week, and I stack
our conference against any of the power five conferences in terms of
organization, in terms of facility, and the City of Pittsburgh, we love it
here. Our program loves it here. I can remember back in 1972, I used to work
five-star camp over in Coraopolis and I loved coming to Pittsburgh. So it's
been a love affair I've had for over 35 years; 45 years. I'm really old
(chuckles).  
  
Q. It seemed like Aldridge in the first and second half sparked runs for
you guys. What allows him to kind of do that?  
BOB McKILLOP: He's fearless, No. 1. No. 2, he's got great versatility. He has
a great basketball IQ. What he makes -- what he lacks in maybe explosive
athleticism, he makes up for with pinpoint passing, precise shooting and
superb cutting, screening. He has an understanding about where to be at what
time and when.  
  
Q. You spoke about your offensive flow today. Tomorrow it's a big
challenge against Dayton. How confident are you in your team's ability to keep
that up tomorrow against the Flyers.  
BOB McKILLOP: Dayton will speed us up. Arguably between them and Rhode Island,
the two best defensive teams man-to-man in the conference. They will make it
an adventure to pass and to catch. They will make it an adventure to cut to
screen. We have to be as precise as can be. There is no margin for error
whatsoever.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [DeJon Jarreau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32866)

### [Rashaan Holloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30560)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
ST. BONAVENTURE 73, UMass 60  
  
DEREK KELLOGG: That was kind of a frustrating game for us. I thought we had a
good game plan in place, and they did a very good job of attacking our
triangle and two, and kind of one-three-one and 3D defense that worked so
well, five, six days ago. I think they probably took every second of every day
from that point to now and prepared for it. Whether it was UMASS or Saint
Joe's, I thought they did a really good job.  
  
And then we had ten turnovers at the half for ten points, and they played a
pretty basic two-three I thought we struggled with throughout the contest. We
made a pretty good effort in the end to try to get back in the game but a
couple plays that were kind of just some weird basketball plays we didn't kind
of get over that hump.  
  
So I thought they outplayed us today. And we're going to have to, you know,
get back at it and get back in the gym pretty quickly here after spring break.  
  
Q. How much did the fact that other guys were making shots make it
harder for the triangle in two to be effective?  
DeJON JARREAU: It was very harder because we wanted them to -- beat us and
they made shots, and we were hoping that if they miss shots, try to take
Mobley and Adams out of the game but unfortunately that didn't happen. They
made their plays.  
  
Q. How much did the fact that they were able to build a lead kind of
force you guys to rush some things offensively?  
DeJON JARREAU: It made us rush because the simple fact we were down 18 going
into halftime, coming out of halftime, we were trying to chip away at the lead
but we couldn't. They just kept making shots.  
  
Q. The season as a whole, does it feel like this for you guys that
there's some things to build ongoing forward?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: Yeah, we've got to learn how to mature on the court, you
know, and guys like myself, we need to know how to dominate every game and
come out with good energy and just learn how to win games in the second half.  
  
Q. St. Bonaventure, obviously with Mobley and Adams, when you look at
the A-10 Conference as a whole and you see these older, experienced veteran
guards who are very well some of the better players in the conference, does it
elevate you; that you know you have to match their intensity and their skill
the next few years?  
DeJON JARREAU: Yeah, I know this off-season, I've got to go and work hard so I
can get to their level, try to match that.  
  
So if I go and work hard, then I could be able to lead my team next year and
we'll be in a better place and not be up here after a loss.  
  
Q. Same question that I asked those guys. How much did Andoh and Ayeni
kind of --  
DEREK KELLOGG: Well, I will say that only five days ago, they took a lot of
those same shots and they didn't go in. So it looked like it was more
effective.  
  
When they start making that baseline jumper and that elbow jumper, you know,
we were kind of willing to give some of those up, but when seven in a row go
in, all of a sudden you have to change what were trying to do, and I thought
that affected us some.  
  
And then you kind of mentioned it: We started pressing a little bit
offensively. And that's been kind of a common theme at times when we get, you
know, kind of get playing a little faster than we'd like or taking some tough
shots.  
  
But ten turnovers at the half, they had seven extra possessions, which led to
12 points. And then, you know, the constant theme I think when we've kind of
not played as well as I would have liked or we've lost, is when teams have
shot -- they outscored us by 14 at the free throw line and we end up losing by
13. That was a little construed there. But you know, you can put that there.  
  
Q. Was the fact that you guys got behind almost feed into the turnovers
that much more because you had to hurry?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Yeah, I think so. You know, they kind of were an old school
zone to be honest with you, and we kind of pressed a little bit instead of
just getting in the middle of the paint, jump stop, make the next play, the
open play and then they were able to run out of that. Once they got a few easy
open basket, I thought that opened up the game for them some.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Jordan Roland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32911)

### [Tyler Cavanaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30539)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
GEORGE WASHINGOTN 53, Saint Louis 46  
  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Yeah, I want to credit Saint Louis for coming out of the gates
really strong. That's the second time we've played them, and that's the second
time we've started flat and they have started really well.  
  
I thought that we missed shots and we compounded that by not defending the way
we needed to. But credit to our guys on the other end, we came out in the
second half with a lot of energy. Obviously the change of defense was huge for
us. You know, we've come back from big deficits before this season, and I was
glad to see our guys dictate how they wanted their season to end. It wasn't
going to be tonight and the guys made that decision at halftime, so I'm proud
of the guys, how they fought back.  
  
But we've got to find a way to make sure to have them move on now and prepare
for the next team, because this league, there's no off-days. So tomorrow is
going to be another tough one. We have to figure out how we're going to come
out and beat a very talented Richmond team and a very good player in T.J.
Cline, Player of the Year. So back to the drawing board, get out of here, get
some food and figure it out.  
  
Q. What was Coach's message at halftime, and what in your own mind
needed to change drastically?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: He just told us, we've got to play. We were missing shots. We
were taking too many threes. We were settling. We didn't getting it inside,
but it's a credit to them the way they were defending and switching and
junking it up a little bit.  
  
But in the end, we were pressing in the first half. We've have got to go out
and have fun and just play. I know it's kind of cliché, but you've got to play
loose. And that's what this kid did and brought us back in the game, along
with Yuta. It's a big win for us.  
  
Q. Do you think that you can afford a slow start like this against
Richmond or even further progressing in the tournament?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: No, no, I mean, we battled today and got back, but Richmond
and whoever we play, hopefully next, our elite teams, and we have to be ready
to go right from the jump, elite players, and we were fortunate tonight. Saint
Louis had good looks. They just rimmed out in the beginning, because we could
have been down 20 at the half easily. We gutted it out and we've got to play
better tomorrow.  
  
Q. After the slow first half, the entire team, and you especially had
some really aggressive and good defense. What was the mind-set during that
stretch?  
JORDAN ROLAND: Yeah, just like what Tyler said, we just needed to stop
pressing and play our own game, like play more calm. I think we did that.  
  
Q. What's it like to be in a FIRST half like that where nothing is
following and as a veteran, what are you telling them to improve during the
break?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Well, it's terrible. Nothing is going in and you just see the
scoreboard, they keep scoring, we're down more. Just stay; stay the course
like we have this year and keep fighting and make enough stops. And that's a
credit to the coaches and to Coach Joseph for keeping us focused and taking it
in four-minute increments and just fighting each possession as if it's our
last, because we didn't want to go home tonight.  
  
Q. Richmond has been a tough matchup for you guys. What problems do they
cause and what do you have to do tomorrow night to have a different outcome?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: They run a very unique Princeton-style offense with a great
play maker in Cline directing it, and they have great guards. We just have to
-- whatever the coaches tell us to do, we've got to be ready to go with that
game plan and force them to take tough shots and score on them on the other
end, and I think we'll be fine. They have been two close games.  
  
Q. What motivates your team? And I'm curious, how much are you guys
fueled by defense?  
JORDAN ROLAND: I think today defense was huge. Today we switched to the one-
three-one. I think our first run that we started Yuta at the top was huge. I
think he forced a bunch of turnovers. I think defense definitely, definitely
fueled our runs today.  
  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Yeah, I mean, defense, and the last three games, the one-
three-one has worked well for us. We caused some damage with Yuta and Jordan
on top and our activity has been great.  
  
So whatever we need to do, but defense, definitely fuels us, when you get
stops, but at the end of the day you have to put the ball in the basket to get
on a run and we were fortunate enough to do that at the end with some big fast
break points and some free throws, so I'm happy.  
  
Q. Curious what you think about defense and what motivates and fuels
this team.  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, that's what we hang our hats on. I thought we finished
the year off really well defensively. The first six games, our field goal
defense was 49, 48 percent and you're just not going to win in this league
defending that poorly. We did a much better job the last 12 games,
particularly the middle six, the middle six games, where we held teams to
about 40, 41 percent.  
  
It's vital. We hang our hats on it, and we understand that defensive
rebounding is what wins championships and we've got to be able to bank on our
defense when shots aren't falling. Shots were definitely not falling in the
first half. We were 0-for-8 from the three and we were just kind of taking bad
ones. Like the guys said we were pressing and seems like we were trying to
make -- we were trying to get back in the game, get back from down eight with
one shot, you know when I'm saying. We were taking deep ones, and we just
can't do that.  
  
We got have to be able to stay the course a little better. But credit to our
guys we figured it out in the second half and went inside a little bit more.
Obviously the defensive change and defensive energy switched up in the second
half, and I'm glad our guys did it.  
  
Jordan was huge in the one-three-one, so was Yuta, their activity and hands
and all that kind of stuff, deflections, forced 16 turnovers. Just happy that
our guys really made the decision to come out in the second half and compete
at a high level.  
  
Q. In particular with Yuta, obviously getting the defensive recognition
for his efforts, you said earlier in the year he guards pipsqueaks, and it's
consistently throughout the year for him to guard Davell the way he did,
shooting the ball ineffectively, turning the ball over seven times, and
creating that defensive disposition that became infectious; how important is
that for you guys?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: He's our warrior man. He never complains about getting shots,
whether we are playing man, one three one; he's just flying around. He just
wants to compete and help our team win, and he did that tonight. I asked him
at one point, "Do you need a sub or are you tired?"  
  
And he told me, "Hell, no."  
  
And I was like, "Go do your thing, man, you're good to go." He's a warrior. He
deserves to be all conference. He's one of the most selfless teammates I've
ever met. He's a tremendous "us" guy. He's definitely not a "me" guy. He does
whatever he need for our team to be successful defensively, and again, he's
our warrior.  
  
Q. Were you at all worried at halftime, only scoring 13 points in the
first half, think you guys weren't going to be able to get the offensive side
going?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: I was definitely concerned about the fact we were pressing and
taking too many jumpshots. I thought we were shooting so many, try to get
going and we weren't taking enough inside out jumpshots. We got some good
looks that just rimmed out and just missed.  
  
But I was concerned more so about the fact that we were trying to get back
into a groove and we stopped playing inside out as much. We were trying to get
going with our jumpshots by shooting more jumpshots and they weren't falling.
Sometimes it's going to happen: First time in the arena, depth perception, all
that kind of stuff. You can make all the excuses in the world; we just weren't
making shots. So we've got to be able to play inside out and pass up good ones
for great ones, and we did that in the second half a little better. We got to
the free throw line more. We didn't get got to the free throw line a bunch but
we got to the free throw line, and you know, we just -- we have to do a better
job.  
  
So I was concerned but you know, we've had experience in this type of
situation, being down a bunch at halftime. So I felt confident the fact that
we were going it make a run. Whether or not we were going to come all the way
back and take the game over, I wasn't sure about that. But I knew we were
going to fight back and I knew we would come back, because we've done that all
year. We've been down 18, 20, 13, we've come back. We've tied games, won
games. Two games ago, we were down 18 at Fordham and we come back and we win
by one. Our guys were resilient all year, so I wasn't worried about us coming
back. I knew we would come back. I just hoped we would have enough in the tank
to finish the job and we did.  
  
Q. Princeton offenses and motion movement offenses are so successful.
What are things you can do defensively to try and slow it down?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well you've got to make sure that you understand where they
are trying to get their actions, and it's tough because there's a guy like
T.J. Cline who is making plays for them who can make up for good defense with
a tremendous pass or can make up for a good defense with a tremendous post
move.  
  
He's such a talented playmaker and player in general that he makes their
Princeton offense, or whatever they call their offense, a lot more special
than it probably is, because he's such a -- he's that special of a talent.  
  
So we have to make sure we understand what they are trying to accomplish and
this is a team that we've played twice, I think the last three years so we
know their personal really well and we know what they are trying to accomplish
and it's a matter of trying to stop it, and again, that's a tall order because
they are so talented.  
  
ShawnDre' Jones is a tremendous guard, four-year guy who has been good since
he stepped on to their campus and T.J. Cline, obviously just a monster. So we
have to make sure we come ready with a scouting report in terms of how we're
going to approach them defensively. We've got to make sure that we know that
we can't let them get going early, and we can't come out flat. And I think we
could have switched some things up from the two games we played them to
hopefully keep them off balance. Hopefully those things work and we'll look at
that when we get back to the hotel.  
  
But you can't let those guys get into a groove, because once they do, then
you're done. They are just too good, too talented, and T.J. Cline, he's a heck
of a player. So if you let them get going, it could be a long night.  
  
Q. Tyler finished 3-for-12 but got 16 rebounds. Can you talk about his
ability to be effective even when his shot is not falling?  
MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, Tyler is a warrior, man. He knows, this is his last
hoorah. He didn't want to go home tonight. He was very vocal at halftime. He
actually cut me off and jumped into the guys, and I let him go. It's their
team. It's his team. He's our horse. He's our senior captain. He's our leader
and all that kind of stuff. So I let him rock; I let him influence the
halftime speech, and he did a great job and our guys followed suit. And I said
my peace and that was that. We went on the court and we did it.  
  
He's able to affect the game in so many ways. Not just from a production
standpoint, but he shoots the ball well, he rebounds, he leads, he understands
the defensive concepts, he communicates back there defensively, and he's one
of our best scouting report guys in terms of telling other guys where to go,
so he does a tremendous job, not just from a production standpoint but he's
leadership, A to Z, he does a tremendous job for us. He's a -- that's why he's
-- why he should have been first team all conference, in my opinion, but
that's why he's an all conference guy.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jordan Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28527)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
DAVIDSON 82, LaSalle 71.  
  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: T was a game of two halves. In the first half, we didn't
always do what I had planned on defensively. And even when we did, they made
some extremely difficult shots from deep.  
  
In the second half, I thought our defense, especially in the last 15 minutes
was exactly what I want, and at a very high level. We communicated much
better. And our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our kids played
really, really hard.  
  
I'm disappointed that we weren't better as a whole in terms of our season. But
you know, we'll refresh ourselves here in the next couple weeks and get
started with a lot of veterans and some young guys that I think are going to
give us a lot of energy and that I am going to play.  
  
So it will be a fresh start for us, but right now, we're disappointed with a
hard fought loss, and our guys really gave us a chance and gave a great
effort, and especially did a good job defensively down the stretch.  
  
I thought when we cut it to three, and Demetrius Henry got a foul helping out
on a ball screen, I thought that was a momentum killer for us. But you know,
at that point, I felt really good, and we fought all the way till the end. But
I'm proud of our effort and I'm proud of Jordan, as always. He's a great
person and really proud of him.  
  
But you know, we'll lick our wounds and move forward.  
  
Q. In the first half, can you point to some yourself and the team at
large, you guys were really hitting from the three and having success. What do
you attribute what you were able to hit so well and so often the three in the
first half?  
JORDAN PRICE: We were just running our offense, getting each other open,
basically we got a cross, just dribble at our teammate and drive and man
helps, pass it to them. We were getting open shots and good looks and just
knocked them down today.  
  
Q. Jordan, just take me through a little bit, you guys are down 19 and
you came back and were right there and had a chance. What was it, Coach said
about the defense, but what was it with you guys that allowed you to make that
run?  
JORDAN PRICE: Everybody just pretty much locked in. We didn't want to go home.
So pretty much just locked in and tried to get stops.  
  
Q. What made the combination of Aldridge and Gibbs so difficult to guard
today for you guys?  
JORDAN PRICE: I mean, they are always. It's not just today. They are always a
difficult combination.  
  
Q. The first half, can you point to some things that you just felt -- I
mean, you know what Davidson is and what they do, and obviously you guys hit
seven of ten threes, and you're down 15. What was a little bit out of sync at
both ends, do you feel like?  
JORDAN PRICE: Pretty much we were all losing our man sometimes. You've got
like a crazy offense from everybody running around everywhere, and sometimes
we got lost. We practice it, but within the game today, we just -- in the
first half. But in the second half, we locked in.  
  
Q. Obvious question, sort of a, what-does-it-feel-like question. I guess
I'm asking you to state the obvious. You're walking off the court for the last
time. What was going through your head?  
JORDAN PRICE: It hasn't really hit me yet. I'm just trying to get back with my
teammates and just get back to the school and finish these last few months.  
  
Q. You spoke a little about Jordan, but can you reflect a little bit
more on what that guy did for you for the past three years?  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: I think, again, at this time, I think about them far more
as people than I do as players. So we went 17 and 15, 17 his first year, 15
his next year, and -- a thousand times, was my fault. But I would say is
through the ups and downs he's been consistent. When you go through tough
times, you want to go through them with people that aren't going to change and
are going to be positive and that's what Jordan, as well as Cian, has done for
us. I just appreciate them as people and their consistency throughout some ups
and downs.  
  
Q. In some ways, is this game kind of like your season?  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: Yeah.  
  
Q. At times, you were very, very good, and at times not as good.  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: Kind of in reverse order, though. In the first half, I
can't even put into words, and words don't do justice, how well I thought
prepared we were for their offense. We've played them before and we had three
days to prepare, and we just didn't talk. We didn't do what we practiced. They
are wonderful kids with great attitudes. I just can't figure out why it's so
sometimes.  
  
But in the second half, they did exactly what we wanted. I mean, we didn't
miss a switch, and Aldridge got us down low in a couple mismatches. But we
held them down and held them to 38 percent from the field. If we could have
done that in the first half, I think it could have been a very different game.
And why we didn't, I really don't have any idea. I don't question our guys'
attitude or their motivation. It's just it's really hard for me to understand.  
  
And on top of that, as I said, they made some really difficult shots and shots
from deep. They executed well, as always. But I think in the second half, we
show we can guard them, and the first time we played them, we showed that we
could guard them. For some reason, we just didn't do a great job of it in the
first half.  
  
And again, maybe we would have been down by a little bit, but when you throw
their unbelievable shooting on top of it, we were really in a hole at that
point.  
  
Q. You talked about Aldridge and mismatches. What does he do to maximize
that? Because you look at him, and physically, it's like, okay, he's 6-8 and
he can kind of bounce out and play inside. But what does he do?  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: So what they do offensively is, one of the best continuity
offenses in the country. I mean, no one does it better than them. But it's
more simple than you would think, and he just knows what to do when he has a
smaller guy on him. He just knows what to do when he has a bigger guy on him.
He's done it for three years and they don't do anything different. I mean,
they do that, and he has a wonderful feel of what he can take advantage of.
And they have great role definition.  
  
You know, they know that Gibbs and Aldridge are going to score, and they are
always looking for those guys and those other guys are going to pass and make
open threes. They have the makings of a really good team, some terrific
scorers, some guys who are very good players in their own right, but know what
their role is and of course, they are wonderfully coached. They have a lot of
things going for them.  
  
Q. The first half, and the season, obviously the team never stopped
going hard. Could you see them press a little bit and the gears working
through their brains when things weren't going their way?  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: I don't understand the question.  
  
Q. I guess it's sort of a psychological question where --  
DR. JOHN GIANNINI: We definitely lost confidence after the VCU game and after
losing a few games without Pookie. Our confidence level really never got back
to where it was in the middle of January.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

### [Davell Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32833)

### [Jalen Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32907)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
GEORGE WASHINGTON 53, Saint Louis 46  
  
TRAVIS FORD: It was really almost a carbon copy of our first game against
George Washington at their place where we led most of the game. They just made
some big plays down the stretch. You know, four or five threes for the second
half for them, we turned the ball over way too much in the second half and
give them credit for that.  
  
Really proud of my guys and really proud of their effort. I think ran out of
gas a little bit out there, which is understandable because of how hard these
young men played all year long.  
  
But give George Washington the credit tonight, but really, really proud of our
basketball team.  
  
Q. For either one of you, George Washington came out, was really cold
shooting. Did you feel like you maybe could have made a little bit more of a
push early on, get a little bit more of a cushion, or was it just the way the
game was flowing?  
DAVELL ROBY: We knew eventually they would make some shots. We just stuck to
our defensive principles. Came out early, they was missing some shots. But
they are a really good team, and like I said, hats off to them and they are
basically going to make some shots. They have some really good players on
their team. We kept on trying to make our push and kept on running our assists
and we were executing our offense early. We got the shots we wanted. Just
couldn't get the shots late to fall like we needed them to.  
  
Q. Jalen, it's tough because the season just ended, but can you look
back and say, first-year coach, what kind of positives you have and what you
are looking forward to next season?  
JALEN JOHNSON: I feel it was a very successful season. I know Coach coming in,
the players at Saint Louis had to accept him. As a freshman coming in, I was
at home and him -- meet him. He recruited me here, so I didn't worry about
that. But hats off to our seniors, Reggie and Mike for accepting him, Davell,
big-time player, he accepted him. It's really the team that helped me do what
I do and Coach is just a plus.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little about the season again, what you did, and
coming in and having a lead tonight, and just looking back over the course of
the season, looking forward a little bit?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, you know, I've been around -- you know, basketball has been
pretty much my whole life since I was about two years old. Playing it, been
around it my whole life, coaching it.  
  
Man, I've been a part of a lot of teams in my life. I've told our guys, I've
enjoyed this year as much as I've enjoyed any year for the fact that I knew
what I was inheriting. I knew the position they had been in the last couple
years. And these young men have really accepted everything I've thrown at
them, with bright eyes, eager to learn, very -- as coachable a group as I've
ever been around, very coachable.  
  
And we all fully understand our weaknesses. They fully understand kind of
their identity and who they are and we talked a lot about before the season.
We talked a lot about before the season where we were picked. We have our
article that said we wouldn't win a game. And we kind of understood that. We
understood where they were coming from but it doesn't mean we have to accept
that.  
  
And we've had our ups and downs but the one thing these guys always continue,
just try to get better. Every day I'd walk in the locker room for practice or
whatever it is, and they were just looking at me: Let's do this, no matter
what happened the day before.  
  
And they continued to get better and better, and I believe this, I think the
last month and a half, we were as good as anybody in this league and that says
a lot for this basketball team. I wouldn't mind playing anybody. And that's
all just because they continued to get better and better and better.  
  
From that standpoint, really proud of our guys, really proud of our seniors.
Reggie and Mike really led us. Very good leadership. Really have a lot of
respect and admiration for those two guys for what they stand for as young
men.  
  
And so, yeah, I think this year was a success for our basketball team in a lot
of ways. You know, if you didn't know what we, if you didn't know a lot about
our team, just looked at our record, you may not know that, but I'm sure you
know kind of where we started at this year.  
  
And you know, I think we could -- by the end of the season right now, we could
play with anybody. And before the season started, I really haven't talked
about it much, but I had some concerns about this year, and my concerns, my
biggest concern wasn't about talent, wasn't about numbers, because we don't
play a lot. It was, would they be able to sustain what I was going to put them
through. Would we have anything left three to four weeks left in the season;
would we have anything left, physically and mentally.  
  
Because I knew we were not going to win a ton of games, so would they still be
ready to play hard, every day, when you know you're not necessarily playing
for an NCAA Tournament or something, but would they have enough character just
to come every single day and get better, and worry about the things we can
control; would they have enough left. Would they have enough left physically,
because we get after it. We get after it.  
  
We could play with anybody today. We got stronger. We got stronger as a team.
And for that, I'm very impressed with these young men. I'm very impressed. So
my concerns did not come true. And that says a lot. It says a lot about these
young men in that locker room, a lot. I told them, they walk out that door,
their shoulders better be back and their chin better be up, because they
deserve it.  
  
Q. When GW came out in their one-three-one in the second half, what kind
of problems did that pose for you and how were you trying to combat that
defense that they were trying to put on you guys?  
TRAVIS FORD: Well, it caused some problems. We knew they were going to go to
it. I just was wondering when.  
  
And we got some decent shots. It will be interesting to go back and look at
it, and didn't make them. But they did a good job. It slowed us down, no
doubt. Turned us over, probably more than anything. Turned us over.  
  
So yeah, we had some opportunities where the ball kind of went in and came
out. But give them credit again. It was almost just like the first game. I
mean, identical to the first game. But yeah, the one-three-one was a
difference, no question. It helped them.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Brendan Casper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32809)

### [Chris Clover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32810)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
UMASS - 70, Saint Joe's - 63  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: Just offensive struggles in the first half. We were 4-for-21 on
twos. We were holding on to the ball too long. Not letting the ball go out. A
little bit better in the second half.  
  
They made some threes that we didn't anticipate and we had to change up our
defensive look. And then when we got it tight, you know, our bugaboo all year
has been foul shooting. We were 2-for-6 in a tight stretch at the end, could
have made it a one-possession game a little earlier than we did.  
  
Q. You guys have battled all season despite all the struggles. Talk
about coming back from that 19-point deficit to get it to a one possession
game?  
BRENDAN CASPER: That's what we've been about all year, just battling, playing,
segment by segment, just trying to grind. We got ourselves in a hole but we
got ourselves out but it wasn't enough.  
  
So you know, that's not really going to do it for us, and that's something
those guys are going to have to work for next year is just improvement on the
offensive end. We can't shoot 37 percent in this kind of game. It's just not
good enough.  
  
CHRIS CLOVER: Yeah, we just worked hard each possession. We tried to
incorporate, Coach always says, segment by segment. We just wanted to do that
and hopefully when we got back into the game, but it wasn't enough. We worked
hard and we went out there and played really hard. It just wasn't enough
tonight.  
  
Q. The game just ended obviously but when you're looking forward in
terms of what this team, especially you, want to do in the months just ahead,
what comes to mind?  
CHRIS CLOVER: Just work on my play-making ability. Just being a team player,
just going out there and playing hard. I just want to continue to get better
each and every day. Hopefully be able to play hard next year.  
  
For the team, finishing games. We had a struggle this year finishing games, so
we just want to work on finishing games and taking each segment seriously and
playing a 40-minute game, doing that and hopefully getting better at that.  
  
Q. When you think back on this team and everything they went through, I
know you're not into moral victories, but what are you going to think about
this team?  
PHIL MARTELLI: To be honest with you, I'm going to think I was right in
August. I was concerned in August about our basketball maturity. That carried
all the way through. It's not knocking them, and the mirror tells me; like
what I have to look at and say, what do I have to do to make them more grown
up in basketball terms. Not off the court; they are nice kids. They do what
you ask them to do. Today with midterms exams, and we're going to stay
overnight and take exams in the morning. I don't have any issues with.  
  
But we need men. We need men to be in this league. And you know, the two men
that we have really are Brendan and Javon, and they are gone. So who is the
next man to step up? So there's nothing, moral victory here. Like we just got
into a hole because of skills, not because of will. And in the first half, we
got into it because of skill.  
  
But when you break this out and look at the numbers and say, look at their
three-point percentage, look at their foul shooting percentage; you know, and
I said to them at halftime, we're trying to do this with players, not a
position.  
  
We played with, since Fresh has been out, we played without a point guard and
that's what offense looks like without a point guard. It's just not very
appealing.  
  
Q. In terms of what you guys need, with everything that happened --  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, I give them a lot of credit because they never stopped
and said, oh, but Coach, so and so is out or this guy is out. That would make
a difference.  
  
This has been humbling, for all of us. And I don't think you can get better as
a player until your humbled. So you know, we'll start again. They go home for
a week next week and then we'll start. And those that are humbled will get
better.  
  
But there will be no, like, well, Chris Clover played a lot of minutes so
he'll be better next year. That's not true. Not unless he gets better. And
James Demery, unless he gets better; and Charlie Brown, unless he gets better.  
  
You know, I say it to the point of people being, older is not better.
Experienced is not better. Better has to be better. And we have a lot of --
that's the only thing. That's the only thing. With the injuries, we haven't
had skill practice because we've had to do everything to get ready for a game
and figure out how are we going to play with, you know, out this position. And
we just haven't had time to go in there and break down -- like Nick Robinson
had several assisting but his shooting form is off.  
  
So as long as they are humbled, and they will accept coaching, then we'll get
better.  
  
Q. Along the exact same lines, just thinking, okay, Fresh comes back,
whatever, Newkirk comes back, same lines, you can't make assumptions, is what
you're saying, right?  
PHIL MARTELLI: No, I know nothing about, don't want to know anything, and will
not engage in any conversations about, you know, well, what if, and then when.  
  
I have no idea. I have no idea. I will say this. The other day I walked out to
practice, and for the first time in seven months, I saw Pierfrancesco shooting
a basketball. Didn't touch a basketball in seven months. So anybody remember
his game? I don't even remember his game. I don't know what he does. I know
he's a basketball player.  
  
But there's no assumptions here. Like if the doctor came in and said two
months, four months, six months, that's, to be honest with you, that's part of
the dilemma in going into the spring. Like what are we going to do, when will
we have certain guys to kind of, you know, we know our freshmen don't come
until June 20-something. What's that eight weeks going to look like? What's
this period going to look like? It just can't be wandering in the desert here.
We're walking out of here with 20 losses, and we will not repeat that.

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [Luwane Pipkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32811)

### [Zach Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32812)

### [C.J. Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18420)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
UMASS - 70, Saint Joe's - 63  
  
DEREK KELLOGG: I'm pretty happy with our team today having to play a tough
Saint Joe's team for the third time, come away with a victory that was right
down to the end. I thought we played a great stretch in the second half and
then they made some great plays to get back in the game.  
  
So a well-fought college basketball game. I love the environment out there. I
thought it was a fantastic arena with a great crowd, support for our game and
our team and we're excited to go after St. Bonaventure again tomorrow. That's
it.  
  
Q. Austin, does it feel to you like you guys got a little tight in the
second half when you got the lead?  
C.J. ANDERSON: You could say that. I felt like we got a little complacent. We
saw the lead and we was trying to slow the ball down. Felt like we could have
kept attacking them but that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Zach, did it feel like you should have kept attacking more at that
point?  
ZACH LEWIS: Definitely. That's the toughest part of a game when you have a big
lead and we're looking at the same, so we're waiting for the time to go down
but be aggressive and score. That's just a tough part for any team really.  
  
Q. You guys have been in conference tournaments before, and you win
today, but obviously have a quick turnaround now against St. Bonaventure. How
you do you prepare for that and getting yourself ready to play a game in 12,
18 hours from now?  
ZACH LEWIS: It's survive and advance. It's all-or-nothing. That's why we're
here. We've been preparing for it and we're ready for this moment, so now
we're just trying to win and keep it going.  
  
C.J. ANDERSON: I've been saying the same thing, as soon as we got in the
locker room, just stay focused and locked in there for the next game.  
  
Q. I just wanted to hear from you, about your freshman class, and kind
of how things were at the beginning of the season and what they are like now,
just on the court, off the court, how has that class grown to this point?  
LUWANE PIPKINS: Beginning of the season, we was mature kind of, on and off the
court, but as the season went on, we got deeper in the season, we matured more
on and off the court. Now we just have to keep it out on the court and win
this conference tournament.  
  
Q. Does Dede (ph) owe you anything for making the free throws after he
put one in the wrong basket? Is there anything that he has to do to you now to
make up for that?  
ZACH LEWIS: We got to the locker room and I said, that's going to be Shaq
(indiscernible)(laughing) excited to get the win, so we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. Does winning a game like this, the way that this game went, are there
good lessons to be taken from it when you still get a win?  
ZACH LEWIS: Yeah, definitely, from every game there's always going to be
lessons, always something to get better at. But right now, our biggest thing
is survive and advance, so we're happy to survive.  
  
Q. Did you know you got a thousand points in the game?  
ZACH LEWIS: Cody just told me.  
  
Q. Do you feel relieved after that?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Absolutely. To see -- you know, we've had some strange things
happen this season on the court, some things haven't gone our way and when
Decky (ph) kind of knocked the ball in for them, and the three, I was like,
wow.  
  
So to come away with a win, after a couple of those things that happened,
there's some relief. But also, I think these guys deserved it. We talked
about, you know, once you kind of felt like we definitely weren't in the race
to win the league or whatever, we felt like, let's get ready for the end of
the year and also tournament play where we're playing at a better clip and
playing together and everybody seems pretty energized and still with it. You
come here to Pittsburgh and you give it a great effort.  
  
Q. Was the way you were playing up until of the offense -- was that what
you're hoping to be for as long as this tournament goes?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Absolutely. As long as in a game of 40 minutes that we can play
that way, I'm kind of mushing for.  
  
Q. How much did Luwane give you a lift with the three-pointers?  
DEREK KELLOGG: It's nice. I like shooting threes. I like it play faster and
make some threes and shoot them. When they go in, it's much better than
playing fast and not have them go in. So seeing Luwane make some and a few of
the other guys, it was good. And Zach Lewis was 1-for-7. If he makes a couple
of those, I think we're in better shape.  
  
Q. You heard me ask Zach and C.J. about the quick turnaround. How
quickly will you turn the page, and look ahead to St. Bonaventure and how does
your preparation change?  
DEREK KELLOGG: There's not that much preparation. Luckily, I think we played
them six days ago. So there's not much as far as, I know they know game plan.
The good thing is we play a lot of players and we've done that all year. One
guy played 35 but everybody else was under 30, and sometimes it's not all bad
for a quick turnaround.  
  
We've played in the tournament before, advanced a few games, and that third
game we were a little tired a few years back but also felt like the team was
energized and ready to go. Each team is different. I think my team wants to
come and play. I think they will be engaged and want to compete and go against
a very good St. Bonaventure team who has beaten us twice.  
  
Q. Was there a game where Holloway, a few less shots and minutes, why
was that the case?  
DEREK KELLOGG: We've kind of spread out a little bit throughout the last,
whatever, and once we went man, we had to go smaller because they were playing
four kind of perimeter guys and one big. And our rotation, I thought Chris
Baldwin was playing fantastic, and I didn't really want to take him out of the
game defensively. But then Rashaan made a couple easy baskets on the offensive
end.  
  
So sometimes you weigh the defense versus the offense, and it just so happened
that he only played 14 minutes but had eight points and I thought he gave us a
decent boost.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played St. Bonaventure, you did a good job keeping
Mobley and Adams in check. What's the key to doing that again tomorrow?  
DEREK KELLOGG: That's a good question, because in the second half, Jaylen was
fantastic the other day against us at St. Bonny's.  
  
I think we just have to pay constant attention to those two. They average 40
points a game, they get to the free throw line, they make threes and they
score in transition; and are about as tough a duo, not only in our league but
college basketball for the production they put up. I think when they have the
ball, everybody is on high alert, pay attention and make them drive into the
guts of our defense.  
  
Q. When you look back on the start of this season with the group that
you had, it was young and you had a talented freshman class. What would you
say at this point, hey, you know, I knew we were going to go through some of
these pains and whatever, early, but we've improved here, we've done this.
What are some of those things now as you get to this point where people can
get excited and energized about this young group that has made some great
plays at times?  
DEREK KELLOGG: They have. I mean, I think consistency has gotten better from
maybe, we only turned the ball over ten times tonight. I've had guys that are
freshmen turn it over eight themselves, maybe nine, and you can't really win
college games with that.  
  
But you've also got to go through those growing pains and some of the maturity
process if you're going to get them to where you want them to be. They are
closer. I mean, Chris Baldwin is playing more. I think Bryson is playing more.
Ty is playing more.  
  
So those guys are finally getting some minutes to improve. But I will say it's
tough when there's five or six of them. You know, you're plugging one in at a
time, so that you don't have two guys doing the same thing on the floor. But
you know, at times tonight, we had four of them out there in basically a
playoff game.  
  
They have come a long way, but the good thing is I think they have got a long,
long way to go but they are maturing pretty quickly and I think they are going
to play good basketball because it's tournament time.

_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
SAINT LOUIS 72, Duquesne 71  
  
TRAVIS FORD: If that's not March Madness, I don't know what is, because my
goodness, I still don't really, you know, we were really sluggish for the
first half, we just couldn't get anything going. We were changing defense the.
We were trying a little bit of everything. We actually shot 56 percent at the
half but we just couldn't guard anybody. We just looked like we were really
sluggish.  
  
Second half, made a little bit of a run. Early in the second half, cut it back
to, what, five or six and then they go back up 18. And when they went up to
18, I think we were in the time-out. Right when they went up to 18, there was
a time-out, and I told these guys, you know, our defense is going to have it
start creating offense. Our defense has to start creating offense or we don't
have a chance. From this point on, our defense better start turning them over,
we got to press, and we got to attack the rim.  
  
And these guys continue to amaze me, I'll tell you. We had every -- Jim does a
terrific -- they were really well prepared. Jim was really well prepared for
us, because we run a lot of stuff. We guard a little bit different and they
were ready for it.  
  
But for us to fight foul trouble like we did tonight, we haven't been in foul
trouble like that all year long, for 30-whatever games we played. But you
know, these guys continue to amaze me. We just continue, under three minute,
just made he every play. Made every play. To be honest, hard to explain.  
  
Told these guys, I've been part of a lot of comebacks in my life, as a player,
as a coach. I played at Kentucky; we were down 31 points with 15 minutes to go
and came back and won, and this one here to me was even more impressive,
because we didn't do much, a lot, until we started making a few plays down the
stretch. So really proud of those guys. Really proud. Really proud.  
  
Q. You're going to have to take us through that, such a scramble in the
paint.  
DAVELL ROBY: Our coach say, Mike, get the ball to come off the pick-and-roll,
and I told Mike, when you drive, I'm going to slash behind. And I saw Mike
driving. Guy to knocked the ball out. Jalen picks it up, I see Jalen falling.
I'm thinking about picking Jalen up so he can shoot the ball.  
  
But then I was like you know what he might make it because he's always falling
over making shots. And then he throws over the side of the backboard, I kind
of catch with two hands and I just throw it up there. Man, close my eyes and
throw it up and it goes in.  
  
Q. So was it more just the -- all right, I've got to make the most of
this moment, or was there a sense of determination coming into that final
play; that we have to get something?  
DAVELL ROBY: Oh, definitely determination. Like he said, everything's working
against us man, in this game, man. A lot of adversity in this game.  
  
TRAVIS FORD: I wasn't too happy in our time-outs.  
  
DAVELL ROBY: Coach Ford, he's chewing us out, man, from start to finish
(laughing). I think it was the last shot we just all crashed the board. Just
like we got to get the ball and put it back in.  
  
Q. The whole game, you're overcoming this. As players, what are you
saying to each other to help you overcome the adversity and the deficit?  
DAVELL ROBY: I mean, we wasn't saying much, man. The leaders on the team was
saying we've been down like this before, but really, the coaches did a great
job of keeping us in it and encouraging us throughout the entire game and
pushing us and never letting us get our head down. They huddled us; dead
balls, they never let us get our head down. We kept our shoulders up. We kept
fighting.  
  
Q. Just watching Duquesne's film studies, they have blown a lot of leads
this year. Was that something that you guys had looked at or known when you
were down 18 that, hey, this has happened before for those guys?  
ELLIOTT WELMER: No we didn't really look at that as much. We just prepared as
any usual game. We just kept fighting and fighting throughout the game and you
know, was able to end it in a win.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead, you guys have your hands full with Cavanaugh, and
starting with you, Elliot, you're a younger player, bigger player. How do you
make up for having less experience and how tough has it been to keep him off
the free throw line?  
ELLIOTT WELMER: I don't really look at myself as a younger player, since I'm
actually a little bit older than some of these guys (laughter).  
  
But yeah, we've just got to play, you know, extremely well against Cavanaugh.
He's a great player. A lot of respect for the guy. I think we can do the job
against him.  
  
Q. Looking at the points in the paint differential, 22 to six in the
first half and you put 48 on them for the full game. Was that just sticking to
the game plan and letting the law of averages take place with their jump
shooting?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, we were trying to take advantage of some mismatches size-
wise. They were doing a lot of switching so we were trying to get it inside as
much as possible, and we have five to seven different plays that we can run to
try to do that. And we tried to -- I was trying to mix them up as much as
possible.  
  
It wasn't the offense as much as it was our defense. We couldn't stop anybody.
You know, they made seven threes in the first half, and you know, I was
telling our coaches at halftime, every stat other than our shooting percentage
was going against us. We didn't make free throws. We were in foul trouble.
They made seven threes. There was a lot of adversity going on for us that
wasn't going our way.  
  
But I told our guys at halftime, first thing I walked in, I said, it's
absolutely amazing we are not down 25. We could easily be down 25 right now.
So you fought -- I told them, you fought your way back to 10-points at
halftime, so you've earned the right to go win this game. You've put yourself
back in this position because really how we played, we could easily have been
down 20, 25. Tried to motivate them a little bit that now they need to finish
it.  
  
Came out the second half the way we wanted to. Came out the second half and
really executing a few things we talked about at halftime to go at them and
changed our defense a little bit. And you know, then all of a sudden, the
wheels came off. We cut it to five or whatever it was and then they go backup
to 18 in a matter of, I bet almost two and a half minutes, three-minute span.
It was fast.  
  
Reggie, after really struggling, the first half, really struggling, made some
huge plays and made some free throws.  
  
Q. You were able down the stretch to cut it to one possession, cut it to
one possession but never get over the top. Was that thought going in your
mind?  
TRAVIS FORD: No, once we got it down there, I felt, all right, anything can
happen at this point. I kept telling our team, we're going to win the game and
we're going to finish this game. You fought back through all kinds of
adversity and you deserve to win this. You need to go out and do it.  
  
The big thing is, I like how we executed down the stretch. We're down three, I
told them, go ahead, take a two, 16 seconds to go in the game and I told them,
we were able I think to foul out, we were able to huddle up real quick and I
told them, take a two if you've got it, let's play the clock here. Let's play
the clock.  
  
We got fortunate they missed free throws and things like that, but I thought
our press really got them out of rhythm a little bit in the second half, we
really started pressing a little bit harder, I think got them out of rhythm.
But yeah, I really was happy how we managed the clock the last two, three
minutes of the game.  
  
Q. How did being picked last in preseason inform the team, and also you
in your first season?  
TRAVIS FORD: Say that again? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. How did being packed last in preseason inform the team and you in
your first season as you're trying to establish things?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, we've talked a lot about from day one, being picked last,
it's not something we ran from or something we tied to hide or that we were
necessarily embarrassed about or anything like that. We talked about it
freely.  
  
And I told our team, I understood why. I get why we were picked last. But I
told them, you know, none of that really matters, and all we've tried -- from
day one, we haven't talked about winning or losing. We've just talked about
playing hard and playing, stick to the game plan, scouting report, get better,
ail of the typical things but never talk about winning.  
  
We went through our lumps early. We went through our lumps early, as we all
tried to figure out each other. I was trying to figure out them and they were
trying to figure out me. And then we slowly, you could see it coming, you
could see it coming. We slowly just continued to get better and better and
believing in each other, and one thing we talked about a lot, we fully
understood our weaknesses we have a lot of them. We fully understood who we
are. We get it. We are not world beaters or anything like that. We don't --
you didn't see any of our guys's names on the all-conference teams or none of
that. But none of that matters.  
  
I've had as much fun coaching this team as any team I've had, because we've
just got a group of guys that, no egos. No egos, do the right thing in the
classroom, and just every time-out, I say some pretty crazy things and they
just nod their head and look at me, okay, okay, and they go out and do it and
they take it.  
  
They are always looking at me with big eyes and just wanting to know what to
do. Because they understand who they are. They understand, we get that we've
got to be overachievers. We talk about that all the time. We've got to be
overachievers. We've got to be overachievers.  
  
So from that standpoint, it's very rewarding to coach these young men. I told
them in the locker room, that's win of the craziest games, for 30-something
minutes, we didn't play too well and then figure out how to win. It's pretty
good for those -- pretty cool for those guys. I'm happy for them. Really happy
for them. They deserve it.  
  
Q. You referenced a 31-point comeback when you were a player at
Kentucky, and this is more satisfying than that one; is it more satisfying to
do that as a coach than it is as a player?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, probably a little. We had a bunch of All-Americans on that
team at Kentucky. We had a pretty good team. We had a bunch of guys that are
just trying to figure it out.  
  
Really guys, if you haven't seen us play, we've been playing a lot better than
this, and we had every reason to sit out there and a, well, this is just not
our night. Hey, let's just, whoo, just not our night. We had to play in the
hometown of the opponent and they played here a couple -- I think this was
their third game here in this arena.  
  
It would have been easy for us to just say, hey, tonight wasn't our night;
we've had a fun season, good year. But not once, every time-out, I was trying
to give them a reason, everything's going to be all right and why we could
come back, and they just look at you, and nod and go out and try to figure it
out.  
  
But no, it is -- that was -- this ranks way up there, without a doubt, way up
there.  
  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Jim Ferry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22062)

### [Tarin Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32831)

### [Mike Lewis II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32832)

  
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_  
  
SAINT LOUIS 72, Duquesne 71  
  
JIM FERRY: I thought our kids played extremely hard tonight ask really left
everything they had on the court. I don't think I've really ever been involved
in a more devastating loss, especially at the end of the season, like what
just transpired.  
  
But we've had about ten games this year like this, and it still comes down to
turnovers, free throws and rebounds. I've got to give Saint Louis credit. They
really fought back. They had nine offensive rebounds in the second half,
forced eight turnovers.  
  
I thought we did almost, almost everything we had to do to win the game. We
just didn't win the game. And that's been our last five games, but it's
probably been about ten games this season that have ended like this. I thought
these kids played really hard.  
  
They showed a lot of character, being able to fight through and come back day
after day after day, practiced really hard, and then go out tonight and really
battle.  
  
So I just wish I could have done more for them as a coach. I take full
responsibility with all these close games, but we just came up one play short
again. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys started off smiling, having fun, making baskets,
go up ten. When did the smiles turn to frustrations in the second half, and
how did you guys handle that? Seemed to be a little better than usual.  
MIKE LEWIS II: I don't think our smiles really turned to frustration. You
know, coming down the stretch of the game, in our huddles, telling each other
what we normally do, look, okay, we knew they were going to go on a run.  
  
So let's just come out here and get another stop and another score and just go
on from there. I don't really think we got frustrated at all.  
  
Q. You guys in your last game here, you had only three threes in the
whole game and you had four in the first ten minutes of the game and then you
guys kind of went cold from three during that long stretch run after you guys
went up 18. Do you wish you guys would have took more efficient shots down the
stretch?  
TARIN SMITH: Yeah, for sure, I think their press put us up into taking some
quick shots. Thought we moved the ball and we got what we wanted. Looking back
on it, it's easy to say we should have take some more efficient shots. So
yeah, pretty much.  
  
Q. For Mike and Tarin, for you guys to come back next year, what can you
do different in this off-season to really propel these guys into a better
start for next year? You guys have been through so much this year already. How
do you use that to move forward?  
TARIN SMITH: I was just talking to Mike in the locker room. We got to learn
how to close games a lot better. Clearly that's been a theme this year. We've
got to watch a lot of film, figure it out and just learn how to close games a
lot better. Me and him, I know we're competitors, so we take a lot of
responsibility for not being able to close those games. Obviously that's one
thing we really need to improve on for next year.  
  
Q. Conversely, obviously choosing Duquesne, you could have chose
anywhere as a grad student. What made that decision for you, and what's going
through your mind knowing now that your career with the 000s is now over?  
EMILE BLACKMAN: First off, I just want to thank Coach Ferry for giving me this
opportunity to be able to play my last year of college basketball at Duquesne.  
  
I mean, it's come to an end. We all know that that point comes at some time.
So I just hope that this year that I had is very impactful and I hope that
they can be better going forward. I hope that I set a good example and I hope
that these two guys here learned -- everyone else in the locker room, I hope
that they learned everything that I was trying to convey to them, just how to
be a leader, just how to show up every day, and you know, work hard, try to
get the most out of not just yourself but everyone around you each day.  
  
I mean, there's some positives out of this situation, and just looking at
those right now.  
  
Q. You mentioned you had a lot of games like this one. We know you've
got a lot of young guys. What do you have to do now to take that next step as
a unit, as a team, all that stuff, so that you can close these games? With
this group, obviously you're close, but what do you have to do now?  
JIM FERRY: Yeah, we're close in every game. It's an issue of execution. We
have across our locker room above the board, and I brought this with me from
LIU: It's turnovers, free throws and rebounds. That's what it says, turnovers,
free throws and rebounds.  
  
If we make our free throws late in our last two games, we win. If we do a
better job rebounding the basketball, we win. If we don't turn the ball over,
we win. Those were extreme weaknesses this year, and it just kept coming over
and over and over. Guys we were playing, decisions we were making -- I mean
down the stretch in this basketball game, we get one or two, or not even two;
even just one, any of those sequences where they got those four offensive
rebounds late in the game, we win the game. We don't turn the ball over at the
end of the game, we win the game. If you make two three throws at the end of
the game, you win the game.  
  
It's something that with a young group, you've got to just keep working,
you've got to keep working and you've got to keep pounding at these guys,
teaching them, spend time on it. For those guys that have been to our
practice, you see they are organized, they are detailed, situational.  
  
We go over situations over and over and over, but nothing fits a situation
like a real situation. And with a young group, Mike Lewis, one heck of a
ballgame for a freshman in a tournament situation like this. Got to get that
ball in at the end, and it deflected and we turned it over. Big play. Big
play.  
  
And that's where, you know, the true sense of frustration for coach is just
because you know what the problem is, that doesn't mean you can solve it. And
that's what the frustration is, and sometimes, guys, it's personnel.
Positional personnel stuff. I'm not going to sit here and talk about an
individual or individuals but we know what we have coming in next year.  
  
We know these guys are going to get older. This isn't going to happen again. I
see this group as being a team that can next year take a jump and get right to
the middle of the pack in this league because we won't turn the ball over, we
will rebound better, and we're going to make our free throws. It's stuff we
have to keep working on with these kids. A lot of freshmen, a lot of
sophomores trying to make plays out there. That's a tough situation. In that
game out there, I think you saw couple seniors, older guys, making plays for
Saint Louis. Got to give them credit, too.  
  
Q. You just talked about your youth. How do you plan to replace guys
like Emile, Kale and Darius leadership-wise next season?  
JIM FERRY: The maturity of these younger guys, Mike and Isiaha have great
leadership skills. They are also great kids. So they took a step back this
year. They weren't going to step on anybody's toes.  
  
Tarin, as well, I think with Tarin, it was just his year of experience,
getting back in the game, and believe it or not, I think all these close
losses, it ain't going to get any worse, guys. These were devastating losses,
all these close ones. I think we were in ten of them and we only won one.  
  
It's going to make them better. It makes us all better. Makes me a better
coach and makes these guys better players. Again, you review it, and you're
not going to do it now with these guys, but we go over it like we always do
and just got to teach them.  
  
And then what you're going to see happen is they are going to win one and they
are going to win two, and then they are going to win three and four, where we
just never got it going; I think they lost some of their confidence in that.  
  
Q. Speaking of frustration, is there any temptation to change the way
you're doing it or bringing in different type of players?  
JIM FERRY: Yeah, I mean, we have a really good recruiting class signed again,
as this recruiting class was very good. We have a really spectacular point
guard but I don't like putting pressure on young kids like that.  
  
You know, the first five years you're able to get a certain type of kid and
then you have some success which now allows you to recruit another type of kid
as you saw with Mike Lewis and Isiaha, now we have another wave coming in like
that.  
  
But you know, on our side of it, too, it's such a young group, you can look at
it either way. You can look at it like, wow, you lost all these close games or
you can look at it like, man, we're in a lot of close games with a young
group. Yes, we are always going to change stuff as a coach. As soon as the
season ends, once you get off the road recruiting, you sit down and you re-
evaluate your philosophy.  
  
Every year I do it, every year. And what's difficult in a place like this is
you're not getting -- you're not always getting a blue collar kid and say,
okay, I'm going to be North Carolina, we're playing this way because we get
the best in the country. You've also got to make adjustments to the type of
kid you get or who you do get in your recruiting class and that gets settled
in and start going in the summer.  
  
Q. Going into next season, what do Mike and Isiaha have to improve on
the most to take the next step in their careers?  
JIM FERRY: Durability, strength, conditioning. Again, understanding the flow
of the game. Sometimes shot selection is an issue. Sometimes Mike not being
aggressive enough is an issue.  
  
You know, you spend a lot of time with these guys in the summer watching
videotape, watching tape of other players that you think that they compare to.
Isiaha needs to understand, he's got a whole package, can post up more, can
use the mid-range game more. Mike's got to understand decision-making.  
  
So that's stuff that we'll work with these guys on, and putting them in the
forefront of more of a leadership role.  
  
Q. Does that one hurt more, being that the tournament was here this
year, or would that have hurt the same --  
JIM FERRY: I don't care if this game was played in Tillary Street Park in
Brooklyn, man. Something like that is just devastating.  
  
You know, I tried to keep the poise, a lot of tiers in the locker room with
those guys. They played really hard. Did in a lot of games. We thought
Saturday's game was a devastating loss, when we had one of best free throw
shooters in the league, 85 percent, down one with two free throws and he
missed both. Can't control that. We thought that was devastating. This was
extremely devastating, whether it was here, Mars or whenever, that's
devastating. Anybody that's played the game, and has worked so hard,
understands that.

_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 75, Notre Dame - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: To my left is Coach Krzyzewski, Luke Kennard, Matt Jones, and
Amile Jefferson.  
  
Q. Congratulations on your win. Coach, you've compiled more wins this
week and over the season than both of our New York teams (laughter). Can you
just take us through the week and how you were able to do it?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, thank you. I don't know exactly. I was
mentioning to a few people that my team has taken me on this journey this week
that you could not plan.  
  
First of all, the high caliber of teams that you had to beat in order to
achieve this. And the deficits that you had to overcome in each of the last
three games, and even against Clemson it was one point, and Luke made a move
on the baseline, lit the shot fake, and made a bucket that put us up 71-68. So
they're all close games.  
  
They stayed fresh. You know, they're really a good group, and they've been
through so much with injuries and me being out, just so much. So they're
close, and I think that closeness paid off for us.  
  
Q. Fellas, did you all have to make a conscious effort at all to stay
focused.  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Definitely. It was a tight game both ways. They made a really
good push in the second half. I thought they speeded the game up in the second
half, and it kind of knocked us back.  
  
But all our guys stayed poised. No one was ever like rattled. That's sometimes
when you see when things like that happen. You see guys splinter. But after
the time-out, we huddled, and we were strong. That's why I was really proud of
my guys because everyone was strong today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Matt, did you have any further thoughts on that?  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He's not the talker of the group. He only hit the biggest
shot of the game. He's just up there with his chest out.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. I think you mentioned outside you didn't call
a play in the last ten minutes. Can you elaborate on that, or was it a
unilateral decision? What went into that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't even know what that means. It meant that I didn't
know what the hell I was doing, and I just let these guys do -- what we call
as motion. Basically, we thought that they would assert themselves more. They
own motion more than if we run a play.  
  
I know they were really tired, and so by taking ownership and attacking like
that, they made it work. We've done that in each of the last three games but
not as long as today. I know they looked over, just motion. Motion. Come on,
Coach. Come up with a really good play. Motion, motion. And it worked.  
  
But I believe in these guys, and they can make plays. You know, we have guys
who can make plays. They're not selfish, and they can make plays for one
another.  
  
Q. This is for both Coach and Matt. Kind of what you were just talking
about. If you were scripting a play -- Matt's threes have not been falling for
a couple of games. If you were scripting a play, you probably wouldn't -- one
of us wouldn't run it for him. Would you talk about him coming through? And
then, Matt, I'd like you to talk about that shot.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: First of all, Matt's coming through the whole game. He and
Amile defensively turned the game around. So, again, you take ownership, and
if it's your house, your game, it's the rhythm of the game, all of a sudden
it's your shot, you're going to hit that shot. We have confidence in any of
our players doing that. We tell them.  
  
We actually were yelling at a few of our players -- I yell at Luke and Jayson
all the time for passing up shots. It was just a rhythm shot, and it was
beautiful. It was the shot of the game. It was the shot of the game.  
  
Q. The 6 seed has won this tournament five times. The 5th seed in 64
years has never won until tonight. As one who loves the history of the
tournament, I'm sure you're also aware that no team has ever won four straight
nights to win the tournament. Can you put into words what these guys have
accomplished coming from behind three straight games against three of the best
teams in the country?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's difficult, Bob, and I can see why no one's done
it before because I didn't think we were going to do that as that game evolved
in the second half. Because they're really good. Mike does such a great job
with his team. And Colson, you have one of the best players in the country.  
  
It's a journey that's kind of hard to describe, and like I was trying to tell
the guys, the kids in the locker room, I said, you know, we've won a lot of
these. We've won, this is our 14th, but this one's so different. I can't say,
well, it was like this one or like that -- no, it was not like anything.  
  
It's not like a Final Four or the NCAA Tournament because you don't play four
teams in a row like this. So it's like this -- how cool is it for me, for
these kids to take me on a journey that at 70 I've never been on? Whether it's
Olympics -- I've been on a lot of good journeys, but this was such a good one.
Thank you. I thank my guys for doing it.  
  
Q. This is for both Matt and Amile. Everybody talks about freshmen and
all these one-and-done guys, but you two seniors, when Notre Dame took the
lead, Amile, you kind of, it looked like, willed this team to kind of get
back. Then, Matt, you hit the big shot. Can you guys discuss the importance of
that experience and being a senior and in a situation like this, especially
when fatigue kicks in?  
MATT JONES: Kind of like what Coach said. It was just the rhythm of the game.
The last couple of days, the freshmen and Luke and Grayson have done their
part, and Amile as well. So in this game, it kind of just went down to
everything we've been through, as both players and people.  
  
I mean, we just put our hearts out there on the line, and that's what
everybody's been doing, and it usually pays off. (Phone ringing.)  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's my wife. No, she's right there. It's actually my AD.
Sorry, Matt.  
  
MATT JONES: No, you're fine.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Isn't it nice that I have an iPhone, though, that can do
that? Sorry, did I interrupt you?  
  
Q. Especially when fatigue kicks in in a situation like that, kind of
willing your team to win this thing.  
MATT JONES: I'm sorry. One other thing, just me and Amile, everything we've
been through, we told each other we weren't going back to the dorm without it.
So that was the big motivation for us at least, and we just made that message
known to all the other guys that, hey, like they're not going to accept us
back there if we don't get it, and we're not going to accept ourselves back
there if we don't get it as well. So that was kind of the motivation
throughout that ball game.  
  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I think Matt just hit it on the head with what he said. All
day we've been talking about not going back to the dorm without this
championship. It took me long enough to finally get one. I had to come back
another year. I just wanted to win.  
  
During time-outs, the looks on guys' faces were the looks of champions, even
when we were losing. So it made me and Matt's job easy to lead guys who want
to be led, to lead guys who are fighters, and to have players like Jayson
Tatum and Luke Kennard, who are just dynamic scorers and always tough players.
It makes our job easy.  
  
So today was just a time for me and Matt to be able to lead these guys, and I
thought, especially Matt, we did a great job of it.  
  
Q. Guys, congrats on the championship, and Coach as well, congrats to
you. My question is for you, Coach. Pardon me, this is a little bit different.
After an eventful season, whether it's on the court or dealing with the media
or even you, Coach, with your back. Can you shed some light on how you've seen
the guys grow, whether it's any of the guys up here, Jayson or Grayson. Also,
if you've grown at all this year, can you shed some light on that as well.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's a book answer you're looking for. Of course I've seen
them grow. That's the purpose of coaching is to give them an opportunity to
have them impact on one another, to have a staff impact on them, to have
competition impact on them, and trying to move them along and see how they
develop as a group.  
  
For me, I grow every year because I want to. I think, for me, this game, no
one's got the proven solution for this game. You've got to keep learning, and
you've got to be a lifelong learner. It's not about strategy too. You have to
be a lifelong learner about people. These guys let me in well. So I get to
know them, and it's one of the things that keeps me young, and they do me a
favor. They laugh at some of my jokes. We have a good time growing together.  
  
Q. My question is for Coach K and for Matt. Over the tournament, Matt's
had 11 points, but you've kept him in a significant amount of the game. That
says a lot about the confidence you have in him and the leadership he provides
on the team even without scoring. So talk about the confidence you have in
Matt. And, Matt, how do you stay in the game and do other things besides
scoring to still lead this team to a win?  
MATT JONES: First and foremost, I came to Duke to be a part of something
that's bigger than myself. Like Amile said, we have so many dynamic scorers
around myself, why try to fit in and be something I don't have to be? So I
just try to find other areas that I can help this team out.  
  
Obviously, me and Amile's voice is something that can really help this team.
So just try to focus on that. And the time comes where I do need to make a
shot or make another play that's outside of defense or talking, then it just
kind of happens.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, and in sport or in anything, there are valuable things
that people do to help you win that everyone sees, and there are valuable
things that only people who want to look deeper into it see. He does valuable
things for us or else we wouldn't be sitting here right now. And he wouldn't
be my captain, and he wouldn't have been a part of so many wins and a National
Championship and now an ACC Championship.  
  
Q. Mike, have you ever had a team go into an NCAA Tournament that has
evolved so quickly at the end, a team that's so in flux late in the season?
'01 maybe?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, when you use those words -- I know you're being
positive about them, but kind of like there was something wrong with us. They
were in flux. What? No, we were hurt -- a back operation, and they had bad
feet. It wasn't about attitude. It was about -- you know, the garage burned
down. Things happened to our family, and we never let that stop us.  
  
We haven't paid any attention to standings or seeds for this tournament or
rankings. We just haven't -- we haven't talked at all about that because so
much has happened. We just said let's talk about us and let's get better.  
  
It's worked. Even for this tournament, we said, let's just win one game, and
okay, we won it. Let's win one game. And today was the championship game. And
hopefully, we can take that same attitude into the next tournament.  
  
No, it's been a different year for me than any that I've coached and a
remarkable year. Because they've all -- we've really -- we were always
together, and all that stuff made us more together. Maybe if it didn't happen,
maybe we wouldn't have been as together, you know? Like that's how I look at
it. Okay, everyone's healthy and whatever, maybe we do have dissension then.
Maybe we don't have. Maybe, maybe.  
  
So instead of dealing with maybes, let's just do what's going on with us, and
that's what we've tried to do. I think with my experience and age and
whatever, my ego's not attached to whether we win 20 games or 30 games or
whatever. I'm going to be all right.  
  
Q. Coach, and maybe even for the seniors, Jayson down the stretch made a
lot of really big plays -- a block, a pass, a couple of shots. Was there any
one in particular that stood out to you as particularly key, particularly
unselfish? Any one that stood out?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I said that, and Luke would agree with me. I think
there should have been co-MVPs. I think these two guys were -- you couldn't
split a hair on them. So I'm bringing his plays up. You can bring Luke's plays
up. They were remarkable.  
  
I thought when he went full court, and I said what are you doing? Yes, you did
it. Like how the hell did you do that? All these -- no, no, yes, yes, how,
wow, that was good.  
  
And it gave -- I thought it gave everyone energy, like somebody on our team
could move that fast right now. I thought that was a great play, the block and
everything, but that's like oh. It was terrific. It was so darn good.  
  
Q. Luke, what does it mean to you to be named the MVP of this
tournament?  
LUKE KENNARD: You know, it was great. Through this all, I've just been so
emotional. I'm just so happy. Just to be -- like Matt said, we came to Duke to
be a part of something bigger than ourselves, and just to be able to put my
heart on the court with guys like this, it means so much to me. And I'm just
so blessed to have that opportunity.  
  
I've done as much as I could to help our team win, to bring success to our
team, to this program, and I'm blessed to be able to share that with these
guys. We're happy right now, and we're looking forward to our next step this
season.  
  
Q. Mike, you have 13 wins against the RPI top 50. That's two more than
any other team in college basketball. Obviously, the backdrop of this season
with the injuries, you being out during the back surgery, you're going to be
hotly debated tomorrow as to whether or not you should be a 1 seed. Perhaps
you should be a 2 and get sent back up here to New York. Villanova will
probably be the 1 in that region.  
Do you think you deserve a 1? Do you care if you get a 1? You have so much
experience in this tournament. I want to know whether a 1 matters to you
personally.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, whatever they decide really. We've had a heck of a
year, and we're at our best in the last month, once we got everyone together.
And how that compares to everyone, the committee will do a good job. We'll go
wherever they want, and we're okay with whatever seed.  
  
We haven't paid any attention to that. So even your question, I haven't -- I
didn't know those things. I'm trying to figure out how to stop Bonzie Colson.
So we'll just let it happen, and I think that's the best way of doing it.  
  
Q. Coach, after such a tough emotional championship, do you ever worry
about a letdown in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I worry about that after -- you know, like I told
these guys, when we beat Carolina during the regular season, 40 hours later,
we have to play Clemson, and we didn't play well. We were able to win by two
points. You know, we talk about part of becoming a really good team is beating
human nature, where you want to stay in the last thing. So we've had to beat
human nature like crazy here because you beat Louisville in that game, whoa,
now we play Carolina, whoa. Human nature saying, come on, man, let's watch the
highlights of those two, and now you've got to play Notre Dame.  
  
I think the experience of doing it this week will help us, and I think also we
have spring break this week. We need to get a day and a half, two days of just
get rest, get rest. And we'll find out tomorrow night where we're going.  
  
Hopefully -- the only thing I would say in reference to the tournament is I
would like if it was a Friday, Sunday, but they're not going to listen to me.
They'll probably make a new rule and have us play in Dayton or something.  
  
Q. Question for Amile. Every rally has to have a starting point.
Yesterday was Luke's four-point play. The Notre Dame guys felt like the basket
that you made after the resounding dunk that V.J. Beachem had got you started.
Then you had another big basket after that. You always rebound. You always
defend. You don't always score. What was your mindset about really taking it
hard to the basket to try to get your team back in the game -- to get your
team even in the scoreboard? Not that you were out of the game.  
AMILE JEFFERSON: For me, it's about always trying to make a play on the
offensive end or the defensive end. Whether it's the screen, offensive
rebound, tipping a ball, just making a play. At that point, I thought the play
was -- I had my back to the basket, and I was really close to score the ball.
I'm confident in my abilities, so I'm glad it went in.  
  
But I thought there were so many plays that turned the game around and sparked
the game made by a bunch of our guys. Jayson made terrific plays down the
stretch. Luke, this whole tournament, has been making unbelievable plays. And
then that shot by Matt was the biggest shot of the tournament.  
  
So I'm just really proud to be on this team with this group of guys at this
time where we're becoming pure. So really proud of my group.  
  
Q. Mike, four games in four days, is there some point where you just see
the adrenaline taking over for these guys and the potential -- the limited
time between games and the possibility to overthink things isn't really there
because you've got to come here and play.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: One thing is we adjust how much we give them in a scouting
report. It becomes less because there's less time. We're at the end of the
season, so they're accustomed to that.  
  
And time-outs -- one of the things I try to remind them in the second half
when there's time-outs is that, look, this is why -- this is tough. Winning
championships is not easy. So whatever you need to do to be tough, it's not
about being motivated now. They are motivated. They're tired. The other team
is really good. How are we going to be tough right now?  
  
And they figured that out. And they figured it out for four straight days.
Hopefully, they can figure it out some more.  
  
Thank you to all the people here at Barclays who made this so good. The
tournament was great up here, as it has been in all locations.

_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 75, Notre Dame - 69  
  
COACH BREY: What a great final. It was a great college game. I'm really proud
of our group. You've got to give Duke credit. They made some big shots and big
plays. Tatum was hard for us to deal with.  
  
When we were up six, we had some really clean looks from three. We needed a
couple of those to go down to escape and couldn't do it.  
  
Q. Mike, phenomenal game. That two-minute stretch at the end when Tatum
just kind of took over, what happened there? It looked like he had the block
and the driving layup. Was it just a matter of his brilliance taking over?  
COACH BREY: He's really gifted. The Matt Jones three is on me because I told
him run at him. I told Matt Farrell, we've got to run at him. To his credit,
he made a great pass, and Jones made a big jumper.  
  
The thing of it was, we weren't helping much because we were giving up twos.
And the score -- they couldn't get away from us. Even though they shot a high
percentage, they weren't ripping it from three, and we were able to stay in it
and hang in there. But we ran at them, and they've delivered. They've done
that in the last three games. They've really made big shots to win the thing.
I take my hat off to them.  
  
Q. Mike, from the reaction of your bench, it appeared at 32 seconds you
thought Matt Jones stepped inbounds. Did you see it?  
COACH BREY: I thought he did. I thought he stepped on the in line. That's why
I was just trying to -- I don't know if there was a replay. I thought he did.
A lot of commotion, though, at that time. We certainly could have used some
help right there to get that ball back because then Jones hits the three.  
  
The officiating -- the game was officiated by three pros, and that's why the
game was a great college game.  
  
Q. Mike, when you had Zach Auguste, Bonzie was the stretch four. Do we
call him the stretch five now? Just talk about his performance tonight, on the
glass and really all over the court.  
COACH BREY: It's one of the great performances in championship game history.
Now, our fans don't know about the history of the ACC Championship game. We've
only been in the league four years. But what he did willing us and keeping us
in it and making big plays and chasing down loose balls, it's a great
performance. And he's so confident. He's a tough matchup now that he can step
up and make jump shots.  
  
We need to get him a lot of rest. I hope we don't play until Friday. We could
use some rest.  
  
Q. Is his ankle okay?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, it was a twist, so I think a couple of days, he'll be fine.
Luckily, it wasn't bad. He'll be 100 percent by the time we play again.  
  
Q. V.J., you guys have done so well from three-point land this week and
for a while. Tonight just seemed to really not be your night. What was going
on with the shooting? Were you guys a little heavy legged with the three
games? Was it their defense? What do you think?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think we got the usual great looks we're used to getting. We
might have been a little tired, but we just didn't knock them down. We got
some rest and some time to get our legs under us and come back ready to play
next weekend.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think we got great looks, and we usually step up and knock
them down. That's all you can ask for. Matt did a great job of getting guys
open and finding them. I think we'll take those shots every day. It's up to us
to knock them down.  
  
Q. Mike, a little bit more, you're talking about Jayson and the
performance he's had here. He played well against you guys earlier in the year
too. I'm wondering how you've seen him develop. He looks NBA-ready these
days.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I said in our thing -- I said, if he's not the 1 pick. I've
got to see the guy who's the 1 pick. I know there's all those projections.  
  
You know, he plays with the poise and pace now of an older player. I think
they've done a great job bringing him along, putting him in situations where
he can be really successful. He's an amazingly gifted guy, and he has a great
demeanor. He just kind of stays calm and plays.  
  
I think what's shocking is, when you're standing on the floor, how big he is.
His size is imposing that he gets up over the top of people.  
  
Q. The shots weren't always falling, but it felt like on offense,
especially in the half-court, you were getting really good looks. What is it
about your offense, both the personnel and the structure, that makes it run so
smoothly?  
COACH BREY: It's funny. It's not much structure. We just kind of ball. We just
kind of play. But we have high basketball IQ guys. Spacing has always been a
key for us, but you need a guy at the controls like Matt Farrell that can
break the thing down off a ball screen and then kick to these guys.  
  
Again, we're great with the ball. We already had six turnovers tonight. We're
pretty efficient. We know who we are. But we need to make a few more of those
open looks to beat a team like that. And to beat Florida State last night, we
had to make more of them than we did. We couldn't tonight.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think just having great spacing. We had a bunch of great
looks, and I think that's just the way we've been playing all season long. I'm
confident that, going forward, people are going to continue to step up and
make those shots. Yeah, we were in the right position, so you've just got to
step up and knock them down.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: The same thing as far as the spacing, and then just playing
fearless as far as driving the ball and rising up and shooting the open two.  
  
Q. Colson took the loss hard, understandably. How is he doing back
there, and how is his ankle now?  
COACH BREY: I think his ankle is going to be fine. Luckily, it was just a
little bit of a twist and not a sprain. He'll be sore for a couple of days.  
  
Bonzie is bouncing back. You know, it was neat, after I talked to them, he was
the one that was telling guys to keep their head up. I think the guy that was
hurting the most was Matt Farrell. He really wanted -- we all wanted it, but
he's going to have the hardest time getting over it.  
  
Thank God the Selection Show is in, what -- not long. What day is it? When
we've been playing the late night, I run into -- there we go. Thank you,
Michael.  
  
Q. Question for V.J. and Steve. V.J., you had a resounding dunk to make
it 56-48, pretty comfortable lead, I would say, at that time although 11
minutes left. In each of Duke's three comebacks, there's been a basket or two,
a play or two that's really gotten them going. I would like your guys'
opinion, even before the Jayson Tatum show late, what were the plays they made
that got them energized?  
V.J. BEACHEM: The play that really sticks out in my mind is Jefferson got an
and-one to cut it from eight to five. Then I think we got some more good looks
and just didn't knock them down, but I think that play right there kind of
kept them in it.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: There was a corner three from, I think it was Jackson, but I
think we've done a really good job of stringing together stops the last two
games. Tonight I don't think we -- we obviously didn't get as many as we
needed to at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Coach Brey, what did you see in Jayson Tatum, and why is it so hard
to play against him? And do you think he's the best freshman in the country
right now?  
COACH BREY: Yes, I think he's the best freshman. I've seen a bunch of them
play. To see his improvement has been really interesting to watch through the
league.  
  
First of all, like I said, his size is -- he's got to be 6'9", and I don't
know what they list him at. He's really long and big. And then he's got the
ability to shoot a jump shot and put it on the floor. Then you can be in great
position. Steve was in great position many times, and he gets up over you to
get a shot. There's not much you can do about that.  
  
But, again, I think his demeanor is to be complimented. For a young guy, he's
got the poise of an older guy.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Nate Britt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32956)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 93, North Carolina - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just a brief opening statement, and we'll go to
questions.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Congratulations to Duke. It was a big time game for a while,
and then it got so it was not a big time game. I think the most disciplined,
the best coached team, the most focused team is the one that won the game
tonight. I didn't do as good a job as Mike did.  
  
One of our biggest focus, play defense without fouling. They shot 37 free
throws. He outrebound them by 11. We take 28 more shots, but we didn't make
shots. Put them on the free-throw line way, way, way too much. Assist-to-error
ratio is 23-10. You look at all those things, it looks pretty, but you can't
continually foul people.  
  
At the end of the game, 8 or 10 of those free throws, we were trying to foul
at the end. But we shot eight free throws the first half. They shot 14. We had
some foul trouble, and some of those were silly fouls. It's my job to make
sure that we make -- we're more disciplined than we were.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a 13-point lead, then they went on a 20-4 run. What
were the factors in that other than Joel Berry being on the bench for four?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think our offense stopped moving. They picked us up a little
bit in the backcourt. We wasted some time in the backcourt getting it down. We
really did stop moving. When we had shots -- I remember a couple of them, I
think we rushed them a little bit, forced them a little bit.  
  
Guys, we shot 56 percent in the first half and 28 in the second half. We shoot
28 percent in the second half, they shoot 59 percent because they got better
movement, better screens, better shots than we did.  
  
Q. Coach, you went about eight to ten minutes without Berry in the
lineup. It appeared Nate was playing pretty confidently, but not having your
team leader on the floor, how much of an effect does that have?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, it had an effect, but that takes away from what Duke
did. I really believe that. I don't want to use any excuses. North Carolina
was still playing Duke. Nate did some good things.  
  
For us, our whole offense got stagnant, and our whole defense was bad. We'd
run off a guy and leave a wide open three-point shooter in the corner a couple
of times. So you can't do those types of games.  
  
If you've got any questions for the players, let's ask them now so we can let
them go back and dress and the whole bit. Anybody got any questions for the
players?  
  
Q. This is for Isaiah. What changed offensively for you guys in the
second half? You guys were pounding the paint in the first. The second, it
seemed like Duke was just stopping you. What changed in the second half to
sort of change the offense?  
ISAIAH HICKS: As Coach said, we stopped moving. That really made the
difference in our offense.  
  
Q. This is a question for Nate. Duke has struggled to defend the two-
point shot at times this year. Coach Krzyzewski has not been pleased with
their field goal percentage defense, but they've been very good at defending
the three-point shot, and they were tonight. When you're beyond the arc, what
do you see from them defensively that it makes it harder to get a three
against them sometimes than it does a two?  
NATE BRITT: Duke likes to take three-point shots on the offensive end, so I
feel like they do a very good job of defending it. Duke often tries to shoot
threes off offensive rebounds, and they do a great job of defending it. They
apply a lot of ball pressure on the perimeter, which we try to take advantage
of and try to get in the paint.  
  
Q. Roy, I'm sorry if this sounds impolite, but you went -- they
outscored you 13-2 in under four minutes, and before you got around to calling
a time-out. Do you think you missed one there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's not impolite. I've had people say I don't call time-outs
my whole life, but we've won some games, and it's the way we do it. I always
think that that's what we practice for. We practice every day being able to
play without me calling them over to say I love you and singing Kumbaya and
all that BS. I did say BS today. I'm better than I was yesterday.  
  
Somebody could say that, but that's the way I've coached my whole life. That's
nice of you to say impolite. I've had people say it my whole life. I'm dumb
enough to think, if I die and I have more time-outs left than anybody, I'll
get something from it.  
  
There was a time there when I looked up -- and the fact I called a time-out
when we got one 30 seconds later kind of thing. But kids have to be able to
handle adversity, and that's the reason we practice. We've had some great
comebacks when I've had time-outs left at the end. I've seen some games on TV
yet this year when games were lost when coaches wished they had a time-out. I
don't ever want to coach us out of a game.  
  
But that is the way we practice. We do it all the time. I'm too dumb, too
stubborn, whatever. I'm not going to change for 29 years. I didn't let the guy
get wide open for a three-point shot. What am I going to do?  
  
Q. Spoiler, Jayson Tatum is a pretty good athlete. He had a run there at
the end of the first half that narrowed your lead going into the second. How
critical was that to ultimately Duke coming back?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think you can point at any one part of the game. It
was the whole game. Even talking about the time-out, that was part of it too.
We talked about playing without fouling, and we took -- we talked about
getting the ball inside. We take a quick three. We take a bad shot. They run
out on the break because somebody doesn't get back, and then we foul the guy
as he's laying it up. That's not very smart. We talked about those things a
great deal, but I didn't do a good enough job with it. I really didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's just after disheartening loss, but you're still
looked at as the No. 1 seed likely. What do you have to do to turn this around
after such a tough loss to a big rival?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, right now it's best for me to stay away from my players
because I'm ready to jump off the top of the building or something like that.
So giving them some space. But I did tell them in the locker room -- and it's
true -- my teams have taken me to eight Final Fours. I've never taken a team,
but my teams have taken me to eight Final Fours. Six of those times, we lost
in the semifinals of conference tournament, and two times, last year being one
of them that we won the conference tournament and still made the Final Four.  
  
There's a lot to still play for. I'm not trying to make anybody mad. Our final
goal was not to win the ACC Tournament. Our final goal was to play on the last
Monday night and win the game there.  
  
I told them that after I said a couple of other things to them, but hopefully
we'll get to be more disciplined and tougher and understand fouling hurts your
team and all those things. And if we do that, then we've got a chance. I've
had two players during those six times stand up in the locker room and say
something to everybody else about we're good enough to make the Final Four if
we just play, and one of them was dumb enough to say we're good enough to make
the Final Four if we just do what he says, and he pointed at me. So he was
pretty dumb. But I did give them that message, but right now I'm really
ticked.  
  
Q. Along those lines, over the years how have you dealt with these kinds
of losses differently when you do have stuff ahead but it's disappointing in
the moment?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think about suicide. If I ever jump off the top of a
building, have it investigated because somebody pushed my rear end. Understand
that part.  
  
But it's disappointing because we didn't do what we asked to do. We didn't do
what we practiced to do. We didn't do those kinds of things.  
  
And then we were not tough enough. Begging the officials every time a call's
made. You're throwing up your hands. Those are disgusting things to me. You
can't always blame somebody else in life. You've got to do a better job. I've
got to do a better job with my team.  
  
Right now it's difficult, but when we figure out the path that we're going to
walk back home instead of riding the plane or bus or anything, when we ever
get back to Chapel Hill, I'll try to coach the heck out of them.  
  
Q. Meeks was out for a significant amount of time. What was going
through your mind of having him sit out for so long?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We've been trying to get Kennedy through playing in short
periods of time the whole season, and we need to give Tony some time as well.
Kennedy's performance goes down drastically once he gets winded. His stamina
is not as good as we would like for it to be. We've held him out of a bunch of
practices because of a sore knee, but he's come to play.  
  
Last night he was defensive player of the game. I don't even know how many
scores tonight. He scored 19. Last night he was the defensive player of the
game.  
  
For us, it's the way we're trying to milk as much time of him as we can,
knowing that we had hoped to play three straight nights, and that's just the
way we've done it all year.  
  
Q. Justin Jackson kind of faded towards the end of the game. He didn't
shoot too well. What do you think changed? What happened to him down the
stretch in the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: These last three games, Justin hadn't been the player he was
before. I think he's putting too much pressure on himself. I think he's trying
to do too much and perhaps take in some shots that weren't quite as good.
Tonight he had four assists and really did some good things, but the shots
didn't go in as much.  
  
I think I've had a little talk with him. I've got to do some more because I
think he's putting a little too much on himself. But at Virginia, Duke at
home, Miami last night and tonight, probably in the four-game stretch it's
been about as poorly as he's shot the ball all year long. But I do think he's
probably putting too much on himself.  
  
Guys, here and here, both of you, that was awfully nice, you thought you were
being mean asking difficult questions. But 29 years of this stuff, I
appreciate that. Thank you.

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Luke Kennard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32796)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 93, North Carolina - 83  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Another great game. Holy mackerel. For us, in the last nine
days, we play Florida State, Carolina twice, Clemson, and Louisville. Wow, you
know, just to play, and then to win all but one of them is terrific.  
  
Tonight we beat an outstanding team, obviously a team that can win the
national title. Did a great job of winning our regular season.  
  
Our guys just fought. When we were down by 13, Jayson got that dunk, called a
time-out just to get rested. Let's go. Let's try to make a charge now, and
that was the play in Chapel Hill that he tried to lay up, and tonight he
dunked it.  
  
Then we came out, and the next play that we scored on I thought was the play
of the game for us. We missed, and Grayson chased down a loose ball right in
front of our bench, and he hit Luke in the corner. Luke hit it and got fouled,
and it's a four-point play.  
  
I thought that Jayson's move and these two guys -- these two guys are very,
very special competitors. And then we just fought, and it worked out. Our guys
-- they were fouling to get back, and we hit every free throw, or most free
throws, and we only had that one turnover.  
  
Again, we're really pleased and proud of the win.  
  
Q. Coach K, you had a new player today by the name of Harry Giles, who
was absolutely amazing the 15 minutes he played. And we've seen you a couple
times to talk aggressively to get him in the game. What were those talks
about? How did you get him to come out and be explosive those 15 minutes?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's interesting. Harry said his cousin was going to be out
in the audience. Thank you for asking about him.  
  
Harry, the last two games, has been terrific. I mean, his rebounding, and he
had four blocked shots. But the energy -- you know, these guys give energy,
and Harry -- you know, Harry is coming off of some really bad injuries. He's
still -- you know, a year from now will probably get it. And he's put it all
out there. When our guys have seen that, it's been a lift. It's been a huge
lift for us.  
  
So we're getting better. I said it even when we lost to Syracuse and Miami by
one possession each game, that our team's getting better. We just are getting
better. And these two guys and Jayson, when they're on the court, those three
guys, when they're sharing it and scoring, it's a potent offensive unit. Not a
big unit, these guys are guarding big guys and whatever, but a big -- and it's
where Harry's contribution is coming in.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on the Harry question. Knowing what he's gone
through this season, and you were talking yesterday about the scrutiny that
Duke is under, what is it like to watch him have these two games and have that
success? Grayson, can you talk about it? He was talking about being a role
player and coming off the bench and how he's learned that role, and you've
helped him with that. If both of you can address that.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Let them talk, and if they give the wrong answer, then I'll
say something.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Basically, every time I've talked to Harry, I just told him
that he's really good, and it doesn't matter if he's coming off the bench, if
he's in the game for two, three, four minutes. I think he can play with
whoever's out there, whoever he's going up against.  
  
So I told him that. I said, you might be playing limited minutes. You might
feel like a role player, but you're not. You're extremely talented, and when
you get out there, act like it. Don't be shy. Don't be trying to play into a
role. Do what you can do.  
  
That's something I learned my freshman year, and he's learned that, and he
showed that.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: When you have like two ACLs, like it definitely does
something to you physically. What I've told Harry, especially this last week,
I said, you didn't get an ACL with enthusiasm. Like you're the most
enthusiastic kid I've ever been around, and you're not bringing your
enthusiasm. That was never hurt. But I think you're not using it.  
  
And I said, just be enthusiastic and see what happens, and I think he's done
that. Instead of being methodical and trying to think about everything, he's
been more athletic. It's great. I'm so happy for him. And us too.  
  
Q. Mike, just to follow up on what you just said, from a coaching, from
a teaching standpoint, just how satisfying is it for you that Harry has gotten
to this point now?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Great. If he didn't have that setback in September, I think
he'd be really far along. It's just been that kind of season for Jayson,
missed eight games and all that. For them to stay with it, not look ahead,
like I'm going to the pros and whatever, but a lot of people said, well, Harry
shouldn't play and whatever. Harry wants to play. Harry wants to be at Duke.
Harry wants to be their teammate. Harry wants to be a college kid and be on
Duke's team.  
  
I love him for that, and these guys know that too, and they love him. He's
always up. He's always up. He's got such a good personality.  
  
Q. Mike, we've all seen teams that in March kind of get that intangible
that carries them through into the tournament. Are you sensing that this team
is kind of getting that in this week?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think they're getting to know each other really well. Even
when we had that seven-game winning streak and Grayson got hurt and Amile got
hurt and we didn't have a continuation there. This week, even the game in
Chapel Hill, I thought we played well. We just got beat.  
  
So they're getting to know each other better. It's a good time. It's a good
time.  
  
Q. Grayson and Luke, this might be hard to answer with Coach sitting
right there, but what have you learned? You mentioned the time-out saying
let's make a charge. What have each of you learned about the messages he
delivers in those moments, what the tone means, what the different demeanors
are? Maybe you could address that.  
LUKE KENNARD: I'll start, I guess.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Remember I control playing time, just so you know.  
  
LUKE KENNARD: I think one of the biggest things for us is we have to stay
poised in situations that we're in. I think, as a group, we have learned --
we've grown up because of so many different things we've been through this
season. We've had so much adversity. But I think we've grown in a sense that,
when we are down in games and we want to make a charge, we continue to stay
poised. We continue to stay calm. We don't let anything affect the way that
we're playing as a group. We stay ourselves, and that's what it's been about,
and we've really grown from that.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: First of all, he's a pretty good coach. So he knows how to
manage the game. That's what he's trying to teach us in moments like that.
When we go on a run or when we score, okay, now it's the next play. We need
this stop right here. Just learning the ins and outs of the game and which
plays are important and what you need to do out of each moment.  
  
That's what he's telling us, and when he's getting us fired up, we focus on
the message, and if we need energy, we'll see that from him. So it's really
just taking his message in and producing on the court.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to beat North Carolina here and also to
advance to the ACC final?  
LUKE KENNARD: I mean, it's huge. Every win is huge for us. We've taken it one
day at a time, one game at a time. That's what Coach has been telling us.
We've taken it day by day, making sure we're ready to go, making sure we've
been rested. It's been good.  
  
Like I said, each win is a big win for us, and today was another one. It's
time to move on to the next one, and we're excited for it.  
  
Q. It feels strange to ask you a question about anything being new all
these years, but the challenge of four games in four days, never been done in
this tournament, four straight wins. Have you made basketball decisions with
that in mind, or is it entirely today?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's entirely today. Throw it all in today and -- our guys
are in really good shape. I was actually amazed today because Carolina really
comes at you. They not only came at us offensively, they were playing
outstanding defense, really good pressure. So it could have worn us out, and
it didn't.  
  
We've cut down on practice time and physical stuff, and they want to win. We
have good athletes. So they respond well, and we'll see tomorrow. Tomorrow,
that's four in a row, and we'll play -- whatever it is will be really good.
And we won't see anything like that in the NCAA Tournament. So this is very
unusual.  
  
But we've gotten better here. That's the main thing. We've gotten to know each
other better. Playing against a team that's really desperate in Clemson and
two teams that could win the National Championship in Louisville and North
Carolina, just so opportunistic for us. And what everyone was saying about
this bracket or that bracket, we just said we've got a chance if we can keep
winning with a chance to play against the best in the conference. It's been
the best.  
  
Q. Mike, you went to that bigger look today, a little bit against
Louisville too, with Jayson at the three, Harry and Amile on the inside. What
does that do for you going forward? How much more confidence do you have after
these last two games with that group?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It means we have different opportunities, different looks.
Offensively and defensively, we have different matchups. We're more of a team
that looks for matchups, looks for things that we can try to exploit. We're
not as much a play team, as much as they have a lot of freedom, and they
should have it. And that gives us a new look like for Luke and Grayson to run
around, two big guys, instead of Jayson being down there and popping out.  
  
Defensively, it might give us a look about the zone. We've used zone the last
two days. And it adds to our inventory, which is great.  
  
Q. Grayson, you hit your first four three-point attempts. Were you
feeding off the environment at all? And just after the past two games, how
high is your confidence?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: First of all, my confidence is the same. It doesn't move
whether my shots are going in or not. For me, just when I'm coming off the
bench, I'm just coming in and trying to give energy. Once I see the first one
go in and I get another open one, just keep shooting, and that's the
confidence that Coach has in me just to keep shooting. If I don't shoot it,
the guys are going to tell me I need to shoot it.  
  
Really, it's just coming in and trying to explode. I've been able to do that
the last two days, and I want to continue to do that.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I should have mentioned this. If he doesn't do what he does
in the first half, we're down by 20. I mean, we could get blown out. I thought
he saved us in the first half.  
  
And that's what we need. If it's not him, then feed off Luke or, you know --
but him, what he did in the first half, they were playing a lot better -- they
were playing a lot better than us than the score indicates. And his four
threes made it look like we were okay, but we were close. It was almost a
third round knockout, you know, without him playing the way he did.  
  
Q. Seeing Shelden Williams gave me flashbacks to the days when Duke held
teams to 39 percent from the floor. This team has not done that, but it has
excelled at defending the three-point shot. Everyone knows Duke shoots the
three so well. How do you defend the three so well? A huge factor, North
Carolina was 5 of 22.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think they're accustomed to how people get threes. That's
their territory. They know how to score from it, and they know how to defend
it. You are who you are, you know. We can't defend inside as well, but on the
perimeter we have really good players. Not that we don't have as many or as
bulky. You've got to, if it's a ten-round fight, try to win six of them. Try
to win certain aspects of the game and know that you're not going to win all
of them.  
  
But if we can be really good at shooting it and defending it, that
differential in the game can be the difference. And tonight that helped us.  
  
Q. Mike, sorry to ask something of a philosophical question.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That's all right. I'm in a philosophical mood.  
  
Q. As am I.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Why is that funny for a Polish coach? We're not allowed to
be? Are you making fun of me?  
  
Q. No, sir.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: All right.  
  
Q. If we can go back to the Tatum dunk and your time-out there, some
coaches might be reluctant to call that because you've just gotten a big play
and stop the game and stop the team's momentum. You obviously saw it as a time
to consolidate momentum in your little huddle.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I say ignore.  
  
Q. Is that something you used to do back in the days of Army or
something you developed?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think whatever, good decision or bad decision, I'm not
afraid to make a decision. And I make my decision knowing my guys, whether it
be Duke, U.S., Army, I don't know my guys as well as I do now. I know these
guys. I trust them. They're just moments.  
  
There isn't like this recipe for how you coach a game, where you should take
them out, there is not a recipe. You determine based on your team what you're
going to do, and I've always done that, and then you pay the price. The price
has been good. So it's not perfect, but what the hell.  
  
Q. I had a similar question talking about philosophy. Roy sat in here
and talked about his time-out philosophy, and you mentioned you called one
after the Tatum dunk to give people rest. I was curious, you also called one
in the first half when Justin Jackson hit a three to put them up 33-23. Was
there a different purpose for that time-out?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yes, to throw water in their faces and slap them. I didn't
really. Verbally slap them. No, we were getting ready to get knocked out.  
  
Sometimes -- games are not won always at the end. They're won at certain
periods of time, and if you can win those periods of time by your feel, as
many games as you're in, that's what I try to do. Again, I may not feel the
right thing tomorrow night, but I'm going to trust what I feel. I know my guys
well, and they know I believe in them, and I give them the freedom to be
themselves. So that's what we're trying to do.  
  
It's fun for me doing it that way. It never gets old because they're always --
it's always evolving. Is that philosophical enough? I didn't even use -- I
don't think I used a three-syllable word or anything.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 77, Florida State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Notre Dame here, Coach Mike Brey, Matt Farrell, Bonzie
Colson. Just a brief opening statement, and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH BREY: Getting off to a great start like we did last night was a key. I
thought we were amazingly efficient offensively again. What did we shoot? We
shot 47 percent, took great care of the ball.  
  
When they beat us in Tallahassee, we turned it over. We were good with the
ball, and every time they made a run in the second half, we really answered.  
  
We're really proud to be playing for a banner tomorrow night.  
  
Q. For Mike and then the guys, what is it about this place that seems to
bring out the best in you guys in a relatively new arena, and you haven't had
such great success here?  
COACH BREY: We believe here. When you had the success we had in the NCAA
Tournament here last year, it was so dramatic. We talked about the karma when
we came back here for the Legends Classic. And I think we believed, and these
two games we feel really comfortable.  
  
We get a good fan base up here. But we feel good about this building.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think it's obvious we have a lot of fun playing here.
For me, it's fun playing close to home, a lot of family and friends here.  
  
I think all of us are just really comfortable here with the things that have
happened in the past with us playing here. I think a lot of guys enjoy it
here. A lot of guys love being in the city, and we just have a lot of fun
together here.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: I agree. Really confident in this building. It's good to have
your family and friends cheering you on. We're just playing really well in
this building. I can't complain. Just got to keep doing what we do.  
  
Q. Matt, can you just talk about the experience you got in the NCAA
Tournament last year and how that can help you in this tournament and moving
forward in the NCAA Tournament this year.  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think that was huge for me. Getting in the lineup,
playing a lot of minutes with guys, with Demetrius and guys like that and even
Bonzie and Steve, the guys that were running, getting out there and being
comfortable with them. I think that kind of jump started me.  
  
Then me and Coach had a meeting and talked about next year and said it's your
keys. I think that experience really helped me and helped me become a leader
on this team moving forward.  
  
Q. Mike, Bonzie's had a really strong season, really turned it on the
last couple of weeks as well. Just wondering what sort of growth you've seen
from him over the last three years.  
COACH BREY: I think it's been a methodical progression. It's the kind of guys
we get that get better over four years. I thought this year, one of the things
I noticed when we were practicing in the summer, was he became a better
passer. He's finding people and passing the ball, and he's become a better
defender.  
  
But that nose for the ball and that edge that he plays with gives the rest of
our group a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to be playing for the ACC Championship here
tomorrow night?  
BONZIE COLSON: It's a blessing. We're really excited, especially to be in this
building playing. It's been a great one here. We've just got to keep playing
on both sides of the floor, but we're excited, and it's really a blessing.  
  
MATT FARRELL: I think it's safe to say we're definitely excited. We've got to
have a quick turnaround with this one because we play another really good team
tomorrow. Like Bonzie said, we're excited. We're confident, and we're flowing
really well offensively, and we're playing good defense. We're excited for
tomorrow, and we're going to go in and have fun and do what we do.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of folks use the phrase one-and-done era of college
basketball, but two years ago when you won this led by juniors and seniors,
you have four unbelievably reliable juniors and seniors now. Can you just
elaborate on how many ways does that show up?  
COACH BREY: You know, it shows up in poise. It shows up in outstanding
leadership. It shows up in great stability in times of taking punches in a
league like ours, which we did.  
  
I've always had great senior leaders because I've always had great seniors.
It's the rhythm to our program, and I'm really proud of this next wave of old
guys that are leading the team.  
  
Q. Looking forward to Duke now, what is it going to take to beat them,
especially with their trio of Kennard, Allen, and Tatum?  
COACH BREY: We got to score. We're going to have to score. You're not stopping
them. They're a gifted offensive team. We've got to put numbers on the board.
We've got to score more than 77 to win tomorrow. Hopefully, we can slow them
up a little bit, but we're going to have to be really efficient offensively.  
  
Q. Mike, you've had some success against your old boss. Do you think
your team matches up well against what Duke does, or is it just you've had
some good games?  
COACH BREY: I think they've been great matchups. I think the matchups were
good, and our guys have always been very excited to play the Duke program.  
  
When I got this job, when we were able to steal a win from Connecticut or
Syracuse, those were real program wins for us. And when we've been able to
beat the Duke or the North Carolinas, those have been great program wins for
us in this league. We're in the early stages of this league. But our guys have
always been excited to play against them.  
  
Q. This is for Matt and Bonzie. Heading into today, the talk was Duke-
North Carolina. It seems like you guys were left out of the picture as far as
the media was concerned. Does that give you guys any extra motivation heading
into the championship playing Duke tomorrow?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, we don't focus on anybody else. We stay within ourselves
and lock in. We had Florida State. That was our main focus. We don't really
care about what the media says. We locked in ourselves, and we got it done
tonight.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we don't care about that. We focus on us. We worry about
us. We stick to what we do, and we stick to what we know.  
  
COACH BREY: I focus on it a little more because I think we were left out of
the picture in October. Have you ever seen the two polls where -- the coaches
poll, we've been like six ahead of the AP? It's interesting. But it certainly
drives -- we've been pretty damn good. We've been pretty darn consistent.  
  
Now, because we don't have anybody on Chad Ford's big board, is that why we're
overlooked? I think so. But these two guys probably (indiscernible), by the
way.  
  
Q. Mike, you played a lot of games at the Garden too in the Big East. Is
there any comparison between this arena, that arena?  
COACH BREY: I like this building way more because my record in Barclays is way
better than the Garden. This had the electricity tonight in the semis tonight.
We were fortunate enough to play in the semis in the Garden, we never got to
the Saturday night. And it was electric. I thought tonight was really good.
Both arenas I think are on par. We'll probably be in that arena someday. I
don't know if I'll still be coaching when we get there, but we'll be in that
arena someday too.  
  
Q. For the players, they're real big, and they outrebounded you, as I
think a lot of people would have expected tonight. How do you overcome that?
What do you guys do when you know it's going to be tough to beat them on the
board?  
BONZIE COLSON: Just keep battling, keep fighting for position. Try to outplay
them as best we can. If there's a loose ball opportunity, get on the loose
balls. We have to rebound and move on and continue to defend. That's something
Coach Brey has continued to emphasize, and we do that really well.  
  
MATT FARRELL: We try to get five guys in there to help Bonzie and Marty and
help them rebound. Going up against big bodies every night in this league. I
thought we did a good job tonight, all five guys rebounding on the floor and
getting the loose balls and the 50-50 balls are something we need to do every
night.  
  
Q. How do you guys match up with Duke? Where do you have the advantages
and disadvantages? What are you going to look for to sort of change?  
COACH BREY: Well, we're similar because I refer to our big four, these two
guys with Vasturia and Beachem, those are the guys who really have to get it
done for us on the offensive end. They kind of have four that do the work for
them. It's the battle of the big fours.  
  
Then who comes in and does some stuff off the bench? We got a great
contribution from Matt Ryan tonight. I sure hope we can ride him tomorrow and
beyond. Rex Pflueger, T.J. Gibbs, they have guys coming in.  
  
But the big fours of both teams, it will come down to those two groups. The
group that has the better night will win it.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think they've got, obviously, really good players, and
we have really good players, and I think it's just going to come down to who's
going to play better defense. They're really gifted. We're confident in the
way we score. We think we're very efficient. But all four of us have to show
up tomorrow. We need everybody else too. This is a team effort, and we're
excited to go at it tomorrow.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: This a team effort. This is togetherness. They've got scorers.
We've got scorers. Just trying to dig on the defensive end -- who can get all
the rebounds, who can get the loose balls -- and continue to do what we do on
both sides of the floor.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Dwayne Bacon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30471)

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Xavier Rathan-Mayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28477)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Dame - 77, Florida State - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the late hour. A brief
opening statement from Coach, and then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH HAMILTON: Congratulate Notre Dame. I thought they shot the ball
extremely well. It wasn't that our defense was necessarily that bad. They hit
some great catch-and-shoot shots that were exceptional. I thought the early
part of the game kind of put us back on our heel.  
  
We normally can do a much better job getting to the shooters, but they
executed very well. They caught the ball and shot the ball so quickly with
accuracy that it gave them the lead.  
  
From the offensive end on our end, I thought we weren't very aggressive.
Starting our game off, our game plan from the beginning was to be more
aggressive, like we were in the second half. First half, I thought we were
extremely tentative, and I thought they were very, very aggressive, and they
were extremely effective. We dug a hole for ourselves that was difficult to
dig out of.  
  
To their credit, I thought they played more to who they are than we did.
Hopefully, we'll learn from that as we move on to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How do you balance the disappointment of losing in this tournament
with looking ahead to an even bigger championship, which you're positioned
for?  
COACH HAMILTON: I think we've been pretty good at bouncing back all year.
We'll evaluate it, look at the film, dissect it, debrief ourselves, try to
evaluate the mistakes we made and things we could have done better. We won 25
games. So we realize we're a pretty good basketball team.  
  
Now what we have to do is move on to the next level. Each time you falter,
there's a possibility that you can grow and learn from it. Hopefully, that's
what we'll do this time. We normally bounce back pretty good.  
  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: Like Coach said, got to go back to the drawing board.
Evaluate what happened tonight, go through, correct some of the mistakes we
made, and just continue to get better.  
  
Look forward to making a deep run through the NCAA Tournament. We know we've
got the talent, the depth. We've got a great coaching staff that leads us.
We've just got to look forward to getting to the NCAA Tournament, and like I
said, making a deep run.  
  
DWAYNE BACON: I think it's stressful for us just because we know how much we
think we could have won this tournament. But I think after we go and watch
film and get back in the gym and work on the things that we didn't execute
right on tonight, we'll be fine when we come to the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, this is for you. I'll put this as best I can. Like you said,
you thought your defense, you played fairly well today. However, on the
season, you're 143rd in the nation in points allowed, however, you're seventh
in the --  
COACH HAMILTON: Speak up. I didn't quite hear you.  
  
Q. Nationally ranked, defensively, you're 143rd. Offensively, you're
17th. Heading into the tournament, do you feel really worried about your
defense or feel confident that your guys, like today, will continue to keep
improving?  
COACH HAMILTON: I looked at several of the teams in the ACC in the top 25, and
they have similar statistics. You can't worry about stats. You've just got to
worry about preparing for your opponents and move on to the next level.  
  
I think in the ACC, especially when you're playing people for the second time,
they make their adjustments. They're good coaches, and they have outstanding
players. But I feel like we've had a pretty good season. I'm not going to be
overly concerned about statistics. If that's something that you're overly
concerned about, let's wait until after the NCAA run, and let's see where we
are.  
  
Q. Coach, you got huge contributions off the bench. Going into the
tournament, how important is it for the bench to give contributions, maybe in
a day where your starters aren't having a good shooting game?  
COACH HAMILTON: That's who we are, and that's what carries us all year long.
Occasionally, it throws us a little off rhythm because we're playing, most of
the time, 12 guys. Sometimes it bothers us, but in the long run, I think
that's one reason why I feel good about where we are going into the
tournament. I think we're fresher, and we're going to play this tournament
with a tremendous amount of energy.  
  
Today, I think, we just got beat by a team that was red hot. Sometimes that
happens when you run up against a good team. Sometimes you have to give them
credit for what they did positive as opposed to trying to figure out what you
did wrong.  
  
I think we could have played better, but I really believe they shot the ball
exceptionally well today. And I think the quality of our depth as we move
forward will be a benefit to our team. I got a tremendous amount of confidence
in the guys who come off the bench. Rodas had 17 points tonight. It takes
junior college players sometimes a little more time to adjust. My freshmen,
Walker and Forrest, they played exceptionally good basketball for us this
year.  
  
We still have a young team. We have five first-year players we're trying to
rotate into our system. I feel very good at this particular point as we move
on and prepare for the NCAA Tournament.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Miami - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Williams.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're still playing. We like that. Second half, I thought we
played well. First half, they outrebounded us by one. Second half, we
outrebounded them by eight.  
  
One of the things we wanted to do was do a better job on the backboards, to
say the least. First half, it was 8-0, them on the offensive boards. Second
half, the points was 8-4 for us. At their place, they outscored us 11-0 on
fast break points, and I thought we ran the ball up and down the court better
today. Bottom line is we shoot 53 percent, and they shoot 35%. They played
yesterday and we didn't have to play until today, and I think that helped us
as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you held them to 36 percent shooting with 15 turnovers. On a
scale of 1 to 10, how was your defense today? I think I know you well enough
to know you won't say 10.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I wouldn't say 10, but it was better in the second half. It
really was. First half, we gave them too many open drives and open shots.
Second half, you have to think about their legs first.  
  
No. 4, Vasiljevic -- I don't know how to pronounce his name. He had a few
shots and didn't make them.  
  
I thought we were much better in the second half. I'd go 6 or 7.  
  
Q. Coach, Isaiah had a solid game, 9 of 9 at the free-throw line. What
kind of boost does it give the team that he was able to get to the line and
knock them down while he was there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If you go 9 for 9, that helps you with anything. I thought
Isaiah was active. We needed to get the ball inside. We needed to do a better
job in the paint. They beat us badly last time. It was embarrassing. I watched
it yesterday. It was the worst two hours I've had recently. I think we were
more motivated today after the way they manhandled us the last time. But
Isaiah was huge for us, and I think that was really good.  
  
Q. Coach, the last 50 seconds going into halftime was an explosive
moment for Miami. Among some of the writers, we knew there was a lot of
frickins coming during the halftime for you. What was that halftime speech to
get the team fired up and take over the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, the first 75 seconds, there were a lot of frickins out
there, I guess. I was just upset with the way we had turned it over, given
them the basket, the way we didn't stay in front of the guy and the way we had
given them the eight points on offensive rebounds. So we got after them after
that, because nobody emphasizes the backboards more than I do. So I got after
them a little bit for about 75 seconds, and then I let Coach Robinson talk so
I could think of some positive things.  
  
Q. Just wondering your thoughts on the value of having the ACC
Tournament in a big city like New York or Washington versus Greensboro? Coach
Boeheim, as you may have heard, had some strong thoughts yesterday saying
there's no value to having it in Greensboro.  
COACH WILLIAMS: This is America. Everybody's got the right to their opinion. I
don't agree with that. I love moving the tournament around. I think it's good.
But the Masters was played at Augusta National. Augusta's not a very big town.
We keep taking the tournament back there.  
  
I still think it's good for us to move around. I loved Washington, D.C., last
year. New York is doing a great job. I love Greensboro.  
  
Don't ever forget your roots. My problem is I try to make sure -- not problem.
One of my big goals is never forget where I came from, and I think we have
tremendous history in this league. But Jimmy's got the right to have his
opinion. It doesn't mean that he's wrong. I played golf with him one time, and
he thought it was going to make left, and the sucker broke right. So every now
and then he makes a mistake too. It's okay. He can have that opinion. I'm fine
with that.  
  
I like the fact that we move it around, and I love being here in New York. I
loved being in D.C. last year. And the next time we go to Greensboro, I'll
love being in Greensboro.  
  
Q. Any advantages media-wise or recruiting-wise to have it in the big
city?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It used to be much more so than I think it is now. Now
everybody's has got social media, and we don't need "The New York Times" to
find out what in the dickens is going on in the country. You know, our
president tweets out more bullshit than anybody I've ever seen. We've got
social media.  
  
In the old days, there's no question it was the media capital of the world,
but I'm not sure it is right now. Media capital of the world is sitting right
there, right there, right there.  
  
But it has value. I'm not saying it doesn't. I don't think we have to go
overboard. If you guys have questions for the players, let them answer them so
they can get out of there.  
  
Q. Isaiah, second straight game, a lot of points, very few fouls. What's
been the difference between this and a couple of the other games before that
for you.  
ISAIAH HICKS: Just focusing on the game. Not worrying about nothing else. I
had a talk with Coach, just play the game. Lose myself in the game. I feel
like that's the biggest thing that helps me so far.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on what Adam said, the prospect of playing Duke
here tomorrow night, obviously, Carolina and Duke is a sacred thing. Does that
at all feel odd, this game could take place in New York and not at home?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Not really. I mean, we've played them in the tournament not
very often, though, really for 14 years. I think we played them once or twice
in the tournament, and it wasn't in Durham or Chapel Hill. I can't even
remember where it was. We played them at least once in the tournament.  
  
No, we're fortunate to beat Miami. Miami's got 11 wins in the ACC, and I hope
that Sunday's a great day for them as well. But I'll get to go out and watch
the game, and whoever wins is who we'll play.  
  
Q. For the players, Miami cut the lead to three points early in the
second half. What did you guys start doing better at that point and put the
pedal to the metal?  
THE MODERATOR: Kennedy, take that first.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think in Miami we had a similar part of the game where we
were up early, and they kind of brought it back with their efforts. I just
think that was the main thing for us, just to continue having great effort and
trying to execute the best way we knew how to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Isaiah?  
  
ISAIAH HICKS: I agree with Kennedy. The biggest thing, we just had to settle
down, really focus on defense. Let offense come. We just had to learn from our
past mistakes at Miami.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the value of having so many guys involved,
getting them in the game at this stage of the season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I always think that depth is extremely important to us. Our
guys work really, really hard. As hard as they work, I do want to get almost
everybody in every game, and they deserve it.  
  
I do think I'd rather have Kennedy's backup playing as opposed to Kennedy
playing tired, and I think that same thing with Joel. If Joel is tired, I want
somebody else in there. I think a fresh player is really more effective for
our team, and I also think it makes them work harder and practice every day
and helps the morale of the team. But I like having depth, there's no
question.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you shot around 60 percent from the free-throw line for the
first two years. Now you're close to 75 or 80. What went into that improvement
there at the line?  
ISAIAH HICKS: Just shooting a lot of free throws and just focusing on the
process, not worrying about making it or missing.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Sweat. That's what it was, sweat.  
  
Q. In terms of Bruce Brown, who had a great game today, even on a day
where you guys are shutting just about everything else down? Not the first
time he's done it against you guys? Curious what your impressions of him have
been this year and what you think he can be?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's all world against us. He's got 51 in two games. I stopped
him in the hallway out there and told him he had a great game and he's going
to have a great career, don't forget to work. I think he's been really
something against us in both games.  
  
Q. Fans would love any of your numbers, Isaiah, 9 out of 9 or 5 out of
7. As you guys go through your relationship together, does like the one in the
foul column mean as much as the rest? How does it work through your eyes
compared to the fans' eyes?  
COACH WILLIAMS: One foul also means that he gets to play 25 minutes. I like
him playing 25 better than I do 7 or 11 or 9. I have seen some of those. It's
pretty important to me. What about you, big fella?  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Are you talking about me?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: The other big fella.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: My bad.  
  
ISAIAH HICKS: I'd rather be on the floor not worrying about nothing, just
playing. Just to have one foul in the game just allowed me to play, not
worrying about nothing.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Not worrying about anything is better English (laughter).  
  
Q. Based on today, is there anything that you think you have to do to be
ready and prepare yourself for tomorrow?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say we just have to prepare to play defense. As Coach
always said, he never seen a team make it that far without playing defense. I
would say that should be our biggest focus, and it shows, when we start really
amping it up on defense, that's when we start to make the run. That's when we
start to take the lead.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think playing together also will help us a lot down the
stretch. I think we're working together and setting screens for each other,
not passing up on those opportunities for us setting screens on Justin and
Joel for them to get open shots and possibly getting us open shots also. So
sharing the ball and setting the screens and having the greater amount of
effort is definitely important.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: 21 assists out of 28 field goals is pretty good. But I do
think we've got to concentrate on the defensive end of the floor.  
  
Q. How much of a feel shot was that supposed to be alley and it turned
into a three?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If you'd have heard what he said when he let it go -- ooh,
ooh. It was comical, but it was Theo. Nobody else could do it except Theo.
Somebody else, I'd try to strangle him, but Theo, you've got to understand
that it's him.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I'm not surprised at all that the ball went in. Like he said,
only Theo can make a shot like that. He's a funny dude. For him -- he didn't
smile after that play. He was serious, but I think everybody else was pretty
--  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: He tries to pick up full court like we're pressing.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Like he meant to make it (laughter).  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: That was a better shot than the one he shot from across the
court that ended up being an air ball.  
  
Q. I was actually going to ask about that lob. Who was the intended
target? Isaiah, were you the intended target on that?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I was to the first one.  
  
Q. The one that went in the basket?  
ISAIAH HICKS: That was to Tony.  
  
Q. The look on his face, he looked like he was concerned first about
Coach is going to get on me for making a bad pass.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, it was a bad pass. It wasn't even open. Superman
couldn't have caught that lob and got it in there. All right, guys. Thank you
very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Florida State - 74, Virginia Tech - 68  
  
Q. Buzz and Seth, obviously when Zach picked up his fourth foul and went
to the bench, they scored 11-straight points while he was on the bench and
took control there. How much of that was just Zach not being out there and how
much was that just the deeper team that they started wearing you down and the
depth situation kind of kicked in there and that was a big factor in the
second half?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: We struggled with foul trouble for anybody, whether it was this
game or any other game. Their length, their athleticism, their second shots,
our turnover rate, not being able to maneuver guys because of foul trouble
obviously plays into it. They're a really good team, so it's all of those
things combined.  
  
SETH LeDAY: Yeah, when Zach got his fourth foul, even with Zach they're a
really great team. I just think that we didn't handle business on the
defensive glass, and that was a big separation tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, the size differential seemed to be very present there. Your
thoughts on the size differential playing such a big part, especially in the
rebounding game?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, 20 percent of our losses this year have come to Florida
State. I would have to think through all of the losses, but when teams get
that many more shots than we do, it's typically because we're struggling to
get a rebound to finish the possession defensively. We're going to play 6'6"
and under. That's the team that we have, and we've done all right. But yeah,
if a team shoots as many more field goals as we do, it's a struggle for us.  
  
Q. Buzz, it's been 10 years since a team has left the ACC Tournament
pretty much knowing they're in the NCAA Tournament.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Say it again now?  
  
Q. It's been 10 years in Blacksburg since a Virginia Tech team has gone
home from the ACC Tournament with the fate that they're going to get this
year. How much different does that make bowing out of a tournament than say
last year where you knew maybe NIT, and Seth, as a player curious what it's
like knowing that you have very significant games still ahead of you?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: We're thankful to still be playing. I mean this in the right
tone of voice: I can't speak on the last 10 years or 11 years because we
haven't been here. And that's not to be disrespectful to those that were in
these chairs. We're grateful for the chairs that we sit in. We're thankful to
still be playing back to back nights. I think we managed it as best we could.
But that we get to go home and know that we have another opportunity, there
will be 68 teams that will be 0-0, and we want to keep playing.  
  
Q. Zach, not to put too much emphasis on that fourth foul, what did you
see in the play when the whistle was blown? Did you think it was kind of a big
moment?  
ZACH LeDAY: I was just trying to get around in the post, had my hands straight
up. The ref made the call, he must have seen something. I'm not sure. But I
can't put myself in those situations because that's not helping my team, and
I've just got to be smarter than that, just try to get myself out of those
situations and just keep playing hard.  
  
Q. How much different does it feel this year going home to such a
significant future as opposed to last year when it was the NIT and maybe not
quite as big a deal?  
SETH ALLEN: That's a good question. Like Coach said, we're grateful for the
ability to play. I think because we took care of business in non-conference
and preseason and in the conference, it gave us the opportunity to still be
playing, and I mean, it's a blessing. We're going to be grateful for it. We're
going to treat it the right way, and we're going to prepare as best we can for
postseason or wherever God lets us play.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Zach's performance battling guys two,
three, four, five inches taller than he was tonight?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: That's all he knows. I don't mean that condescending. He
doesn't know any different. He's a little taller because of his length than
what his height actually says. I think it's hard to measure someone's heart,
but he plays with incredible fight. For him to do what he's done here over the
last two games obviously allowed us to still be here today.  
  
And not to say that it's not about Zach, but I think per position, pretty much
we're always shorter. I think our style of play fits our personnel, and I
think we've adjusted over the last eight games to what's best for us, and I
think it's a more narrow lane than what we were accustomed to prior to that.
But I think it speaks to our staff and the work that they've done to make
those adjustments and the willingness to the kids to be able to try to execute
that.  
  
We had a turnover rate of 21 percent, so 20 percent of the time we gave them
the ball. They got 18 offensive rebounds, which led to 13 more field goal
attempts than us, and we got beat by six by the 16th-ranked team in the
country, playing seven guys on back-to-back nights. But it's just a very
specific recipe that we have to follow, and it's a very fragile line of doing
that per possession on both ends of the floor.  
  
I think that we're mixing and matching defensively in the right way. We can't
get in rotation. We have to keep the ball in front because it is going to come
down to a rebounding situation; can we finish the possession with the rebound.  
  
To your point, Zach or Seth or 5 or whoever were smaller, and being
transparent, less athletic. So our guys are willing to accept that, which
speaks to who they are, and I thought there were multiple times tonight that
they could have stopped, and they didn't, and I think that's why, to Aaron's
question, I think that's why we're still playing, and not to expand on what
Seth said, but in the right sort of way, I think our guys have felt as though
they've been playing postseason since Valentine's because they understood what
was at stake, and I think that it speaks to the toughness of who they are that
they understood that postseason was now, and that's hard to understand. Those
are the only two seniors on our team, and that's a heavy burden to carry
figuratively, and I think they've carried it really well.  
  
And so I think on Sunday, if you're able to be there, I think they'll remember
whatever questions you asked the rest of their life. He's never played, he's
never played, and there's not a player in the locker room that's ever played
in the NCAA Tournament. So for them to chase that since Valentine's Day and
not even really completely understand the chase, that's great wisdom for their
life.  
  
Q. For the players, you had to play last night; they did not. You played
seven guys, they played 12. How much of that had an effect as the game wore on
there?  
SETH ALLEN: I mean, our bodies are fine. I don't think that we were fatigued.
I think, like Coach said, we turned the ball over too much. They got 13 or 14
more possessions than us, and I mean, just mathematically it's hard to win
when they get that many extra possessions, and we still only lost by six. So I
mean, that just shows the fight with our seven guys in our locker room and our
program, our coaching staff that we ain't never going to give up, no matter
how bad we play or how we play. But when we tighten things up, we're a really
good team to watch.  
  
ZACH LeDAY: I think just to piggyback on that, we did turn it over too much
and they got a lot of offensive rebounds, but I wouldn't really say them
having 12 players really made that much of a difference. Only five people can
play for each team, and we're all going to go out there and play as hard as
possible.  
  
I know everybody, my team is going to play as hard as they can and give it
their all, so if we just cut down on the turnovers and just keep on boxing
out, then I feel like we could have won this game, regardless of them having
12 and going deep.  
  
Q. Zach, Coach mentioned you deal with a height disadvantage a lot. Is
this maybe the most extreme example that you've experienced in your whole
basketball life because you were guarded by 6'9 ", 6'10", 7'1", and 7'4", and
that sounds about as extreme as it can get.  
ZACH LeDAY: To be honest, I don't really look at the height. I just feel like
if I play hard, I'll be able to help my team win no matter how tall I am or
how tall another person is. I know I can just do what I can control. I can't
control how tall I am. I can't control how tall they are. I just need to keep
on playing hard and boxing out and keeping those big guys off the glass, and
that'll help our team.  
  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: He did pretty good to have 22 and 9 and those guys he played
against last night, 31 and 15. That guy, you won't cover that guy again. He'll
be one of those ACC Hall of Fame guys in 10 years. That's 43 points and 24
rebounds, and he played 64 minutes. So per-minute played, if you add all of
those guys up, he probably held his own.  
  
Q. You guys had seven three-pointers in the first half. I don't think
you had another one until the last minute of the game. Did their defense do
certain things to make them tougher looks for you from three-point in the
second half?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I think their defensive philosophy is pretty much the same. I
think that's the first time they've played zone in the last month and a half.
I thought we did well in the first half attacking the way we need to, free-
throw make, free-throw attempts was pretty good. Some of those threes down the
stretch were quick on purpose. Some of those threes were without a paint touch
based on time, scoring and momentum. You're right, we typically make more, but
that's probably about the amount that we average attempting. But I don't think
that they changed. Obviously every team is going to play us that way to some
extent.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Deng Adel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32872)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 81, Louisville - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with a brief opening statement
from Coach Pitino.  
  
COACH PITINO: I thought we played well enough to win the game tonight. We
certainly have improved a lot offensively, but we still have some free-throw
shooting woes, which really hurt us. If we improve that area and play the same
type of offense that we're playing, I think we have a chance to go pretty far.  
  
We're very disappointed we lost this game. We thought we were a better
basketball team, and we were hoping to win this tournament. They wound up
being the better basketball team. So give them a lot of credit, and we move on
and have a long layoff.  
  
Q. Deng, you looked like you were able to get a lot of penetration, a
lot of layups early. What was so effective about that?  
DENG ADEL: In the first half, we did a good job of rebounding and pushing the
ball. When we ran, opened up the lane, and we were just trying to move the
ball and get easy layups.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a 12-point lead and almost run him out of the
building, four or five transition baskets. They looked a little leg dead,
having played yesterday. How did they get back in the game and win?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we played four games to win the Big East, and I think
Connecticut one time played five. If they're leg weary, then they're not in
very good shape. So I don't buy that.  
  
We missed a key blockout on the line. They missed a free-throw. We didn't
blockout, they threw it back out and got a three. It was a key play in the
game. If you don't block out on the foul line, there's something wrong.  
  
Q. Talk about Kennard's performance and how he seemed to take over at
the end.  
COACH PITINO: He's a great player. I love him. I recruited him in high school.
We gave him his left hand a little bit too much tonight. We didn't at
Louisville. I love his game.  
  
Sometimes I look at rankings, and I can tell you from spending eight years in
the pros that what you see on this.net or this.net is not what the general
managers are thinking in the pros of who to draft. That's just saying who the
best players are, in their opinion. I've always felt he was, from an offensive
standpoint, one, two, or three best players in the country because he really
knows how to play the game of basketball. He really head fakes well. He passes
well, and has great feel for the game, and he's a great foul shooter as well.  
  
Q. Rick, on the foul that was called against -- on you, your team
against Grayson Allen that sort of touched off that little Grayson Allen
sequence there, you seemed to be indicating that you thought he cleared off
with his free arm. Was that the case? And what was your view of that entire
sequence?  
COACH PITINO: I felt early on in the play he fended off with his arm, but I'm
okay with that call. I'm not okay with Donovan Mitchell's block shot and the
fact that he got his other foul, which he didn't foul him on either play.  
  
So that play I'll live with, but you take your best player and put him to the
bench on plays that I believe weren't fouls. Now, I watched one of those, the
second one. It's just referees play a huge factor in games. They really do.
It's not often talked -- sometimes it goes in your favor. A couple times this
year it went in our favor, and of late it hasn't gone. They can play a huge
factor by putting your best players on the bench at times if it's a foul or if
it's not a foul.  
  
They're a good crew. They're a good refereeing crew. I thought he used his arm
to fend off, and then they got the real foul after the two dribbles. They made
the right call.  
  
Q. Just to jump off of what you're saying about Luke Kennard, do you see
him as the best pro prospect on that Duke team?  
COACH PITINO: Oh, I don't know. Mike would be better answering that. It's
either him or Tatum, obviously. Certainly, they're both great. It all depends
what type of team you have. Like if you're San Antonio, and they had a high
pick, he fits in so well with that scheme. It all depends on what team and
what you need, as far as that's concerned. I think he's going to be an
outstanding pro, no question in my mind.  
  
Q. Rick, you forced 18 turnovers in January against them. They handled
the ball better today. What did you see as the difference in that regard?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we didn't press as much in this game. We pressed a little
bit, not much, because when you play every day, it's tough to press every day.
It's a little bit different. You know, it's -- we lost a game mentally tonight
a little bit.  
  
The obvious thing is you pick up the stat sheet, and even some of those one-
on-ones, we lost the game -- could have won by 10, 15 points if we make our
free throws. That's the obvious thing.  
  
There's three or four major mistakes we made in the game -- not switching out,
not blocking on the three, not blocking on the foul line, giving up a three,
coming in on the strong side, giving up a three. And then running a play we
practice every day at the end and then not getting in the right spot. So those
are things this team lacks right now. Because they give you a lot of effort,
great heart, but mentally they're just not where they need to be.  
  
Q. I know you're coming off this game, but just your thoughts on the
value of having the ACC Tournament here in New York as opposed to, say,
Greensboro. Obviously, Coach Boeheim had some strong statements about that
yesterday.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I can't be as eloquent as Jim. Let me say this. You have
to understand what it's all about because, when there were eight teams and
most of them were on Tobacco Road, Greensboro is a great town and a great fit.
But when you've got a corporation, it's now not about -- for us, we don't care
if it's Greensboro, Washington, New York. We don't go out. We're sequestered
away, watching film, getting ready.  
  
The whole thing is for the fans. They don't have Final Fours in towns where
the fans can enjoy themselves. A dome is a dome. It's for the fans, and
obviously, Jim meant to say that (laughter). But after a loss we say things we
regret later. It really is for the fans. New York is great for the fans. D.C.
is great for the fans and so on.  
  
Greensboro was great for an eight-team league on Tobacco Road where all the
teams are from, they gather together, and it's one big happy fraternity. But
now we've got them out of the fraternity, it needs to be a good environment,
and this certainly is a good environment.  
  
Q. Do you think there's any added benefit, media coverage or recruiting-
wise, to having it here? Coach Williams was saying because of social media,
you could have it anywhere, and it would still be covered heavily.  
COACH PITINO: No question about that. That's a true statement. But I go back
to the fans. You have the best restaurants, the best hotels. It's very tough
to have this many teams in small towns. Charlotte is going to be great. And
Greensboro is a great town. It's like a big convention. Why do they have so
many in Las Vegas and Napa Valley and all those places? There's a reason for
that.  
  
Thanks for distracting me from this game.  
  
Q. Talk about a quarterfinal game and the quality of the play. Did it
almost feel like a championship game with the intensity?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, we really played well today. I can tell you, I'm
heartbroken we lost today because we've become a very, very good offensive
basketball team, and we have struggled with our offense. We always were decent
at times at defense, and we've become a very good offensive team.  
  
But we have got to cure these free-throw shooting woes because like last --
you've got to win six games to win a National Championship. You can't -- like
last game we shot free throws well. Next game we shoot -- you can't do that.
You're going to have to shoot a decent percentage for six games to win a
National Championship because it's like a turnover. And although we only
turned it over eight times in the game with 15 assists, that's a really good
offensive production, and we shoot 48 percent, that's good. But if you shoot
15 for 26, some of those being the first half of one-on-one, you're beating
yourself where they go and they shoot 22 for 31.  
  
Q. Coach, when you met with us way back at Operation Basketball, you
said, among other things, fans don't like to hear that maybe you'll be better
next year than this year, but you said you came here thinking you could win
this tournament. Did your guys surprise you with how far they came given what
you said back in the preseason?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we had very little experience returning, lost our two
leading scorers. Only Q and Mango have any tournament experience. It showed a
little bit tonight, not in the missed free throws because we've done that
before. It showed in the missed switches, the lack of blocking out, all the
little things.  
  
And that will be a great lesson going into this game. When you're playing in
the ACC -- we wanted to really play Carolina badly because it was one of few
games we didn't play well, and we wanted to have that opportunity. But Duke
stopped it. Everybody from your neck of the woods will love Duke-Carolina
talk. So it's good. You put the hex on us.  
  
Q. Question for Mangok.  
COACH PITINO: Deng Adele.  
  
Q. I'm sorry.  
COACH PITINO: That's all right. I do it all the time. You're my age.  
  
Q. Your big guys' length really bothered Duke today. You got credit for
six blocked shots, and they may have missed a couple. You guys were able to
convert that into fast break baskets. Just talk about that as a weapon going
forward.  
DENG ADEL: Our bigs are great at blocking shots. Usually, when we get beat,
they step up and block the shot. But it's up to us as the guards to switch
out. Once they take our man, we got to block out the big guy. And then getting
guard rebounds helps us out because it makes it easy to push the ball.

### [Bruce Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32853)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Miami - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're with Coach Jim Larrañaga, Kamari Murphy, and Bruce Brown.
Coach, just a brief opening statement, and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH LARRANAGA: I thought Carolina was very sharp from the start. They made a
lot of shots early, got some things going.  
  
I didn't think we were sharp all day. Our defense did not put up much
resistance, and our offense was out of sync from the very beginning. End
result is a 24-point, or whatever it was, 25-point loss.  
  
Q. Jim, it seemed like in the first game you guys did a really good job
in the interior against them, did not happen that way today. What did they do
differently, or what did you do differently?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think that's the thing about North Carolina. They're very
predictable what they're trying to do, and our players knew what they were
trying to do. We just couldn't stop it.  
  
Our attention to detail, our focus at the defensive end was impacted by how
poorly we were playing offense. You miss shots. You turn it over. You give
them some easy baskets. You get frustrated with your offense, then all of a
sudden you're thinking about your offense when you should be playing defense.  
  
There were just so many times they did exactly what we knew they were trying
to do. They threw that lob pass a number of times. They didn't get that once
against us at our place. Our guys defended it exactly the way we planned to.
And last night -- and some of it may have to do with not having time to
actually practice it on a court. We did it in a ballroom last night at the
hotel at 9:00 at night. Not a lot of time to prepare.  
  
And even though you should remember what we did the first time, because you
play so many games against so many different teams and they do so many
different offensive plays, it's challenging for a player. But without that
game preparation, we just didn't play well.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of Bruce being the offensive bright spot today, I'm
curious, first of all, what you made of his overall performance here? But also
the fact that his numbers have been disproportionately good against North
Carolina and Duke this year. What do you think that says about his growth and
development as a player?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think Bruce is a great competitor, and I think he loves a
challenge. I think he should have been on the All-Rookie team. I can't believe
a player of his caliber who had the kind of year he had did not make the All-
Rookie team. Just not right.  
  
But I thought he was pretty solid today, but you need a team effort. In
Bruce's case, I know he wants to win. It's what the game is about. Win the
game. And he's going to do whatever is necessary to do his part.  
  
Q. What about Carolina's defense made it a tough shooting day for you?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, the first thing is their defensive pressure early on,
on the ball and on the initial pass and on our initial ball screen, was far
better than it was the first time we played them. So we had a much harder time
trying to get into the paint and score. But I think part of that was we were
not nearly as aggressive and quick and thoughtful in our decision making.  
  
So I think a lot of credit goes to their players' effort, team effort
defensively. I'm sure Coach Williams mentioned to them how the game went in
Miami.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm just wondering your thoughts on the value of having the
ACC Tournament in a big city like New York or Washington or somewhere versus
Greensboro. As you may have heard, Coach Boeheim had some strong thoughts on
it yesterday.  
COACH LARRANAGA: What did Boeheim say?  
  
Q. He said there was no value to having the tournament in Greensboro
whatsoever, none.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I'm only kidding. I know what he said.  
  
Q. So what are your thoughts on that?  
COACH LARRANAGA: First of all, I coached in the ACC in the early '80s, from
'79 to '86, and I thought it was the best basketball league in the country
then. For a majority of my years there, we played it in Greensboro. I think
one year we played it in Atlanta. Another year we played it in the Cap Centre
in Washington, D.C. To me, the ACC Tournament, no matter where it's played, is
a tremendous event and deserves the recognition that it does get.  
  
But the fact of the matter is New York City is the capital of college
basketball, starting back when CCNY and LIU were winning national titles, and
kids were growing up in the city and becoming All-Americans and NBA players.
So to bring the ACC, the best basketball conference in the country, to the
mecca of college basketball and give it the exposure that it truly deserves, I
think is a great thing. Not to disparage any other city or any other location,
but New York is special.  
  
I played for Dave Gavitt at Providence College, he is the first commissioner
of the Big East conference. He kind of founded the league, and his goal was to
create a conference that could compete on the national level with the ACC, and
the way he did it was he brought the Big East Tournament to Madison Square
Garden in New York City, and all of a sudden, every kid around the country was
following Big East basketball.  
  
From a business model, you want to get as much exposure as you can so that the
coaches in your league can recruit the best players, and they know more about
your league than anybody else because of the exposure they got during the ACC
Tournament.  
  
By us coming to New York now, we hope we will benefit from it in the long run.
In addition, we no longer have eight teams like they were in the '80s. We now
have 15 teams, and we're spread out all over the place. We may be called the
Atlantic Coast Conference, but we have Notre Dame, we have Louisville, we have
Pittsburgh, we have Miami and Virginia Tech -- all in the Big East. So we've
taken the creme de la creme of one league that was highly thought of and put
it with the creme de la creme of the ACC, and now we have, in my estimation,
the best basketball conference in American history of college basketball.  
  
Q. Do you want it to stay in the big cities, or are you okay with it
rotating to Greensboro?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Again, as I said, this is not my choice. My choice is for us
to be the best basketball league in the country and for everybody to know that
because of the exposure we're getting. So the bigger the venue, the more
people that are watching, the more media exposure, the better for the
conference.  
  
Q. Kamari, you guys got within three in the first half. Did you think
things were in pretty decent shape all things considered at that point?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Yeah, leaving the first half, we left the floor with a lot of
confidence. But coming back, again, we couldn't stop what they were doing. We
knew what was coming, but they continued to attack us.  
  
And then on our end, we were hesitant. We weren't attacking them. We just
wasn't glued together this game. I'm not going to say we fell apart, but they
just were the better team today.  
  
Q. Kind of put things back together when you get into the NCAA
Tournament here next week?  
KAMARI MURPHY: It's another season. When we came into this one, we said it's a
new season, 0-0. So NCAA is a new season. We're going to leave this game
behind, leave this tournament behind, and then start a new season in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Kamari, you're from Brooklyn, right?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Yes.  
  
Q. What neighborhood?  
KAMARI MURPHY: East New York, Brooklyn.  
  
Q. What's your view on what Coach just said? And how was it for you come
can back to Brooklyn to play in this tournament?  
KAMARI MURPHY: It was amazing. Besides the family and friends that I got to
see, it gave guys that have never been to New York the exposure. Like Anthony
Lawrence has never been to New York City. We went to the World Trade and took
that tour. So it gives guys that have never been around the world that
exposure.  
  
Of course, I would love it to come back, but this is my last year. I think it
was fun. I think they should continue to do it.  
  
Q. Have you ever played in this arena before?  
KAMARI MURPHY: No. They played Providence my redshirt year. I came to watch,
but I never got to play. So this is my first year this time.  
  
Q. Bruce, two parts to this. One is, curious how you account for your
ability to put up particularly big numbers against UNC, against Duke. And just
related to that, the fit you see at Miami, the success you've had here on the
court, the success you've had off the court with the GPA at 3.0. Does Miami
feel like a long-term fit for you in both of those ways?  
BRUCE BROWN: Yes, for sure. My success with Duke and North Carolina is just
Coach L putting me in positions to score the ball, pick-and-roll offense, and
back screens.  
  
The school is just they help me a lot in the classroom. I get tremendous help
from my academic advisors. I go extra hours to get help on tests and quizzes.
So it's a perfect fit for me, honestly.  
  
Q. And just real specific to the end of the first half, where you had
that putback and then that dunk right at the end of the half, did you feel
like you were getting the opportunity to carry the team on your back in a
fundamental way at that point?  
BRUCE BROWN: I was just trying to give us a boost of energy. I felt like we
were down and we weren't playing the way we knew we were capable of. So I was
just trying to give us energy, get us hyped. I guess it didn't work.  
  
Q. The other two Miami teams we've seen you take to the NCAA Tournament,
both went to the Sweet 16. They also were, what, top two or three in the
league. What do you see from this group, what could make it a potential Sweet
16 type of team or even more?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, despite the fact the way we played today, this has been
an outstanding defensive team. We've been very hard to score on. We have some
guys that are just tremendous defensive players.  
  
The guy sitting next to me, Kamari Murphy, is as good a defensive player as
I've ever coached. He can do so many things at the defensive end of the floor.  
  
And Davon Reed is an All-Conference defensive player. Bruce plays very hard
defensively. I thought Ja'Quan Newton's defense yesterday on John Gillon was a
big key. And if our young big guys come along and guard the basket for us a
little bit better and rebound, I think that gives us a real chance against
anybody.  
  
I would look at Carolina and think they're a real threat to win the National
Championship, and yet we split with them. I mean, I know we played bad today,
but we're very capable of playing a whole lot better than we did. At the
offensive end, we're not quite as consistent as we are defensively, and if we
share the ball well and get some assists and don't turn it over very much,
we'll be a tough team to beat.

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 81, Louisville - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we could go ahead and start with a brief opening statement
from Coach, and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: So that was a quarterfinal game. Holy mackerel. Wow, that
was a big time game. We're so pleased and proud of the win because we beat a
heck of a team and a team that could win it all really.  
  
We just made some shots and played our hearts out. They played their hearts
out. We hit a couple more shots than them. I don't know how you can split
hairs on that game. Both teams played so hard. That was a heck of a game, just
in case you didn't know that. I would hope that you would know that.  
  
Hopefully, we have some gas in the tank here as we push on. I'm proud of my
guys and made big time shots. When we got down by double digits, made a little
change defensively. But defensive rebound, and we attacked. We started attack.
They attacked us so much in the start of the second half, we were on the
bottom of a hill covered with snow catching a sled. Their fast break, man,
they were just coming at us. We just had to do something to stop momentum.
These guys were able to do that.  
  
Again, we beat an outstanding team. Obviously, I love -- Rick and I are great,
great friends and admire everything that they do in their program. It was a
big time win for us.  
  
Q. Grayson, first off, congrats on the win. My question is after your
scoreless in the first game, it's the first time you haven't scored since
2015, in the Elite 8 game against Gonzaga. What does it mean to put out a good
performance in a big game, and what's your confidence like going into the game
against North Carolina?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, I've had a lot of confidence. It's big for a game like
this because I was happy I was able to contribute to the team in what we did.
We really needed a spark off the bench, and I didn't think I did a good job of
that in the first game. So I thought I could be better than that.  
  
Today when I came in, it was really just trying to give these guys energy. A
lot of our starters played big time minutes just 24 hours ago, where I had a
little bit fresher legs and was able to go out there and really just attack
and hopefully pick the team up and give us a little spark.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously, when you talk about Duke versus UNC, that's a sacred
thing. Obviously, those games are played in Durham or Chapel Hill or
Greensboro. Is it at all awkward or different that this game is taking place
tomorrow so far from home in New York?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No. I sound like Popovich, don't I? I spent the week with
him in the summer. So he told me how to answer a good question, a really good
question, but with a very short answer.  
  
We're going to enjoy this for just a little bit before we think about them.
The bottom line is we're going to play two Final Four caliber teams in a row
in 24 hours. I mean, Louisville and North Carolina are Final Four caliber
teams. We just played them, had a great game. If we're fresh enough, I think
it will be a great game.  
  
Q. As you guys were coming up the stairs, it was nothing but joy on all
of y'all's faces. Tell me about this win and how happy you guys are for this
win.  
JAYSON TATUM: This was big time for us because, obviously, we lost to them
early in January. We realize that we're a much different team from then. We
went through a lot of ups and downs. We're continuing to grow and learn and
get better each and every day. So this was a big stepping stone for us.  
  
Like Coach said, Louisville is a Final Four caliber team with a great coach
and great players. So for us to come back and play the way we did today after
a good win yesterday in less than 24 hours was huge for us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about going to the zone and its effectiveness and
then why you changed on the last possession back to man.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, any port in a storm, so to speak. We could not stop
them in transition in man. They come down so hard.  
  
I don't know if our guys got tired, you know, guys who were -- because we had
a tough game against Clemson yesterday. So I just thought maybe we could just
run back there, everybody try to stop them.  
  
And they missed some shots. It's not like we played a great zone, but it
changed a little the tempo. And then we went back to man because we didn't
want to give up an open three. So we could switch everything. And our guys,
really, that was like the possession of the game defensively for us when we --
our guys switched everything.  
  
Snyder is such a good player. You've got to be careful that you don't foul him
because he's trying to draw a foul.  
  
Luke had eight, I think -- what did he have? Eight defensive rebounds, and
Jayson had six. That was the key in the second half was the defensive
rebounding from our perimeter, which led us to fast breaking. It's kind of
like we were fast breaking, and now we were fast breaking.  
  
I had so much fun coaching our team today. I felt like a little kid, man. They
were fun to coach. They gave everything. You wanted to not get in their way
really. That's why we just called motion, 12, and play. That's a big time
coaching strategy. And our kids just played. They played. It's all on them.
They played great. They deserved to win.  
  
Q. After Louisville got up 12, your team looked maybe a little tired or
certainly looked knocked back a little bit. Within a few minutes, they were
reenergized. My question was with the tactics Louisville pressed one time
which led to an easy basket, seemed to get him going. You went zone. Was this
tactics or more something from within the players?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think more from within the players. Always a little bit of
tactics when you make a change. I thought in that play, you bring up a really
important play because they're going for a knockout punch right there. If you
can remember the play, the guy who caught the ball was Marques Bolden in the
middle. He passed it ahead and we got a layup. It gave us a spark.  
  
Also, Harry, that's the best Harry played. He didn't hold anything back, and
Marques gave us good minutes. It was so good because these guys have fought
injury, especially Harry. To see him out there and having fun and being
himself, wow.  
  
These guys right here, they're excited -- I hope you're excited about -- that
kind of stuff. That's what I mean. Like today was just joy. Obviously, there's
joy of winning, but how you win and to see kids put it all out there, it's
great.  
  
I mean, Luke, he's not up here, but wow. A couple of his shots were daggers.
Daggers. It's fun. It was fun coaching them.  
  
Q. Jayson, and if Coach wants to chime in too. When Grayson gets fouled
shooting that three, there was a lot of energy in the building at that point.
You had boos and cheers after each shot and a lot of energy on the bench. Did
that energy hit you guys? Were you able to use that energy to help boost that
comeback?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, for me, energy produces energy. I think we already had
energy, and people saw it. And then Grayson has played for three years all
out. All out. All out. That was another example of it, and his teammates and
everyone responded.  
  
And the people who don't want us to win, they responded. God bless everyone.
But energy produced more energy.  
  
Q. Grayson, was there a difference in how you felt yesterday, today, or
anything that you kind of told yourself mentally last night to kind of
rejuvenate today?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: No, I just attacked the same way and made some shots today.
That was really it. And got going a little bit and just was able to bring us
energy when I got in, and then once the whole team got energized, just feeding
off of that, like Coach said.  
  
Q. This could be for any of you. Coach, you just talked about the energy
today. Usually, when you're playing Carolina, it's either in Cameron or in the
Dean dome, where there's energy for one particular team. There's probably
going to be energy on both sides. I'm sure Duke and Carolina fans are buying
up the ticket from losing teams today. What do you think that energy's going
to be like?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Typical. Look, they're a great program. We're a great
program. We're two of the great programs. We're accustomed, they're accustomed
to playing in buildings that have a lot of energy, for or against them. That's
why the kids go to those schools is to be in those moments, to be in a moment
like today.  
  
So to be in that moment tomorrow, the people who were in the stands, they have
a chance to enjoy that because those moments don't happen all the time. Our
two programs have created a lot of them.  
  
Q. You talked about today being pure joy for you.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah.  
  
Q. You've been through this a few times. When it's pure joy at this
point in the season, are those the years that you guys are usually the last
ones standing?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Just depends if you have a series of pure joys. There can be
pure heartbreak too. Our sport's crazy. It really is. And that's why it's
madness. These kids put their hearts -- all these teams, the conference
tournaments and all that. They win by a point. They lose by a point. It's what
captures our whole country. I'm so happy that I'm a part of it and been a part
of it for 42 years.  
  
So to have an afternoon like today, I'm 70 years old, and I felt like a kid. I
was hugging him, punching him. He didn't punch back, which is a good decision
on his part. I love that. I love that. It's nice to be a guy -- it's nice to
be a guy in a situation like that, and we got good guys.  
  
Q. Amile had a long stretch on the bench in the first half. Is he
okay?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, he's okay. I think he's worn out. He had to play the
two big guys from Clemson, and Harry was playing so well that I just felt too
that, one, I think, if he's playing well, we've got a better chance to win.
But, two, going forward, to get him time in a game like that was really
valuable. Very valuable. And it turned out it was more than just getting him
time. He produced.  
  
But he's okay. He'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Mike, what's it been like for you to watch Grayson this year, you
know, go through physically and emotionally what he's gone through, and how
hard was it to keep him on the bench even last night in crunch time?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he wasn't ready to play as well last night. Look, I
love Grayson. Grayson, I got his back all the time. And everyone in our
program has his back all the time. We're just -- the public eye on our program
is a blessing and can be a curse. So we have to be able to deal with all of
it.  
  
The thing in dealing with all of it is for everyone to know that we're
together. I believe in him. I love him. And I thought what he did today was
sensational. I loved it. I loved it. He was himself today.  
  
Q. Jayson, can you tell when your team's playing well defensively -- you
guys had some really good stretches on defense today and had some other
stretches where they were getting easy baskets. Are there some things you're
able to tell focus-wise or things you're doing when you're playing well
defensively?  
JAYSON TATUM: Just when everyone is in a defensive stand and talking. That's
when we're at our best. It has to be all five guys. It can't just be two or
three that are just talking and the other two are not. When all five guys are
talking in a defensive stand and trying to get a stop together, that's when
we're at our best.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you're 70 but you felt like a kid today, and today
was more proof that you're still able to get some of the best players in the
game. How do you reach prospects who are a lot younger than you are and still
connect with them and get them to come play for you?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's called communication. You're in the communication
business, right? And being honest with them. I think I can -- do I still get
along with you guys?  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah.  
  
JAYSON TATUM: Yeah.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: One thing about coaching, you're always with young people,
so you're able to stay younger. I'm lucky. I've done what I wanted to do since
I was 16, and I've been able to do it at two great schools. They bring kids
like this in. This school brings a little bit more talent than the other one.
But it's been fun.  
  
When you're around good people all the time, you don't age as badly, let's put
it that way. At least I hope it looks like I haven't aged that badly. Thank
you all.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Jonathan Isaac](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32902)

### [Dwayne Bacon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30471)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Florida State - 74, Virginia Tech - 68  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Virginia Tech was very well-prepared. We had a very
difficult time at the beginning of the game because they confused us, made us
somewhat tentative with their defensive coverages. We made some adjustments
there midway in the second half, and we were able to climb back into the lead
offensively, and we also went to a seldom-used zone. I thought Christ Koumadje
came in and gave us a good lift. He just clogged up the middle there and gave
them a different look.  
  
Second half we came out and it was still nip and tuck, very hard-fought game,
but I thought we got some stops, got some easy baskets. Dwayne hit a couple of
baskets, and we got some put-backs, extended the lead a little bit, and we
were able to kind of get the game and the tempo that we like.  
  
Q. Dwayne, what did you think happened in that stretch there, I think
you guys scored in nine consecutive possessions to push things out a little
bit.  
DWAYNE BACON: I think we stayed in attack mode, me, myself, Christ was making
the shots he can make. Every guy that we had on the team that was in the game
at the time was just pitching in in a positive way, and I think that's what
made us have a successful run.  
  
Q. Coach, when LeDay had to leave the floor with the fouls, you guys
took advantage and had that big run. Talk about that as a difference maker in
the game.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we had intended in our game to be extremely aggressive
in terms of taking the ball to the basket, but their schemes and their ability
to plug the hole and not give you clear vision of how you can get to the
basket was problematic for us, but during that period, I thought we moved the
ball a little better, created some wider gaps, and we were able to get in,
drive, and got some put-backs, and I thought that really made the difference.
In fact we were a lot more aggressive during that period because our ball
movement was a lot better.  
  
Q. Do you feel like in the second half, could you sense you were wearing
them down and the depth advantage you had was kicking in there?  
JONATHAN ISAAC: Yeah, that's our thing, and this team has a great depth and
that's exactly what we do. We wear teams down. So we already know what's going
to happen. When we start off slow, we're in the locker room saying we're going
to wear them down because that's what we do.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Koumadje, just the presence you guys had down
low, seemed like that was a real big advantage for you guys, and for the
players, the vindication of picking up a big win on the road.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, it's important that we got to the next round, no doubt
about that, just for the confidence of our players and the fact that they've
worked real hard all year. The fact that Ojo had two fouls and Jarquez had two
fouls and we were able to go to our third-string center and he was able to
come in and be effective, I thought that was huge for us. All year long the
quality of our depth has raised its head there during most of the games and
given us an opportunity to win games.  
  
DWAYNE BACON: I think there's a chance right now where every game is going to
be on the road so we can't look at any game and be like, oh, this is on the
road or this is on the road because it's tournament time, so every time we
play now from here on out is going to be on the road so we've just got to
compete like if we were home and that's kind of what we did tonight when we
came out in the second half.  
  
JONATHAN ISAAC: Like Dwayne said, you could tell in the first half, we had a
little bit of jitters, but we ironed it out in the second half and we felt
comfortable and just went to work.  
  
Q. Dwayne, I think you were 0-5 in the first half and you've excelled on
every level in every big game. Did you say something to yourself or did
anybody say something to you?  
DWAYNE BACON: I don't talk to myself, but I did, you know -- I go in the
locker room every time, just be quiet, listen to what everybody got to say and
come out in the second half and play my game like I did the first half. It was
tough. I had to adjust because it was kind of a mix up. We haven't played here
since earlier in the season, so I kind of had to adjust and had some hand
issues but I came out in the second half, sucked it up and played as hard as I
could.  
  
Q. Since you don't talk to yourself, did anybody talk to you?  
DWAYNE BACON: Yeah, a couple players told me, this is your half, it's time to
will it in and let's get this win. We were down 2, so it wasn't too bad when
we came back from halftime. We had a chance to fight back, and that's what we
came out and did.  
  
Q. You had seven three-pointers in the first half, but I don't think
they had another one until the last minute of the game. Did your defense do
certain things to make a tougher shooting day for them in the second half?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We tried to make it a tough shooting day for them in the
first half. They're a very good basketball team, and they're the No. 1 three-
point shooting team in the ACC. They're in the top 10 in the nation. When we
played them earlier in the year, they only made four threes. We wanted to try
to keep them under their limit.  
  
I thought the second half we didn't give up as much penetration. We backed off
a little bit and contained the dribble a little better, and we were able to
contain and not give them the kick-out jump shots as much as what they had
been accustomed to in the first half.  
  
Q. Jon and Dwayne, you guys kind of mentioned you're playing every game
outside of the Tucker Center from here on out, you had a little bit of jitters
to start the game. To go on that run after letting them lead 8 to 6 points
that first half, to cut it to 2 at the half, how big was that to keep that
game in front of you and keep it from getting away?  
DWAYNE BACON: I think it was pretty big because I don't even think I was in
when we went on that run. It was our bench players and they were just wearing
them down, and that's what we've been getting from those guys all year. A lot
of those guys are freshmen or newcomers but those guys can play as hard as we
can, and that's what they did. They wore them down, and they had a chance to
make a run.  
  
JONATHAN ISAAC: For me it just kept everything in perspective. Our second time
playing in the Barclays Center, they played here yesterday, so they're more
accustomed to it, so going into the second half I wasn't scared at all where
we were at. We were down 2. First game coming back to the Barclays Center, so
I thought we were in good position, and we made a run.  
  
Q. Jonathan, your length and height really were impactful when you made
the big run to get your big lead in the second half; when you're getting all
of those offensive rebounds against them, what are you seeing in them? How is
it affecting them when you guys are getting all those offensive rebounds and
blocked shots?  
JONATHAN ISAAC: I think offensive rebounds, it affects every team. When that
other team gets offensive rebounds and puts it back you kind of feel helpless,
and we had that mantra going into this game that we were going to beat them on
the glass and we'll try to get 20 offensive rebounds, and I don't know if we
got 20, but we got a lot, 18, so we did our job on the boards.  
  
Q. Just the potential match-up with Virginia-Notre Dame. Your thoughts
on the two teams?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This time of year, we all are who we are. We'll make the
necessary adjustments, in-game adjustments, but we're not going to change very
much, so we're very familiar with them, they're very familiar with us. We
split the season with Notre Dame. We were successful at Virginia. So they know
us, we know them. It's going to be more about us and how well we play, how we
execute our defensive philosophy, our offensive philosophy versus what they
do. It won't be a hard prepare for either school. We've just got to go be who
we are this time of year, and hopefully that's enough for us to move on to the
next round.  
  
Q. Coach, you dominated with points in the paint. Can you talk about how
difficult it is for a team whose tallest player is 6'7 " to defend against
those guys?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Getting the 18 offensive rebounds obviously was huge for us
because we got a chance to get to the foul line, we got a chance to get some
easy put-backs. I don't know how many deflections we got, but we were trying
to -- we had to back off because they're such a great team of getting in the
lane, and when they get in the lane, they kick out. We decided that what we
would do the second half, they would have to make tough twos, and they made
quite a few of them, but they didn't make the tough twos and the threes. So
the lift, I thought bothered them somewhat because we tried to play with our
hands up to try to make it as difficult for them to see past the lanes and
finish lanes as possible.  
  
Q. I think this is the first time you guys have gotten to the semis
since '12. Is there any significance to that for you guys? I know it's
obviously been a great year for you guys, but to get back to this point in
this particular event?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I didn't understand your question.  
  
Q. Is there any significance to you guys getting back to the semifinals
after having not been for the last four or five years?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: The two times we played for the championship in the ACC,
we've had similar teams that had quality depth, and we've been able to extend,
play with a lot of energy, keep people fresh. When we played for the
championship and we lost to Duke, I think -- what year was that, '09? And then
we won the championship in '12. We had six seniors and we played 10, 11 guys,
and we were able to stay fresh and play with a lot of effort. Our defense was
able to be a factor like it was tonight.  
  
Q. Leonard, forget the shooting for a second; how would you assess his
play in the first half?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Who?  
  
Q. Handsome on the end there. How would you assess Dwayne's play in the
first half, and do you just expect a player of that caliber will get it
going?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I wasn't concerned at all. I mean, you don't expect -- you
would love for your players to be on point all the time, but when you see them
every day and you have confidence in them, I whispered in his ear at halftime
and told him to be as aggressive as he could the second half. That's the only
thing I said to him, wanted him to be aggressive, because those shots would
start falling.  
  
Dwayne has a way of creating offense not only for himself but for his
teammates, and the fact that people give him a lot of attention, which opens
up opportunities for other people.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that you had to go to a zone at a certain point
in this game. This is the second straight game you've had to do it. Is it nice
to know that you can sometimes when you have to move out of your normal
defensive principles have a defense that can deliver like you guys did in zone
today?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we work on it quite a bit. Tonight it was working. I'm
not a zone guy, but we found out that the caliber of teams that exist in the
ACC, you can't always go all man-to-man with these guys because every team is
loaded with players that can make you pay. So sometimes it's making a little
bit of adjustment or creating enough indecision for another team just to give
you a chance to get it going on the offensive end, and that's what happened
tonight.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Devon Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30893)

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 71, Virginia - 58  
  
COACH BENNETT: First, credit to Notre Dame. We were outplayed today. We were
behind in the play. They really were moving the ball well. They're hard to
guard. They played well, and we didn't have one of our better games. We have
to learn from it but pick up and move on and just were a bit lethargic.  
  
Again, when a team can move the ball as quick as Notre Dame moves the ball and
we were a step behind, they got a lot of easy looks, and they looked fresh,
and we weren't as fresh physically or as fresh mentally as we've been in the
past against them for sure.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett, what do you guys need to do to prepare yourselves for
the Tournament now that that's what you're looking towards?  
COACH BENNETT: You learn from this. We talked about it in the locker room
after. We've got whatever little bit of time now. We recover. We rest. But we
prepare as well as we can in practice and tighten up. We weren't as sound as
we've been in the past. A formula for our success has been we've taken care of
the ball, and we've shot it pretty well.  
  
Notre Dame guarded us hard. They were ready. You could see it. They were very
looking forward to playing us.  
  
We've got to find ways to guard a little better when we get in that situation,
handle those four-guard lineups, and just keep battling. There's not a whole
lot -- we don't throw it inside and score a ton, but we've got to just keep
doing what we've done and have a great however many days prep it is for the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Tony, how is Isaiah feeling right now? 14 minutes tonight, obviously,
he was a big part of your game last time against Colson and things like that.
Will this break help him?  
COACH BENNETT: He is. He's struggling with a bad virus or whatever this is.
Maybe a blessing in disguise if he can get some more rest and recover. He is a
big part of our energy and helping defensively, and he wasn't right in terms
-- they're hard to guard.  
  
When it's Beachem, it's a hard matchup for Isaiah. And Colson. They put
pressure on you. They're playing Colson as the five. And they've got good
quickness and skill offensively. So if your defense isn't really locked in,
it's a problem, and they exploited that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, Kyle obviously had a tough night tonight after the good night
last night. How much were they kind of keying on him, do you think, after what
he did yesterday?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, obviously he played well yesterday, and I'm sure they
were contesting shots. As a first-year guy, he's got to learn from that. That
wasn't one of his stronger games, and there's going to be some ups and downs.
But he was good last night and not as good tonight.  
  
Q. Tony, I think you used ten players in the first ten minutes. Could
you tell right away that something wasn't right tonight?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, they just -- I think, again, Notre Dame, they were hard
-- I felt like we were behind the play. Again, there's matchup issues with
them because of Colson at the five, and we had to use Nzei in limited minutes.
We weren't knocking down our shots, missing easy ones and then weren't
knocking them down.  
  
So, yeah, we were scrambling a little bit. It's a hard matchup who you're
going to play at the four. So, yeah, I was searching for sure.  
  
Q. Tony, you guys are so good defensively from your chair, what Mike is
able to do offensively, how impressive is it in terms of schemes and how he
uses guys?  
COACH BENNETT: He really spreads the floor, and he plays four guards and a
really skilled five man that can shoot the three and bounce it and is a
double-double guy. So their ball movement was terrific tonight. The pace on
their cuts was good, and they had us behind the play. When we're at our best
defensively, we're there, and we're anticipating.  
  
So, yeah, they put a lot of pressure. We've had a lot of good success against
them. We've bothered shots and protected the lane, but we had trouble
protecting the dribble off the bounce, and when they started getting in that
way, again, we're playing catch-up.  
  
Q. London, your shooting wasn't what it has been. How much of it was
Notre Dame, and how much of it was fatigue or anything else?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Obviously, Notre Dame played some good defense tonight. But,
yeah, missed some chippies, some layups. I had a couple of open threes that I
missed. I don't know, I can't really tell you what it's from.  
  
Obviously, Notre Dame played good defense, and I put my hat off to them for
that, but obviously I missed some open jump shots as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you guys have been playing well defensively,
especially throughout the year. What do you guys need to do offensively to
take that next step, especially against teams that play faster like Notre
Dame?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we've got to play better defense. I'll start with that.
But, no, we've got to take care of the ball. We had a couple of live ball
turnovers that led to some easy buckets and even some out-of-bounds defense
that got some easy buckets.  
  
But it's the ability to -- all I want these guys is to get quality shots and
take them. If we're making them, great. If we're not, we're going to shoot the
outside shot when it's there. We'll occasionally look inside. Got to try to
touch the paint and make plays. Probably, when we take care of the ball and
are low with our turnovers and moving hard and taking quality shots, that's
what I ask for, and running our offense with pace, screening well, getting
London the shots and helping him set people up.  
  
I think it's not going to change for us. It's just doing it a little bit
better and taking care of the ball. I think that's a huge thing for us.  
  
Q. London, you mentioned yesterday about your defense being so
successful against them in the past. What do you think was the kind of change
today that they were able to get some shots into you guys?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I don't think our ball screen defense was good at all. Matt
Farrell was able to throw the ball out of our -- I guess we tried to trap a
ball screen when it happens, and we didn't do that at all today, which allowed
open shots and allowed us to be behind the play, which is tough. So, yeah, I
mean, that was a huge part of it.  
  
Q. Question for Tony. I don't know, it's probably a difficult comparison
to make, but obviously last year the ACC did so well in the tournament, the
NCAA Tournament. I'm curious, can you compare just how the teams are
competitively speaking last year to this year, and in terms of just going
forward, what that might mean.  
COACH BENNETT: The depth of this league is so much better. In terms of parity
in college basketball, it's matchups and who's playing hot basketball in the
NCAA Tournament. There were some really good teams last year that had a chance
to go all the way. This year, I think there's a balance in college basketball,
so it's deeper. I don't know how many teams we'll get. Obviously, we want to
get as many as we can.  
  
We're a different team than last year. Matchups will be important for us.
Carolina is playing. I think it's comparable and maybe a little more depth.  
  
Q. London, after the North Carolina game, you talked about the
connection between your guys' offense and defense and how, when you're a
little bit off like you started tonight, it kind of bleeds into that. Was that
what you guys were feeling at all tonight? Was there any tightness?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I think it kind of just started with our defense. We gave up
some easy looks at the beginning of the game. Obviously, we're not going to
make every shot, but I think giving up some easy looks kind of takes the air
out of house, and knowing that we're not supposed to or we shouldn't be giving
up easy looks kind of messes with our head, I guess you could say, especially
with some of the young guys. Obviously, Kyle and even me had a little slump
today shooting the ball-wise.  
  
Yeah, it all starts with our defense, and we weren't right from the jump, and
that kind of dug us a hole.  
  
Q. Devon, I believe Virginia beat Notre Dame ten straight times. Did you
see anything different in Notre Dame today?  
DEVON HALL: Yeah, I think they just came out with a lot more energy than we
did. We were kind of lethargic, like Coach said. We weren't as good as we
usually are at our ball screen. So it was a little frustrating for us. And
they just came out with a lot more pace and effort than we did.  
  
Q. Coach, it did look like Marial got it going a bit today. Did he look
more confident or anything?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, Marial, he can create a shot off the bounce. He got us
some buckets when we were there. He's been -- had a little bit of a knee issue
or a quadricep issue. He looked like he was moving better, and he gave us a
lift. We cut it to six at the half, had some chances, then in the second half
it separated again. I was happy to see some of his offensive prowess come
back.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 71, Virginia - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll go ahead and start with a brief opening statement
and go to questions.  
  
COACH BREY: I thought we defended fabulously for 40 minutes to win tonight.
Getting off to a good start in the first half and the beginning of the second
half, I think was a key. But I'm really proud of our defense to hold them
under 40 percent field goal percentage. We were smart offensively. We had the
floor spread pretty good.  
  
It's a great win for us. Obviously, we've not had much success against the
Virginia program. It's nice to get the first one when the stakes are really
high.  
  
Q. Mike, did you say anything before the game about the ten-game losing
streak to Virginia?  
COACH BREY: No, I think I'm responsible for five of those, and I think our
guys, they know -- everything in this league we've accomplished in four years,
that's the one thing we didn't have an answer for.  
  
I thought we played like we wanted it so bad in South Bend, we tied ourself up
in knots. I tried to keep us a little looser today. But they wanted to beat
this program. This program has kind of had our number. So it's great to get
the first one when you're advancing in a tournament.  
  
Q. Mike just gave a very nice, measured response to this. Bonzie, you're
a very emotional player. When you hear you haven't beaten them ten times, and
five times in ACC. How bad did you want it?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think as a team we wanted it bad. We just wanted to stick
with what we were doing on both sides of the floor, rebounding, getting balls.
Other side of the floor, we just integrate rhythm. V.J., Steve, Rex, Matt, we
were hitting great shots and just played at a great tempo on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned your defense. It looked like you had the story on
Guy. Given the way that Guy had shot it of late, did you really want to put an
emphasis on him in keeping it off the three-point line?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I thought what helped us, the two matchups that helped us
was certainly him, our most alert defender on Guy, who's really ignited them
in our run here at the end of the season.  
  
And Pflueger guarding Perrantes, he's a little bigger and was able to be more
physical with him.  
  
But Vasturia, he worked his backside off chasing Guy off stuff all night.  
  
Q. You obviously talked a lot about keeping your team loose. I think it
was before the Wake Forest game, you were shooting half-court shots. What did
you do this time? I mean, Rex had that reverse dunk. It seemed like the guys
were really loose.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, they were. Did I do anything different today?  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: You played five-on-five at the team we went to work out at.  
  
COACH BREY: I jumped in a pickup game at the health club before shoot around.
My guys were cheering me on. I shot a dang air ball. Then they walked down to
the other court and started stretching. Luckily, I didn't pull anything like I
did last year in postseason.  
  
Q. For you and your players, you split the season series against Florida
State. Just talk about tomorrow's matchup against the Seminoles. Third time
you're going to face them this year.  
COACH BREY: We had, of course, two great games with them. Down there, they
guarded the heck out of us, and it was probably our worst night of the season
handling the basketball. We had 18 turnovers. We were better with the
basketball in South Bend, and we were playing small. So we were able to spread
them out a little bit and get going.  
  
We've had -- it's a great matchup. They come at you in waves, physically and
athletically. We're going to have to block out. But we know them pretty good
because we played them twice.  
  
Q. Bonzie, they said the way you guys came at them, it's like you wanted
to play them. How true is that? How much did you want to get these guys in
particular?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think we're really hungry and motivated to play these guys.
It's been a tough route playing them in the past, so I think we wanted it
more. We got off to a great start. That's something Coach Brey has been
emphasizing, great starts on offense. I think we were great on the defensive
end, rebounding and playing without fouling. I think that's something we need
to keep doing.  
  
Q. Coach and the players, if you want to jump in. You talked about how
the defense played a lot better tonight. They usually muck it up pretty good
on the defensive side. What did you guys do better offensively to be more
efficient?  
COACH BREY: I think our smaller lineup, which we play longer, we've been
playing longer since we got going after the Carolina game, really spreads the
floor. And Matt Farrell was fabulous with his decisions off the ball screen,
dragging their help. Bonzie was slipping into space. We were hitting and
making the extra pass. We're really hard to deal with when we can get into
that rhythm.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, like what he said. I just think we just had a good focus
on both sides of the floor, and Matt was doing a great job making decisions,
and it was just a great win for us. We've just got to keep doing what we do.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Pretty much what these two guys said. As far as spacing the
floor, that was really a key advantage for us tonight, and we were able to
knock down some shots early.  
  
Q. V.J., Duke and Carolina are the undercard for you guys tomorrow
night. What do you think the building is going to be like? What kind of
atmosphere are you expecting? Do you think your fans will be able to get any
tickets?  
V.J. BEACHEM: Hopefully. It should be two great games of basketball tomorrow
night. We're really excited about the opportunity we have. We were in the same
position last year and didn't deliver. So being here again is good for us.  
  
Q. For both players, do you recall the first time that you heard that it
had been ten straight losses to Virginia, and did you think that can't be
right?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think you guys just -- I didn't know that. I knew we haven't
beat them since I've been here. So we had a little bit more edge, a little bit
more swagger coming out, and I think that's something we need to keep doing
throughout this postseason.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: I heard about it today, and I was just thinking, whoa, we
haven't won the three years or four years we've been in the ACC, but I didn't
know it went back even before then either.  
  
Q. Mike, how much of a benefit has the double bye been, particularly
with Virginia playing until 11:50 last night or whatever?  
COACH BREY: There's no question that's an advantage. We've gotten the double
bye six times, and we've advanced to the semis six times. I'm thrilled that
we've taken advantage of it every time.  
  
There's no question there's wear and tear. I think there was some fatigue in
Virginia the last ten minutes, just like there was last year in the Duke game.
They were up big on us and kind of ran out of gas because they played a tough
game against NC State on Wednesday.  
  
Q. Mike, this is a pretty good run of years you've had with postseason
success, and some big time games, big time performances, big time opponents.
Do you feel like you've gotten your program now to a place where this is
something that's expected of Notre Dame?  
COACH BREY: I think so. We're kind of in a new rhythm and kind of in a new
area, new territory, so to speak. Moving to -- we were good in the Big East
and very consistent. We've been really, really good in this league. The league
has been great for us. I do think the fan base and our players expect to be
playing in big games in March. I certainly have a nucleus of guys that played
for two years previously in big games.  
  
Q. For the two players, a lot of similarities between you and FSU. You
can go big. You can go small. You can go in. You can go out. Your take on how
you guys match up against the 'Noles?  
V.J. BEACHEM: Like you said, they play a little bigger sometimes, and we play
big sometimes. I think the key is going to be taking care of the ball and
getting great shots. I think that was the key for us in the second game we
played at home. We really took care of the ball, got great shots, and you
know, Bonz was cooking inside.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, just being decisive on the defensive end, getting all the
loose balls as possible on the opposite end. Just spacing the floor and just
do what we do. Box out as best we can, and see what can happen.  
  
Q. For the guys, I know these gold uniforms have done really well, I
guess. I'm curious what do you think about just the look of them?  
BONZIE COLSON: I love the jerseys. They're one of my favorite jerseys. I'm a
big fan of them.  
  
COACH BREY: My brother calls them our waste management jerseys. We're pretty
good in them.

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia Tech - 99, Wake Forest - 90  
  
THE MODERATOR: To my left is Coach Buzz Williams, Zach LeDay, and Seth Allen.
We'll start with a brief opening statement from Coach Williams.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We'll just go straight to questions.  
  
Q. You guys shot 61 percent from the field in the second half. What got
that offense executing so much better in the second half than the first
half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Go ahead, Seth.  
  
SETH ALLEN: We just really played together. We touched the paint a lot. Every
time we got into the paint, we found the open man, and he just drove it again.
I thought we did a good job of getting the rebound on defense and just running
in transition and kind of tired them out.  
  
Q. Zach, you seem to be a very emotionally charged player. Can you talk
about that and how that fuels your game. You had a great game today. And,
Seth, does that get you guys going as players as well?  
ZACH LeDAY: I wouldn't really say I was that emotional in the first half, but
I knew that my guys -- I just didn't want to go home. It was just looking bad.
We weren't playing as hard as we needed to, so I wanted to try to get my team
some energy and some fight, and that ended up helping our whole team and
getting us all the way right to play together and play as hard as we needed to
win in the second half.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Yeah, I think Zach's really a big part of our team. He's a really
good energy guy. He's like the engine to the team. I think that, when he's
rebounding like he did today, it takes pressure off the guards because he's
down there 6'5", 6'6" rebounding with one of the best bigs in the league. So
when he plays as hard as he did tonight, it changes our team, and it takes
pressure off the guards.  
  
Q. Zach, I know Saturday you talked about how bittersweet that kind of
was, the Senior Day and everything. Did you learn anything in the process of
that game that you were able to use tonight in terms of combatting Wake
Forest's bigs and all that?  
ZACH LeDAY: We just had to pick our energy up. We played -- like Coach said at
halftime, we played the last three halves with them. We weren't playing our
type of basketball. We weren't getting stops. We weren't getting out in
transition and running. We were just walking up the court and calling plays.
That's not how we play.  
  
We were diving on the floor in the second half. We had a big amount of energy
in the second half. And we did that, and that half just made that big of a
difference. If we'd have did that the whole game last game, we could have done
beast them both times. But we did that in this half, and that helped us get
the victory.  
  
Q. For both of players, guys, what's the confidence level like right now
for this team coming off that loss in the regular season but then getting it
back tonight and heading into tomorrow's game?  
SETH ALLEN: I think the confidence level is kind of just remained the same.
Coach Buzz does a really good job of making us take it one day at a time, one
ATO at a time. We're going to just try to focus on tomorrow and just try to
get our bodies right for tomorrow.  
  
I think that we've got a good group of guys, good chemistry, and I think that
we should be rolling.  
  
Q. For both players, can you explain why you believed that at Virginia
Tech, which does not have much of a history with college basketball, that
Coach Williams would be able to take you to the places that you wanted to
go?  
ZACH LeDAY: Well, me, I played against him at USF, and he was at Marquette,
and they beat us by 25 twice. It was insane. So I knew what he could do it
with just guys. When I was on the court with him at USF, I was like, man, they
got all small guys, and they just whooping us like it was just crazy. So I
just believed he could work miracles.  
  
I didn't have a choice. This was my only choice. I didn't take a visit or
anything. I just came here just willing. Just I had nothing to lose. So I put
all my trust in him, and I still put all my trust in him probably for the rest
of my life.  
  
SETH ALLEN: For me, when I transferred from Maryland, it was really hard to
trust all the coaches that were trying to talk to me. And when I first met
Coach Buzz and I came on my visit, the way he treated my mom and my dad, just
with respect, looking them in their eyes and just -- I just trusted him from
the jump. I mean, I cancelled all my other visits. I committed right as soon
as I left, and I just really put my trust in the Lord and Coach Buzz.  
  
When Zach came, when we sat out, we worked hard every single day. When we were
the last place team four years in a row, and we just kept digging, and we just
put ourselves in the hole from the jump, and we just kept digging and digging
and trying to work every day.  
  
It's eventually paying off. Now that it's paying off, everybody's asking, did
we think about it? Just from day one, we just tried to work. That's really
what he taught me and Zach was how to work.  
  
Q. Coach, you didn't have Seth in your matchup earlier in the year
against Florida State. Can you talk about the matchup you're going to have
with the Seminoles tomorrow.  
COACH WILLIAMS: First of all, I think they have 12 major players on
scholarship, and they're going to play all 12. Seth didn't travel. He was
calling me from the training room, and Dream turned his ankle three days
before at North Carolina State.  
  
We tried some different things for the first time in Tallahassee. I thought we
played incredibly hard. Didn't have enough ammo to beat them. Not saying that
we have enough ammo to beat them tomorrow, but thankful that Seth and Dream
will both be healthy tomorrow.  
  
Q. Buzz has kind of faced this his whole life. He's kind of been the
overlooked guy, the guy who works his way up from the boot straps. When people
think about the ACC, they think Duke and Carolina and all that. Do you guys
relish this role of being the overlooked rabble that we're just going to come
in here and ruin your life?  
ZACH LeDAY: Same thing. I've been overlooked my whole life. I met Coach Buzz
being overlooked. So I get used to the role. I'm used to it. I'm going to keep
on working as hard as I can, just giving thanks to God and playing as hard as
I can for my teammates every night and just give them my all because I don't
want to go home. I don't want to lose. I'm going to do anything it takes to
win and just play my heart out, play my guts out.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Same. When I committed to Maryland, didn't nobody know who I was.
When I was transferring, I got this -- I mean, some type of respect, but
still, I mean, just the hardest thing about being overlooked is, once you
start getting to ground level and people are noticing who you are, you've got
to still work like you're not overlooked, you know what I mean? Our team does
a good job of working like we're nobody, and that's how we play.  
  
We just try to keep it in our huddle and just keep it one family.  
  
Q. Zach, you had to deal with one of the better big guys in the ACC, and
you had a great game. What enabled you to have a great game? And, Buzz, as far
as the three-point shooting in the second half, what kind of got that
improvement there? Was it a question of better looks, open looks?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll go first so Zach can process his answer. We had a
negative assist-to-turnover ratio at halftime. I think the threes that we took
tonight, I would have to look at a different deal. I think the threes we took
in the second half, I think 6 of the 7 were assisted. So that tells you how we
were playing, right?  
  
I think the numbers offensively in the second half were a tribute to the
mentality that we played with, and I think the numbers in the first half were
attributed to the mentality that we played with.  
  
ZACH LeDAY: Collins was a really good player. I just wanted to try to play as
hard as I can. I'm not really worried about the opponent. I can just control
what I can control. I can control how hard I play and my emotion.  
  
In the first half, we weren't doing what we needed to do, and I just wanted to
give energy coming off the bench and help my team and be a leader in my own
right and do what it took to win.  
  
I don't really worry about the opponent, I just do what I can control, which
is playing hard, boxing out, rebounding, and do what Coach asks me.  
  
Q. For Coach Williams, when these two guys, they don't start, what's up
with that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's an unspoken symbolism of what we want the culture
of our program to be about.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate on that.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I could probably elaborate on it for a long time. We're not in
the position we're in. We're not playing on March the 9th if it wasn't for
these two guys, and I think the example that they set for their teammates, but
for our staff, for our institution, for our department speaks to it's not
about them. Even in their answers to the previous three questions, I think
that it speaks to who they are.  
  
Q. And also, why did you believe you would be able to win where few
have?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm just demented. I don't think that it's about me. Only God
could have authored and ordained a story like this. So I don't want to take
credit. I think that, when you're doing it the way that we're doing it, it's
the hardest way for sure, and it requires everyone to be accountable within
their role.  
  
There are ten people that I've hired since I've been at Tech. All ten of them
are incredibly important to the lives of our kids. And I think, when you look
at this year's team is comprised of two recruiting classes, in my opinion,
it's the best league in the country. As they mentioned, for the fourth year in
a row, we went 2-16 in year number one. Last year only three teams in the
history of the ACC have improved by eight games. We were the only team in the
history of the ACC that that eight-game improvement came from last place.  
  
And then for us to be in the position we're currently in, I don't know how it
will transpire down the stretch, but I think that it speaks to the character
and the willingness and the effort and the time of all of the people that have
been a part.  
  
And I think the other thing, Roger, that I would say -- and I'm only saying it
because of my relationship with you -- if you research even deeper, past all
of that stuff I just said, which I wholeheartedly believe, all of them have a
story, and it's the culmination of those stories when they're all together
that make it what it is.  
  
So Zach LeDay has never been All-Conference in any sort of way. Not to be a
jerk to you, the only reason Seth Allen was voted Sixth Man of the Year is
because I didn't start him. So I think, when you -- if you research it deep
enough -- and I know you don't have time to do that -- but it's the
culmination of all of those stories. So there's a lot of guys that will get on
the bus tonight that have an edge to prove that they want to belong. They want
to be a part of it.  
  
In their heart, the intent of their heart is pure. They're not trying to do --
Zach's not trying to do 31 and 15 because he's 31 and 15. Zach just doesn't
want to go home. I love that. Is it me and why did I come here and all of
that? It's demented. It's perfect. It finished last place three years in a
row. The president had been there 70 days. The AD had been there 50 days. The
whole nation said, what a dumb move. I love it. Let's go, baby.  
  
Q. You were bleeding through your shirt. What is that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's the dumbest thing ever. I went to Nordstrom
yesterday and was looking for a maroon tie, and they sold a white shirt that
had maroon on it, and I was like, we got to get that.  
  
Q. What's the bleeding from?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was maroon.  
  
Q. It's maroon?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The shirt.  
  
Q. Bleeding through, showing through --  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, maroon, as in the color of the shirt.  
  
Q. I get the color.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Maroon.  
  
Q. Buzz, just to follow up on what you said before, what did you think
the mentality of the team was in the second half versus the first half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The only way that we can operate playing for one another,
playing off two feet, trying to get a second ping touch, play north and south,
put pressure on the rim so that they have to play in long closeouts so that we
keep them in rotation. We call it point five. So in other words, I pass the
ball to Zach. Zach is within 0.5 seconds passing it to Seth. Instead of
catching it, holding it, taking empty dribbles, it's the only recipe,
particularly over the last seven games without Chris, that's the only way that
we've been able to operate.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Brandon Childress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32821)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia Tech - 99, Wake Forest - 90  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and start with a brief opening statement from
Coach.  
  
COACH MANNING: I thought this afternoon Virginia Tech came out, especially the
second half, and made more hustle effort plays than we did, which is
disappointing. They went out, and they scored 62 points on us in the second
half, which is far too many. And they're a very talented offensive team, but
we have to provide much more resistance defensively than what we did.  
  
I thought there were times when we were able to get stops, which weren't that
many in the second half, that they were able to come up with an offensive
rebound if we didn't finish the possession.  
  
I thought they came out and took it to us and did what they needed to do to
win the ball game.  
  
Q. Did they just heat up in the second half, or did they make certain
offensive adjustments on you in the second half?  
COACH MANNING: I'm sure Buzz did make some adjustments, and they did some
different things, but regardless of what they did, 62 points is still too many
points in a half to give up. We have to do a much better job of staying in
front of the basketball. They had 38 points in the paint. They had 20 at
halftime.  
  
And LeDay had a great ball game, but there were other guys, other guards on
their team that spent too much time in the paint as well.  
  
Q. Bryant, same question, and also when they start knocking down threes
like that, does that put more pressure on you guys offensively to try to match
that?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: We try and fly around the shooters. Sometimes we're going to
break down on defense, but our whole mindset was to just fly around and get to
close out the shooters. I mean -- yeah, I mean, them hitting threes and
putting points on the board makes us need to put points on the board as well,
but we also needed to get stops, which we didn't.  
  
COACH MANNING: The thing about it too is they had 31 field goals, we had 31
field goals. They made ten threes, we made ten threes. They shot 35 free
throws, and we shot 21. So we have to do a better job of staying in front of
ball.  
  
I know late we put them on the line a lot because we're trying to get back in
the game and playing catch-up, but a lot of times, they spent a lot of time in
the paint early on in the second half.  
  
Q. This is for Danny and both the players. You've done everything you
can do now, and all you can do is wait until Sunday. Do you feel like you've
put together a good enough resume to get in, or is there a little bit of
trepidation here as to what might happen?  
COACH MANNING: I've been very fortunate and blessed to be around this game for
a very long time. Sometimes it's not very logical. So we're going to sit back
and wait. That's our reality right now.  
  
Q. Brandon, what do you feel about your chances? Do you feel like you've
put together a good enough resume?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I think some losses early in the season kind of like hurt
us a little bit, but I think down the line during ACC play we picked up a few
big wins, especially against -- upsetting at Louisville and now Virginia Tech.
Being 9-9 in ACC play, I think that helped us out a lot. Hopefully, we get in.
If not, we've still got to be ready to play no matter if it's NIT or in the
NCAA Tournament.

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Jim Larrañaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30874)

### [Davon Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28853)

### [Kamari Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30767)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Miami - 62  
  
Syracuse - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just go ahead. Give us a brief opening statement, and
we'll go to questions.  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: That was a great college game. We came into the game with a
couple of thoughts in mind. Number one was they had outrebounded us 41-26 the
first time we played them. We couldn't afford to have that happen again. We
needed to be the better rebounding team.  
  
Number two, I thought our defense up there was reactive and not actionary,
where we're trying to take some things away. I thought our defense was much
more attentive to detail.  
  
I thought we made a couple of ill-advised fouls on a couple of shots they were
about to attempt, and we fouled them, which gave them free throws, and they're
Number 1 in the ACC in free throws.  
  
At the offensive end, I feel like we needed to make eight threes or more. We
needed Davon, Anthony Lawrence, Bruce Brown, Ja'Quan Newton, and D.J.
Vasiljevic each to hit a couple to get us in that ballpark. It's hard for just
one guy to do that. But when you play against that zone, the whole key was
first to get the ball in the middle, and we had a very hard time doing that.
So the guys did a great job of sharing on the perimeter, making some key
threes, making some key stops, and rebounding the ball. We ended up winning
the rebound battle 31-26. So great win for us.  
  
Q. Kamari, just to kind of build off what Jim was saying, they didn't
have any second chance points. Just how significant was that making sure they
didn't get any extra opportunities like that?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Like Coach said, that was part of the game plan. We know Lydon,
Roberson, and those guys like to attack the offensive boards. That was part of
our game plan to stop them and get them off the boards. We did that. But as
well as our game plan was to get on the offensive boards as well. So I think
that's where we got some exercise, some extra points. I got fouled a few times
and got some free throws. So I think we executed the game plan pretty well.  
  
Q. They came back after you guys were up eight at halftime. What kind of
happened during the time-out, and obviously D.J. made the threes on that push
to kind of push the lead back out a bit?  
DAVON REED: We've been in these types of pushes all season. Early in the
season, lack of experience led to us not being able to pull out some of those
closer games. As the season progressed, we've been able to pull out some close
games, and we showed that same type of resilience today. We had D.J. hit a
couple big ones, and we just stayed poised throughout the stretch.  
  
Q. This question is for Kamari. You were perfect today from the free-
throw line. You usually average about 59 percent. You doubled your points
today. You're probably the definition of what it means to step up for your
team during the tournament. Talk about your performance today and what it
means to just be the big winner today.  
KAMARI MURPHY: Coming into this game during practice and everything, we kind
of said to ourselves, we're starting a new season, 0-0. Everybody had a fresh
head and a clear mind.  
  
Just today I came in playing my role -- rebounding, staying around the rim,
finishing when I can. Free throws, I know I'm capable of making, and I made
all of them today.  
  
The guys did a great job of finding me, so I put it all together. And looking
forward to tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious, I know you took down the, quote-unquote, home
team, but for you what was it like to have a more neutral site for the ACC
men's basketball tournament and for the future?  
JIM LARRANAGA: First of all, I looked at it as Syracuse's home game. They're
from New York. They played in the city a lot over the course of Coach
Boeheim's decades of excellence at Syracuse. But we've been on the road
before.  
  
The Barclays Center is a fantastic venue. New York City, the New York media,
the television exposure in this area, being able to bring back a lot of our
guys who are from the northeast -- Davon from New Jersey, Kamari from right
down the street, Rodney Miller, Bruce Brown from Boston, Ja'Quan Newton from
Philly.  
  
So we've got a lot of guys, and their families are able to drive to the game.
It's probably a little more expensive for them to stay overnight than it is in
Greensboro, but it's a great venue and very, very exciting for our league to
be in New York, what I consider the mecca of college basketball.  
  
Q. My is for Coach Larranaga. You're from the Bronx. How does it feel to
get a win in your backyard?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, it's absolutely great, but the credit really goes to
these players. Like I'm looking at Lydon, who I think is an NBA guy, a great
player, All-League player, and Kamari Murphy held him to five points, and
Kamari didn't even make the All-Defensive team, which blows me away. I cannot
understand that. I thought he was the defensive player of the year.  
  
But him coming back home to Brooklyn, New York, I think it's a lot more
important for him to have a great tournament. He got off to a great start with
a tremendous performance today.  
  
Q. Jim, I know you said you felt like you guys were more attentive to a
couple details on defense. What were the two or three things that you were
really trying to limit for them?  
JIM LARRANAGA: We were trying to keep Andrew White from making all those shots
like he did. Maybe that didn't work out so great.  
  
But what we really wanted to do was limit their offensive rebounds in case
they did miss, and we wanted to change up our defenses a little bit, and we
did. We played man-to-man the whole first half. We switched and went to a
matchup zone for a good portion of the second half, and then went back to the
man-to-man for the closing three minutes.  
  
I thought that helped us because, when we went to the matchup zone, we didn't
foul as much because we'd been fouling too quickly and giving them free
throws.  
  
Q. Davon, what enabled you guys to click from three today? Were you
getting good looks, open looks, tough looks?  
DAVON REED: Well, in the first matchup, we took a lot of shots off the
dribble, and we had a lot of shots -- catch-and-shoot shots in the first half
as well, and the percentage between the two was outstanding. So we wanted to
focus on knocking down open threes and taking less shots off the dribble
today, and I think we got a chance to do that.  
  
Q. Davon, there was a play toward the end of the game where Tyus Battle
drove, missed the dunk and then you guys came down and scored on a dunk. Can
you talk about how important that play was or pivotal that play was toward the
end of the game?  
DAVON REED: Coach always says through practice don't give up on the play.
There's times when we disagree with what may have happened. We've got to just
keep playing. So got to give credit to Coach L, and we just did that today,
especially that play.  
  
Q. Guys, how tough was it in the second half? First half you were making
three-pointers, but the second half, the shots weren't falling. What was the
game plan in the second half?  
KAMARI MURPHY: It was the same as the first half. We had to keep rebounding.
That was the emphasis on the game was keep rebounding. Definitely stop fouling
in the second half. I think they got a lot of points off the free-throw line.
I think to continue the offensive rebound and make them guard us as well.  
  
Just like the play she was just talking about. We attacked before they got
into the zone. We made plays before they got back into the zone, and that was
key for us, and we made some threes. So we put it all together. Great win for
us.  
  
Q. Coach Larranaga, you mentioned Kamari's defense on Tyler Lydon today,
but John Gillon struggled too. Were you doing anything special with him? What
was the plan with John?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I told our team after the game that Ja'Quan Newton's
performance was outstanding, and going into the game, by coaching staff and I
had basically determined that if John Gillon has a big night, so does
Syracuse, and that it was a challenge for Ja'Quan Newton to guard him. I
thought he did an amazing job. I thought it was a good team defense, but it
really started with Ja'Quan and how hard he played and how often he kept him
out of the three-second lane.  
  
Q. Coach, tomorrow you play Carolina, a team that you already beat. What
is your strategy going in tomorrow for the next game?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Is that for me?  
  
Q. Yes, sir. Sorry.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, we have a list of seven things we have to do against
North Carolina, both defensively and offensively, and we're going to review
those seven things defensively and seven things offensively with our players
tonight. There's no practice. We're not going anywhere and practicing this. So
it's more about mental preparation and relying on our skills that we've
developed over a long period of time, both offensively and defensively.  
  
We have the utmost respect for Carolina. They won the regular season
championship. A lot of people are picking them to win the National
Championship. So we know we're the underdog. But we like that we've moved on
and we're in the quarterfinals now.  
  
Q. Kamari, Coach was talking about your defense on Lyon today. What was
your approach, and how did it work out for you?  
KAMARI MURPHY: We know that he's a three-point shooter. He's one of those
stretch fours that rarely run to the rim, and he runs to the three-point line.
So we had to be aware of that. Middle ball screens, we were trying to show
hard and get back to him and kind of force him to get on the floor, which he's
not so comfortable doing compared to shooting. So we added a ball screen game
plan, transitioning game plan, and I think I executed -- the team helped me
execute as well, and you see the results.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 79, Clemson - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and open up with a brief opening statement from
Coach, and then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It was typical game for our conference. They're good. We're
good. They're in kind of a desperate situation, trying to make the tournament.
Brad's done a heck of a job with his team. They've lost more close games than
anybody in our league, one-possession games. So to have them up playing well
like that for the whole season is terrific job on his part.  
  
I thought we played good defense today. We fouled too much in the first half,
but the second half, we held them under 40 percent for the game. And I'm proud
of our guys. I think their defense did it, and then when you play this second
game and it's your first game, you haven't shot in here, and you only get a
20-minute warmup or 23 minutes and 22 seconds or whatever it is, but it's
tough to get acclimated. I don't know if that's part of it or whatever, but we
didn't shoot well in the first half.  
  
The second half, Luke, Jayson hit big buckets. Frank has played great for us.
He gives us a strong presence out there, and he came up with 20 points. So we
had three 20-point scorers, which was big.  
  
So we beat a real good team, and now we've got to turn it around and play
another really good team.  
  
Q. Luke, you had a tough shooting night, but then toward the end of the
game, you hit two big shots for your team. Talk about your psyche going into
that and what it took to make those buckets.  
LUKE KENNARD: For me, I think, the biggest thing I can take away from this is
how much confidence my coaches, my teammates, they have in me. They continue
to tell me to be aggressive. And I struggled tonight. You know, we struggled
tonight shooting the ball, but we stayed aggressive. We stayed connected on
the offensive end.  
  
For me, like I said, just the confidence that they built in me to take my
shots, to hunt shots, and to be aggressive, you know, I just kept looking to
do that.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, he had a bad half. He was 8 for 11. If that's bad, be
bad all the time, man (laughter). That's what I think. I think that's a heck
of a performance when a player, it isn't going, and then it goes. That shows
like you're a different player, you're a special player when you're able to do
that.  
  
Q. I think it was Grayson's fewest minutes since his freshman year. Is
that related to a nagging injury or fouls or --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: A little bit -- well, the fouls hurt. He has not -- I think
the injury is a huge part of it because he has not been able to really go
after it in practice, and he's lost his timing, his rhythm.  
  
Even today, what did he take? He took four shots, but the two threes he took
were right on target, but they were a little bit short. We got to get him
going, and these guys will help him because they're good teammates.  
  
It wasn't a good afternoon for him individually. Collectively, obviously, it's
a great afternoon for us. When you don't practice at the speed and with the
reps that you normally do, it affects your performance. And it has with him.  
  
Q. Any view on the technical from you?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The one they didn't call or the one they called?  
  
Q. The one they called.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Okay. Well, whatever they called, they called. They saw it.
Kids get technicals. Sometimes they don't get technicals either. They can slap
the board, backboard, and not get a technical.  
  
Q. Mike, Matt Jones just said, he said he had a hard time pinning down
--  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Did you already talk to Matt Jones?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That's pretty good. You're a quick son of a buck.  
  
Q. I'm faster than I look.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You're a hell of a lot faster than you look.  
  
Q. He said he had a hard time pinning down what this team's identity is,
and he says it's different every night. Do you agree with that, and can that
be a positive or a negative?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Crazy as it may sound, I think we're still evolving because
of all the injuries and interruptions that we've had. But we're getting
better.  
  
Today we found a new thing with Jayson, how to use him. So how Frank has
played -- he's had a terrific year, but the last four or five games he's been
great.  
  
The last 13 games -- we were 3-4 13 games ago. We've won 10 out of 13 and had
a chance in the other three. I don't know who we are completely, but I have
good kids. I have really good kids, and they play hard, and they share the
ball. Maybe we'll develop a little bit more of an identity here. We've got
another chance, let's put it that way.  
  
Q. Coach, great production out of the starting five, but with them
playing so many minutes, is fatigue an issue with the quick turnaround in this
part of the season with those guys?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yes, it is, and it's a good observation. We've told our
guys, just play one game. Play one game, then play another game. Then if we're
fortunate enough to play another game, then we'll try to figure it out, but
not the pace.  
  
They didn't do -- they couldn't today. That's just the way it is. We have to
play again tomorrow at 2:00 or 2:15 or 2:22, whatever it is, and so we'll
play. At least in the NCAA Tournament, you get a day in between. So playing
like this might help us get better.  
  
Q. Mike, a little bit of an offbeat broader question --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Is it a Northwestern question?  
  
Q. No, it is not a Northwestern question. But I've been asking other
coaches this and haven't gotten a chance to run into you. You've coached for a
long time. Do you ever think back like if you could give your younger self
coaching advice, what you've learned, what you may have done differently in
the beginning?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Get to Duke earlier. That would be the very first thing. No,
I wouldn't -- I'd say be who you are. I think I was really lucky at 28 to take
over a 7-44 program at Army, my alma mater, and to have to do everything, and
my wife had to do everything, and our whole family got involved. We ended up
73-59, and we learned how to win by looking at every -- counting pennies. Then
we needed to do that to build Duke.  
  
So I wouldn't change it. I think we've maintained that family and looking for
pennies. I think we've maintained the hunger because it was ingrained for
eight years in our life.  
  
Q. 5 of 6 possessions you scored on early in the second half to take
charge of the game for an extended period. The freshmen, Frank and Jayson,
played sensationally, but it all started with two jumpers by the guy who went
1 for 9 in the first half. How did you see the offense coming together to take
charge there?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I always see the offense coming together if Luke
shoots the ball. We have four really good scorers. He and Jayson can really
score the ball, but Frank can score, and so can Grayson. If we ever get all
four of them going, that's the -- that's who I would like to be.  
  
Because Amile can score when he's one-on-one, and Matt can knock down an open
shot. So we always allow them to shoot. That's the one thing. No one's saying
don't shoot, Luke. Like shoot, Luke. Shoot, Frank. See basket, shoot ball.
It's that simple.  
  
I don't know if Luke wants to say anything about it. I don't want to put you
on the spot.  
  
LUKE KENNARD: No, not at all. What he said. That's it. He gives us a lot of
freedom to shoot the ball, and he always just tells us to hunt our shots.
That's what we do as a group, and it's really, really good.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: What we're learning a little bit more is that not to take a
lower percentage shot if they really converge and for our guys to yell for the
ball because he and Jayson can really pass, even while they're in a move.
While they're in their own move, they can still pass. I'd like to see us do
that a little bit better.  
  
Q. Mike, how possible is it at this time of year with games coming so
close together to manufacture the time for Grayson to get healthy and for this
team to kind of carve out its identity? How do you kind of do that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We're just trying to win and doing it that way. Look,
Antonio got in the game for a couple of minutes, things like that, really we
have to get seven or eight guys there. I'd like to see more from either Harry,
Marques or Antonio. And if we can get Grayson to be Grayson, that's how we're
going to get better because it puts a lot of pressure on another team having
so many guys out there that can score.  
  
Q. This question is for Frank. You had a huge night. For the last week,
you've been showing how great of a freshman you can be for this team. Talk
about the 20 points and perfect from the three. How big of this game is for
you and your confidence going into this tournament.  
FRANK JACKSON: You know, it's huge. I think we can really roll off this win
and keep going. For me, I always try to stay aggressive. I like to score the
ball. It's what I do best. I'm lucky to have a coach who allows me to be
myself and players that I'm surrounded by that give me all the confidence in
the world. So I just try to attack early and stay aggressive, and all that
carries throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached in a lot of ACC Tournaments. This is the first
one in New York City. Another coach suggested earlier today there's no value
in having the tournament in Greensboro. I wanted to see your opinion on the
value of having it in New York, and is there no value in having it in a place
like Greensboro?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, obviously, there's been great value having it in
Greensboro because this is the tournament that everyone copied, and if we
didn't have the support of an entire city to support us and keep adding to
their beautiful coliseum, this tournament and this league would not be where
it's at.  
  
So if the powers to be want it to eventually go back -- stay in Greensboro or
visit or whatever, so be it. I think they deserve that. We still look at it,
and I think coming to New York is a huge thing just because we've added -- we
have 15 teams. So a number of those teams played their tournament in New York.
So their fan base was accustomed to that. So the ACC schools and then the Big
East schools that went, their fan bases were accustomed to two different
things.  
  
So to try to find out what the new thing will be, that's what these guys are
supposed to do. But having it here is great.  
  
Q. Frank, you mentioned Coach letting you stay aggressive. Last four
games, double digit points. What has it been in the last four that has maybe
sort of had your game blossom? Or what sort of turned it around? It has also
coincided with Grayson being a little banged up. Is that a coincidence?  
FRANK JACKSON: Like I said, I just look to stay aggressive. For me, I try to
attack earlier in the game so I get going a little bit earlier. I just try to
keep attacking and look for the open shot and look for my teammates as well.  
  
Q. Jayson Tatum scored in a variety of ways today, which was a lot of
fun to watch, very impressive. Can you just describe his offensive arsenal,
and have you had any other players in the past as diverse as him
offensively?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yes, that's why we've won five National Championships. Well,
I'm not going to compare them, but I just said diverse players, whether it be
Grant Hill, Justise Winslow, John Scheyer, Nolan Smith, J.J. Redick.  
  
Look, we wouldn't have all the -- I've been in a lot of big time games because
I've had a lot of big time players. I've been in 21 Final Four games. I've
been in 18 of these championship games and 14 Elite Eight games. That's a lot
of big games. You don't get there without these guys. But you have to have
these guys, give them the freedom to be themselves.  
  
Jayson is still learning how to do that. Like today he learned a new thing
today, and we got two buckets. And if Amile was ready for the pass, we would
have had another one on an early post.  
  
These guys will find out that Jayson is actually as good a passer as we have
on the team, and that would add to it. But he just can't punish himself when
he misses a jump shot. I still think he's too hard on himself when he misses.
That's not us, but he wants to be perfect. You can't be, but he was darn good
again today.  
  
Q. Luke, two-part question. Luke, you played 39 minutes, and as Coach
alluded, there is a short turnaround. What impact do you think that's going to
have on you? Secondly, how do you see the matchup with Louisville under those
conditions?  
LUKE KENNARD: This is a process. I mean, to play back-to-back days, it can be
tough. It can be tough. But for us as a group, we take it very seriously. We
try to take care of our bodies as best as we can, and for us, we just have to
move on to the next one.  
  
This is a big win for us, but we have to move on to the next one, and the next
one is Louisville. We played them earlier in the season. They got a great
group. They're really talented. They have some size and some really, really
good players. So we have to stay locked in, and we have to stay together, and
we have to stay tough and just be ready to move on and stay focused.  
  
Q. Frank, Grayson said the two of you had some pretty intense pickup
battles during the summer. I was curious what you remembered of those and what
your motivation was going into those.  
FRANK JACKSON: I'd definitely say we got into a little bit in the summertime.
We're both really competitive. For me, I learned so much from G. He's been
here for a couple years now, and he's played in big time games. He's won a
National Championship.  
  
So in the summertime, to pick his brain, to work out with him, to kind of
follow him around and see how -- you know, how he wins, it's been great for
me. He's a good example to me, and I'm lucky to have him and all my guys on
the team this year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Shelton Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32774)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 79, Clemson - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll take an opening statement from you.  
  
COACH BROWNELL: Congratulations to Duke. I thought those guys really made
plays in the second half and just outplayed us.  
  
I thought in the first half, once we kind of got into the game, I thought we
played very well, defended them at a good level, but we had a harder time
guarding them. I thought we made some mistakes defensively in the second half
for sure.  
  
Our guys fought back, now. That's what we do. We're a tough team to knock out.
Obviously, we missed the layup there, I think that was going to cut it -- I
don't know if it was going to cut it to one or two -- and that changed the
whole game. If he makes the layup, then Duke has to do pressure plays, but
they didn't have to do that because we didn't make the layup.  
  
Congratulations to Duke. They played very well. Kennard was hard to stop,
Frank Jackson and Jayson Tatum, all three of those guys played at a very high
level.  
  
Q. You guys had a steal and a layup to start the second half. You're up
two. Then Duke took over the game. Kennard hit a couple of shots --  
COACH BROWNELL: I'm not sure they took over the game, but they took the lead.
With a minute to go, we missed a layup for one, so...  
  
Q. 11-2 run. They got control of the game, and you came back.  
COACH BROWNELL: Thank you.  
  
Q. What happened in that?  
COACH BROWNELL: They made plays, and I thought we turned it over some. We had
a couple of bad defensive possessions. You know, our first three or four
minutes of the second half, if you go look at our shots, they're open. We had
two wide open threes in the corner, and we missed them both. Wide open,
executed very well by our guys. We just didn't make them. Unfortunately, one
of them, I know for sure, bounced long into a fast break. At some point,
that's what this game boils down to is you've got to make shots.  
  
Credit Duke's defense. I thought they guarded us well. But we had enough
opportunities to score better than we did. We played better in transition than
we did in the half-court. Again, some of that was because of Duke.  
  
Q. Coach, they seemed to get a handle on your defense in the first half.
Were you doing anything different from the first half to the second half on
defense?  
COACH BROWNELL: You know, not a lot. They just have really good players now.
They're hard to guard. You can't really guard them with multiple people very
often because the next guy's going to make an open three, and because you have
to guard the three-point shot against Duke, it puts you in one-on-one
scenarios, and your guys have to be able to guard their guys. If they can do
that and make them take challenge shots, you're going to have a chance to win,
and if you can't do that, you're probably not going to win.  
  
I thought they made more individual plays. Amile Jefferson made two individual
drives and scored. They scored two baskets on underneath, out of bounds plays.
We threw a ball and we saved it right to them right for a layup. Jayson Tatum
made some very difficult plays. Luke Kennard made some shots.  
  
I just think their players rose to the occasion and made high level shots, and
I think that's what you expect out of high level players.  
  
Q. Shelton, what was different about this game, as opposed to the game
in Cameron about a month ago, for you on the floor?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: There wasn't really any difference, to be honest with you.
We knew what they were going to do, and we had a similar game plan. But today,
just like in Cameron, it didn't work out.  
  
Q. Coach, between now and Sunday, things are kind of out of your hands,
but what are your credentials? How would you sell yourself for selection?  
COACH BROWNELL: I find it very difficult to believe that we're going to make
it. Obviously, we had a tremendous nonconference, playing through some
injuries. Shelton didn't play with us in the two losses. Eli Thomas didn't
play with us in the two losses. But unfortunately, in league play, we just
didn't quite get it done.  
  
We won six games. We probably needed to win eight or ten. That's going to be a
bugaboo. That's obviously why today's game was so important for our team. If
we could have got today's game, then I think we have a better chance, and then
maybe one more.  
  
We're not worried about that. We'll see what happens, and if it's -- you know,
we play in the NIT, we'll do our best in that. Obviously, I'm disappointed
because I think our team is very close to being an NCAA Tournament team. I
think we showed it again today that we can play with just about anybody in the
country. You know, we had another great battle with Duke today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_New York, New York_  
  
Miami - 62  
  
Syracuse - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Boeheim.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought it was -- you know, Miami's a trick team. I thought
the first half they shot the ball extremely well, but we hung in there and
got, say, close.  
  
Second half, we were more aggressive. We got to the basket. We got them in
foul situation early and got back in the game. Down the stretch, we missed
two, and they made two, and that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Jim, I guess the simple question is what do you think your NCAA fate
will be on Sunday?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It doesn't matter what I think.  
  
Q. What would you expect to see happen?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I expect the committee to make a decision.  
  
Q. Do you have an opinion on what that decision should be?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Obviously, I've answered that twice already. Want me to answer
it again?  
  
Q. Sure.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't have an opinion. It's up to them. My opinion doesn't
matter. Every coach in the country that's on the bubble thinks his team should
get in. Every coach. The facts in the case -- I'm not going to say whether we
should get in or not. That's up to the committee.  
  
The facts in the case, last year we had three good wins against a top team in
the country, Texas A&M, Connecticut who was not ranked, and Duke was at about
18. This year we have three good wins, three teams in the top 10 when they
beat them.  
  
I see all the time on the bracketology thing, it says Syracuse has
(indiscernible) top 50 wins, and so does this team. That team doesn't have any
wins against the top 20.  
  
The committee has always looked at good wins. Everyone says they're home. The
tournament is not played at home and not played on the road. It's played at
neutral sites. We have better wins than we had last year. We have more wins.
We have Miami, we have Clemson on the road, we have Wake Forest. We didn't
have those wins last year. We have a couple more nonconference losses this
year, and that's something that will, I'm sure, be taken into consideration.  
  
We are universally felt to be -- I think by everybody -- the Number 1
conference in the country. We finished seventh, tied for seventh. Other
conferences are talking about getting 60 percent of their teams in the
tournament. If we're the best conference in the country, we should get more
than 50 percent of teams in the tournament.  
  
People keep talking about road losses. In the ACC, there's four teams going to
the tournament that have three losses in conference on the road, and we have
two. The only team with a winning conference on the road is North Carolina,
and they're top 10 in the country. They're 5-4, I think. And there's two or
three other really good teams in our conference that have four road wins.  
  
Those are the facts. The committee is going to have to figure out where it all
falls. I feel -- well, I know our profile is better this year than it was last
year in terms of top wins.  
  
I think the committee, from what I've gathered through my years, is looking
for teams that can win games in the tournament. I think we can. I think to
look at today and say, oh, they lost to Miami -- Miami was top 25 team in the
country last year. It came down to a one-point game, and that was it. I mean,
one game? That shouldn't mean anything.  
  
But that's what I look at, and it's up to the committee to look at all that
stuff and figure out what to do.  
  
Q. My question is for John. John, can you just kind of tell me what you
were thinking when you're bringing up the ball there for your final shot that
left 0.4 seconds on the clock?  
JOHN GILLON: I was just trying to get the ball up as fast as I could and just
knock down the shot. That was the only thing that was going through my mind at
that time.  
  
Q. Did you kind of already think you were going to take that shot
regardless when you were bringing it up?  
JOHN GILLON: I mean, there's no regardless. If I saw someone ahead of me that
was wide open, I would throw it immediately. But there's not a lot of time to
think. We had five seconds left. So more than likely, I was going to shoot
that.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: Any time, with that time left on the clock, like with the Duke
game and like with Clemson, he's going to go up and shoot it. You don't have a
lot of time to make a lot of plays or pass the ball there. If he can get a
good shot in that situation -- he's made two of them this year. Maybe it just
wasn't in the cards to make the third one. It was the absolute right play.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're the, quote-unquote, home team for this being in
New York, but do you like the fact this is a more neutral site for this
tournament, and would you like to see that going forward?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think New York's a great place. Obviously, we get some fans
here. It doesn't matter in terms of who wins. I just think New York City is a
great venue for our tournament. I think the big city is where it should be
played. I think it should be played here, Washington, Atlanta. That's where
the tournament should be played.  
  
I'm not going to be around much longer to care about it, but I think that's
where the value is. I think there's a huge value in playing the tournament in
those places. There's no value in playing Greensboro, none. It's there because
the league's been there and the office is there, and they have 150 people that
the ACC needs. That's why it's there. It should not be there.  
  
You get in the media centers and the recruiting centers, how many players do
they have in Greensboro? I mean, New York, Washington, Atlanta, that's where
the media centers are. Madison Square Garden made the Big East conference.
There's a couple other factors, but made the Big East conference.  
  
And I'm saying all that because I don't give a shit. I'm just saying what's
right. That's what's right. Why do you think the Big Ten is coming into New
York? It's business, good business sense. They all say it's a business. Well,
then, let's start acting like it's a business.  
  
Q. Jim, along those same lines, any deja vu coming to Brooklyn?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's a little different. The Garden is different. That's where
we always played. This is a great venue and great place for the tournament, I
think.  
  
Q. Coaches, how have you seen your defense evolve from the beginning of
the year to now?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, it's been a struggle. It's been a constant struggle. It's
not good. We're in the middle of the pack defensively, eighth, ninth in the
league in most categories. It's gotten a little better, but we have four
first-year players and a sophomore. It's not good. It's not a good defense.  
  
Our offense got better as the year went along, and we outscored people. We
haven't been able to stop anybody. Today we got a few stops, but not enough.
Our offense just wasn't quite good enough today. Our defense was okay.  
  
But we don't have the defense that we thought we could have this year, and
that's what's probably hurt us the most. I think these guys really have
adjusted. Two fifth-year players coming in and being able to adjust to what
they have done. Andrew's consistency and John's leadership the last part of
the season -- after the Boston College game, we went 10-7 in this conference.
It's not that easy to do.  
  
I don't care where you play, Duke and Florida State and Virginia, they beat a
lot of people. And to win those games tells me something about what we're
capable of doing, and they're better wins than we had last year, and we did
all right last year when we got in. We'll see what the committee decides, and
we'll move forward.  
  
Q. Andrew, how can you describe the strides this team has made since
that 33-point loss to St. John's and just giving you guys a reasonable chance
to get into the tournament since then?  
ANDREW WHITE: I think we've come together a lot more. I think this team has
figured out what it takes to win, and that's helped getting into the meat of
the ACC season. I think we've just picked up our intensity, and we've done
everything we could to put us in a position to be considered for the
postseason. So we've done everything we could up to this point.  
  
I think we have a lot of potential, a lot of things we can do well. So just
proud of where we come, coming from where we started early in the year.  
  
Q. Jim, only ten assists today, also ten turnovers. What was Miami doing
defensively?  
COACH BOEHEIM: They're a very good defensive team. I think they're one of the
best defensive teams in the league. Ten turnovers is not out of hand. That's
not a bad number.  
  
They're just a really good defensive team, and they made it difficult. We
finally got it going much better in the second half. Much better. And we had
some good looks. Tyus got to the basket. That's a big play. Missing the dunk
was a huge play. They went down and got a dunk. You can't have that happen in
close games.  
  
We got two really good looks from the three-point line and missed. They got
two and made them. They were 0 for 8 from the three. And Vasiljevic was deep,
really deep. We had taken a one-point lead. Shot clock was down. We were up
pretty good on them. He was way back, and he made a big shot, and we came down
and missed. That's usually how these games are decided.  
  
Q. Jim, to follow up on that, did Miami make certain defensive
adjustments on you from the regular season to make it tougher on you?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No. Earlier in the year, we got off to a good start and got
them early, and our defense was really good, and they didn't play well
offensively. They played -- they shot the ball great in the first half, but we
overcame that and got back in it.  
  
This game came down to a couple plays. We missed a dunk and a three, and they
made two threes. That was the game. We kept battling. We made a big three to
get back to two, and we just couldn't get the turnover in that situation.  
  
But it came down to two plays, a couple plays. They made a couple, and we
missed a couple. That was the game.  
  
Q. Andrew, I want to ask you defensively, it looked like Miami made some
adjustments in terms of positioning their shooters the second time playing you
guys. How difficult was it to get out to guys like D.J. and Reed?  
ANDREW WHITE: Their spacing was good. They have good guard play. They're
experienced and well coached, so they're going to shake free and get some
looks. But we made a couple small execution errors, so that was probably, like
Coach said, two, three, maybe four defining moments in the game where we just
would have buckled down a little bit, those would have been valuable points.  
  
Q. Jim, Coach Larranaga really praised Kamari Murphy, his defense on
Tyler Lydon today. Tyler struggled. How much of that was Murphy, or was it
just other things going on with the offense?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Tyler, same thing today he's averaged the last four games. So I
don't think Murphy was playing him any of those games. He's not really -- he's
got some looks, but he's hesitating a little bit. He's just not probably being
quite aggressive.  
  
You can't tell a player to shoot. He's got to see it when it's there. I mean,
he knows we want him to shoot. He's a great facilitator. He's doing a great
job. He's playing great defense. He's rebounding the ball. But he's not really
-- I don't think he's ready to be a big scorer. I don't think that's his
mentality. I think that's something he has to develop.  
  
But nobody's ever told him not to shoot. We've only told him to shoot. And
this game, I think, is pretty much typical to what he's done the last three,
four games -- I don't have the numbers exactly, but it seems like it. He's
deferring. He's passing up some shots. He's passing up some opportunities, I
think, where he could go.  
  
But those things take time, and he's just not quite there yet, I don't think.

_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia - 73, Pittsburgh - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll open it up with a brief opening statement, and
then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH BENNETT: It's about midnight. Any questions, let's go.  
  
Q. Tony, they cut the lead to one, and London scored 10 of your next 15
points. Just talk about how he is in the clutch.  
COACH BENNETT: He responded. You know, I challenged the guys. I told them in
the locker room after the game and I think about the 12-minute mark, we've got
to tighten it up defensively, and they did, but then London made some big
shots. You know, he's done that for us his whole career, and we needed that.  
  
Pitt, you can look at their record, but they're an offensive team that's hard
to guard. We had to answer them with some baskets, and then we tightened up
the defense, and that's where a bit of the separation occurred.  
  
Q. Tony, Jerry mentioned that stretch where London went off, and you
mentioned you separated there. Jack made that great save kind of dive --  
COACH BENNETT: That's right.  
  
Q. \-- diving out of bounds. Just what did that hustle play mean to that
stretch?  
COACH BENNETT: It's huge. Big play. He didn't look like he had a chance at it.
We had a couple of those plays, but those are momentum changers. I tell our
guys, it's about the heart. At this level, every possession matters, and that
one mattered. I didn't think he had a chance at it. I don't know if that was
more impressive or him trying to run away from the guy trying to follow him at
the end of the game. They were both very impressive.  
  
Q. Tony, while we're speaking about Jack, the four fouls, and the fourth
foul seemed to particularly bother you in terms of the call, are there things
he's doing that he shouldn't be, or are things just not going his way?  
COACH BENNETT: Are you trying to get me fined or in trouble here? What's the
deal? I disagreed. I'd have to watch it on tape. I thought he was set. He was
walled up, and it was a fourth -- that foul, I didn't see. I didn't agree with
it, but I'll look at the tape. That's about all I'm going to say about that.  
  
Q. London, what has been so good for you guys against Notre Dame? It's
been a long win streak. Coach Braves talked about the matchup trouble that you
give them. I know you're just getting your head into it now, but in terms of
Notre Dame, what have you had success with?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Our defense. Obviously, our defense is a huge part. They can
spread the floor, just like Pitt. Obviously, different types of weapons, but
they can go to the spread, five-guard lineup with -- I kind of count Bonzie as
a guard. But it gives people trouble. As long as we hang our head on our
defense, I guess that's why we've been having a good record with them.  
  
Q. Tony, talk about your freshman guards and what they did on a pretty
big stage tonight.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, they made some big shots, and actually, defensively we're
solid. A couple of fouls late that we probably didn't think on. But they've
done that at different times through the year. London was like that as a first
year as well. You saw that different times of the year -- Ty kind of came out
in that Notre Dame game and showed that, and, of course, Kyle has as well.  
  
So it's playing the game and just -- they don't -- they're not afraid of the
moment, but they have an unselfishness about them that makes a difference.  
  
Q. For Coach, you just mentioned at this level it's about heart, and
although you have to be technically sound to play great defense, so much of
defense is heart. I'm curious, how do you evaluate that? And then how do you
get them to buy into it?  
COACH BENNETT: I mean, you just kind of try to impose your will as a coach on
them and demand it. But they know. I think, like London said, it's validated
when they have success.  
  
We have to do that. We rely on each other. It's a hard way to play, but we
know it's our way to play. We work at it, and we know we have guys that are
bought into it.  
  
Q. Evaluate it. When you look at it as a kid, how do you evaluate
that?  
COACH BENNETT: Just you find out what kind of character they got. Anyone can
play defense if they're willing. When you recruit them, you don't sell them a
bill of goods. You say, you're going to have to guard. You can ask both these
guys. I said, we're going to work defensively, and it's going to help your
game.  
  
You have to see, do they move laterally? Do they anticipate well? Do they have
vision? I remember London had quick hands and the ability to do stuff. Kyle,
as he's learned our system, is getting stronger and can spread out. So those
are things I look for, but they have to do it tomorrow too. So I'm not going
to give them too many compliments. But they're willing, and they're able.  
  
Q. Kyle, you hit four threes tonight. The last one, they had cut it to
two, I think, about ten minutes left. That's when the crowd -- it was a pretty
pro UVA crowd, really got into it. And you hit that three. You've risen up to
big moments. Did you sense that in the game and in the atmosphere to kind of
rise up there?  
KYLE GUY: I knew that we needed a bucket, but it wasn't like, we need a bucket
so let me shoot it no matter what. I didn't even think that shot was going in,
to be completely honest. Thank God it did.  
  
Like Coach said, I'm not really afraid of the moment, but whatever the team
needs from me, I'm willing to do.  
  
Q. You're now the first UVA player to advance in four consecutive ACC
Tournaments. How do you gear your game up for postseason? And what do you need
to do in postseason?  
LONDON PERRANTES: It's just a program. I mean, obviously, we actually were
talking to Joe Harris today and how our defense is built for March because
we're going to play teams with high powered offense, but as long as our
defense is there night in and night out, we'll be able to give ourselves a
good shot to win games. I feel like, ever since I've been here, our defense
has been pretty good, to say the least. That's just given me the shot to even
advance.  
  
And then obviously, we have some good offensive players, myself included, to
help us. So I don't know if it's exactly me, but just the program.  
  
Q. Tony, tonight Jack's game kind of recalled Marial's standout games
that happened around the same time last year in the NCAA Tournament. Like
London just said, is your roster kind of just built for guys to have those big
pushes late in March?  
COACH BENNETT: You said Jack you're talking about? Yeah, I think all year I
said we're going to need them all, and it's been different guys at different
times, and Jack has. He's such a warrior. You asked the question about what we
look for in guys that are willing to defend, and it's just he'll screen, he'll
rebound. He doesn't care if he takes a shot or not.  
  
And to see him make those hustle plays -- he's been that energy. He and Isaiah
are really good defensive players. They're good help defensive players. They
know who they are as players. They're not confused what their strengths are
and what we need them to do. And I think -- I don't know if I'm answering your
question. Are we built for that? I just think that stuff is valued when
possessions matter in tournament play. Those hustle plays, those bothering a
shot, being in position, helping these guys, that's just emphasized and
magnified more in these kinds of settings.  
  
Q. Kyle, London. Kyle, it's your first ACC Tournament, London, it's your
last. What kind of message do you have for the team, and what kind of stuff
are you taking into these games?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I just -- for me, my mentality is to have fun. Obviously,
like you said, it's my last one, last go around. So I'm just going out, having
fun, trying to lead these guys. I pulled them all in and told them how I love
them, and I just want to go out there and go out and do what we do best. Don't
put any extra weight on your shoulders. We've been here before. We've played
all these teams before. We know we're capable of winning, but just go out and
have fun.  
  
Obviously, it's going to be a grind, but like we said before, our program is
built for stuff like this.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I basically just do whatever he tells me. He's been there,
done that, like you said. So he's been a tremendous leader on and off the
court, for me especially, and the rest of the guys. When he tells us that he
loves us and he has confidence in us, it's really easy to play free.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have won four straight since losing four straight.
This league is so tough. Is there a dramatic difference between how you have
played when you lost those four games and how you have played when you've won
these last four?  
COACH BENNETT: I think the Carolina game was an outlier. They really took it
to us. They played great. We really struggled. We weren't right. The other
games, we've hung in there and tried to guard hard, just ran a little better
offense. We've taken care of the ball better. We made some shots. We made
adjustments. But we were really close in all those games. We had chances,
played some good games.  
  
So besides maybe some shots going in and our ability to handle the ball a
little better, I think there hasn't been a big change, but we know the value
of our -- again, I think our defense has tightened up in some of those games
even a little more. Not a lot, but a little more.  
  
Q. London, talk about your stretch in the second half. In the first
half, you were a little quieter, I guess, as Kyle kind of got going. Wanted to
ask you kind of your difference in mentality or rhythm or whatever it was in
the first half and then once you got going in the second half.  
LONDON PERRANTES: The defense they ran was a switching man. It's hard to kind
of get a rhythm when you're trying to feel your way through the game. Or for
me myself, I was trying to feel my way through it, pick my spots. I had some
open looks, missed them, but that's the game.  
  
Obviously, we had Kyle, so I was looking for him whenever he was open. He was
on his run. For me, I was just trying to do whatever I can to win, whether
that's make shots or just play defense and let Kyle make the shots.  
  
But in the second half, I just had some openings and knocked down some shots.  
  
Q. London, I was hoping you could kind of describe what you've seen in
Kyle's development and maybe his potential once you move on.  
LONDON PERRANTES: Yeah, Kyle is through the roof. You don't have to worry
about that. He has confidence in his game. I think we all have confidence in
his game. Shoot the ball. I think, like Coach said earlier, the stronger he
gets, the better defender he's going to be. But, yeah, offensively he has a
great feel. He can shoot the ball. Defense can get there. It's going to get
there.  
  
Yeah, obviously, with him and Ty, the two young guys, and we got two redshirt
freshmen that have put in a lot of work this year too. So we'll be all right
when I leave for sure.  
  
Q. Your teams have had some characteristics. You know, right now you're
351st out of 351 in pace, length of possessions, but you're also incredibly
efficient, especially on defense. Do you try to dictate the pace, or is the
pace just something that comes as a result of what you're trying to do
strategically?  
COACH BENNETT: Definitely we try to take care of the ball, get good shots,
make people -- I think, when our defense is set and we're in possession, it's
hard for teams to score quick or shoot quick when we're right. And then
offensively, I always tell them, if it's a great look and it's early, you can
take it. Otherwise, we want to try to move the ball and get shots. Again, I
think we know what works for us. We don't apologize for how we play. We play
that way because it's effective for us.  
  
You know guys are developing their game. They're having chances to play after,
but it works for us. When we lose sight of that against the teams we play,
then we kind of struggle.  
  
But as far as the number of our pace of play, I think it's, yep, we try to be
patient offensively unless there's something good. Then defensively, I think
it slows it down a little bit because teams can't quite get shots quick
enough.  
  
Q. Kyle, for you as a freshman first time in this tournament with a late
game like this and getting out so late, what was it like to wait all day for
your chance to take the court?  
KYLE GUY: I didn't really know what to expect this late of a game and stuff
like that. But I was really excited and just ready to play, focused. Coach is
always preaching to stay focused and stay on top of things off the court so
that on the court there's no problems and we're focused the whole time. So
with London as a roommate, it's pretty easy to stay focused because all he
does is sleep. So I have a lot of alone time.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Jamel Artis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30530)

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia - 73, Pittsburgh - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just a brief opening statement, and we'll go to
questions.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: We're very disappointed. Congratulations to Virginia. They
just played better than we did. Our inability to keep them away from effective
three-point shooting, I thought, really cost us for the whole game really and
ended up being the difference.  
  
We just didn't guard them as well as they guarded us, and as a result, we
weren't able to win.  
  
Q. 44-43 game after the Jeter dunk with 13:05 left. Did you feel like
you had the momentum up at one point, or was it one of those things that was
just fleeting?  
COACH STALLINGS: We certainly had the momentum at that point. Jamel and I were
just talking about that coming into the press room. I don't remember the exact
series of events, but I remember we missed a front end of a bonus in that
stretch they scored on. It felt like it was one, and then it seemed like it
was seven or eight real quickly there. I haven't seen the time sheet or
anything and would have to go back and see the film to see exactly what
happened.  
  
They kind of started -- I thought they started taking the ball to the basket
on us a little bit more on that stretch. Perrantes got to the goal and got to
the foul line, I do remember that. They drove us and got fouled a few times
and converted their free throws, and I do remember we missed a front end of a
bonus and missed a couple of good shots, and then all of a sudden, they had
some separation again.  
  
That was our best stretch in the game was those first seven or eight minutes
of the second half, and I thought that we were getting ready to have an
opportunity to get back on top of the game, but unfortunately, it didn't
unfold that way.  
  
Q. Jamel, yesterday you shot 3 of 12. It was a tough day for you from
the field. Today you ended up 6 of 9, including 4 of 6 from three. What was
the difference today in terms of your feel for the game?  
JAMEL ARTIS: The coaches try to tell me everything I do on my shot. So I just
try to listen every time I shoot the basketball, leave my follow-through up,
bend my knees more with my shot. So I tried to do that more today, and as a
result, it was falling.  
  
Q. Perrantes getting in that stretch that you mentioned had 10 of their
15 points. Just talk about what a clutch guy he is and how hard he is to
defend in big moments.  
COACH STALLINGS: Yeah, he's a good player, and I thought we had him under
wraps for most of the game. He did hurt us. Like I said, he got to the goal
and got to the foul line. But he's just a good player, and he's a winning
player. He's just a winning player. He does what's needed to win games.  
  
Those guys do a great job of buying in to what Tony's selling and how they
have to play at Virginia to be successful. It starts with Perrantes. He's the
senior. He's the leader. He's the guy that sort of stirs the drink for them.  
  
So he was effective when he needed to be, and that's the sign of a good
player. He was good when the game got close, and unfortunately, we didn't do
quite a good enough job against him.  
  
Q. Kevin, I guess, how nice is it to see this group kind of come
together tonight and really fight against an opponent that was kind of playing
at their best for large stretches of the game?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, I thought that -- I do think that we tried to utilize
this week to come together and to play, think, be a team, and I thought that
was reflected in our play. I thought it was reflected in our win last night. I
thought it was reflected in our ability to go from wherever the game was at
halftime to get it back to where we were really back in the mix and in that
game.  
  
Our guys fought hard. We didn't play great tonight, certainly, but you don't
play great against Virginia very often. They grind the game down. They play
great defense.  
  
But I thought our guys fought really, really hard, and I was very proud of
that. So our guys, especially our seniors, were thrust into a tough situation.
They had played one way for one person for three years, and I came in and
asked them to do some different things, and we were positionally absent of
some things.  
  
I had to ask this guy to play out of position all season long. I thought he
did a terrific job. I thought he was great tonight. But it's been a
challenging year for all of us, and I was proud of these guys for really
fighting it to the end and doing the best they could.  
  
Q. Kevin, what do you feel like your first season here, what are you
going to take away from the most this year?  
COACH STALLINGS: I really enjoyed these seniors, and I don't think that
there's any question that it's been somewhat dysfunctional at times, but I've
enjoyed them individually. I've enjoyed them collectively.  
  
I laugh when I hear things. I don't read too much, but I laugh when I hear
things. You know, I benched him to start the game last weekend, and I get on
my text messages, and on January the 28th, he sent me a text one night and
said, I love you, Coach.  
  
You know, we've worked hard, all of us have worked hard to sort of acquiesce
to the other and accommodate the other and know that we're all in a situation
that maybe we didn't all choose exactly the way it unfolded. I thought Jamel
and Mike and Chris and Sheldon, I thought those guys received me well, tried
hard for me, and, again, under the circumstances did the best they could.  
  
Q. Kevin, how do you go about this off-season losing four seniors, and
what kind of challenge is it going to be to replace, I think, over 70 percent
of your scoring?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, I think that it will be very difficult because we're
replacing some very good players and some guys that are very experienced and
played a lot of basketball at Pitt.  
  
We're going to have to turn the page, and Cam Johnson and Ryan Luther are
going to have to step up into prominent positions in the program in terms of
leadership and productivity and things like that. There are a myriad of things
that we will do in an attempt to sort of shift the culture into what we think
it needs to be.  
  
I tried real hard this season not to -- I didn't want to come in here and blow
up everything these guys knew. You know, you're going to do it this way, and I
don't care what you've learned. I tried to really accommodate who they were,
what they had known, and other ways, and how they've had success.  
  
Going forward, we'll turn it over. We'll turn it over. It will -- we'll have a
lot of new faces. We've already got six or seven guys in the fold and still
looking for more. So it will have a facelift over the next year or two, a
pretty thorough one.  
  
But, again, I would say, to begin with, we would start with Cam and Ryan and
our expectations that they could step forward and be leaders and guys of
prominence in this program going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, I was hoping you could tell me about one of Virginia's
players, Kyle Guy. Kind of what do you see in his game?  
COACH STALLINGS: He's got a terrific ability to make baskets, and he's got
great legs on his shot. He's a terrific shooter. Even though he's not real
big, he's got great legs and lift on his shot. So he elevates, and he can
shoot with his body not all the way turned and not all the way squared up and
still shoot very accurately.  
  
He was very effective tonight. We did a pretty good job on him, I thought, in
the first two games. Tonight he really hurt us.  
  
Q. Kevin, you just now talked about kind of transforming the culture.
What does the culture have to be for this program to be successful?  
COACH STALLINGS: I think that, first of all, it's got to be something that I'm
comfortable with because, as the person that's in charge of it, it needs to
reflect the things that I believe in, the things that our program will now
stand for because I'm in charge of it and that kind of thing. But it's going
to be a culture of accountability, a culture of unselfishness, of trying to do
the right thing on and off the floor. I'm not saying that these are shifts in
what the culture has been in the past. I don't know what the culture was
before I got here. I'm just saying what it needs to be going forward. There
are lots of other things, but we'll just try to get guys in here that are ACC
level players that will do things both on the court and off the way we expect
them to be done and try to be as competitive as we can be.  
  
Q. Obviously, not the way you wanted the season to end or the tournament
to end, but what can you say about the team, the fight they showed, down by 11
at halftime, fell behind even more in the second half, I believe, to cut it to
one and really never give up when it seemed like the game could have been
over?  
COACH STALLINGS: We talked about that a little before you got here. I was
really proud of how our guys fought and kind of came together this week. Kind
of the character they showed to stay together given a tough circumstance and a
tough season, and to come out and to perform the way they did last night and
have to grind out that win against Georgia Tech and then come back tonight and
really fight to the very, very end. There was no back up, no give up, no give
in. I was proud of them for that.  
  
We didn't play great, but a lot of that had to do with Virginia. But I'm proud
of these guys. I'm proud of these seniors. I hope they feel like they can walk
out of here holding their head high.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

### [Michael Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27919)

### [Sheldon Jeter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32047)

### [Chris Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26683)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Pitt - 61, Georgia Tech - 59  
  
COACH STALLINGS: Proud of how we stuck together and fought through. These two
guys made some plays for us going down the stretch. Chris Jones made some big
plays, as did Jamel. I thought Jonathan Milligan came off and gave us good
minutes off the bench.  
  
We didn't play great, but I don't think that you look great too often against
Georgia Tech. I think they scrum the game up a little bit. I think that's part
of the beauty in how they play.  
  
But we fought, and we were able to make plays, do just enough to win the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Sheldon, you told us a couple days ago that you wouldn't know
necessarily what kind of mental state the team was in until you got here,
walked into the arena. What did you see today when that happened?  
SHELDON JETER: We were upbeat, came out ready to play. Sole focus was, you
know, just winning by any means. So it was a very positive mindset going in.  
  
Q. Michael, when you have given up the lead late in games previously,
you struggled to get it back. What made the difference in this one?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Defense. Kept getting stops even though the offense wasn't
clicking. Get some good shots, good looks. It was our defense and our
discipline. We fought really, really hard. We came up with some big stops. I
think that contributed to us being able to get the lead back.  
  
Q. You started off strong. What do you attribute to Georgia Tech's
ability to come back and battle you throughout the rest of the game?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: They attacked the whole game. Down 20, up 20, they going to
keep attacking, push the ball up, attack, get up to the rim. Lammers, he's a
load inside as far as rebounding the ball. Like I said, they attacked the
whole game, no matter what the score is.  
  
That's a tough team to play. They got great guards. They play really well
together. Great chemistry. They fought hard the whole game. We fought hard as
well. It came down to the wire.  
  
Q. Michael, you've had a long and fairly illustrious career at Pitt. I
know this season probably hasn't gone as well as you would have liked. At this
stage of the game, is there something about not wanting it to end that drives
you and the other seniors on the team?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Yes, for sure. This is it for us. Regular season is over. We
can't get none of those games back. We just got to move forward.  
  
We believe, our coaches believe, this whole program believe that we can do
something special in this tournament. That's what we came here to do. That's
what I believe we're going to do.  
  
Just for the seniors, this is our last go-around. Every game is our last game.
If we lose, we go home. We just got to fight. You got to have that desire to
play every possession like it's the last play of the game like it's your last.  
  
Q. Michael, because seniors and making important plays at the end of the
game, it's a three-point margin. Artis commits the foul with two seconds left
in the game. Seems like a wise move. Was that something you talked about or do
you think he did it out of instinct?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Something we talked about. Coach always keeps us prepared for
moments like that. We go over numerous situations that may come up in the
game. Coach keeps us prepared.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: We actually called timeout before Cam's second free throw and
said, He's going to make it, but in the event it doesn't go in after he makes
it, then we have to foul them just before the ball gets across halfcourt.  
  
That was the entire reason that the timeout was taken. We've practiced it. But
we executed it very well.  
  
Q. Coach, you described Georgia Tech as a team that will scrum it up.
You'll face another team that will scrum it up tomorrow, for the second time
in five days. How optimistic are you after the performance tonight?  
COACH STALLINGS: Oh, I don't have any more or less optimism based on what
happened tonight. My optimism will come on a continued commitment for these
guys to be united and be together in their approach to playing whatever game
we play. Now it's Virginia.  
  
I thought we were a more together basketball team tonight than we had been in
a while. Put it that way. And I thought that togetherness carried us through
to win, even though you look down and we're six of 23 from three, and we have
almost twice as many turnovers as they have.  
  
But we fought together. We guarded together. We tried to share the ball
together. We had some guys make big plays. These guys made big plays.  
  
I think when you approach the game right, more things go right for you. I
thought we approached the game right. As a consequence, I thought more things
went our way.  
  
Q. Sheldon, you got a little banged up midway through the second half.
Seemed when things were going bad, Georgia Tech went up by four, when you come
back in, that kind of sparked the team to come back. What were you going
through on the bench? What was it like to get back in the game?  
SHELDON JETER: When I was on the bench, I'm pretty sure Chris and Mel both hit
big threes while I was out. They kind of held the line.  
  
We got back in, we had the momentum already. It wasn't really me getting back
in that sparked whatever. They had already started it while I was on the
bench.  
  
Q. Michael, you have had mixed results against UVA this year. Obviously
the last result is pretty fresh in your mind. What is your approach going in
there? After the game on Saturday, is there a way to represent a better
showing four days later?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: We going to prepare for every game the same way. Scout the
team, watch film, go over what they like to do. This will be our third time
playing them. We know them pretty well.  
  
But just scout the team, go over everything that we need to do. The coaches
will get us prepared to play the game. Some of the actions they may like to
do, things that we may have advantage at doing.  
  
From there, we just got to prepare for the game how we prepared for this one.
Just come in together, knowing we have to play hard, every possession out.
Know we need everybody, from the starters to the last guy on the bench, we're
going to need everybody to win the game.  
  
Q. Kevin, you said the way your group played tonight, they were more
unified than they've been in a long time. Why haven't they been unified? Why
did they come together tonight?  
COACH STALLINGS: The first part, I don't have an answer for. The second part,
I think seniors feel urgency. I think the tournament represented sort of a
different beginning, a different start.  
  
I think that they kind of took it upon themselves to approach this a little
bit differently, a little better. Our practice sessions were really good and
productive leading up to this game. They were better than they had been in a
couple weeks probably.  
  
But that's why we haven't been sort of behind us. The only thing we really
need to do or the only thing we can do is try to be better going forward.  
  
Q. Kevin, you were 1 for 11 from the three-point range in the first
half. Maybe conventional wisdom would be not take as many. Five from 12 in the
second half. What was the difference there in the second half from beyond the
arc?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, they were in front of us. You know, I don't know.  
  
I think when one guy hits one... Jones hit two. Mike hit one. I think Mike and
Jamel hit back-to-back ones, isn't that right? That was kind of the umph that
we needed.  
  
But Jones made a couple big shots for us. That was really nice to see, because
he's the only good player that I know that can go through playing 36 minutes
in a game and take one shot. We encourage him to be more aggressive. He was
tonight. The ball went in for him. We needed all of them.  
  
We just did a little better job in the second half. I think when Chris made
one or two, then Mike, you know, you kind of feed off each other. You keep
seeing each other miss, then it detracts from your confidence a little bit.
When they go in, I think it adds to your confidence.  
  
Q. Kevin, I'm sure the focus going in was to stop Lammers or limit
him.  
COACH STALLINGS: We had small guys switch off on him. Our help side was
better. These guys were very alert.  
  
It's probably the reason we won the game. You look down, he got six points. So
Ryan Luther helped in that regard. Our guards got switched on him some. We
just got down there and fought. We have fought and we helped each other. We
played together on defense, just like we tried to play together on offense. It
made a big difference.  
  
Q. Mike and Sheldon, what does it signify for you guys to win a game
like this, where you shoot below 40%? Going into tomorrow, what does this kind
of a win signify for y'all?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: It reaffirms that we know as a team, no matter what the
situation is, come together, play hard, execute, we'll have a chance at
winning the game, down or up. Taking it into the next game, no matter what the
score is, what the situation is, down or up, to keep playing, execute, play
hard, play together.  
  
SHELDON JETER: I believe it shows a little bit of growth more than anything
else. A week ago we played them, kind of the same story as we did in the first
half. The second half, they came out and shot 60-something percent. Today in
the second half we held them to 34%.  
  
I believe that's what showed to me, the growth, especially defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Quinton Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32048)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Pitt - 61, Georgia Tech - 59  
  
COACH PASTNER: Congratulations to Coach Stallings and Pittsburgh with a great
win. We had trouble scoring in some areas, missed a lot of short shots, missed
some of those layups in the first half. Our free throws in the first half,
missed a lot of layups, which kind of has been our Achilles' heel all year
long.  
  
Our guys guarded. We've been able to hang in, stay in games, strictly based
off our defense. We came in the game seventh in the country in defensive
efficiency, first in the ACC, during ACC play in field goal percentage. We've
hung our hat on that.  
  
But our young men have given us everything they had. We just fell a little
short today. It's a tough loss. It's one of those things.  
  
But I'm really proud of our young men. I still believe eight wins in this
league deserves to be in the NCAA tournament, being this is the best league in
the country. However, I know it could still be a longshot. We're going to keep
our fingers crossed. Either way, whether it's the NCAA tournament, or the NIT,
to be able to play in post-season, as we're trying to rebuild the program
back, to get more games, this one is going to sting.  
  
But we'll have to get back to work. We'll give the guys a day or two off, then
we'll get back to practice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
COACH PASTNER: I would also like to say thank you to everyone at The Barclays.
Everyone here is first class. Tremendous place to play. Whether it's from the
ACC or the people at The Barclays here, everyone is first class, have put on a
great event. The ACC is obviously the best league in the country, without
question.  
  
Q. Coach, you made reference to the fact that you're hoping to get into
the NCAA tournament. You made such great strides this year. Is it hard to
balance now the fact that you sort of petered out at the end there?  
COACH PASTNER: No, this season has been a success. Remember now, I mean, in
the spring meetings, my fellow coaches told me, many coaches said, This is
going to be the longest year of your life. You will lose maybe -- you're not
going to win.  
  
We scheduled Tusculum in the middle of the conference season because we were
projecting, based on what I was told, that we might lose 11 straight
conference games. So I wanted to stop the bleeding.  
  
So there's no petering out. This has been an amazing year. This is my eighth
year as a head coach. Even though we're on a two-game slide, to this point I
haven't lost three games as a head coach. For this team to continue that
during this year, based on this league schedule, is amazing.  
  
It's a credit to these young men on how we've come together and built as a
team. We have a lot of shortcomings and deficiencies, including myself and all
of us, in our group. But we've really come together as a team. I'm just so
proud of our young men.  
  
It's been just an amazing season. We've had some amazing wins. But, you know,
we play hard. We're going to look back, this team, this year, has set the
foundation, whether in the NCAA tournament or the NIT, of what we're trying to
do for the long-term to build Georgia Tech basketball back, as Coach Cremins
had it back in the day when he had that run.  
  
Q. Josh, Ben had a tough night. Did they do something in particular to
slow him down?  
COACH PASTNER: Two things. If Ben struggles, it's nearly impossible for us. It
might not even be possible. It's very hard when he doesn't play well. It's
literally impossible, because it just makes it really hard.  
  
We do everything through him offensively, everything. We just open things up.
The second thing is what they did, they really played off of everybody and
just sat in the paint. We didn't make enough shots. We were four for 18. Q
made big threes, especially those two in the first half, to keep us in. Had
that one on that skip in the second half.  
  
We have to make some shots. As we build the program, I said many times, we
have to increase our shooting and scoring. That is our biggest area of
deficiency. That's what we have to do. We have to get shooting. Shooting is
just so critical for us, scoring. That's been our Achilles' heel. We've really
struggled to score. It's been a struggle.  
  
We missed a lot of layups. Obviously free throws. But you're going to have to
make some shots somewhere.  
  
Q. Josh, you finally got the lead, went up four. It looked like you
stopped most everything they were trying to do. They go on this run.  
COACH PASTNER: The back-to-back threes.  
  
Q. The game changes. Is that something that you as a coach say, That's
basketball?  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, you know, you look back, what could I have done? Josh
Okogie had three fouls, just picked up his fourth, I think. He had his fourth
foul. We were on that run with him. I pulled him right before the media
timeout because we were going on defense. I figured, go offense-defense. Not
that they wouldn't have hit a three, but maybe that changed with that sub. I
don't know.  
  
What I would tell us is basketball is a make-or-miss game. That's why I was
sure with everybody in Atlanta that we have to get shooting. It's the
difference maker. It's the equalizer. It will open things up for us
offensively to spread the floor, especially the way we move the ball. I think
as we moved on this year, teams just really - the second half of the ACC, it
was hard to find openings. I think Quinton would agree with that.  
  
The amount of packing in that teams did on us... I probably have never seen it
this packed in on teams, whether I've been coached or even seen. It's just not
normal to pack it in as much as they do. That's where we have to get some help
on that. Obviously, that's my job and the assistants' job to help us in that
area in recruiting.  
  
Q. Coach, you got off to a slow start in the first half. What
adjustments did you realize you had too make to be able to come back and only
be down by three? What was it that you said to your team to motivate them to
play so well?  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, we've started slow on the road and at neutral courts.
That's something we have to examine in the off-season, why are we starting
slow on the road or neutral courts.  
  
On the timeout, on that media timeout, we made an adjustment offensively. We
run a type of high-post. We went away from it, went more into motion. We tried
to get more driving opportunities, which allowed us to score a little more.
Got to the rim better, tried to open things up by creating some gaps. That way
we were able to attack the gaps, have better spacing. We just missed some
layups.  
  
The thing that saved us is defense. Seventh best defense efficiency coming
into the game. We've hung our hat on defense all year. Guys like Quinton, he's
overachieved this year. He's been so good for us. But he's been so good
defensively. He has another double-double. He's given us his body to just play
so hard. It's all those guys.  
  
When you get down like that, you're just playing from behind, trying to dig
yourself out of a whole the entire time. That makes it tough, especially based
on our limitations offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, before the season, I'm sure there may have been a period when
it came down to this time of the year, you thought, Oh, the ACC, they get
everything, the benefit of the doubt, when it comes to the tournament. Being
on the other side of that, having gone through the regular season, how big of
a factor do you see that as now, making it through this conference schedule?  
COACH PASTNER: I think if you have eight wins, you should automatically be
locked in for the NCAA tournament. It's impossible not to be.  
  
This league is the best league in the country. I just believe they should just
say in the preseason, If you win eight games in the ACC, you're automatically
getting an at-large. That's just how good this league is.  
  
I've been in the other leagues, nothing against those other leagues, we had a
lot of success, a lot of great memories, but there's nothing like this. It's a
whole 'nother level, whole 'nother level. It's the closest thing to the NBA
that's not the NBA in terms of just the competition and the intensity and the
players. Everyone is so good in this league. Everyone can score. Everyone can
score in this league.  
  
Q. Was Josh Okogie supposed to make the second free throw?  
COACH PASTNER: I wanted him to miss it. We were going to X on the out of
bounds.  
  
He made it. What happened was, we talk about it all the time, we had the same
play set up against North Carolina State. Ben went with one hand. We always
talk about the most important thing is the catch, is the catch.  
  
But I wanted Josh to miss it. I think he tried to miss it. I told him to make
sure it was soft, not just a line drive, so it would get a bounce.  
  
He ended up obviously making it, unintentionally. Then the other guy tried to
miss the second one. Artis, was it? He ended up making it. So it kind of
balanced each other out.  
  
Q. Quinton, it did feel a little bit like the NC State game. Did you
feel like you were going to pull it out?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Yeah. I mean, I think with the help of our bench, they
always kept us believing in it. Even them turning the ball over after we hit
some free throws, I mean, I didn't think much of it.  
  
Feeling the energy from our bench got me realizing, Hey, man, we're still in
this. That's what teammates are for. So, yeah, I mean, we went after it. I
think we executed pretty well. Yeah.  
  
Q. Josh, not to be harsh or anything.  
COACH PASTNER: I've heard it all, especially coming from Memphis, I've heard
everything (smiling).  
  
Q. For as hard as you played, as hard as you had to play, do you think
the last few weeks, especially the last couple weeks, you kind of hit the
wall, not so much in terms of effort but in terms of what you could do?  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, I mean, you know, I've talked to Marvin Lewis and Todd
Stansbury about it. I've said it many times. People, like fans, would email
me. I have said, We have gotten every ounce of energy and effort from these
guys. Quinton, there's just nothing more he can give.  
  
I even told multiple people, I just said, I hope we have one final push in us.
I just think late in the season, in this gauntlet of a league, for the amount
of minutes that we are playing these guys, and the effort that they play at, I
mean, as much as we talk about our cutting, I felt towards the end of year we
didn't cut as hard, in the speed of our cuts. It's hard.  
  
Then our defense, how we fly around, move around, shift. It just takes so much
energy. I'm all about energy. I just think towards the end there, you know, we
milked everything we could out of the guys. Literally, every ounce of energy.  
  
You know, if we're in the NIT, if we're not in the NCAA, these couple days
will give them some rest, try to get them rested, back at it.  
  
That's part of the recruiting process. We have to get more depth. We have to
develop the guys on the bench that didn't play. That's where this depth goes.
It's not having 13 guys, it's just being able to get into a seven-, eight-man
rotation so you can rest some guys, so in this league you can go a little
deeper, require the speed of the cut that I want us to be able to do, to play
with the effort and energy defensively.  
  
You get to that last two, three weeks, they're exhausted. Ben Lammers, like
North Carolina State, Syracuse, we played so hard. Then we turn around versus
NC State, and we look -- it's hard to be mad at the guys. They look so tired.
I just think we maybe ran out the gas as we were coming down the homestretch.  
  
Q. The last time you led an ACC team at the half was the Notre Dame game
at home, which was January 28th.  
COACH PASTNER: Right. We were down 13 to start the game. Our starts haven't
been great. If you look at our defense, teams don't even get to 30. We just
have severe struggles scoring.  
  
This is new for me. It's new for me because I haven't been on a team like
that. That's where I felt in the beginning, back in the summer, projecting who
we'd be, for us to have a chance offensively, it was all about the pace of our
cutting, the speed of the cut. It was our only chance to survive.  
  
As I said in these last few weeks, we weren't as fast on our cutting. Just
kind of caught up to us.  
  
Q. Do you feel that way, that you're pretty tapped out at this point?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: I don't really even -- I don't know. I'm just giving it my
all. Who knows how I felt in November. I'm not sure.  
  
But, I mean, I know that my guys, we're giving our all. We want what's best
for Tech. I want what's best for Tech. I want to leave it a better place than
I found it. Tech will be a great place to play at. I enjoyed playing here. I
loved being coached by Coach Pastner. I get energy from guys like and Rand, I
get energy from Corey. You don't think about how tired you are. I think that
speaks a lot to our team.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Exactly, you know.  
  
COACH PASTNER: Let me say that on Quinton. What an unbelievable young man.
What he said, he's been saying that in the spring and summer. How important it
is to lay the right foundation for the future, that the program is very
important to him.  
  
He has given us his all. Like, he had other double-double tonight. I mean, the
guy, I can't say enough about him, about his energy and effort, how hard he's
played for this program, for the name on the front of the jersey. He's laid it
all on the line every practice, every game.  
  
We've gotten to the point if he wasn't getting a double-double, we were
losing. That's how vital his energy was to us. I'm just very proud and honored
to coach him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
COACH PASTNER: Thank you, everybody.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

### [John Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32777)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Wake Forest - 92, Boston College - 78  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wake Forest.  
  
Coach, a brief opening statement, then questions.  
  
COACH MANNING: I thought this was an interesting ballgame. BC came out with a
lot of effort, a lot of energy. I think Jim's game plan was very good. They
followed the game plan.  
  
Again, this afternoon, their game plan was to come out and double-team John
Collins every time he touched the basketball. I thought we did a good job of
having patience, a little bit of poise, getting guys into open spots. I
thought John did a good job of getting the ball out of the post to our
shooters. We had some guys knock down some shots.  
  
I thought we got good contributions across the board from a lot of guys. Happy
to be moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach and John, with 24 minutes gone in the game, John had one shot
from the floor. All his points were from free throws. A jumper, a dunk, other
baskets that were a big factor. Was it anything you did tactically? How did
you get open, John?  
JOHN COLLINS: Coach just stressed me to play harder, post harder, cut harder.
There's really no change in game plan. Just told me to do what I'm supposed to
do: play hard basically. I think I did that in the second half.  
  
COACH MANNING: For us, that was BC's game plan, to take him out. I thought he
handled it very well early on. He got rid of the ball. He didn't necessarily
get assists, but he got hockey assists. He got the ball to the first open guy,
then we got it to someone else for a wide-open jump shot. That kind of changed
how they wanted to guard him in the second half.  
  
In the second half, he did a good job of asserting himself, getting fouled,
then scoring the basketball. He still finishes with 19 points. That's right
there for us.  
  
Q. Bryant, they battled back and tied the game at 53. You guys ran off a
14-1 run to break it back open. Was that a matter of getting a challenge and
answering it, or was there something different in that run?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: We came out flat after halftime. They came out and brung more
energy than us. We had a bench player, Greg McClinton, come off the bench and
give us a lot of energy, make a few big plays for us that turned us up on the
defensive end, so...  
  
Q. Danny, could you address that, how your team answered the
challenge.  
COACH MANNING: We responded okay. I think we can do better. We have to do a
better job of staying in front of the basketball. We allowed far too many
points in the paint. A lot of those came off of dribble-penetration with their
guards.  
  
But we were active. There were a couple times we strung together a few stops
in a row that gave us a chance to create some separation.  
  
Q. You had mentioned some of the passes that John was making. Those
threes that Austin hit in the first half, which were big, were some of those a
result of, Things aren't working for me, I'll move the ball around?  
COACH MANNING: John caught the basketball. They committed two guys to him.
Austin hit four threes in the first half. Shot very well. Had 12 points for
us.  
  
We feel like offensively we have guys across the board that are capable
scorers. For us, it's all about ball movement and player movement. We want the
ball to find the open person. If you're open, we want you to shoot the ball if
you're in your range.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH MANNING: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Abdul-Malik Abu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28818)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Clemson - 75, NC State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by NC State.  
  
Coach, just a brief opening statement, and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, we're disappointed. I'm really proud of our guys. I
thought they continued to play hard and battle. I thought today probably their
rebounding, offensive rebounding, I thought at key times, probably hurt us. I
thought our turnovers in the first half hurt us. Probably dug a hole in the
game just with how we played offensively in the first half, turning the ball
over.  
  
Then we also had some opportunities where we had some pretty good looks today
and couldn't make them. Sometimes you just got to make some shots, too, when
you got great looks.  
  
Dennis never really got going. I thought Clemson did a good job of kind of
packing it in there on him, taking away some driving opportunities for him.  
  
But overall, you know, I'm proud of our guys. They kept battling, kept playing
hard, just came up short today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach or Abu.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just explain the emotions of your last time with NC
State.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, it's sad for me. I came to NC State hoping to be here
for the rest of my career. That was my goal. So I'm sad.  
  
I look at Malik, a lot of these young guys on this team. I wish I was the guy
that was going to get to coach them next year. I think there's a lot of
potential.  
  
I'm proud of our guys. I thought they kept playing hard. But it hurts. You
move on in life. Things happen.  
  
But proud of our accomplishments. We've had a ton of them. Obviously this past
year and this year have been hard. But I got all kind of thoughts. I got
everything running through my mind.  
  
Deep down, just disappointed.  
  
Q. You said the word 'proud' a lot there. Do you have one moment that
you're going to think about when you think back to this season?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No, I don't think there's one moment. I think it's been well-
documented, all the amazing accomplishments that have happened at NC State.  
  
When I took the job, I don't know that anybody anticipated us going to the
NCAA tournament in our first year. Then turn around, do it for three more
straight years, two Sweet 16s. I can go on and on. Beating No. 1 teams in the
country, all those kind of things.  
  
So for me there's a lot of things I think very highly about. I loved coaching
our guys. We got caught this year. We were really young. We're playing against
a really good conference, league, that just kind of the way it falls have a
lot of veteran teams. You start going team by team by team, you see a lot of
veteran players.  
  
Herein lies where we sit right now. So that's a little bit hard for me.  
  
Q. Mark, obviously you had a lot of hopes and expectations on Dennis,
his season, what you could do. Was there ever a point where you could sense it
wasn't coming together with him and the team in terms of the wins? Was there a
point where you sensed things started going wrong a little bit?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No, I never really looked at it like that, to be honest. I
look at our team. Malik and I were just sitting back there talking about a guy
like Lennard Freeman for us, veteran guy, would have been a senior, had his
second surgery last summer. Truthfully our team, you look at them, probably a
veteran post player away. A lot of pressure on Omer and Ted. Malik, just like
today, he's out there playing like a seasoned ACC player should play.  
  
We're just shorthanded a little bit. So I never looked at it in that regard,
like it's not coming together. You're always looking to that next game.  
  
Unfortunately, for Dennis, just kind of the way it fell this year, there's a
lot of inexperience around him. That's hard. He's inexperienced. You've got
inexperience everywhere. That made it really hard on him as the quarterback of
a team to play with so many young faces.  
  
Q. Coach, you walked off the floor with Dennis, hand around his waist,
saying something to him. What were you telling him? Also, what do you think
the legacy he might be leaving behind at NC State will be?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think what Dennis and I talk about are private.  
  
All the time with him, I'm really proud of him. I think he's handled a tough
situation as well as you can handle. I think they all have, no question about
it. Tons of expectations put on Dennis to be savior of the program. He's got
great things that are going to happen for him in his life. He's going to learn
this year. It's going to be a great learning opportunity for him.  
  
He's just going to stay positive. He'll get better and better and better, and
life will move on for him.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you, there's been a lot of talk about the NC
State job being a very hard job, a good job. Some people say it's not a good
job. We saw Coach Brownell say how hard it is to play in the ACC. Is NC State
a good job for a coach, or is it a hard or bad job for a coach?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I don't know that I would really directly answer your
question.  
  
Here's what you got. It's a great place. NC State is a wonderful place.
Different than every other job in this league. You look around all these
banners, all these other schools, nobody else is compared daily the way our
guys and our program is to North Carolina and Duke. They're just not.  
  
I think it says the fact that in six years, four tournaments, two Sweet 16s,
two years missed the tournament, they're hunting for a new coach. I'm not sure
that's happening at about 50% or 60% of the rest of the league, quite
honestly. In that regard, I've said it many times, tough neighborhood.  
  
The other part about it is for us, just like when we recruited Malik, or
Dennis, or T.J. Warren, or Ingram, or Bam at Kentucky, Grayson Allen, or all
those guys, we went after the best players, got some, like this guy. We did.
But missed on some, too. The expectation at our place is a little different
than maybe it is at some other schools.  
  
It's a great place. It's a tough situation because of some of those things.
But I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything in the world. Would not
trade it. Loved every second of it.  
  
Q. Malik, I'd like to know your emotions right now. This is your last
game of the season, it's your last game ever playing for Coach Gottfried. How
does this feel?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: It's a weird feeling, you know. This is the only college
coach I've ever had. I'm forever grateful he gave me the opportunity to play
for this wonderful program. Taught me millions of things. I just wish we could
have kept the family together.  
  
It's kind of tough. But, you know, I'm proud of our guys. I'm proud of Coach.
I love him to death. You know what I'm saying? I love all our staff.  
  
It's tough, you know. But life moves on. Good things are ahead for, you know,
all of us.  
  
Q. Talk about your up moments and down moments in this season. When you
look back to this year, what are you going to remember?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: The biggest thing I'm going to remember is just the family-
ness, you know, when things are tough. You guys had big opinions on us
throughout the season, but we stayed together as a family. I never been closer
with a group of guys, you know, from the staff to each player.  
  
We walk into practice, and we had a good aura. We never got down on each other
too hard. We just knew what we were capable of. We knew we were young. We knew
that there were some things we needed to fix. It was the love that kept us
together.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Wake Forest - 92, Boston College - 78  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boston College. Coach, a brief opening
statement of the.  
  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I was proud of our team's effort. I thought we played really
hard. Obviously, when Ky went down, that really hurt us. Obviously, he's such
a great player, it hurt us from that standpoint because he's such a great
player. Also from a minutes standpoint, we're not very deep on the perimeter.
We really had no subs at that point to guard. They kind of wore us out as the
game went on.  
  
Again, proud of our effort. I couldn't have asked more from our kids. If you
were in our locker room now, they're broken up because they wanted to keep
playing. I'm proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jim, was the strategy to try to keep Collins from beating you? Was
the downside of that the fouls?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Well, we didn't foul him in traps, we fouled him in open
floor. I mean, if you don't double him, he hurt us in both games we played, so
we tried to neutralize them. You got to pick your poison, right? He's probably
the best offensive post player in the league. They're also a good three-point
shooting team. You have to scramble, get to those guys. They hit some threes
early.  
  
We weren't fouling on those situations. We were fouling in open-floor
situations, off a couple turnovers. It was, you know, way too much.  
  
Q. Is there any update at all?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: No update. The doctors are here. They came on the trip with
us. It's a knee injury. To what extent, nobody knows. We have to go back and
get it MRIed. We got to find a way to get him back. We're taking a bus back.
Probably don't want to put him on the bus. We'll get an MRI when we get back,
find out what it is.  
  
Q. The brace?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Precautionary. It's a knee injury. It's what they do.  
  
Q. The minutes become one thing, but in that moment, a four-point game,
five minutes left in the first half...  
COACH CHRISTIAN: The first thing, you know, just to talk about it, obviously
our kids care so much about him. To get our kids back in the locker room,
focused -- he was in the locker room, when we came in at halftime. They were
obviously very concerned about him and they care a lot about him. Try to get
their mind back on the game. That's one of their friends who is in there
crying, he's hurt. To try to get them refocused back on the game, that's not
an easy thing to do.  
  
That's the kind of kids we have. We have great kids. They care for one
another. That's a hard thing to do. That's a hard thing to do.  
  
Q. You held Collins with your defensive strategy to one shot in the
first 24 minutes, then he got involved in the game, was a big part in their
breaking the game open. What did they do differently to get him going?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: You know, he did a good job posting up early in the clock
before we could get to a double. So like in transition when he's posting
directly under the rim, he's hard to handle there. He got himself going. I
don't think they changed anything.  
  
He was really good. He handled double-teams really well. He made the right
plays. He passed the ball. In the second half, he was finding open plays. He's
a great player. He can pass and he can play. He got some other guys shots.  
  
He might not have scored in the first half, but he was very influential in the
game. That's what great players do. He's a First Team All-Conference. He
played like it.  
  
Q. After you tied the game at 53, they went on a 14-1 run, what was the
catalyst of that?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Our run?  
  
Q. Their run.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: We had a couple live-ball turnovers, got a layup. A three-
point play on the break. We only had two turnovers at halftime. That he was
keeping us in the game. We were getting shots.  
  
The second half, I thought we had some careless decisions with the ball. That
got them going a little bit. They hit a couple big threes. There was a stretch
there, we settled for jump shots. We were attacking the rim. That's been a bad
formula for us.  
  
Q. How much of the onus fell on Jerome?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: It was a tough role for him. He was dying out there. He plays
a lot of minutes anyway. They picked him up full, tried to wear him out. It
was hard for him. There's no other point guard for us. He got worn out.  
  
Obviously on the defensive end, that's where the toll is. It's not the
offensive end. We're a step slower on the defensive end, guys are turning the
corner, ball-screen situations. The big guys have to stay a little bit too
long. Now they're making other plays.  
  
That one step defensively, when you don't have depth or guys get too tired,
that's how they get going. That's what happened.  
  
Q. Not that you can look from 50,000 feet right after a loss, but you
can kind of see some of your pieces coming together. I'm curious, at what
point do you see some places that need to sort of still be tweaked?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: There's a lot. There's a lot of areas. Look, the guys who are
coming back, they have to get much better. There's no two ways about it. They
have to get better.  
  
We have a good foundation. We have some good, young players who are talented.
They have to get hungry, better, keep adding pieces. That's the bottom line.
This is a process. It's one step at a time.  
  
We have a foundation with our two guards are good. Nico and JC are two young
players, have to get stronger, more experienced. We have to keep adding
players. We added one early. Add some late. Then you have it.  
  
That's what it takes. There are no miracles out here. You have to stay with
your process, believe in what you're doing. I do. Our kids grew and got better
as the year went on, individually and collectively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Thank you.

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Shelton Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32774)

### [Jaron Blossomgame](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32046)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Clemson - 75, NC State - 61  
  
COACH BROWNELL: But I thought we were really locked in. Did a great job on
Dennis Smith. Offensively we played pretty well for most stretches. Didn't
shoot it as well in the second half. We had a bunch of layups and chips that
our bigs missed.  
  
Our attention to detail was better than it's been. So very pleased to get this
first win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask questions for Coach Brownell.  
  
Q. Coach, specifically Dennis Smith, you shut him down pretty much the
whole game, kept him about 11 points below his average. What was the key to
that?  
COACH BROWNELL: Some of it was transition. I thought we kept him out of
transition a good bit. He's dynamic in the open floor. Whether it was just
making shots or good shots around the rim so we didn't have long misses that
led to run-outs and open-court play for him, I just think he's a terrific
player. When he gets a full head of steam, you can't guard him with one
player.  
  
I think keeping him in the halfcourt, executing offensively with shot
selection, not to take bad shots, have live-ball turnovers, kept that
situation the way we wanted it.  
  
Q. Keeping the ball away from him, was that Holmes that was doing
that?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, we had a couple different guys guarding him. Avry
started, and then Avry tweaked his ankle. Marcquise got some minutes there. I
thought both those guys did a really good job of making it a little bit
difficult when he got rid of the ball to not just be able to make easy
catches.  
  
Then our big guys did a good job in ball-screen defense.  
  
Q. Brad, seemed like you guys have had so many nail-biters at the end.
Did it feel strange the last couple minutes not having it down to one
possession?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, it did. You know, our team has showed unbelievable
amounts of character this year. I don't know that people speak to that enough.
This day and age, we're very critical of young people in a lot of
circumstances. If you look at our schedule, the way we've played every team in
this league almost, we've had a couple bad outings, a bad half at Louisville
and a bad game at Florida State, but every other game we've been in the game
with a chance to win with a minute or less to go.  
  
It's not easy to come back to practice every week when you're losing one-point
games, two-point games, one-point games in a variety of ways. Some of the
reason for that is the character of the guys I coach. I have great guys on my
team. They represent us phenomenally both on and off the court. They just
won't give in.  
  
So, yes, it's nice to win a game like this. But I've been extremely proud of
this team on nights when we lost. When you coach in this league, you can play
extremely well and lose because the teams are so good.  
  
It's not all about the outcome every night. We certainly would have liked to
have won some more games. There have been a lot of nights when I've been very
proud of our team when we didn't win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you could talk a little bit about the ease of the second half, how
well you were playing offensively. A couple thoughts on Duke tomorrow. Close
game with them last time.  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: We had a couple guys play well early in the first half. A
lot of guys gained confidence from that. Avry hit a big shot right before the
half. Guys were feeling good about our game, the plan that Coach put in for
us. The second half it carried over offensively.  
  
Q. Duke?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Another opportunity. We focused on beating NC State. We got
that out of the way. We'll regroup now and focus on Duke. We played them tough
up there in Cameron, lost by two. I'm definitely excited for round two.  
  
Q. What was the key, if anything, to slowing down Smith? Looked like he
was having a hard time finding his rhythm.  
COACH BROWNELL: Again, I think keeping him in the halfcourt, not allowing him
to be in the open court as much as possible. Some of that, again, it's floor
balance, it's good offensive execution to take quality shots so that you're
not having turnovers, you're not having long rebounds off bad shots that
bounce out, now he's grabbing it, getting a long outlet, playing in the open
floor.  
  
I thought our guys did a really good job of being in gaps, making him see
multiple jerseys, as much as possible, in the halfcourt. Our big guys did a
good job in ball-screen coverage.  
  
Q. You two looked like you were trading off baskets. You both finished
with 22. New stadium. Did you feel comfortable out there?  
SHELTON MITCHELL: Yeah, I think we felt comfortable. I think it was more so
getting our shots. Coach always talks about spacing on the floor, making sure
we're taking our shots. I think today we took our shots and they went in.  
  
Q. Jaron, yesterday you were comparing the NC State game, saying you
needed to have more attention to detail. That seems to have been the key to
the game today. Is that fair?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Yeah, we played really, really well defensively. In the
first game we gave up some things we shouldn't have given up. I felt like guys
for the most part were locked in today. Defensively we took care of business.  
  
Q. Shelton, talk about Duke, what you took out of that game last time,
what you think you need to do differently this time.  
SHELTON MITCHELL: I think just at Duke, we missed a couple of opportunities to
get the lead, winning the game. They're a great team. They space the floor.
They have a lot of weapons. Now we can focus on them and try to get a win
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Brownell, could you talk about what kind of conversation did
you have leading into the tournament about the NCAAs, what you might have to
do or not have to do?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, we didn't get into too many specifics. In some ways
every team gets an opportunity to make the tournament because if you win your
tournament, you're going to go, whether you're a mid-major, low major, high
major. You get to play until somebody beats you.  
  
I reminded our guys of that this week. We talked about the quality of play
that we've had throughout the year, some resulting in wins, some not. We
actually won a couple league games when we probably didn't play as well when
we lost. We know if we play well, focused, we can be a difficult team to beat.  
  
You can't talk about advancing in the tournament until you actually play a
game and win. Our full focus was on NC State. I thought we had great
preparation, a quick turnaround from Boston College, an emotional day with our
Senior Day with our players. Extremely proud of how they performed today.  
  
We'll give our full attention to Duke as soon as we get back to the hotel.  
  
Q. Jaron, as a senior, you've been through this a while now, does this
feel or do you think about this any differently, this being your last go-
around?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Not really. Haven't paid much attention to it. Really
trying to focus on each game. We have a really good team. Lost a few close
games this year.  
  
Like Coach said, we played well in some of our losses. We believed in each
other. We have a good team. Coach always prepares us to the fullest. We always
have a plan in place. I'm definitely excited for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you tell us anything about Avry? I know he came back from
the locker room, but you didn't put him back in.  
COACH BROWNELL: We're optimistic he'll be able to play. Trainer said you could
put him in and see how he goes. I told him a couple minutes into when he came
back, I just went down to him and say, Hey, I'm going to try not to play you.
If we can keep the lead at double figures, I'm not going to put you back in
the game. I'd rather you just rest it. Let's get more treatment, try to get
you as ready as we can for tomorrow.  
  
He'll certainly give it a go. We'll see how he is. I'm hopeful that he'll be
able to play and really help us because he's played really well here down the
stretch. As a senior I know he's highly motivated and wants to be out there.  
  
I'm sure he'll give it a go. We'll just have to see how it looks tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brad, can you speak a little bit to what Jaron has taken out of this
year, deciding not to leave last year?  
COACH BROWNELL: I know, I can say for me, I can't speak for Jaron. Certainly
one of the things that I'm unbelievably proud of with Jaron is Jaron had his
degree and still came back. I think that speaks a lot to our university and
our community.  
  
Jaron, in my opinion, just talking to him, I think he just loved his Clemson
experience. As much as he was going to improve in certain things, in
basketball, dribbling, passing, defending perimeter players, all those things,
I think he's a guy that wanted to enjoy his Clemson experience one more time.  
  
Again, we have an unbelievable Clemson family, from our president to athletic
director and all the people that support us and our student body. It's just a
unique school. Until you actually go and spend time there, it's hard to
explain. It just kind of grabs you.  
  
I think here is a guy that didn't grow up a Clemson fan. But I think he just
really loved his experience and didn't want to leave.  
  
Q. Jaron, can I ask you similar, what went into your decision? How did
it jibe with what Brad was saying there?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: There were a few factors that went into my decision. A lot
of what Coach said is true. I really do have a genuine love for Clemson. It's
a very special place. If you're not there, you really don't understand what
Clemson family really means.  
  
To be there five years, I truly understand what it means. There's a few things
I wanted to come back and work on and improve. I wanted one more year. I
didn't want to give up my last year of college, my last experience at Clemson.
The NBA will be there next year after the season.  
  
Wanted to come back to school, play with my guys one last time.  
  
Q. For both players, this is the first time this tournament has ever
been in this part of the world. What was the vibe like? What is it like
playing here?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Definitely a good feeling. It's my second time coming to
New York. It's a great venue to come play basketball at. It's a very good
basketball city. Guys were excited about it.  
  
SHELTON MITCHELL: I'll be honest. I was kind of disappointed, to be honest
with you (smiling). I grew up in North Carolina. I'm just used to always
seeing the ACC tournament in Greensboro. This is my first time being in New
York, so it's pretty cool. I'm honest (smiling).  
  
COACH BROWNELL: Oh, we didn't make any fans there (laughter). He's young, he's
young.  
  
SHELTON MITCHELL: I still love it here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Keyshawn Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33019)

### [Mitchell Wilbekin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34265)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Your intensity during the season is fun to watch; where do you get
that fire from?  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: Something I was pretty much born with. You know, being a kid
that always had to work hard and had to outwork everybody. When it comes to
bringing that fire to the game and bringing the fire to practice, it`s just
always something I've always had to do, something I've always enjoyed and had
fun with.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the effects that Danny Manning has had on
this team; what is he doing to improve this team from your opinion?  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: Danny Manning wanted to change the culture of our team. He
wanted to bring in good guys, wanted to bring in people that love being in the
gym and love to get better. He did a great job with bringing in the right type
of guys that we needed in order to win games.  
  
Q. As a redshirt junior, who do you look up to as a role model in the
game of basketball, say in the NBA or as a competitor in the ACC?  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: My favorite player was Kobe Bryant, so competitive-wise, I'd
take his type of fire and his approach to the game and try to take different
things from him.  
  
Q. What is it about the environment of Wake that really motivates you as
a player?  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: Our fans. Our fans bring a lot of energy, and we feed off our
fans' energy. Our student section is wild and crazy, and they enjoy being at
our games. The energy that our fans bring to our stadium is what as players we
like to feed off of.  
  
Q. Describe Mitchell as a teammate.  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: Mitch is amazing, especially playing with him as guards. You
find him anywhere around the perimeter. If he's wide open and by himself, nine
times out of ten it's going in, so you might as well run back on defense and
find who you've got to guard. But playing with Mitch, he's a good person. He's
also a co-captain of mine. He's a great leader, as well, and he's got a great
personality.  
  
Q. What makes your personality so great?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Well, first of all, I just want to thank Keyshawn for all
the great things he just said about me, saying I'm amazing. But no, I just --
like he said, I'm a captain with Keyshawn along with Bryant Crawford, and I
think us three are going to have to have a big voice this year on the court.
So I'm looking forward to playing one last year with these guys.  
  
Q. Mitchell, just what you can say from your point of view, the mark
that Danny Manning is leaving on this team and leaving on you.  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Yeah, coach Manning has been great since I got here. I have
had a pretty good relationship with him, and I started in the recruiting
process. He expects a lot of us as players, but that's something that we
appreciate. He's been successful collegiately and also at the professional
level, so we all respect that, and we're all eager to learn whatever we can
from him.  
  
Q. There are many basketball programs throughout the country that go
through transition when a new coach comes into play. Wake Forest has gone
through a lot of personnel transition. What has it been like for you to figure
out the chemistry and the bond with so many faces coming and going?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Yeah, well, I came in with Coach Manning, so that was
really the only coaching staff I had known. We've had some players leave, and
we've had an assistant coach leave. But that's just part of basketball at this
level. People are always moving up, people are always coming in. So for us as
players, we've just got to continue to do what we do, work hard every day, and
just compete at 100 percent whenever we're on the floor.  
  
Q. Your older brother Scotty was an All-American at Florida; what are
your takeaways from his game, and what do you two talk about to elevate your
game to the next level?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Yeah, Scotty was a great player at Florida, got to go to a
couple Final Fours. You know, growing up, we played a lot of one-on-one. We
competed a lot. I think that helped me a lot, having him to look up to. If I'm
struggling with anything, I can always call him and he can always give me that
advice, so that's something I appreciate for him.  
  
Q. I meant to ask earlier and forgot, I caught you at the women's game
last year, I think, playing the drums. Two questions: How good are you at the
drums? How long have you been playing? And do you find yourself supporting
many of the other Wake Forest athletic programs, as well?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Yeah, I like to support -- Wake Forest is obviously a small
school, so I know a lot of people from the different sports teams. So we try
to always support each other, and like you mentioned, I was at a girls' game
and saw the band down there and asked if I could play the drums, and they
didn't believe me, but I actually can play the drums. I was in the youth group
band at my church back home, so it's something I enjoy doing whenever I get a
chance to.  
  
Q. Are you any good at it?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Fantastic. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: So when I first started out, it was just like Christian
music that I would play like with a band, but I really can play -- how I
started was my mom wanted us to play the piano, and it wasn't really my thing.
So I started drums, and I was just naturally pretty decent at that.  
  
Q. What do you think your obligation is as a senior to make sure the
program is in as good a position as it can be after you're gone?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: Yeah, I really just want to come in and do whatever I can
do to help this team be successful and win basketball games. Like Keyshawn and
Bryant, we're the returning players that have to have a voice on both sides of
the floor, offensively and defensively, so I'm looking forward to my last year
here, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to have a good year.  
  
Q. We've asked several other seniors this: How did it become that you
got to be so old so fast?  
MITCHELL WILBEKIN: That's the best question I've heard all day. People say
it's going to fly by, and you never really think anything of it, and next
thing you know, I'm a senior, and it's really here. I'm just trying to take it
day by day, just enjoy this last year, and really try to just make the most of
my opportunity at Wake Forest.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams.  
  
Q. You always have such good, I don't know, phrases, sayings, Wednesday
wisdoms you call them. I always enjoy them. What are some of the mantras that
you go back with this team that have really stuck with your guys, just
curious?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's still a little early but inevitably we always go back to
a lot of the core things.  
  
I think what we're trying to figure out now is what the identity of our team
is going to be, the core values of what we want our program to be, et cetera,
et cetera. Those things never change. But the complexion of our team is way
different than it was a year ago at this time.  
  
I think it's important specific to how we coach our guys, that we allow them
to blossom and grow before we start critiquing and/or changing and/or give
them some country sayings to move them in the right direction.  
  
I think we're getting close to that. Our calendar is a little different
probably than most coaches that have stood here and how we go about things in
September and October.  
  
We're not in a very good rhythm yet. We normally don't hit our stride until
later than most. But I also think, without being arrogant, I think that's why
we've always finished strong, because of how we handle the fall. So hopefully
we'll continue to grow and mature. But we've got a long way to go.  
  
Q. Last season you had two big wins at home against UVA and Duke. How
will you continue to succeed going into this season in such tight-knit
conference games that will make or break your season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Those two were important. But the other 13 were really
important at home, too. I think the margin, every coach would tell you in this
league, is razor thin. And I think one thing that we're very grateful for is
the groundswell of support that's within our community and within our
institution.  
  
There's 229 season tickets left in Cassell as of this morning when I woke up.
That's distinctly earlier than when you woke up. So it may be less.  
  
That's 378 percent increase since we got there. So I think, in order to have a
chance to be sustainable as a program, you have to have a presence at home. I
think we're trending in that direction, and a lot of that has very little to
do with our players as much as it does the support of our institution and our
community, because playing in Cassell is completely different now than it was
upon arrival.  
  
So I think we were 15-2 last year. At some point we need to get to the point
where we don't lose at home. And when we're doing that, then we probably have
a chance to advance in March.  
  
Q. I know you guys want Chris to come back sooner rather than later, but
what does he bring to the team that you guys are able to do differently on the
floor night in, night out?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We'll have to be really cautious on when he gets back. It's
237 days since he had surgery. I think when God made him, he made him a little
different than he made you and I just from looking at you.  
  
His motor is what he does best. And he allows us to play fast in transition.
He's arguably the best passer on our team. He's been the best rebounder on our
team in the games that he's played.  
  
Both years that he's been there, he hasn't been healthy. And so the most
important thing in October, in November, in December is that we continue the
rehab and the protection of Chris so that the last half of his career he's
healthy in comparison to being (lost audio) --  
  
Q. \-- at times during the games, what about you as a head coach?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think when I was young I fed off the energy in the building.
I'm getting so old now what it does is we play so late it wakes me up.  
  
I'll tell you what's happened, and our kids don't necessarily have the thought
process to articulate it, but the support of their peers has really changed
the ambiance in Cassell. That doesn't mean that we're not grateful for the
season ticketholders and those that have bought season tickets.  
  
But Cassell Guard is the student section, and I think that as the season
ticket base has changed, so has the support of the peers of our players. And
kids want to be around kids. Kids want to be supported by kids and that's been
monumental in the change within our program.  
  
Q. Justin and Devin earlier said that your team is the group that has
said don't shave. We'll be able to understand the 2017-18 highlights
comparatively because it will be the year that Coach has hair.  
COACH WILLIAMS: That's a good point.  
  
Q. Why the change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was a bet. It started as a bet. Obviously I won the bet.
There were some people that didn't think I could -- or that I had hair or that
I could grow hair. And then what transpired as I was growing hair is I
realized that of our four children, none of them, the oldest of which is 15,
had ever seen me with hair. So I think my children are in favor of me keeping
my hair as well, too. We'll just have to see how that transpires.  
  
Q. We've asked several student-athletes this and one or two head
coaches. To be successful this year, do you have to raise a trophy? Do you
have to have hardware?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't. That's not the validation that I seek or the
validation that I need.  
  
I'm not saying that that's wrong of the coaches or kids that feel like that's
important. But the things that I look at on the figurative scorecard of what's
important, getting a trophy is not even on that.  
  
Q. So team unity is a very important thing. What do your guys do off the
court to help them be unified on the court?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I would say we probably spend more time together off the floor
than we do on the floor. There's some new rules in the NCAA Power Five leagues
that are very restrictive, more restrictive than ever before. You may have
heard of those.  
  
But relative to our program, the time that we spend together off the floor, I
think, translates in a much more genuine way on the floor. And so as many ways
creatively, some of which are not creative, it's just the standard, let's
spend time together, but we're constantly trying to think of ways that our
guys can spend time together.  
  
And it's not necessarily always as a big unit. Sometimes it's a few assistants
and a few players and sometimes it's a few players just with me.  
  
But I think that that chemistry, that symmetry is really important with any
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Over the last few years, your centers have given you scoring,
defense, passing at times and most of all offensive and defensive rebounding.
As you look at the young guys who will take up that position now, which areas
do you feel most positive about and which are you most concerned about?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think that's really a description of the way I like to
play. And right now it's the biggest worry I have. Are the big guys going to
get a rebound? Are they going to be able to make a pass without turning it
over? Are they going to be able to score a basket?  
  
We've gone this year probably more so than any team since about 1993 at
Kansas. That team had Adonis Jordan and Rex Walters, our two leading scorers.
But we still had Greg Ostertag up front and Richard Scott and a few guys like
that. We might be more perimeter oriented, but we still have to get the
basketball inside. You have to.  
  
The way I believe the easiest way to be successful is to get more rebounds
than you get. You get the ball, I get the ball. You get the ball, I get the
ball. So the only way to change that, if I get some offensive rebounds and
don't allow you to get any. So I think that's the most important factor in the
game.  
  
We've got to figure out a way to get some rebounds. And the other thing, I
believe in getting the ball inside so you get fouled. At the end of the game
maybe I'll be playing against a group that's not your five best players
because you've been in foul trouble.  
  
And so those things that I believed in so much I still believe in. But we
might have to change a little bit of it.  
  
Q. One of the guys you talk about that you kept from JVs to rebound was
Aaron Rohlman. He's now a senior. What does he bring to your program?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Tremendous enthusiasm in practice every day. Tremendously
intelligent young man who is fun to be around. He's been a great addition to
our team. And he's pushing the young guys.  
  
He pushed Tony. He pushed Kennedy. He pushed Isaiah. And he's doing it even
more effectively with the young guys.  
  
Q. Many of us have seen the report online, but to hear it from you, how
did Joel hurt his hand? And what was your reaction when you first heard it was
in fact broke?  
COACH WILLIAMS: This was a question I was asked what are you going to say? I
said, I'm going to say he was silly for a little while. He's playing video
games with Theo and one of our managers. He lost and he got up and punched the
door.  
  
My trainer called me on Sunday as I was driving up here to Charlotte in fact
to see my third grandson, he's 25 days old today. And get a call from the
trainer. He tells me what happened.  
  
I said you've got to be kidding me. Got off the phone with him, got on the
phone with Joel and Joel tells me, yeah, Coach, it was just silly. He said, I
remember you telling me about somebody that hit the backboard support and
broke their hand and couldn't play in the tournament.  
  
And I said, yeah, it really was effective. It made you change what you were
doing. So he remembered it but it didn't change it. But you've got to remember
that Joel Berry played in the NCAA Final Four last year with two really bad
ankles, swollen, didn't feel good, discolored.  
  
He couldn't play his regular game. And yet he was extremely successful because
he's such a tough kid. And winning is extremely important to him. He made a
mistake here because winning is very important to him. And he's so competitive
and so silly.  
  
And his greatest characteristic is that drive to win, and sometimes you've got
to peel it back a little bit.  
  
Q. I suspect I know the answer to the first question, what game was Joel
playing, do you know?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. But I don't know any of the games. I don't ever play those
games, so I've got no idea.  
  
Q. Theo said --  
COACH WILLIAMS: I did throw a ping-pong paddle through a wind one time after
losing a ping-pong game, so what can I say to Joel?  
  
Q. Theo said Joel is the pit bull of the team but he said Kenny Williams
is maybe second in line. That moderately surprised me, I guess. What about
Kenny fills that role while Joel is maybe out?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Joel takes it to another level. I really think. I told our
team, I said, Joel is one of our leaders. He's one of our best leaders, but do
not expect him to put his arm around you and put your hands together and sing
Kumbaya. That's not going to happen. If you want somebody to bless you out for
screwing it up, that's Joel.  
  
But Luke and Kenny, Theo, all those guys have some leadership traits. But
Kenny does push the guys. There's no question about that. And he pushes
himself. And I still think there's a pretty big gap between him and Joel,
though.  
  
Q. Cameron Johnson coming over from Pitt, what do you think he can do
for this team right away and why he was a good guy to bring in?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Last year he shot 41, 42 percent from the 3-point line and we
had nobody on our team that did that.  
  
So the ability to shoot the ball. The ability at 6'8" to go get a rebound. The
ability to be a tough matchup for somebody else and a guy who came in this
summer, has worked extremely hard, everybody loves him, worked extremely hard
in practice and I expect he's going to be a very good player for us.  
  
And I was trying to think, I think I had Justin Knox as a fifth-year transfer
and Cam I think is only the second one.  
  
And they contacted us first. And he's the kind of young man that everybody
would enjoy coaching and I'm hopeful that he'll be able to be really
successful for us this year.  
  
Q. What are the challenges of coaching a team following a national
championship?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The challenge -- first of all, you really enjoyed your
offseason a heck of a lot more than the year before when you lost on the
second to last play. And let me make sure even if Kris Jenkins's shot go in it
was going to overtime. I'm not saying we were going to win. They made a great
play. It was a harder summer last year than it was this summer, no question
about that.  
  
Last year I was able to use the feeling they had in the locker room of pain,
agony, all those kind of things to use that as fuel, use that as motivation to
work extremely hard in the offseason. This year I just tried to appeal to
their pride: Let's be the best we possibly can be, work as hard as you
possibly can, let's try to do something that hasn't been done a lot, see if we
can go back to Final Four for the third straight year, see if we can do all
those great things.  
  
But probably more this summer was about the internal individual motivation
than it was about the team.  
  
Q. In sport, you hear defending champions. Do you buy into the fact that
this squad, which is somewhat new, are defending, and is there an obligation
to defend?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, I'll answer that the same way they said redemption.
I didn't see it as redemption because Marcus Paige, Brice Johnson and Joel
James weren't there. So Marcus doesn't feel -- he feels better because we won
but it doesn't erase the pain of what he felt the year before.  
  
We're not defending because it's not the same team playing against the same
teams. But we're the only team that can go out and say we could do this a
second year in a row.  
  
Q. You're talking about Cameron Johnson, and obviously there was a
question of whether he was going to be able to be eligible right away. Would
you prefer there was some sort of clarity in that process, that it's not up to
the team and it's black and white one way or the other?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I've never been involved in making NCAA rules. I don't think
there's any rule that's perfect, because depends on which side of the draw
you're on.  
  
I think it would probably be better if we had more clarity. The fifth-year
rule, we had that with Justin Knox and we benefited. Cam was only in school
three years, he graduated in three years. He did a great job in the classroom.  
  
But transferring in itself is a problem. We have so many transfers. And
people, five or six years, go blame coaches. Now they realize the player is
going to transfer. The coaches don't really have a heck of a lot to do about
it.  
  
You've got the people outside. You've got your own family that are always
talking to you about other things. But there does need to be some clarity in
those rules, particularly that one itself.  
  
Q. What are you going to need from Seventh Woods and Jalek Felton with
Joel out, and do you feel they're ready to step up?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Remains to be seen if they're ready. Yesterday in practice we
gave Seventh a chance and Jalek a chance and Theo a chance. Don't be surprised
if Theo doesn't run out there as a point guard a little bit. He's the best
playmaker on our team.  
  
And whether or not he can do that with the ball in his hands as often as a
point guard remains to be seen but it doesn't make a difference whether or not
they can or not; they have to. That's who we have.  
  
Q. I've asked a couple of coaches this already, but I'll ask you, how
strange is it going to be playing Louisville this year and not seeing Rick
Pitino there on the sidelines?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It will be really strange. What, he's been there 17 years?
That's a long time at any place as a coach. Rick did such a magnificent job.
And you watch Louisville play. It would fit his personality and the great
things he did.  
  
So it will be very much different. And David Padgett, I recruited David when I
was coaching at Kansas. He's such a great young man. He's got some big shoes
to fill and a big job to do. But Rick left a foundation there that I think
David will benefit from and taught him some things that I think David will
benefit from.  
  
Q. Two years ago you borrowed this chair to sit up at the podium. How
are you feeling these days? Are you good to go?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Two years ago was the worst year I've ever had in coaching.  
  
We made to it the National Championship game, but this is my 45th year as a
coach. The first 42 years I guess it was I never sat down on a basketball
court a single time my entire life. The 43rd year I had sit down about every
10 or 15 minutes because my knees were hurting quite a bit. Last year I didn't
have to sit down a single time. It's a lot more fun that way.  
  
And needless to say I'm glad I don't have to have a chair every time I turn
around.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
JOHN SWOFFORD: This is always an exciting time of the year, as we're in the
heart of football and our fall Olympic sports seasons, and basketball is right
around the corner. As with most years, there's no shortage of outstanding and
consistent accomplishments surrounding the success of ACC basketball. I trust
that each of you are aware of the numbers of the collective accomplishments of
our programs. These certainly speak for themselves, and as always, it's good
when we go into a new season with the reigning national champion.  
  
We do have some new faces among our coaching ranks this year, as we welcome NC
State's Kevin Keatts and Louisville's David Padgett. Beyond the current
coaches that are leading our programs, it's always great to see so many
familiar faces that have shaped, enhanced, and positively influenced Atlantic
Coast Conference basketball over the years. Having these individuals remain
connected to the conference I think is a part of what has long been special
about our league. And when you see so many former coaches and players, as we
saw last night, as we continue to see today, a number of whom have gone on for
careers in the communications industry, I think it really personally
accentuates the great history and traditional that we're fortunate to have in
this league, because history and tradition is really about accomplishment, and
first and foremost, it's about people.  
  
I anticipate there will be a number of topics that you will be interested in
specifically, including our progress in the ACC Network. As I indicated in
July, there continues to be significant activity on our 15 campuses, at our
office in Greensboro, and at the ESPN campuses in both Bristol and here in
Charlotte. Since we were last together at the ACC Football Kickoff, many of
you have covered the decision that was made, an announcement that was made in
regard to the physical location of the ACC Network.  
  
I think we ended up in an absolutely perfect place in that regard. In terms of
both daily operations and the quality of the ACC Network productions, this is
an ideal scenario. The Bristol studio will provide our network with access to
the latest innovations and technology available, while many of the network
executives with whom we interact on a daily basis will be here in Charlotte
and therefore easily accessible to our office and our personnel in Greensboro.  
  
From our school's perspective and in looking at our footprint, the dual
locations will provide everyone with convenient access, particularly our
coaches and being able to go to both Bristol and to Charlotte. So the dual
location really makes the most sense for the partnership and for our league.  
  
In terms of distribution, which as you know is critical as we move forward, as
was announced by Disney and ESPN earlier this month, the ACC Network was
included in the agreement between Disney and Altice USA and is an excellent
result for the beginning of the distribution negotiations. Altice USA is the
fourth largest cable system in the country and will deliver the ACC Network to
approximately 4.3 million subscribers across 21 states, and significantly, New
York City. This news combined with the continued efforts by everyone working
towards a successful launch in 2019 translates to terrific progress at this
point in time. We're highly pleased with the current status of where we are
from a network standpoint, and we continue to be right on schedule, if not
slightly ahead of schedule.  
  
For the 2017-18 season, we continue to have excellent coverage of ACC
basketball. This includes our partnership with ESPN, the ACC syndicated
networks through Raycom sports, the Fox regional networks, CBS, as well as ACC
Network Extra for digital live events, and the ACCDN for supplemental coverage
of all things ACC. We value our relationship with each of these outstanding
partners in bringing our basketball to a multitude of ACC fans nationally.  
  
Now, last year at this time, we were in the thick of launching a men's
basketball officiating alliance in conjunction with the Big East, the Atlanta
10, and the colonial Athletic Conferences. Following what we felt was an
extremely successful season of collaboration with those conferences and with
increased efficiencies because of that collaboration, we recently announced
the expansion of this alliance, so this season we will include the Big South,
the Ivy League, the Northeast Conference, and the Patriot League, in addition
to the Big East, A-10 and Colonial.  
  
Bryan Kersey and John Cahill of the Big East Conference did an outstanding job
leading the effort in year one, and we look forward to building on this
success as we move forward.  
  
Another first for us last year was taking our tournament to New York City. The
New York Life ACC tournament was a success from our vantage point by all
measures, from the competition on the court to our hosts at Barclays Center in
Brooklyn, and the exceptional experience for our teams and fans throughout the
city.  
  
The impact of being in the media capital of the world was significant, and
again, there were no shortage of league fans, as we set a record for the
largest attendance at a college basketball event at Barclays Center for our
semifinal games on Friday night.  
  
I'm sure it comes as no surprise that we're looking forward to being back at
Barclays Center in New York in March of 2018, when we conclude the ACC season
at that point.  
  
After three years as our title sponsor for the event, New York Life announced
yesterday that it will continue to support the ACC basketball tournament as
its title sponsor through at least 2019. That's another partnership that we
greatly appreciate, and we look forward to that continued relationship.  
  
Following this year, the ACC tournament will return to Charlotte for the 13th
time, at the Spectrum Center, which is obviously nearby, hosting the 2019
event. We have some of our colleagues here with us today from the Hornets and
the Spectrum Center and look forward to working with them when our event
returns to the state of North Carolina. We're also looking forward to
returning to the Greensboro Coliseum in 2020. Greensboro is the home of the
ACC, as you well know, and has hosted the event 25 times, which is more than
any other city.  
  
Whether it's Tampa, Greensboro, New York, Washington, Atlanta or Charlotte,
we're fortunate to have so many outstanding venues and cities and venues that
are run with such great efficiency that are available to us within our
footprint, and we feel like our rotation of our tournament has been a very
positive thing league wide. Discussions are underway for sites beyond the 2020
tournament. We look forward to building on the significant successes we've
seen in moving the event throughout our footprint. There's no set timetable as
to when we will have final locations to announce, but the process is in gear,
and we'll keep you posted as we work toward a decision on adding to the
current rotation.  
  
Now, although I'm not in position to say much about the on going federal and
NCAA investigations, I do want to reiterate what I've said earlier. First, the
charges filed by the Federal Government are truly disturbing to me, to our
schools, and all those connected to college athletics that are dedicated to
following the rules. There's still much to learn, but if found to be true, the
individuals involved need to be held accountable. This is a serious situation
where college athletics shouldn't be. We need to find what good can come from
this being brought to light with facts, not rumors.  
  
Yes, obviously there are systemic issues that need to be addressed, including
in my mind one and done and more liberal agent rules. But individual
accountability cannot be ignored. So much ultimately comes down to
individuals' integrity and individuals' commitment to playing by the rules,
and there is no lack of understanding about what the rules are, and there's
certainly no lack of resources and commitment on campuses across the country
in educating those involved as to what those rules are.  
  
Today's world is not yesterday's world. We need to recognize that in finding
solutions to improving the system. But integrity is timeless. It was critical
yesterday, it's critical today, it'll be critical in the future. And whatever
the system is, integrity is critical to its success.  
  
We have a system in today's basketball world in our country, which is
different than the basketball systems internationally, but the system we have
today in our country, oddly enough, I compare to a sandwich. The bottom slice
of the bread that's there first and is the first part of the experience of so
many young people, when they're at an age to play high school basketball, and
particularly with the more elite players, the AAU travel teams, which often
are 501(c)3s funded by donations, the shoe companies, and others, for gear,
for travel expenses, for coaches' salaries, and at that point, that's all
legal and within the rules, and quite frankly, provides some incredible
experiences playing the game and traveling and in some instances really
quality coaching that mean a great deal to a lot of young people and expand
their lives tremendously.  
  
And I think we all know that high school basketball, is important as it
continues to be the scholastic part of recruiting in today's world, is not
what it was in yesterday's world. So that's the bottom slice of the family,
and it's an very important slice.  
  
And then you come to the guts of the sandwich, so to speak, and that's where
our great game of college basketball is. That's where the collegiate model is,
and that's where our NCAA rules apply. A lot of our rules didn't apply at the
AAU level. So you're going from one system to our system, and all of a sudden
some of the things that were done before these young guys get into our system,
what was being done then is not appropriate in our system.  
  
So then they're in our system for a year or four or five, and they go on to
the top slice of the bread, of the sandwich, which is pro basketball, the NBA,
the international leagues, the pay for play, the endorsements, the great money
opportunities, and their problems are not necessarily our problems. Our
problems are not necessarily their problems. Same with the first slice with
AAU.  
  
So whether you call it three buckets, a sandwich, whatever you want to call
it, I think college basketball, it's in the middle of a broader spectrum in a
very unique way, unlike any other sport, and consequently, it may need unique
solutions. And a one size fits all, as in one size fits all sports, every rule
fits every sport, that may not work if we're going to try to fix this.  
  
We have to work with those that make up the bottom slice of the sandwich and
those that make up the top slice of the sandwich to improve the system and
make it work for the young people involved in all three tears of what make up
that sandwich, to make it work for the sport of basketball in our country.  
  
We're further unique because intercollegiate sports, therefore obviously
college basketball, what we have in the States doesn't exist anywhere else in
the world, where you're tying education to really high-level competition in
sports. It's not just basketball. It doesn't exist anywhere else. So there are
basketball models internationally, and I think this is one reason you're
seeing more and more international players come into the NBA and be very, very
successful. The systems are very different outside of the States, and I'm not
suggesting duplicating those, but I think we should learn something from them,
because I believe so strongly in the collegiate model.  
  
But for some kids, the collegiate model might not should be a part of this
process, where they're going from high school and AAU to making a living
playing professionally. And I think that's okay.  
  
We have an opportunity, I think, for college basketball and really the entire
system, and I think that's how we have to look at it, an entire system, from
high school and AAU to college ball to the NBA. We've got an opportunity here
because of a problem to try and fix something, and I don't think we can afford
to miss that opportunity.  
  
Now, are the actions alleged by the federal charges, are they rampant? I don't
know. I hope not, and I think not. But this is going to have to play itself
out before we really know. I do believe a lot of people, most people in this
profession are doing things the right way. So while I can't say that I know,
every indication I'm getting from a lot of conversations I've had, eyeball to
eyeball with people that should know, is that it's probably not rampant. But
obviously it's a problem.  
  
Time will tell us.  
  
The NCAA, as you know, has formed a commission, and there's no question it's
comprised of highly-respected individuals, including a number that have ties
to the ACC, Notre Dame president John Jenkins, Georgia Tech president Bud
Peterson, and former Duke standout Grant Hill. And the chair is Condoleezza
Rice, whom we all know, who just finished, just last year, her service on the
College Football Playoff committee. In fact, Condi was our conference point
person through the 2016 season for the playoff committee.  
  
You know, it's good to have someone who's probably capable of running the free
world to head this commission.  
  
I hope this commission will hear from those on the front lines, and I'm very
confident that they will, in considering what truly needs to be done and can
be done to improve the current system. That's a critical point of this
commission's work, I think, is to sit down with some key people that
experience what I don't experience, what members of this commission, as high-
quality as they are as leaders and individuals, don't experience, so that we
all figure out exactly what's going on here and why and try to find the best
path to improve it.  
  
It seems to me that it can't be improved without a better connection among the
three tiers of that sandwich that I described. If there's a problem that's
affecting college basketball as it being alleged, we can't fix that
unilaterally by ourselves. We need some help from the shoe companies. We need
some help in figuring out the whole agent situation. We need some help from
the NBA. That's the kind of connectedness that we need, in my humble opinion,
to get this right, and we've got something really special in this country in
college basketball. It's certainly been special to the Atlantic Coast
Conference, to find solutions to it.  
  
During our ACC fall meetings last week, I discussed with our schools about
everything that you just heard, and we discussed the formation of an ACC task
force that will include the following athletics directors. Didn't want to get
it too big, and we wanted people who we felt would most understand the nuances
of these issues. Craig Littlepage will chair it. I know Carla Williams is
coming in as the new athletic director at the University of Virginia, and we
welcome her. Page has been good enough to be willing to chair this group for
us. Obviously he played and coached before becoming an administrator, highly
respected individual who knows the game and knows the landscape. Martin
Jarmond, the AD at Boston College, played college basketball at the Division I
level at UNC Wilmington; Stan Wilcox, the Florida State athletic director,
played college basketball at Notre Dame; Kevin White will be on that committee
as a member of the NCAA men's basketball committee; and Paul Brazeau will join
us from my staff, who's a member of the men's basketball oversight committee
at the NCAA level and has a world of experience in college coaching and
administrative at the NBA, which is where he was when I hired him.  
  
Our goal will be to see if we can offer solutions to the NCAA commission, or
at least ideas for them to consider and process that may prove helpful to them
as it completes its work. We're visiting with a number of our own coaches one
to one for input, and simply put, our league needs to do our part in finding
solutions to this and offering ideas that can lead us to solutions. And I'm
confident with the leadership of that task force, we will hopefully be able to
do that.  
  
As we go forward, this all includes from our standpoint a continued dialogue
with NBA commissioner and Duke alum Adam Silver. I was pleased to see his
comments surrounding the one and done rule recently and his statement that
it's not working for the college game. I think Adam does have a respect for
the big picture here. I think he does have a respect for college basketball
and what it has meant to the NBA.  
  
I liked his plan to discuss with two more players and put them in leadership
roles that are straight out of our league that we have direct relationships
with. He's asking Michael Jordan to head up some of these discussions with the
ownership group, and he's asking Chris Paul to do the same with the Players'
Union. Those are simply another opportunity for our league to play a
significant role. They will be behind the scenes, and that's all well and
good. But have a significant role in getting to solutions and a better system.  
  
With all that said and before I open it up for questions. I want to reiterate
that it continues to be my belief, and I think that of many, many others, the
more conversations I've had, that one of the best things about college
athletics and college basketball is its people, from our players to the
coaches to the leadership at our schools and the passionate fan bases that
extend really worldwide in our case, there are a lot of great people in not
only this conference but in college athletics as a whole, and I think we have
to be cautious not to allow the actions of some and hopefully a relative few
to undermine the many that have dedicated their careers to operating and
conducting themselves with integrity and within the rules.  
  
So let me stop at that and see if you have any questions.  
  
Q. You spoke about the fall meetings last week. As you're well aware,
there have been several protests against police brutality that have been
repackaged as National Anthem protests or American flag protests. Has the
league as a whole discussed any plan of action as we get ready to tip off the
college basketball season?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: We've discussed the situation but will not be taking league
action in regard to that. Our schools feel that that's a situation that
belongs on their campus with their student-athletes, and our schools will
address that institutionally. We don't have any intention of changing the
protocol of how we do the National Anthem in any of our sports right now.  
  
Q. When you talk about all the different groups you want to work with to
try to come up with solutions to this issue, you're talking about agents, shoe
companies, the NBA, these are all groups that have decided that players have a
market value, and it occurs to me that you guys are the only ones who have
decided that there's a fixed cap on that market value. How is it possible or
why would you have confidence that you could find a solution without changing
the whole framework of college athletics when you guys are the outlier?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, we're the outlier because we're the educational portion
of this or the part of it that's tied to the collegiate model and to
education. You know, I don't know where it'll end up. I don't know how much
can be changed. You know, I'm an optimist by nature. But the point I'm really
trying to make is that I don't think we have a chance to improve this without
some connectedness between these groups, and quite frankly, just about any
degree of connectedness among these groups would be better than where we are
right now.  
  
We haven't, for whatever reason, really sat down and looked at this, and I
think that what has happened with this federal investigation and charges takes
things to a whole 'nother level for some AAU people, for some agents,
certainly for intercollegiate athletics. And I think we have leadership at the
NBA that has -- while these things may not really be their problem except
maybe indirectly, I would hope that there's a sense of concern about the
system, a sense of concern about the game in our country, and I would hope
they would want to play a significant role in helping address the problems. So
I guess that's where your question was really about where does my confidence
come from. I guess that's how I would describe where the confidence comes
from.  
  
Q. We've heard a lot of commissioners come up with some ideas and
suggestions in recent weeks; what are your ideas, whether it's in the area of
one and done or AAU camps or agents or player likenesses? What steps, what
fixes would you like to see happen to clean up college basketball, and also
obviously with Louisville involved in yet a third scandal in recent years, do
you or some of your members regret inviting Louisville into the conference?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I'll take the last one first: No. It was the right decision at
the time. Not pleased with recent turn of events, as we wouldn't be, whether a
member were in the league from 1953. Doesn't matter when they come in. But it
was the right decision at the time and I think can be the right decision over
the long-term.  
  
The solutions, I'm purposely putting out thoughts at this level. I don't have
specific solutions to offer today. We'll be doing that through our task force
within the league. I've got some ideas in terms of -- at least what I think
are ideas before further discussions with people that -- I mentioned people on
the front lines. There's a lot for me to learn in this, and I think the same
would be true of any commissioner, any athletic director. If you're not in the
middle of this, you may not really know enough to offer. So that educational
part of this is very important, as we sit down and talk to coaches and talk
with those that have really been directly involved with it as to what their
thoughts are and are affected by it day in and day out.  
  
You know, I think I've got a pretty good sense of the global sense of it, and
I think getting rid of one and done is better than having it. I think taking a
look at the baseball model is worth doing. I can't tell you I think that's a
solution, but signing out of high school or going to college for three years,
you know, that's something I think to look at. Baseball has more liberal agent
rules.  
  
First question is, well, okay, is that working, and if it is, would it work
with basketball. That would be one of them.  
  
So those are some of my initial thoughts. But Dan had some earlier questions,
some very good points that I tried to make in my comments. You've got these
rules that -- you have rules that don't apply, and then they do apply, and
then they don't apply, and we're in the middle of that. And our mission is
very different in an educational setting. And I don't think we're going to
change that mission, and I wouldn't recommend that we change that mission.  
  
But it's like we've talked about and I've talked about in terms of the whole
autonomy approach in trying to reorganize the NCAA to a point where it can be
more effective, that we've got to modernize some things. I'm not for throwing
out the collegiate model by any stretch of the imagination, but I am for
modernizing it to live in a way -- to live in today's world in a way that
makes sense.  
  
Q. Where does the blame or the responsibility lie in this investigation
and in cleaning it all up? Is it the individuals who have been blamed? Is it
the schools? Is it the conference? Is everybody at fault?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I suspect there's plenty of blame to go around. I guess maybe
it matters to some people where the blame is. I'm more interested in how do we
fix it. It's like I said earlier, systemically there are problems there. It
can be better, I think, I hope. Maybe we've waited too long to really address
that. Maybe we haven't understood some of the things that were going on or
acknowledged them, so maybe we've been slow to first base, so to speak. But we
need to find out, and we need to make up for lost time, if that's the case.
And then you -- as I said earlier, human nature being what it is, and there's
probably greater -- not probably, there's greater pressure to win than there's
ever been, college athletics, pro athletics, pro sports, everybody has
entirely lost patience with winning and the time it takes to win and build a
program, and particularly when a program is going about things in the right
way from an integrity and rules standpoint and an academic standpoint, and yet
the patience still isn't there. I don't have a solution for that. That's
societal.  
  
You know, it's not that hard to sort of look at things and say, well, this is
a problem, this is a problem, this is a problem, this is a problem. Any of us
can do that. The challenge is in, all right, what do we do about this that
makes a difference, that makes a positive difference, and hopefully we'll have
some success with that, and hopefully this commission will have some success
with it.  
  
Q. Jim Boeheim basically implied there was a double standard in the way
Syracuse and North Carolina were treated by the NCAA, applied differently,
were his words. Without asking you to pass judgment or assess either NCAA
decision, do you feel like two league schools received the same treatment,
same equitable treatment from the NCAA?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: That's hard for me to judge. The NCAA structure is such that
I've always found it difficult to compare or to predict. People are always
asking me, what do you think is going to happen, and my response is -- and
it's an honest one, is always, you know, I don't really know because you've
got different people on the committee, you've got different -- even in the
same time frame, it's not always going in front of the same group of people,
it's going in front of different groups of people.  
  
You know, I think what they have done is do the best that they can within the
parameters of the bylaws. So it's really hard to really judge that in terms of
whether they're consistent or not. I think you have to get in the weeds of the
charges that are being considered when you do that.  
  
Q. Do you envision your conference task force focusing just internally,
or would you like them to call Sonny Vaccaro, George Raveling, folks such as
that who have experience in the grass-roots basketball and how the system
evolved and talk to them and get their insight?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: There are no parameters on our task force. I think the
mentality is that you start internally with our own connections and our own
coaches and our own experiences, but there's no reason not to -- there will be
some relationships on our task force where it would be very easy to pick up
the phone and call whomever it might be. You named a few, I named a few, and
that's a good thing. That's a good thing.  
  
You know, I -- this league should care deeply about the situation in front of
us in college basketball because I think it's fair to say this league has been
one of the most prominent ones in college basketball for a long, long, long
time, and consequently shame on us if we're not playing a role in finding
solutions to problems in the game.  
  
Q. Over the last couple weeks Louisville let go of its basketball coach,
let go of its athletic director. In your opinion as a guy who makes tough
calls, was that the right move for the university to move forward and move
past this?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I can't say it's the right or wrong move. I will say they
obviously are addressing the problems at hand very aggressively. They know a
lot more than I know, and there's only so much information that Louisville can
share with me. That's limited, but they have certainly been aggressive in
addressing those situations.  
  
Q. Over the last two, three years, we've seen FBI and NCAA
investigations that involved North Carolina, Louisville, Syracuse, Hall of
Fame coaches, national titles, multiple Final Fours. How are we not to believe
that these problems aren't rampant in this sport if Hall-of-Famers with
national titles are the ones with their programs on probation over the last
two, three years?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, you know, I don't think you jump to that conclusion that
it's rampant based on what was just said. I think obviously there have been
issues there that needed to be addressed by those institutions and by the
NCAA, and I think they have been addressed. I think anybody that's been around
me for any length of time understands that what I detest the most in this
chair is when one of our schools has any type of significant NCAA problem or
not. We've prided ourselves for years and years in this league at having the
fewest of those of any of our colleague conferences, and that's a title that
we want to keep. It's not what we want, and if I have anything to do with it,
it's not what we're going to get used to having. I talked about history and
tradition before; that's a great tradition and a great part of our history.
We've had our problems over the years, but there haven't been a lot of them
relatively speaking, and we don't want a lot of them. And so a continued
reemphasis on a commitment to compliance and the integrity of our programs, I
mean, that hasn't -- that's never stopped, and -- you get back a little bit to
most of these situations, and universities go through tough times in terms of
the damage done to the university name and the university -- I mean, it's kind
of like as a person. The most precious thing you have in a lot of ways is your
good name and your reputation. Same with universities.  
  
I've said many, many times, any time we have a new chancellor or new president
come in the league, I sit down and talk with them, and I say, look, athletics
can be a beautiful thing and a great thing for your university if it's done
right, and when it's not, it can be very ugly, and it can be very damaging.
That's just a fact of life.  
  
But what I'm getting to is the vast majority of the time when a university is
damaged because of NCAA problems, it's a very few number of people that have
caused it. It's not the University of or -- it's not the whole university.
It's, generally speaking, a relative few. And you have to get to the bottom of
why did it happen and how do you correct it. And that's what I want to see
ultimately as commissioner, but the best way to do that is to never be there
in the first place, and that's really what I want, and that's what any of my
colleagues would want, as well.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about future tournament venues. I don't know that
attendance has ever been more than it was in 2001 in the Georgia Dome. What is
the future of the tournament going forward south of Charlotte, and what
tournament venues in particular would you look at?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I don't think we'll be going back to any domes. It's a
different world -- first time we were in the dome in Atlanta it was
unbelievable from an attendance standpoint. Incredible, actually, broke every
conference tournament record ever and hasn't been touched since, including
when we went back there the second time in the dome, and some people that
didn't like the experience in the dome the first time decided not to go back.  
  
And I think our world has changed since then, too. You have to live in the
world that you're currently living in, and that worked very well at that point
in time. We don't think it would again. I think you'll see us staying in
traditional-sized arenas.  
  
You mentioned south of Charlotte, I think. I think Atlanta is a possibility. I
wouldn't rule out Florida at this point. But we'll have to see. We've got some
work to do on that, and obviously our experiences in Washington and New York
were terrific.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Pittsburgh coach Kevin Stallings.  
  
Q. Your takeaways from the first season with the team. And then, second
question would be dealing with the newness on the team of the transfers going
out and the freshmen coming in?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, the takeaways from the first season was that this
league is everything that I expected it to be and more. I've lived a pretty
privileged life, it feels like, in terms of the places that I've worked at.  
  
And I've been in the Big Ten, and I was with Roy in what was the Big Eight,
now the Big 12, and, of course, a long time in the SEC.  
  
The ACC is undoubtedly the most difficult league, most challenging league that
I've ever seen from a college basketball perspective. And so that would be one
takeaway.  
  
Certainly going into our second year it feels like you're number one all over
again because we have so many new players. But interestingly enough that's the
way it's been in my other two previous head coaching jobs.  
  
I had big senior classes in both spots. And then there was turnover and so you
felt like you were going through season number one, like I said, for a second
time.  
  
I'm encouraged about this group that we have. They're hardworking, hard
playing, coachable guys. We'll be short on experience. I don't think we'll be
short on effort and tenacity and the things that you want to see in your team
when they play.  
  
So we understood when we took the job, I understood when I took the job that
year two was going to be kind of a hard year in the respect that I knew there
would be a lot of turnover. I knew we would have to replace a lot.  
  
I didn't know we'd have to replace as much as we did, but I knew that we'd
have to replace a lot. And so as I told someone last season, what was keeping
me up was this season.  
  
But we're almost there. And I am excited about my team. Again, I don't know
what that will mean in terms of wins and losses, but I really like their
approach and I like how they think and how they play.  
  
Q. What do you ask for from team senior leaders in Ryan Luther and
Jonathan Milligan in terms of mentoring the younger kids coming in who haven't
experienced the college basketball game?  
COACH STALLINGS: I haven't had to ask too much, because Milligan and Ryan are
both guys, they do the right things off the court. They do the right things
socially.  
  
Ryan Luther is as an exemplary of a student-athlete as you could possibly find
and possibly coach. He's an excellent student. Again, he's a great person. He
does the right things all the time. And so he's really the only guy on our
team with extensive ACC experience. And so he's going to have to lead really
in every way, not only through his play, but through his words and being vocal
with his teammates on -- and he's done that already. He's already embraced
that and done a terrific job with it, as has Milli.  
  
They're giving us what they can give us. I don't really need anymore from them
than we're getting right now. But they know that their job is, A, to do what
they're supposed to do. But, B, communicate to the guys in the program that
haven't been here before what the expectations are, what we want, what we need
and what the culture is and how we are going to operate in it.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches will look from year to year and say, well,
statistically we need to do this better or this better. Since this is such a
brand new year, are there any stats right now that are resonating that you
need to work on?  
COACH STALLINGS: No, there's nothing from last year that will carry over to
this year in terms of we need to be this or we need to be that, that we
weren't last year.  
  
What we need to be is a team that plays together, that defends like our lives
depend on it, and rebounds the ball with as much tenacity and physicality as
we can, because I don't think at times we'll be the biggest team that I've
ever had. And so we are already anticipating what it's going to be like for
us, the kind of effort that we're going to have to play with both defensively
and on the backboards.  
  
So that's our job right now is to get our teams to defend and rebound the way
that we're going to need to in order to be able to be competitive in this
league.  
  
Q. One game at a time, but with all that said, do you look at the
schedule and think about what you want the season to be?  
COACH STALLINGS: Not really. I'm kind of reminded in a little bit of a
humorous way of something that I heard Lou Holtz say one time. He said, I'm
sleeping like a baby. I'm waking up every two hours and crying.  
  
We're so young, and there will be so many lessons that have to be learned. But
that's part of -- that's just part of the process. That's part of the process
of building a team, building a program.  
  
And I knew when I took it over that after the first year it was going to
require a tremendous amount of effort and work and time.  
  
And that's what we're devoting to it. We're trying to build a program that we
want to have and we know that we're in the very, very first stages of that. I
don't know how long it's going to take. I'm not the most patient guy in the
world, but I would have liked to have had it done yesterday.  
  
But hopefully tomorrow, when we're kind of to that point where we want to be,
is closer than it feels.  
  
Q. You say you're in the beginning stage building that foundation with
this new team. What are you most confident about going in with this young
team?  
COACH STALLINGS: Ironically, the thing that I'm most confident in is how hard
they're going to play. And sometimes that's one of the last things that a
young group really gets their minds wrapped around and something that they
figure out.  
  
But I've recruited for a long, long time and you can think that you recruit
this and then all of a sudden you find out that you've recruited that.  
  
We had signed so many guys, I wasn't sure what we had recruited. But the thing
that I've learned thus far is these guys are going to play really hard. And
now, again, we might injure people in the first row with some of the passes
that we throw.  
  
We might hurt each other in practice because they play very physically. But
they play really, really hard and they really care. So the comfort that I take
every night when I go home, despite -- like, two days ago practice was
awesome, we looked -- we were executing and it looked really good.  
  
Yesterday, not so much. And so I go home with two completely different
feelings after those two practices. But the one thing or the two things that I
take with me is they do play hard and they do care.  
  
And they are coachable. So if I can continue to say that all season long, then
we'll get as close to where we can be as our potential allows for.  
  
Q. You said last year was everything and more about the ACC. Last year
was your 24th year as a head coach. You're always learning stuff about your
student-athletes. Last year, what did you learn about you?  
COACH STALLINGS: That's a really good question. I think what I learned about
me is something that I've known but something that was nice to sort of
relearn, if you will. And that is that I enjoy the competition. I'm addicted
to, almost addicted to the competition and that striving to be the best that I
can be.  
  
And I've said this a few times today, but you're always taught and you're told
as an athlete or whatever that to be the best you want to compete against the
best and that sort of thing. That's sort of how I look at this job for me is
I'm competing against some of the best basketball coaches that college
basketball has ever known. And I'm excited to try to put a program together
and put a program in place to see how I can do, our program can do against
some of the greatest that the sport has ever known.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Quentin Snider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28779)

### [Anas Mahmoud](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33227)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Quentin, what you can say about going into this season, obviously a
little bit differently, some unexpected things happened. What you can say
about navigating with a new acting head coach and not having Coach Pitino
there anymore.  
QUENTIN SNIDER: It's been a lot different, but the main thing is practice is
still very intense. We still have good competitive and stuff, but the thing
about practice has been more relaxed, more laid back. Usually with Coach P we
go two hours and 30 minutes, but with DP, he rests our legs and makes sure
that our legs are fresh.  
  
Q. Has it been difficult, and how difficult has it been to kind of
maintain going into the season with the same mindset?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: It hasn't really been difficult. You know, the main thing is
we've still got a chip on our shoulder with everything that's going on. But
with DP being the head coach, it makes things much more relaxed because he's
doing it for us, not for him. He's helping us out.  
  
Q. You refer to coach as DP. Obviously there's a sense of family. Does
that change things that he moves from an assistant to acting head coach.  
QUENTIN SNIDER: It does, but like I said, I'm still calling him DP. It feels
much more comfortable, but with him being the head coach, he really makes
everything so much easier, much more relaxed.  
  
Q. You've been here for four years now. You've been through a lot of
various trials and tribulations of the program. Does having that experience
going through some of those things kind of help you and give you the
experience to get through this to kind of block stuff out and put your head
down and just play basketball?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: Yeah, most definitely the main things, like I said, I've been
through this twice throughout my four years. One thing that keeps me going is
just the teammates and the game I love, which is basketball, which is how we
keep going with stuff.  
  
Q. What you can say about leadership on the team right now, how you look
to one another. Who are the leaders who are starting to establish themselves
and would you consider yourself to be one of them at this point?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: The leaders I look up to is with Deng Adel and Anas. Anas
keeps everybody calm and collected, even when we have like little scrimmages
in practice when things get bumpy, he's the one that can bring us together,
keep us collected. And with DA he brings that intensity, gives us the motor
and all that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your off-season and what you did to get in
better shape?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: What I did this summer, I hired a track coach to get me much
more faster and to work on my defense with lateral quickness, and that was
just the whole summer I just worked on that. Even though I still worked on my
game, but the main thing was just getting much faster, getting more lateral
quickness.  
  
Q. You mentioned Coach DP keeping you guys relaxed. Is that sort of a
team mantra, taking a step back breathing as the season approaches?  
QUENTIN SNIDER: Most definitely. What Coach DP has, he just keeps us all calm.
He makes things fun. He like jokes with us and stuff. He's a player's coach
and makes everything just much more calm even when things get a little hectic
at times. He's still here for us and all that.  
  
Q. Tell us about your teammate that just left the podium.  
ANAS MAHMOUD: He's a great, great point guard, really fun. He's really
enthusiastic. He runs the team when he's on the floor. He knows what he's
doing. He played basketball when he was really young, and he watched a lot of
basketball, so he has a lot of knowledge for the game.  
  
Q. What can you say about not having Rick Pitino there and navigating
through having a new head coach that you obviously know but having him step
into that role and just what it's been like as far as the environment around
Louisville right now.  
ANAS MAHMOUD: You know, it's a new head coach, but it's a really, really
similar system. We didn't have to do a lot of transitioning basketball system-
wise. Q mentioned that practice is a lot more fun, a lot more relaxed, and
it's competitive, but it's fun, and it comes out as a good sign. Everybody
competes, even the coaches themselves, they compete against one another.  
  
It's just a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. Now that you guys actually have a full coaching staff, how have you
seen practices and the team sort of fall into place, and how difficult was it
with David as the only guy the first couple weeks?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: It was tough for him by himself. He had to monitor defense and
offense, which is tough to do by yourself. You know, now we have a full staff,
but they're also -- they just got here. They have a lot to learn about the
system we're running. It's going to be a transition for them as well as us,
and we're just going to stay the course.  
  
Q. Quentin's comments and your comments, I'm almost taking it like
there's some relief coach Pitino isn't there anymore. Am I misreading that?
You guys keep saying how much more fun and relaxed it is.  
ANAS MAHMOUD: It's not relief, but Coach P had a really strong personality
over everyone, not just players but also coaches, even the University itself.
Playing for him was really nice in games, but practice was not fun. Me myself,
I didn't enjoy practice, and I would rather just play games the whole year.  
  
But David Padgett, he's still young, he played for Coach P, and he knows what
we felt like when Coach P was the coach. He tries all the time to make
practice fun. He's sarcastic in nature, and he did not change one bit.  
  
Q. You mentioned getting familiar with some of the new coaches. Have you
been able to interact a lot with Coach Greg Paulus at all?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: He got here earlier this week -- well, not earlier, but in the
middle of the week. He actually texts me every morning and tells me you're
going to have a great day and enjoy it, and he texted me this morning, and he
said, enjoy your ACC Media Day. He's getting to know all of us. We're also
getting to know him, and he's a great coach and a great human being.  
  
Q. Are you enjoying your Media Day? What do you like about it so far?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: It's a bit early. Woke up a little early today. But it's just
great to be here representing Louisville.  
  
Q. Talk about dealing with some of the off-the-court distractions; how
much does that help you kind of get through this a little bit?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: You know, the biggest thing was we know what we have to do this
time around. We know as soon as practice starts and game starts, everything
will get moving, and at the end of the day that's when we came to Louisville
to do. We came here to play basketball, and as soon as practice started and we
started for getting, started getting distracted from what happens in the media
and what happens out of our control, and I'm hoping when the game starts, as
well, it's going to take a higher step and further step into that process.  
  
Q. The American and NCAA amateurism model is pretty unique. You have a
more global perspective. What's been the reaction when you explain to people
what happened at Louisville that aren't from this country? Have you ever been
able to explain it?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: You know, I try to explain it to my parents. I try to explain it
to my friends. It's just the concept itself of all the NCAA rules and how much
you can violate it and you can even violate it without knowing is the one
thing that people don't understand overseas. There's so many NCAA rules and
there's a lot of them that we don't even know. We try our best to know all of
them. It's just the concept of that many rules is the one thing that they
don't understand very well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner.  
  
Q. Your first trip through the league, what did you learn about yourself
maybe more than anything else?  
COACH PASTNER: First, the league is amazing. There's great people in the
league, from the commissioner all the way on down, and it's just a first-class
league, first-class organization. It's a blessing and I'm lucky, fortunate to
be able to be a head coach in the ACC, which is the best basketball league in
the country.  
  
The league is outstanding with coaches and players and recognizing how hard it
is to win games in this league, it's awfully hard to do, especially on the
road.  
  
So it's a great challenge and a fun opportunity at the same time. And that's
what makes coaching in the ACC special, is the challenge of trying to find
ways to win games against the competition that you're playing against.  
  
Q. Josh Okogie mentioned that your energy is contagious. How do you make
your energy contagious?  
COACH PASTNER: I believe you're either an energy giver or you're an energy
taker. Either you're a Positive Paul or you're a Negative Nelly. I prefer to
stay with the energy givers and try to have as many Positive Pauls around and
stay away from the Negative Nellys or the energy takers.  
  
And I believe in energy. I look at the glass as overflowing. I want our teams
to be full of energy. I believe you have a better chance of success on the
court with energy.  
  
And it's much easier said than done because we all get hit with different
things in our life. But I just think it's important for me. And I've tried to
do it ever since I've been a head coach, try to coach every possession and
practice in the games with the energy that I feel is needed for us to have
success.  
  
Q. Last year coming into year one you guys handled the low expectations
extremely well, to say the least. Coming into year two, with higher
expectations, how have you guys handled that this offseason?  
COACH PASTNER: When I got the job they told me I wasn't going to win a game in
the ACC. My bosses told me that, and they said over my first two years we're
going to win a total of 20 games. So obviously we overachieved last year. We
had a great year, kind of maybe a perfect storm.  
  
I still think we're in a rebuilding process. We could be better this year and
not win as much. I mean, we've got fortunate on some games. We got a little
lucky here and there. And for us to have success this year, we're going to
have to get a little lucky along the way, and we'll have to stay healthy.  
  
We're really relying on some freshmen to have to produce for us and that's not
going to be easy. So our main three guys returning in Josh Okogie, Ben Lammers
and Tadric Jackson, they'll have to be good. And they'll have to remain
healthy. Because we don't have that margin after them, margin for error after
those guys.  
  
But, hey, it is what it is. And once the ball's tipped you've got to try to
find a way to get it done and we'll just keep working and try to keep getting
better.  
  
Q. What do you expect from Tadric Jackson this year? Seems like last
year you didn't know what you would get?  
COACH PASTNER: Tadric last year was kind of high and low. And playing against
Boston College with Coach Christian back there, like Tadric Jackson, we were
fortunate, we got lucky in the game at home versus BC, part of it because
Tadric Jackson was really good the second half. The game before he was not
good and the game after that he wasn't good, but against BC he was really
good.  
  
Other games he hasn't been, he's been up and down. We need him to be
consistently tough. And being consistently tough, being mentally tough,
meaning he's just going to be good night in night out.  
  
And this league is really good. There's a lot of good guards in this league.
I've said it in multiple interviews and I'm not saying it just because Coach
Christian is back there. I think Boston College is going to be really good
this year. They've got as good a guard play as anyone in this league, and the
stuff they ran last year was really, really good.  
  
When you're looking at teams like that or everyone's just in a complete
dogfight in the league trying to find ways to win games. It's hard. It's a
very, very hard league to find ways to win. And being in Conference USA or the
American, I always felt like I had an opportunities to circle some games,
probably get a win here or there.  
  
Just in this league there's nowhere to do that. And you just don't know. Maybe
the upper elite teams, a few of them, can say they're going to win a certain
amount of games, but everyone else, you're in a complete dogfight. And for us
to have a chance to win, Tadric Jackson is going to have to be good for us
every night.  
  
He just can't have on and off. He's been really good this preseason
consistently, offensively, he's been very good offensively. But he's going to
have to do it when the lights go off as well.  
  
Q. With Ben Lammers coming off winning the ACC Defensive Player of the
Year award, what expectations do you have from him in terms of mentoring the
younger players? And how has his play developed over the past three to four
years?  
COACH PASTNER: Ben Lammers doesn't talk a lot. So he's not going to be
mentoring anybody. Because he rarely talks. He's a mechanical engineer.
Everything he does is -- he's very introverted in that way.  
  
Ben Lammers can have a great year this year, doesn't mean he's going to get
ACC Defensive Player of the Year. He could still be really good and not get
that award. But he's got to continue to prove -- the biggest thing about him,
he's got to score better for us around the basket.  
  
He shot the ball well. He can pass it. He can block shots. But he's got to
score better around the basket for us. That's got to be a big thing.  
  
And mentoring, like I said, he doesn't really talk a lot. So his mentoring is
just going to have to be through his play and his ability. And he does such a
nice job in practice, like, he just does what we tell him to do.  
  
He's zero maintenance, really, which is a player at that level to have zero
maintenance, you rarely find that. He's not low maintenance; he's zero
maintenance, zero.  
  
Q. Coaches talk about freshmen hitting a wall along about January or so,
just not being used to the pace. But no offense to other conferences you were
part of, did you find that you were holding up well in your first run through
the league?  
COACH PASTNER: The reason I felt we held up in the first year of the league,
in a decent way, was just because we were really playing six and a half guys
and everyone knew their roles.  
  
And I think it's easier when you play less guys. Now, for me, now maybe this
year I have to play more. But I've always been a better coach when I can play
less guys.  
  
I think playing more guys is hard. And I've been in that position where you
have ten guys and you're trying to find minutes for everybody and it's hard.
But I thought last year just made it so simple because you had about six and a
half guys we were playing, and everyone could just, they knew what they were
doing, and they knew their roles. And it just kept things very simple.  
  
And we were fortunate we stayed healthy, our main guys stayed healthy. And
that's got to be the same thing this year, got to get a little lucky and guys
have to stay healthy, knock on wood.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [David Padgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17012)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Dave Padgett from Louisville.  
  
Q. Your new hire of Greg Paulus, what you can say about why you brought
him in and why he was the right fit for your program?  
COACH PADGETT: Greg obviously has a very well-respected reputation, not only
as a coach but as a player. Played in this league, was very successful in this
league.  
  
He came very highly recommended even before I had permission to start hiring
people. Greg and I have known each other off and on just from being on the
recruiting trail and whatnot.  
  
But he's going to be a great addition for our players. Like I said, he's
played at this level. He's proven himself on the court, that players can
relate to him. And he has experience coaching as well at this level at Ohio
State. So he's a great addition. I was very lucky to get him.  
  
Q. Q and Anas talked this morning about how your style resonates and
went as far as saying he went from coming into the Yum! Center and avoiding
your boss to walking in and seeing your dad. What is it about your style that
resonates so much with these guys?  
COACH PADGETT: I think just having been in their shoes before, obviously not
in these circumstances, but having sat in that locker room, having worn that
uniform. Let's make no mistake, Adonis has never been a fan of practice. He's
more of a gamer. We always kid about that. Just trying to make the best of a
difficult situation for the players.  
  
I think it was a tough week, tough couple of weeks there for a while when all
this started going down. And I just wanted them to focus on basketball, kind
of block out the noise, per se, and just kind of enjoy what they're at the
university to do. That's go to class, be a student-athlete and play
basketball. I just wanted them to enjoy that experience.  
  
Because at the end of the day and at the end of this year, they're not going
to be able to get that season back. I don't want them to have any regrets, and
I want them to enjoy what we do and enjoy the process.  
  
Q. With your program this year, will small victories mean maybe a little
more this year compared to previous seasons?  
COACH PADGETT: I don't think any victory means more or less, to be honest. I
think we're just trying to put ourselves in a position to win as many games as
we can. Our goal so far the first three weeks of practice has been, okay,
today we need to be better than we were yesterday. And when we get to the
games, okay, tonight we need to be better than we were last time out.  
  
So we really are just taking that one-day-at-a-time approach here. Because
like I told our guys, we can't worry about what the future has in store,
because we can't control that.  
  
All we can control is our present and what's in front of us, and if we control
and take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.  
  
Q. A lot of people have talked about just the talent that you have on
this roster. And as you said as you worked through things and kind of get into
the season, where do you see the potential and does any of that change with a
new coaching staff and kind of trying to overcome what's going on?  
COACH PADGETT: Well, there's no doubt we have talent. We have a lot of
returning experienced players. Obviously Anas and Quentin, two senior captains
who have been through a lot. Quentin has basically started every game since he
was midway through his freshman year.  
  
And Deng Adel, our third tri-captain who put his name early in the draft
process last year and took it out because he got good feedback that he
probably needed to stay for one more year. We've got those three.  
  
We've got Ray Spalding, who has been a different player since the end of last
season, and mean that in a positive way. And V.J. King is bound for a breakout
year in my opinion.  
  
Our freshmen, they're very talented. They're young, they're freshmen. They
haven't been through this before but the only way to get them experience is to
have them go through it. So we have the talent. We seem to be a very close-
knit unit, they seem to pull from each other.  
  
It's not a case where older guys are trying to separate themselves from the
younger guys or something because everybody in the locker room knows we need
all 14 players to win it at some point this year. They've done an unbelievable
job of staying together and motivating each other.  
  
And I guess at the end of the day just comes down to me trying to put them in
the right position to do the right things.  
  
But they've just made my job easier because our experienced players know what
to do so I don't have to coach them quite as hard as I will the freshmen. So
it's been a little easier for me in that regard.  
  
Q. Will you make changes stylistically offensively and defensively in
what Coach Pitino ran or will you run essentially the same things?  
COACH PADGETT: A lot will be the same for a couple of reasons. One is our
returning players that's what they're familiar with. All this went down as you
all know three or four days before practice was supposed to start.  
  
I would be crazy to come in and change things like I said because the
returning players were familiar with it. The incoming guys came there to play
that style. And it's been pretty successful for the University of Louisville
over the last 16 years. It's what I played in. It's what I've worked in.  
  
But at the same time I'll do things differently where I see fit. Our practice
plans every day aren't exactly the same as what they used to be. I add
wrinkles here and there, do different things maybe I picked up along the way
playing at a different spot or for a different coach.  
  
A majority of it will be the same. Wrinkles here and there might be a little
different. But at the end of the day effort will always be there and defense
will always be there because that's what our staple is.  
  
Q. Has there been any situation in your life previously where you
encountered a stressful situation and you overcame it that you can apply to
what you're doing with now?  
COACH PADGETT: I actually talked to the team about that early on. My
recruiting situation and the reason I ended up at Louisville, it's kind of
funny, is I was recruited by Coach Williams, Roy Williams out of high school.  
  
I signed my letter of intent when he was at Kansas. I went through my senior
season and at the end of my senior season that spring, after they lost the
national championship game, obviously he goes to North Carolina.  
  
So I'll never forget, I was standing at home, got out of school my mom comes
home and says: Have you seen what's going on. I said, no, what are you talking
about? We turned on the TV. Long story short we know what happens. Well, it's
just the unknown. From the time we knew that Coach Williams left to the time
we knew Coach Self was hired, it's the unknown and it's tough.  
  
That was my biggest concern at first. The players need to be reassured that
something good is going to happen that will help them have a good year.  
  
And I also, my second concern besides them was their parents. I spent a
significant amount of that first week talking to parents, just trying to --
they had a lot of questions for me that I simply didn't have the answers to.  
  
I said, look, I'll keep you guys afloat of everything that's going on as best
I can and keep you in the loop. But we've just got to stay patient here for a
couple of days and see what happens.  
  
Q. Obviously the guys talk about how much more fun and more relaxed the
practice is, referring to you as DP. How do you strike that balance between
them being comfortable and letting their hair down and focusing on basketball
and still being that authority figure and being able to crack the whip and
provide discipline if you need?  
COACH PADGETT: Quentin would probably say that practice is more relaxed
because they don't give me too much of a reason to get on them. Probably
should have brought a couple of freshmen up here; they probably would say a
little different. If they give me a reason to get on them I will. But if they
don't, I won't.  
  
Effort is something I haven't had to coach very much in practice so far this
year, which has been really good. Obviously Xs and Os, sometimes guys not
listening or not -- for example, the biggest thing freshmen struggle with, I
think any coach will tell you this, is listening, especially when a coach is
correcting someone that's not them.  
  
Because you never know if I say something to Lance Thomas and Malik Williams
isn't paying attention and they both play the same position, I don't want to
have to repeat myself twice. It's little things like that that they'll learn.  
  
Again, I just walk into practice and say we need to get better. If I don't
think they're bringing the energy or focus that they need I will let them
know. But if they just do what they're supposed to do, then there's no reason
for me to get on them.  
  
Q. You've been an assistant for the last couple of years, which means
you've stayed seated during the games. What will your personality be like on
the sideline now that you get to stand for a little while?  
COACH PADGETT: I think that's a million-dollar question. I guess we'll find
out on Monday in our first exhibition game. I really don't know. I'm not going
to be someone who is up and down, walking up the sidelines the entire 40
minutes.  
  
I need to sit down once in a while or I'll get tired. But I think it's just
going to be a learning process for me as well. I don't think there's any
denying that. It's no secret I've never been a head coach before.  
  
I told our guys the very first time I met with them, look, there's going to be
a lot of things I do well that you like and a lot of things I don't do well
and make mistakes. We'll all have to learn from. It's just going to be part of
the process. But we've got to take it one day at a time.  
  
Monday, I'm curious to see, see how they react to me on the sidelines, a
different voice. And we just gotta go from there. But so far they've been --
the 14 guys in our locker room have been absolutely incredible in the
transition to make my job easier. So it's been pretty good to get back to
focusing on basketball so far.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Josh Okogie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33312)

### [Ben Lammers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34261)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Josh, just what you can say about building off of some of those key
ACC wins last season, just what you can take away from that.  
JOSH OKOGIE: You know, there were a lot of wins that we got last year and
there were a lot of lessons learned as far as how to prepare for games and how
to properly equip yourself, and I think that we can take those lessons that we
learned and apply them to this year and be able to teach the young guys this
is how we do things and kind of teach them the culture and get more wins this
year.  
  
Q. You exploded onto the scene last year, obviously a selection for All-
ACC freshman. Did you expect to have the type of year that you had?  
JOSH OKOGIE: Going into the season, you know, a lot of -- I didn't really
expect that, but I worked really hard for it day in and day out, just trying
to make myself the best basketball player I can be,ing and it's a credit to my
teammates, always looking out for me, and when I get low, they kind of was my
support and they always had my back, and that was a really big factor in how I
did last year.  
  
Q. You and Josh Pastner came onto the scene at the same time. What did
you guys learn from each other?  
JOSH OKOGIE: I learned definitely about myself and Coach Pastner is a really
good coach and pushing you past your threshold. Right when you think you're
doing enough, he tells you, no, that's not acceptable, I need you to do more,
and he pushed me, and I think we taught him just how energy is contagious and
how energy can just win you games.  
  
Q. Josh, being in such a highly competitive conference, what motivates
you to advance your game and rise above the competition that you have?  
JOSH OKOGIE: Just seeing all the great talent in the ACC, you know how hard
those players are working and you know they're going to come at you even
harder year by year, which means that you've got to make your skills up to par
and you've got to be in the gym just as much as the opponents. That kind of
drive just makes you want to be in the gym and makes you be the best player
you can be.  
  
Q. When you're a new guy, you're looking for leaders, looking for people
you might be able to affix yourself to. Who were the people last year that you
really sidled up to and learned a lot from?  
JOSH OKOGIE: The two guys I would say I learned a lot from was Corey Heyward
and Quinn Stevens. From Corey I learned that winning is more important than
anything else. He would always tell me, look, man, I'm here, this is my fifth
year here, I don't care if I start, I don't care if I do this, I just want to
win, and he just always preached to me how important winning was.  
  
Q is one of the most hardest working guys I've ever been around. Q, even when
he's having a bad day, a good day, he's always in the gym, and what surprised
me the most about him, like I just said, is when he's having a good day, after
most good days guys will go home and just reflect on how good their day was,
but you see Q in the gym working even harder because he wants to have an even
better day than he had, and I think those are two big lessons that I learned,
and it's really important for my growth.  
  
Q. Josh, we see you out on the court, but do you have a pregame ritual
that gets you ready to play?  
JOSH OKOGIE: I love music, so just listening to some of my favorite artists
really helps just get me going, and really just being the first one on the
court, if I'm not the first one, one of the first, just getting my shots up,
shots that I love, getting to my sweet spots and just kind of getting my form
right for the game. I think those two things are the biggest factors.  
  
Q. Who's on your play list?  
JOSH OKOGIE: A lot of Drake. I love Drake. I like Young Thug. I like a lot of
new artists. Anything that gets me going.  
  
Q. Ben, what you can say about Georgia Tech turning the tide; do you
feel like that's happening? Are you coming off of last season feeling like you
are turning the tide, turning that corner for Georgia Tech?  
BEN LAMMERS: Yeah, I definitely feel that way. I think last year we did a
great job by creating a culture, and I think the whole entire school as well
as other people started to follow along with that. So I think we'll build off
of what we did last year and hopefully improve on that.  
  
Q. Speaking of improvement, last year your improvement was incredible.
What was it that you did leading up to last year to do that, and now this past
off-season to come up to this year?  
BEN LAMMERS: I think one of the main differences going from my sophomore to
junior year was just kind of building up an overall conference. Sophomore year
I didn't really get that many shots, didn't do a whole lot besides defense and
rebounds. I think junior year I had to kind of accept that I was going to be
one of the main guys, realize that I maybe have to shoot more often and not be
as hard on myself if I miss a shot. So having that confidence that my
teammates are behind me no matter what I do definitely helped out. And then
going on to this year, I think I've obviously worked on all the general skills
like post play, all that, but then I also tried to extend my range a little
bit out to the three-point line. If a 5 guy can extend out a little farther it
makes it harder for teams to guard, and hopefully that will help the overall
flow of our offense.  
  
Q. Watching you last year, one of the rare things you mentioned the
three-point shot, but you actually had the low post moves, and that's so rare
now that a big man actually has those low post moves. Is that what you pride
yourself on? Is that just an added dimension of your game. Having a three-
point shot, or do you want to be the low post guy?  
BEN LAMMERS: It's definitely -- the three-point is just an added dimension.
I'm a 5 player, I play the low post guy as the distributor, so I see that as
obviously one of my main assets to the team. I still definitely worked on
that, I was just trying to add on a little bit.  
  
Q. It seems like you just got to Georgia Tech. How did it happen that
you got to be so old so fast?  
BEN LAMMERS: I don't know, it went by insanely fast. It's one of those things,
I feel like the older you get, the faster time goes by or something like that.
I remember it felt like yesterday I was just a freshman coming in in the
summer, freaked out because I had never played against anyone that was over
250 and I had to go against a guy that was like 280 and 10 percent body foot.
It's been an interesting ride.  
  
Q. What do you think your biggest takeaway from the college basketball
experience is going to be?  
BEN LAMMERS: I think it's just maybe the importance of competing against the
best you possibly -- the best competition really because no matter what it is,
if it's basketball, football, or if it's in the business sense, going against
the best always makes you a better person or better at what it is that you do.  
  
Q. We asked one of the other schools if there are any comedians on the
team. Any on your team this year?  
BEN LAMMERS: All the guys think they're comedians. I'd say Josh O is probably
one of the biggest ones. Then we've got maybe Sylvester, who is going to be a
redshirt sophomore this past year. He's going to be actually a post player
that has made a lot of improvement. But I'd say either Josh O or Sylvester are
the two biggest comedians.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Luke Maye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33294)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Luke, what you can say about the incoming talent into the team and
what the dynamic of the team has felt like through the summer going into the
season.  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, we got seven freshmen, all kind of new to the program, and
then with Cam Johnson coming from Pitt, it really brings a lot of different
faces and different personalities to the team, but I think Coach does a great
job of kind of assimilating everyone very well and giving us a great kind of
dynamic to begin the season, and with so many new guys, I mean, it's kind of
different than past years. We've had a lot of experience, but coming into this
year, I think we've got great talent and we've got a lot of guys coming back
from two National Championship runs, and really looking forward to making that
a third.  
  
Q. Luke, has the buzz stopped? Has it died down at all for you in your
personal life about the shot from last season?  
LUKE MAYE: I mean, it's died down some. I feel like with the new season right
around the corner, it gives us something to look forward to, and experiencing
that with my teammates, like I said, we have so many new guys, different kind
of feel around the locker room. But we all have the same goals in mind, and we
all want to do it again, so that's the kind of goal right now.  
  
Q. You mentioned Cam Johnson; how does he fit into the team, and coming
over from Pitt, what kind of player do you see?  
LUKE MAYE: I mean, it's been great. He rooms with myself and Kenny, and being
able to grow our relationship off the court has been really cool for myself,
and I speak for Kenny when I say this, he's an unbelievable guy and really
works hard and late nights at the gym, and we're really going to use him a
lot. He's proving himself at Pitt and gave us 26 at home, so we're glad that
he's on our team now.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of experience at the guard position, guys like Theo
and Joel, but how have you guys gelled and especially with the youthful front
court that's been brought into this team?  
LUKE MAYE: Yes, sir, I feel like with so many new guys, it's been a lot of
learning and a lot of coaching, but I think Coach does an unbelievable job of
really making sure everybody gets the plays, gets the defensive assignments,
and he's talked a little bit about maybe going small a little bit and being
able to spread the floor with guys like Theo and Cam who really have a great
opportunity to guard 4 men and are big enough. I think it gives us a different
dynamic that makes us very unique in the league.  
  
Q. Last year you guys told us how the word redemption was such a big
narrative, big motto for the season. Is repeat the new redemption, and is that
as strong of a motivator as redemption was?  
LUKE MAYE: I definitely think guys are still hungry. I mean, like I said, we
have so many new guys. We have a great mix of returners who have been through
it and know kind of what to expect throughout the season and the grind, and
then we have new guys coming in who are hungry, and they saw us get our rings
and they want that for themselves. With such a different perspective across
the team, I think it still gives us a lot of hunger and really aspirations to
do it again.  
  
Q. You mentioned the small ball lineup. Obviously you are the big in
that lineup. How do you feel like you would hold up guarding 5s and just being
in that type of different system with Coach Williams?  
LUKE MAYE: Yes, sir, I think I rebound really well for my size and do a great
job of kind of knowing where to be and using kind of my IQ to my advantage.
But guarding 5s, that means they have to guard myself, as well, and being able
to spread the floor and having an opportunity to maybe play 5 around zero
gives us a little different aspect that not a lot of teams can do. I think
Coach wants to play two bigs, he's always done it, and it's just going to be
interesting to see how the season unfolds. But I'm excited about it.  
  
Q. Coming off of last year and just how essential you were to the team
when it came to the intangibles and things like that, what preparations are
you making this year in your new expected role?  
THEO PINSON: I'm going to continue to just do what I do. As far as just
letting the game come to me. I understand I'm going to have to score the ball
a little bit more this year, but it's just something I have to do. I can
adjust. But I'm going to continue to make plays. That's what I do. That's the
answer.  
  
Q. Speaking of your leadership, moving forward, kind of going off of
that, who you've taken from that has been at North Carolina with you that's no
longer there, some of those guys that you've been able to grab something from
in your time with them.  
THEO PINSON: I mean, it's funny because I went through it with them. Like most
of the guys who went to the Final Four, National Championship game, I was
right there with them. We were both learning on the go. At this point I'm
teaching other guys what I know and the way to be successful and to help this
team win. It's a different experience for me because the past couple years
they've been teaching me the ways and how to get through certain moments,
through adversity. But now I'm getting to teach the younger guys; it's pretty
cool.  
  
Q. You just spoke about teaching and adversity. Some adversity, Joel's
broken hand might lead to some teaching moments for young guys. Do you think
that's coming at a perfect time?  
THEO PINSON: Yeah, of course we don't want Joel to get hurt at all, but at the
same time, you know, you've got to look at the positives. It might be a
blessing in disguise. I remember my sophomore year Marcus got hurt before the
season started, gave me the opportunity to get in those big-time games in
crucial situations and see what I can do and make plays and had Coach trusting
me more to be in the game at the end. You never know. It definitely can help
the young guys come off and get those big-time minutes and have to produce
because we don`t have Joel Berry to throw right back in there to save the day.  
  
Q. Obviously Joel is a huge on-court guy with as good a player as he is,
but his tenacity and mentality he gives to the team, how much will that be
missed, and how do you tell him to stay engaged with stuff?  
THEO PINSON: Yeah, Joel is a senior. You won't have to tell him anything how
to be engaged. As far as setting the tone and intensity, we just have to find
someone else to -- someone else has to step up, and I think that's the job of
me, Luke and Kenny. We've got to find a way to get everybody going. Usually
our point guard gets us going by the way he plays every possession. We just
have to find a way, and somebody else has to step up.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wake Forest coach Danny Manning.  
  
Q. You've got a ton of guards coming back, not so much experience in the
front court. How are you expecting the guys like Bryant Crawford and Mitchell
Wilbekin to be dominant for you?  
COACH MANNING: We'll be a very guard-dominated team just in terms of the
locomotive, engine for us this year. Those guys have to go out and they have
to perform at a high level for us. We feel very confident about our front
court players. We just don't have a lot of guys that have played big minutes
or established themselves.  
  
But we have a lot of guys who are ready to make contributions. And for us,
it's going to be big guy by committee. Whoever has it going well that
particular night will be the guy that hits the court for us.  
  
Q. Between Keyshawn, Mitchell and Bryant, what have you seen as they've
transitioned to captains, as well as what are your expectations of them in
terms of mentoring the younger players?  
COACH MANNING: Well, I think those three guys have got a great taste of what
it's like to play basketball at Wake, what it's like to play basketball in the
ACC. And those three guys are three of the main voices on our team.  
  
I'd even throw Brandon Childress in there as another person who has played
quality minutes his freshman year.  
  
So those four guys are the four guards that are going to be the driving force
for our team. And they've all done a great job showing wonderful leadership
capabilities and qualities, helping our young guys along, helping our guys in
general along of, hey, this is what we need to do; this is how we should do
certain things.  
  
Attention to detail's very important for us. Understanding your role is
important for us. And those guys have done a good job of communicating that to
their teammates, and I look forward to all four of those guys having a really
good years for us.  
  
Q. A lot of that expectation comes from watching these kids mature over
the years. This morning, Mitchell at the podium where you're standing -- very
tall, very solid, very straightforward -- you can tell his progression over
the years. He's matured quite well.  
COACH MANNING: Absolutely. Mitch came to us -- this is year four for us. He's
been there the whole time. And he's really evolved as a young man. He's on
track to graduate.  
  
And basketball-wise he stepped on the court known as a shooter. He's expanded
his game. He's able to play the point for us. He's able to get into the paint
off dribble penetration and make plays.  
  
Defensively he's one of our better perimeter defenders because he's so solid,
so sound defensively. So Mitch has grown a tremendous amount, and we're
looking forward to a very good senior year from him.  
  
Q. As you continue to put the pieces of the puzzle together, there have
been a lot of bodies that have floated in and out, how tough is it for you,
even though you're seasoned as a basketball professional, how tough is it for
you to find the gel, to find the chemistry, to know that every year you're
really dealing with a different group of guys?  
COACH MANNING: For us, we've had some mainstays. We just talked about Mitch,
but we have Bryant Crawford who is coming back, Keyshawn Woods, who is coming
back. Those two guys were our starting back court last year. They provide a
lot of stability for us. And they're able to communicate that with the rest of
our team and help them understand what's expected of them.  
  
And then we have some young players that are talented enough that can come in
and help us out. Chaundee Brown, Melo Eggleston and Olivier Sarr are three
freshmen who will have an opportunity to help us out this year. They bring us
a lot more length, athletic ability and skill set being true freshmen. So we
expect a lot of those guys, but we also understand that they are true
freshmen.  
  
Q. I talked to Keyshawn earlier about North Carolina's nickname being
The Hoop State, and I was curious to get your thoughts on that and then the
talent that comes out of the state and the college programs represented
here.  
COACH MANNING: Well, I can concur with that. I'm okay with that assessment,
that adjective. There is a lot of talent in this area and it's something that
we're all proud of.  
  
There are not too many places where you're going to get four schools in the
same conference, in a major conference and the premier basketball conference
in the country. So there's a lot of attention and energy placed on basketball
in this area, and that's part of the reason that the ACC is so special.  
  
Q. Keyshawn earlier today commended you on bringing in the right kind of
guys in an effort to kind of change the culture of Wake Forest. With this past
season being your best since leaving Tulsa, how pleased are you with the
development of Wake Forest?  
COACH MANNING: I'm happy with the direction that we're going. I'm pleased with
our foundation. We have to continue to bring in the right type of young men
that fit our profile. That's extremely important.  
  
I think our assistant coaches they do a wonderful job of vetting and going
through that process and making sure that we bring guys in that fit who we are
not only as a basketball team but off the court as well. And we're trending in
the right direction.  
  
We have to continue to work and we will do that. But we like the direction
that we're heading right now.  
  
Q. What are you most confident with going into the season? And also what
can you most improve upon and develop throughout the season to finish strong
at the end of the year?  
COACH MANNING: I'm excited about our guards. I think we've got four guards,
like I said, that are experienced, talented, and they're going to be the
leaders of our team this year. For us, we have to replace what John Collins
and Dinos Mitoglou brought to the table, not only with their scoring ability
but their rebounding ability.  
  
So those guys almost got 50 percent of the rebounds for us last year. So we're
going to have to be a team that gang rebounds -- everybody is going to have to
go in there and get their share. And then we're going to have some big guys
that night in and night out provide a presence for us defensively and
offensively.  
  
Q. Coach Williams spoke a moment ago about bringing the energy back to
Cassell Coliseum. That energy is coming back to the Joel it seems like every
year. Are you excited about what the crowds are bringing you these days?  
COACH MANNING: Absolutely. Last year we were top five in the league in
attendance, and that's something that we're very thankful for. The Demon
Deacon Tie Dye nation, they came out and supported us very well.  
  
We've got some changes going on in the coliseum, where with the video board
and the ribbon board and things of that nature. So it will be a completely
different feel. But the support that we get from our faithful is something
that we like, we enjoy. And they spoil us with that attention that they give
us and it's very helpful.  
  
Q. What you learned as a player, how has that transitioned to make you a
better coach after winning a national championship? What do you teach your
players from what you learned as a player yourself?  
COACH MANNING: Well, I've been very fortunate. I've had some wonderful coaches
and had some really good mentors. When it comes down to wanting to sacrifice
for your team and understanding that that's the most important thing is
helping the team be successful.  
  
And I think if you had that mindset everything else falls into place. And
being versatile and being unselfish in your actions and thoughts.  
  
So those are things that we preach to our guys on a daily basis. They believe
in those concepts and it's helped us thus far. It helped us last year, and
it's always going to be a mainstay for us.  
  
Q. We know stats mean a whole lot inside the season. How much do stats
matter when comparing them to previous seasons?  
COACH MANNING: It can give you somewhat of a barometer to a certain extent,
like how many rebounds a game you need to average to fall into a certain
category, a certain spot. So analytics is something that we depend on, that we
use. It's not the end all be all, but it's definitely something that we look
at.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [Braian Angola](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34253)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. What are the expectations for 2017-18?  
TERANCE MANN: Just to get back to the tournament. You know, that's basically
one of our main goals, top goals, top of the list, get back to the tournament.  
  
Q. When you think about leadership, how do you define leader ship as a
basketball player, especially now that you are hitting that upperclassman
status?  
TERANCE MANN: You know, we're just making sure that everybody is on the same
page. Basically as a leader you've got to make sure from the freshmen down to
even the seniors everybody is on the same page on and off the court.  
  
Q. You say that your dream job is going to be a historian. What is it
about Florida State basketball that you like in terms of history, and how do
you hope to write history this year?  
TERANCE MANN: You know, I just like the tradition. Back when Bobby Sura was
there and Charlie Ward and stuff, that stuff was cool to me. I just like
history from when I was younger, you know, growing up, elementary school, my
favorite subject was always history.  
  
Q. Tell me a little bit about Braian Angola.  
TERANCE MANN: Braian is an interesting dude. He can score the ball at all
levels. He's my roommate, so we get along very well. We go way back.  
  
Q. Coach Hamilton obviously a fiery competitor on the floor. We see that
on game day. What type of practice coach is he?  
TERANCE MANN: Coach is a laid-back coach. He likes to chill, watch everything
that's going on. He lets you play during practice. You know, he'll only say
something or get a little rowdy when you turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Your jersey number is jersey No. 14; any particular reason why you
picked that number?  
TERANCE MANN: I picked that number because my mom wore it in college. She
played at Georgetown. She wore 14, so that's always kind of been a family
number.  
  
Q. Your numbers last year were really solid; is there something that you
have tried to improve on during the off-season and somebody in November that
you'll really put a focus on before December and January?  
TERANCE MANN: I've been working on my jump shot a lot. I didn't take too many
threes this year, and I've got to step up, take more shots from the outside to
get us going.  
  
Q. The schedule lays out fairly well for you and I know it's going to be
a one game at a time answer, but do you look down the road at the schedule
just to get an idea of what type of competition you're going to be facing
during the course of the year?  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I mean, you definitely look down the schedule, see what
you've got going on. But once we hit ACC we know what's going to happen. Every
team night in, night out is bringing their all. You never know what's going to
happen, you never know if you're going to win or lose in this league, so we're
used to it.  
  
Q. When we look back at 2017-18, who are the names you think we're going
to be talking about come post-season?  
TERANCE MANN: You know, other than myself and Braian on the team we've got
Phil Cofer I think is going to be a step up this year and be a great addition,
Mfiondu, Kevin Gelly. He's kind of one of our backup centers he's real good,
and Christ Koumadje is a big-time shot blocker, he's 7'4", so he doesn't
tolerate anything in the paint.  
  
Q. Koumadje, does he challenge you when you get to game day?  
TERANCE MANN: Oh, definitely. You drive in there in practice, lay-ups are real
tough. It's hard to finish in there, and then you get in the game, and no one
is his size, so you drive in there and it's way easier.  
  
Q. Tell me about Terance, your teammate.  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Terance is my roommate, so I will be always with him. He's a
great person, great man to be around. He's like in the basketball court always
talking to me, talking to the freshmen or the incoming class. He's always
engaged in basketball, and at home he always tries to keep everything clean,
tries to keep everything the same pace. He's a great person.  
  
Q. You were trying to feel your way through the system last year,
averaging five points per ballgame. What is it about your game you hope to
improve on?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Last year I felt like my game was focused on playing defense
because we had great scorers last year, so I was just trying to feel my way
into the team and the way to play defense, something that I'm really proud of.
I like just playing defense and helping my team in any way that we can so we
can win games.  
  
Q. You had a bevy of different schools that you could have chosen. You
chose Florida State; how come?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: Florida State, why, because I feel like Florida State is not on
the top of the league, on the bottom, it was always in the middle, and Coach
Hamilton, the way he coaches, the way he runs his team, the pace that we play,
when I came on my visit, it was really fun, and I wanted the experience of
being in the best league in the nation, the ACC, and coach Hamilton was an
easy decision for me.  
  
Q. You said that the one superpower you wish you had was teleportation.
Why would you want to teleport?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: So I'm from Colombia, South America, and all my family is
there, my friends, everybody is there. Sometimes I would like to go back home
and visit with my sisters and my mom. That's why.  
  
Q. When you think about the 17-18 season, sitting in March, obviously
you're hoping to be in the tournament, but beyond the tournament, how do you
judge whether or not you're successful this year?  
BRAIAN ANGOLA: I feel like it's going to be the same as last year, the quality
of our depth is going to help a lot. We've got five incoming freshmen, and
they're working really hard to adjust to the system, and I feel like they're
going to help a lot. We hope like with the experience that we have as the
upperclassmen, we can help them get through the season and get back to the
tournament.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Ryan Luther](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27930)

### [Jonathan Milligan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34262)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Ryan, just what you can say about the adversity that you've witnessed
at Pitt and just growing through that adversity and moving forward.  
RYAN LUTHER: Yeah, a lot of new changes here. Of course last year was Coach
Stallings' first year. I ended up getting hurt that year, as well. It didn't
-- the year didn't go as well as we'd planned, but we're excited for this
year. Got a good group of guys.  
  
Q. When you think about the 2017-18 season, how will you know you are
off to a good start?  
RYAN LUTHER: I think that is going to be -- start with preparation these next
couple weeks, you know, being a young team these next couple weeks are going
to be really important, and then really the first couple non-conference games
and a couple tests in our non-conference schedule will kind of let us know
where we're at.  
  
Q. Kind of going off of that, seven freshmen on the team this year, just
what you can say about how the summer has been and what you've taken away from
these guys coming in that obviously are going to have to be effective right
away.  
RYAN LUTHER: Yeah, it's definitely been an adjustment, but the guys got in
here this summer, and we got to work right away. A lot of young guys, but a
lot of guys who may come off more experience than what their age would
suggest. But also a lot of good kids, a lot of hard workers, so I'm pretty
excited because the coaching staff, you know, everyone listens to the coaching
staff really well, and just trying to help age this group as quickly as we
can.  
  
Q. You talked about the change in coaches last year; through that,
learning different personalities, what's your takeaway about adjusting? Was it
hard for you to adjust? Was it hard for the team to adjust?  
RYAN LUTHER: There's always an adjustment period. You know, when a new
coaching staff or a lot of new players come in, a lot of people don't know
what to expect. But I think we've really grown together a lot. We learned a
lot about each other. I think we're coming along pretty well so far.  
  
Q. When you think about the young guys that are on the squad, this time
next year, what names do you think we'll have been talking about in reflection
for 17-18? Who do we need to be looking out for?  
RYAN LUTHER: I think a couple of the younger guys, Marcus Carr. He's shown a
really high level of maturity for just being a freshman point guard. Also
Parker Stewart, the way he's able to shoot the ball, and Jared Wilson-Frame,
Shamiel Stevenson, their play making and athleticism is really something
that's jumped out so far.  
  
Q. You come from an athletic family. Your twin brother plays basketball
at Elon. Obviously there's a lot of football and basketball. How much does
your family during times you're not involved in school, how often do they talk
sports? Are they giving you feedback, criticism, highlights, high fives?  
RYAN LUTHER: A decent amount of feedback and criticism, but yeah, definitely
when we're around each other, we're talking about sports a lot of the time.
Just something that we all bond over and spend most of our time growing up
doing.  
  
Q. Tell us about your teammate Ryan.  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: Ryan, I've watched him grow into a leader, watched him
develop and improve in a bunch of facets of his game. It's been a pleasure to
see him get better.  
  
Q. Jonathan, speaking on the back court for you, some of those incoming
guys, the young guys that are going to be on this team, what you can say about
the talent that you have back there and maybe some specifics on who you're
excited about having back there with you.  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: Jared Wilson-Frame, Marcus Carr, Shamiel, who can play
inside or out with his body. He's very physically imposing. They were sponges.
They're ready to learn. They come to compete every day, and it makes the job
easier.  
  
Q. Why Pitt? Why did you choose that school?  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: To be on the biggest stage, to be in the ACC. I like the
town, I like the people, the coaching staff.  
  
Q. To look at Kevin and just what he's done as a head coach, you said
that he's part of the reason why you chose to go to Pitt. What is it about him
that's so special and what are you taking away from him so far?  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: He's a great offensive mind. As a point guard he sees the
game in a way that can help me learn and mature and to grow. He allows us to
get up and down. He allows people to use the tools that they have, and he's
big on execution. You know, it was a lot to learn there.  
  
Q. Being a senior and being a team leader, having so many freshmen on
the team, what are your expectations as a team leader?  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: Like I said, we have a bunch of young guys, but they're
sponges. My expectations are still to compete and win games and to have
toughness.  
  
Q. You play with a lot of emotion, a lot of smiles on the court
sometimes, a lot of furled brow. How do you know when to release your emotion
and show that joy and when do you know how to buckle down and show that mean-
looking face?  
JONATHAN MILLIGAN: I've been playing my whole life. It's a feel. I enjoy the
game. I enjoy playing the game. I enjoy competing and playing hard. But
there's those moments where you've got to be tough and you've got to be
gritty, and being at University of Pittsburgh, having some toughness is
something that we uphold.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Jim Larranaga with Miami.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about over the past few seasons how you've seen
that influx in recruiting, just what you're getting successfully on the
recruiting trail as you continue to improve this team and go forward.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, recruiting in the ACC basically means you're going to
be competing against NBA-caliber players every single night.  
  
And I have a great assistant coaching staff. They're always out there
searching for players that we think can compete at the highest level.  
  
We've been very, very fortunate since arriving at Miami to find the guys that
we think fit our program, fit our style of play and are also terrific students
who fit the profile for a University of Miami student-athlete.  
  
We've got a good group right now led by Ja'Quan Newton and Bruce Brown, D.J.
Vasiljevic. Guys who have experience and are doing a great job in terms of
leadership with our team. And we're excited about getting the season started.  
  
Q. You spoke the other day in saying that you believed you were coach
number three in the FBI investigation. My question is you said that nothing
wrong had been done. Have you spoken to your athletic director? And how do you
kind of try to prevent that from being a distraction as we enter the season
here?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, first of all, I would just like to say I appreciate and
understand any questions in regard to the issue. But, quite frankly, I'd like
you to just go back to my comments on Monday.  
  
In terms of my conversations with our athletic director, we met with our team
the day that this broke in the news for three minutes. That conversation is
the last conversation we've had with our players. We've been very, very
focused on practicing and getting ready for this season.  
  
Q. You lost a couple of important players, Davon Reed and Kamari Murphy
-- Murphy particularly scored points inside for you. As you mentioned you
return two fine all-court players. Are you going to be more perimeter oriented
this year or do you see someone else scoring inside as Murphy did?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think the two seniors we lost, Davon Reed and Kamari
Murphy, where we're going to miss them the most is at the defensive end of the
floor. Their individual defense, their team defense and their rebounding are
going to be very, very hard to replace because young guys, as talented as I
think our young guys are, they're not used to playing against NBA-caliber
players every single day at the defensive end.  
  
But on the other end of the court I think we have more offensive firepower
than we did last year and maybe as much as we did last year when we had Angel
Rodriguez, Sheldon McLellan and Davon Reed all on the perimeter, with a
Ja'Quan Newton coming off the bench.  
  
Our freshmen and sophomore class is very talented, and I think we're going to
be able to score points. Just don't know if we're going to be able to stop
anybody.  
  
Q. They're going to put together a bunch of task forces and commissions
to study the situation in college basketball here pretty soon. If they come to
you, do you have any ideas? What are they looking for? How are they going to
fix this?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I have no idea. And anything in regard to this issue, I have
to go back and just say I appreciate and understand questions in this regard.
But at this point in time I don't have any answers. I don't know all the
circumstances and feel like it's inappropriate because it's an ongoing
investigation.  
  
Q. You talked about a good crew of young players and they have to be the
right fit. Bruce Brown, his freshman year, academic honor roll, first time he
admitted this morning that he's ever been on an academic honor roll. Talk
about him as a person both on and off the floor.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think many of the guys on our team have very unique
personalities and are so much fun to be around. Bruce Brown is a very high-
energy young man. He's always smiling. He's a tremendous competitor. He loves
playing. He's worked so hard on his game. He's projected at some point in time
to be an NBA first-round pick. And I think he is that.  
  
I think he's talented offensively, defensively, rebounding-wise, and his super
enthusiasm and energy is very evident every day in practice.  
  
Q. With such a dominant back court with Bruce Brown and Ja'Quan Newton,
will it be challenging or easy to fit your new freshman class into the
rotation with Chris Lykes and the other players?  
COACH LARRANAGA: We feel like we've got a lot of talented guards. We'll
starting three of them, two of them coming in off the bench. I don't think it
matters whether you start or come in off the bench, you'll play a major role
for us.  
  
When you look at Ja'Quan Newton, Bruce Brown and DJ Vasiljevic, they're our
veteran players. They have the experience. And we have Chris Lykes and Lonnie
Walker who are just tremendous kids and athletes and terrific basketball
players. So we're going to find plenty of playing time for them as well.  
  
Those five guys are going to be a major part of our offensive attack. But for
us to be successful, they've got to become great defensive players.  
  
Q. Izundu, I believe, went to school here in Charlotte. What do you look
for from him this year? Certainly had some moments last year.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Ebuka Izundu, originally from Nigeria, played at Victory
Christian here in Charlotte. Came in as a freshman. Only weighed 201 pounds.
He couldn't bench even 200 pounds at the time. He's now 230 pounds, benching
over 300 pounds.  
  
He's grown into a man and he's playing like that in practice. We're very, very
confident in him. He's doing a great job. And I think offensively, if he had
the same confidence in himself that I have in him, he'd be an all-league
player. He could be that good.  
  
Q. Are there postmarks during the course of preseason or during the
season in which you want to be here by this time or there by that time?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, we always have short-range and long-range plans. We
have goals that we set for ourselves. One of the things we do is we try to
track our numbers to see if we're improving in the areas that we want to
improve in.  
  
One of the challenges for our players is we have a drill that's named after
Kevin Durant. So the KD three-minute shooting drill. And our goal is for our
guys to score 100 points in three minutes. And most of them can't do it.  
  
D.J. Vasiljevic scored 159 yesterday. That was pretty spectacular. If all our
guys could reach that, we'd be awfully hard to beat.  
  
Q. What was the secret for him hitting 159?  
COACH LARRANAGA: He didn't miss for three solid minutes he missed four shots
in three minutes. I don't know how many -- I was not watching. I was watching
the big guys shoot.  
  
I think if you combined our six big guys they didn't get to 159. That's a
joke. Don't tell them I said that. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mike Krzyzewski with Duke.  
  
Q. What do you like about this team? What's different about it than
previous teams?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's becoming a team. It's not a team yet. Hopefully
starting Friday night when we play our first exhibition game we'll be able to
blend where you can actually use your team. Right now, the guys play against
one another.  
  
I like our attitude. I like the fact that we're not injured. We haven't been
injured, which we were last year.  
  
They want to learn. I think Grayson's done a good job of leading them thus
far. Again, he has to pick that up now that we're going to be getting into
games.  
  
But we're big. We're the youngest team we've had since the early '80s, but
we're very athletic. And just an average shooting team right now. Hopefully
we'll be a great rebounding team.  
  
Q. Just speak on the evolution of Grayson Allen and obviously he has a
big leadership role this year, just what you can say how he's grown throughout
the years for you.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Grayson is a great player and a great kid to coach. I think
the fact that he's been through every part of being on a team -- it's hard to
believe that he had DNPs as a freshman where he did not play.  
  
And going into the NCAA Tournament, his freshman year he was averaging eight
minutes a game. So I think he has the empathy that's needed to know what it is
not to play, to be a part-time player and to be a star.  
  
He also knows what the spotlight does for you when things are going good. And
he knows what the spotlight does for you when they're not going good.  
  
So probably no other kid in college basketball has been through that myriad of
experiences. And they're all in some respects very, very good experiences. And
hopefully what he's learned from all of them will benefit the guys that he has
a chance to lead this year.  
  
Q. Looking at your roster, I'm seeing 6'9 ", two 6'10" and two 6'11" \--
how long has it been since you had a team of this size? Have you ever had a
team with this much size?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It reminds me of Bobby Cremins' most talented teams that
overcame some of the lack of coaching that was evident at Georgia Tech during
that time. He's in the spotlight over there. I couldn't help it.  
  
It's a big team. Like, when we play Friday night, four of our top seven guys
that will be playing will be 6'9" and above. But they don't run like that.
They run like that. And hopefully they'll learn to coordinate their running so
that they can play really well together.  
  
I think we could be a really good defensive team where we protect the basket,
hopefully not give up second shots and able to cover -- be a real wide and
athletic team.  
  
So it's not just up and down height, it's width. I think we can be a wide
team. And hopefully that's what that height will translate into. We always
play fast?  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, they can jump. Very good verticals. I can't quote them
here. I'll bring my analytics guy next time and he'll pop those words out to
you.  
  
Q. First off, when playing Louisville this year, how weird is it going
to be to not see Rick Pitino on the sidelines? And number two, as your team
did recently when you took a moment back for health reasons, how challenging
is it going to be for Louisville to adjust to a different voice this year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I'll tell you when we play Louisville what it is.
You're asking questions that my wife and daughters ask. Like, how are you
going to feel when that happens? And I'd rather wait until it happens and then
tell you how I feel.  
  
Rick is a great friend and been one of the great coaches in the history of our
game. So it's not just Louisville missing him, not just the ACC missing him.
It's college basketball missing one of the greats.  
  
As far as adjustment, the best way to adjust is to have good players. And the
one thing Louisville does have is really good players. And they have, along
with those players, a tremendous tradition of excellence in playing together
and playing hard.  
  
And sometimes in these situations that element, those elements combined with
the fact that it's an unusual situation, can produce really good results. And
that's what I would expect would happen from Louisville.  
  
Q. Grayson, I thought, gave an interesting answer when I asked him about
what type of captain you wanted him to be. He said you acknowledged different
types of leadership but that you want to pull parts of leadership out of him,
too. He's not naturally a vocal guy. Do you need your captain to be that
way?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we need him -- one, I think leaders are different. Not
just think, but I know leaders are different. And the very first way that
Grayson has led the team is through example of hard work, paying attention to
what we want to have done and showing up for every play.  
  
The second way is to impart leadership not just on the court but in the locker
room or at a pause where it's individual or collective leadership.  
  
On the court, the way I see it is I don't want him leading when we're on
offense. I want him hunting his shot and being one of the most, one of the
best offensive weapons in college basketball. That's what I want him to be.  
  
Defensively I want him to talk, and when there's stop action -- free throw,
any type of a break -- to get his guys together either individually or
collectively. And I want them to then hear him when that game is going on.  
  
And so we've talked about that. And we have to practice it because that's not
something that he's done in the past.  
  
Q. We noted with Grayson this morning, he's played with 30 different
teammates since his freshman year. You are part psychologist; you are part
sociologist. How do you get your arms around that many personalities and
learning how to work with a different team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, again, this is my 43rd year as a head coach, 38th at
Duke. You adapt to the changing landscape that college basketball affords you.
And it's afforded our program a really neat landscape.  
  
And the last few years, it means that you're going to have a new team every
year, basically. And if we're doing a good job and there's still one-and-done
-- which may change, hopefully in the near future -- then that's what's going
to take place.  
  
You never tolerate a slippage in values. But I think you have to be a little
bit more tolerant in performance, that there are going to be maybe a few more
mistakes, as long as they're mistakes of commission, and not omission. It's
been a really interesting, good time for us.  
  
Q. I know it's still early, but you have a very highly touted freshman
class. What about them has impressed you the most so far?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The fact that they work hard and they want to learn. It's
interesting to me, in the evolution of the game, how the thing that -- I don't
know if you would think about this or not -- they're not accustomed to
watching themselves on tape. They're accustomed to watching themselves in
mixed tapes with level music and they never miss a shot and they do a whole
bunch of crazy good things.  
  
But watching themselves when they don't have the ball. A phenomenon -- and
they want to do that. They want to learn. A lot of workout people right now
and they work with guys with the ball.  
  
But for the most part, if you play in a 40-minute game, even if you're the
point guard, if you have the ball more than ten minutes, most guys have it
less than two minutes, when you have those individual workouts, you never work
on the things that you're going to do most of the time, which is play without
the ball.  
  
What's your attention? How are you ready? How can you play defense? How do you
move when you do not have it so it's an advantageous position when you do get
it?  
  
So they're kind of intrigued by that. But they've been a good group. And we're
going to keep moving on there and see what happens.  
  
Q. Part of what was alleged in these FBI documents is that AAU coaches,
families of recruits, basically third-party people were seeking money in
exchange for a recruit's commitment to their school. I wonder how does Duke,
in particular, vet recruits or their families, or what is the process that it
takes to make sure that the kids you are recruiting have not participated in
anything that would be unbecoming of Duke?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, first of all, I don't think that's a rampant thing. I
think everyone says it's the tip of the iceberg. Well, maybe -- the iceberg
doesn't mean it's the rest -- that everyone else is doing this.  
  
And there are mistakes that are made. I don't know how a coach could possibly
know the complete history of a family or a kid when they recruit them. But we
hope -- we think we're involved with great kids, great families, and we have
full disclosure, and we trust them.  
  
The element of trust still has to be there. And when you trust, there are
certain times when -- most of the time that trust pays great dividends. But
every once in a while somebody might not tell you everything.  
  
But for us, we've been lucky; they have. And I think for the most part that's
what happens in college basketball.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts.  
  
Q. With Al Freeman transferring in from Baylor, how has he transitioned
from a different program, what role will we have on your team, how well do you
think he will assume that role?  
COACH KEATTS: That's a great question. First of all, I'm excited to have the
opportunity to coach Al Freeman. He's a young man that I've known for a long
time.  
  
He's from right here from Charlotte. He brings a lot to our program,
especially -- a lot of people will think his contribution on the court is
going to be major, but I think just having an older guy in your locker room
certainly helps a lot.  
  
Now, on the basketball court he's a guy who can play either guard position.
The experience that he had at Baylor I thought was great, when you talk about
going to NCAAs and everything else.  
  
But he's a guy that certainly has to have a great year for us to be
successful. Could lead us in scoring.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of guys in the front court that have experience from
last year, whether it's Omer or Malik, or even Lennard. He's had experience
when he's not injured. Do you feel that will be a strength for this team, and
how they help you along with this transition process?  
COACH KEATTS: Absolutely. If I could find the way, and I know I can because
obviously playing in the ACC you can't play those bigs together.  
  
When you talk about Malik and talk about Lennard, who is coming back from
injury, and Omer who we're blessed to have back, surely that's the strength of
our team.  
  
It's a situation where I finally got a guy who I can throw the ball inside and
feel comfortable that he can score the basketball.  
  
Q. If you were not available and none of your assistants were available,
which player would you leave practice in their hands and feel remotely
comfortable?  
COACH KEATTS: I don't know about that one. You know, I haven't had them long
enough to have that.  
  
I take that back. I probably would leave it to Lennard Freeman. Lennard is
becoming a great leader for us.  
  
When I go back and look at NC State games from last year, they missed somebody
with that type of leadership. They missed somebody who can rebound the
basketball.  
  
But he's got a tremendous personality. Guys like him. They listen to him. So
he would probably be the guy that would run practice.  
  
Q. We're talking to your players earlier, and I asked them about some of
the biggest differences from ending last year and to how practice is going
with you. And they said the competition, just everything, every drill is
competitive. So my question for you is, what have you seen out of that
competition in practice, whether it's drills, plays, just between your
players?  
COACH KEATTS: Well, as you guys know, I'm trying to create a competitive
atmosphere. And with these guys, it's accountability. It's effort. It's
competing every day.  
  
But it's been good. Ever since I've taken over the program, and we were
fortunate enough to have 10 practices before we went to Italy, and now I think
we're I would say 16 to 17 practices in before we start playing, these guys
have competed and gave me great effort every day, and I'm proud of them for
that.  
  
But one of the things I want these guys to learn is how to compete. And I
think I'm getting that with these guys.  
  
Q. Last Friday was "Prime Time with the Pack." Just talk about your
first experiences with Wolfpack Nation, seeing them for the first time?  
COACH KEATTS: Unbelievable. What a great experience. It was a great show. We
lost our 3-point shooting contest to the females, if you saw that.  
  
I warn you, the only reason why we lost is because that's where they play
their games at and they practice there all the time. I thought it was a great
atmosphere. I thought it was ran very well. It was first-class.  
  
Our guys certainly had a good time. It was great because I think we were --
around 5,000 people showed up. And when you talk about "Prime Time of the
Pack," just to have that many guys come out, I thought it was good. It was a
dunk contest. It was a great experience.  
  
Q. You're an experienced head coach. You're in a brand new venue. What
are your expectations for the '17/'18 season?  
COACH KEATTS: Well, my expectation is if you come and you watch us play, that
you leave the game saying, man, wow those guys compete. As a head coach, you
know, I'm going to go into this season just like everybody else.  
  
My objective is, if we're playing 35 games, I want to be 35-0. But somehow if
we stub our toe and we lose a couple games, we'll reassess what we're trying
to do or what we're trying to accomplish.  
  
But my biggest thing is, when I was able to go on all the caravans and meet a
lot of NC State fans, the one thing that came back to me is they wanted to see
a product that would compete every night. And that's what I'm looking for.  
  
Q. With the seasoned veterans of Al Freeman and Lennard Freeman, what
expectations do you have from them in terms of mentoring the younger players
coming in?  
COACH KEATTS: Well, first of all, you've got to give me a little credit that I
was able to bring two Freemans to this event.  
  
I have high expectations. When you're a senior and this is your last
opportunity, and not just Al and not just Lennard -- I talk about that with
Sam Hunt. I talk about that with Malik. And even with the younger guys, I
challenge the younger guys to play for the seniors.  
  
One thing I've told those guys is one day you're going to be an upperclassman
and you're going to want some freshman or sophomore to play for you. So,
really, this season should be dedicated to those guys.  
  
Q. Last season Markell had essentially played second banana to Dennis
Smith Jr. Talk about how he's developed in trying to transition to the
starting role now.  
COACH KEATTS: He's getting better. The one thing about Markell is that he's
learning how to compete every day. He's a guy -- and it's a great thing,
because we've got a freshman, Lavar Batts, who is from around here who is
really pushing him every day. You'll either see a lineup with those two guys
in there together.  
  
But for Markell, the great thing about it is because he played beside Dennis,
he can play a 1 or 2. And the same thing with Lavar. But he's coming along. A
little slower than some other guys, but he's getting there.  
  
Q. Coming from UNCW and now at NC State, I talked to -- a couple of your
guys are from North Carolina. And I talked to Al about North Carolina's
reputation as a hoop state. He definitely pointed to the fact that he thinks
this is the number one place for basketball. I just wanted to get your
thoughts on that.  
COACH KEATTS: Oh, absolutely. What else would I say? This is the mecca of
college basketball. And I mean that.  
  
If you look around North Carolina, even as far as recruiting, some good young
players, but certainly there's some talent in this state. Always has been and
always will continue to be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Leonard Hamilton from Florida State.  
  
Q. Just what you could say about the importance last season of divvying
up minutes with the guys you had to build that experience that you could take
into this year knowing that you had that freshman class that's going to need
some tutelage and experience?  
COACH HAMILTON: No doubt we had that in mind last year. We have seven guys
returning who I believe played about 10 minutes or more. So I think we have
enough experience returning.  
  
The guys who came off the bench with -- they call themselves the Boom Squad --
they were instrumental in every game that we played. The challenge for us is
to make sure that the new players that we've added to our team will be just as
helpful and be able to contribute as much as the guys did last year.  
  
I like this team. I feel like we have enough talent. The only challenge, the
biggest challenge we have to overcome is the experience, the lack of
experience.  
  
But our guys are working very hard. Their attitudes are great. They're
extremely competitive. And I feel that they have something to prove, that we
can come back and have another great year like we did last year.  
  
Q. It's been a while since last season. I can't remember exactly, was it
an 11-man rotation or did you use 12? And what were the pluses and minuses of
it? And do you have enough depth to do that again?  
COACH HAMILTON: Most of the time we probably played 11 and 12 players in the
first 10 minutes of just about every game.  
  
We did have a full rotation. We got guys a lot of playing time, a lot of
experience. Jonathan Isaac was sixth pick in the draft. He played 26 minutes.
So the type of system that we utilize we feel like we have to have a very, a
big rotation.  
  
I expect the same thing to be happening this year. I expect to have similar
quality of depth. We win games by committee. Our guys understand who we are
and how we have to play in order to be competitive. And I feel very confident
that we could surprise a lot of people this year.  
  
Q. Your student-athletes this morning seemed very excited for the year.
When you talk about "by committee," do you have leadership by committee, or
does it all fall on the captains every year?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, there's no doubt that sometimes you have more leadership
than others. But I do feel that Terance Mann is probably our most veteran
player along with Phil Cofer, guys that have been around for a while. In order
to be a great leaders you have to have great followers, and we have created a
culture where our guys realize that we have to play a certain way with a
certain attitude, a certain unselfish spirit in order for us to be successful.  
  
And I feel very confident from a talent standpoint I feel we've replaced the
talent, maybe not quite as much as we've got a couple kids playing in the NBA
now, but we have improved in some of our skills -- free throw shooting,
3-point shooting. I think we're committed to being a better defensive team.  
  
I think we'll be overall -- we can improve on the tempo. Even though we
averaged 82 points a game last year, I think we can improve on that.  
  
Our guys are excited. They believe in themselves. They believe in the system
that we're utilizing. I think we're in a nice mental place right now.  
  
Q. Anyone who watched you play last year understands you've got
tremendous defensive ability and skill level in every respect. You did lose a
lot of scoring. Who is going to put the ball in the basket for this team this
year?  
COACH HAMILTON: Last year I think we averaged about 23 free throw attempts a
game. We were 13th in percentage. I think we are much improved free-throw
shooting team.  
  
I didn't think we shot the ball very well from the perimeter last year, at
least from the 3-point line. Our percentage was below average. We're a much
better perimeter shooting team.  
  
I thought defensively we lacked a little bit. We were not quite where we
needed to be. And we've committed ourselves all spring, all summer and into
the fall of making sure that we're getting back to that junkyard dog defense
that we've been accustomed, known for.  
  
I feel we have all the ingredients in place. I love the attitude and energy
and effort our kids are giving now. We feel very confident that we're going to
give a full account of ourselves once the season starts.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you may surprise some people this season. Who will
surprise people or who on your team will come out and surprise people?  
COACH HAMILTON: Once again, I think we'll look different than most teams. We
win games by committee. I think we're a better overall shooting team. I think
our execution will be improved because now we've had this team on a tour this
summer.  
  
I thought we made some progress in those areas. Thank goodness we had our
freshmen with us. We have some veterans that are returning that made up the
quality of the depth of our team last year that now will be our lead guys and
I think they've set the table -- setting the example for the new players that
we do have coming in to have a clear understanding of how we need to play.  
  
Right now, like I said earlier, the biggest challenge we have is just the
overall experience. But I think we've narrowed that gap with the summer play,
the trip that we went on, the 10 extra practices, the three or four extra
games we had a chance to play on our tour.  
  
So hopefully we've made enough progress that once we get into the ACC season
that we'll be ready to perform.  
  
Q. What can you say about the back court with M.J. Walker, what you
think he can be to this team, I know you've seen him through the summer and
he's got to have an opportunity out there but just what you've taken away?  
COACH HAMILTON: No doubt that M.J. is a very talented youngster. We try not to
ever put that level of pressure on incoming freshmen. I do feel the full sum
of all after our parts, we have guys that will take the pressure off of him
and I think our system gives those guys an opportunity to play off the ball
and play to each other.  
  
There's no doubt that he's going to be a major contributor, similar to what
Beasley and Baker and Jonathan Isaac was able to do.  
  
But I think the committee approach works better for us, to win games by
committee has been the style of ball we've played with the last number of
years. And I think that's the kind of system that works best for us.  
  
Q. One team wins the NIT. One team will win the NCAA. So everybody else
pretty much will finish the season with a loss. Do you stir on that final game
of a season as you go into the offseason?  
COACH HAMILTON: We were not a very good perimeter shooting team. And as we got
toward the end of the year, people started backing off us because we were very
athletic, took the ball to the basket very well.  
  
And we had one of those nights where even though we were not a tremendous
shooting team, we didn't shoot the ball well from the perimeter, a team that
normally hits very average shooting percentage, shot extremely well. So those
things happen when you get into the NCAA Tournament. We've learned from that
and we're preparing to not allow that to happen to us again.  
  
Q. Charlotte, your old stomping grounds. Have a chance to reconnect with
family or friends while you're here?  
COACH HAMILTON: Absolutely not. This is kind of a business trip. I got back in
and we get in and get to bed and get up in the morning and start dealing with
the ACC Operation Day.  
  
But, no, I have a lot of fond memories grew up in this area. Grew up an ACC
fan. I remember watching Bones McKinney and all the other guys from many years
ago, Zack Boobas, I watched about every game they played.  
  
Always glued to the TV. I consider it an honor and privilege to have an
opportunity to being the head coach of a team that participates in the ACC.  
  
It means an awful lot to me and our staff. We're excited about it. But coming
back in this area for this particular event is all business. Hopefully I'll
get a chance to get back and get over to Gastonia and hang out with a couple
of old buddies and talk a little bit about Gastonia trends, I guess you might
say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Devon Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30893)

### [Isaiah Wilkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30894)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the environment around the team right
now. You had a bunch of guys transfer out and you have some new faces coming
in. Just what you can say about how you've handled that and establishing a
good culture going forward.  
DEVON HALL: Well, I mean, it's up to us as leaders. Myself and Isaiah, to be
able to make sure we establish a culture for guys who haven't played here.
We're going to try to do as best as possible.  
  
Q. You're a redshirt senior; how did it happen that you got to be so old
so fast?  
DEVON HALL: Isaiah will joke about that all the time. But just learning, man.
I took a redshirt year and tried to grow as much as possible. I've been able
to get better each and every year, so just hopefully I can continue that
process.  
  
Q. What sort of expectations do you have for yourself as well as the
team?  
DEVON HALL: Just try to be as competitive as possible. We're a young, little
bit different team, so we just try to make sure we establish our foundation as
a unit first early in these non-conference games and every day in practice to
where we know going into ACC play who we are and how we have to play.  
  
But like I said before, it's up to older guys like myself and Isaiah and Jack
to be able to lead these younger guys.  
  
Q. Does this season in your opinion feel -- does this team feel
drastically different to you than the typical Virginia? How do you gauge going
into the year what you've got?  
DEVON HALL: I think we have a few more offensive weapons in terms of how we
are going to play and we might be able to get it out a little faster and play
a little bit quicker, but defense is not going to change. You guys know Coach
Bennett well, so you know it's not going to change.  
  
Q. Coaches talk all the time about making sure their young men and women
are going to be good citizens after they leave college. What have you learned
that you'll take away? What traits do you think he's instilled within you?  
DEVON HALL: He does things the right way, and I pride myself in doing the
same. He recruits high-character guys, and it's been an honor and a pleasure
to play and be amongst those people at UVA, and our program, as well.  
  
Q. In interviewing some of the other younger players during Media Day
recently, it was asked of them, of the leaders on the team, who do you go to
for a hug, and they generally talked about Isaiah doing that, but if something
was wrong or maybe they'd made a mistake, maybe you'd be on the lookout for
Devon and the evil eye or something like that; how do you feel about maybe
that role?  
DEVON HALL: I guess I'm big on taking responsibility, so if something is done
wrong, then I'm a guy to make sure you know about it. But Coach Bennett always
talked about being a feared leader. I don't necessarily want to be feared by
my teammates, but I just make sure if something is wrong that I address it.  
  
Q. Just the thoughts on the interior for the team defensively. As Devon
said, it's going to be a lot the same, but what you can say about the front
court this year.  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Well, I feel like we found a groove. I feel like I'm in a
groove now offensively. But you've got guys like Jay Huff come in their first
year who can really stretch the floor and shoot it, and Mamadi and Jack have
been working their moves, as well, so hopefully we can help the guards out a
lot this year.  
  
Q. In dealing with your health issues at the end of last year, how do
you feel about your health going into the season, and is it something that you
need to be concerned with, or is it behind you, you never have to look back?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think it's ever to that point. You know, I try to take
good care of myself. I have some things that are genetic that you can't really
change, so I just try to make sure I'm eating right and taking care of my body
and stuff like that. I played in a scrimmage and I was all right. Trying not
to think about it as much, and just getting ready to play this year.  
  
Q. You mentioned in the media notes that part of the reason you chose
Virginia is because it felt like family. You come from a big family yourself;
what is it about this basketball family that's made its mark on you?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Well, I feel like I just remember my visit and being embraced
by those guys who didn't really know me, and I just felt like this is a place
where I could come and be happy. Devon talked a lot about guys' character, and
I feel like that's 100 percent true. Coach Bennett does a great job of doing
that, and I know when I graduate I'm always welcome back. You just can't take
anything like that for granted.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what sort of offensive moves have you been working on to
complement your baseline jump shot and your foul line moves?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Just really post moves, playing more off 2, hop steps and
things like that, just to kind of get a groove. I feel like I have solid
footwork and I can use that to my advantage because I'm undersized down there.
So try to create something and try not to get my shot blocked.  
  
Q. Every team has a comedian. Who's the comedian for you guys?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Nigel Johnson. First year here, big-time comedian. But no,
there's a lot of guys, like I've got a top-5 comedy guys.  
  
Q. Do you want to roll those off?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: So Nigel, Kyle, De`Andre, Ty, and Devon. That's my five.  
  
Q. So Devon is five and not one?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: No, there was no order, trust me.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Donte Grantham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34256)

### [Gabe DeVoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34257)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the team this season, some of the words
that would best describe Clemson this year in your opinion.  
DONTE GRANTHAM: Young and athletic. I think we've got a lot of young guys who
are really excited to play, guys like me and Gabe who's excited to lead the
team. Just a lot of young guys with young, athletic, fast, and we're just all
excited for the season this year.  
  
Q. Big question from all the Clemson fans: Is this the year you guys can
finally make it back to the NCAA?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: I think so. I think this is the year we can make it back to
the NCAA because, one, we've got great leaders in myself and Gabe, and number
two, we've got everybody on the team is all in and dialed into our team. So
guys are really working hard, and we're taking it day by day, getting better
at the things we need to get better at. Guys are really inspired and really
ready for the season to come up.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't replace an athlete like Jaron Blossomgame with
point production, but there are leadership qualities that sort of go away.
Where is the leadership emerging from this year, and what's that chemistry
like?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: The leadership is coming from guys like me and Gabe DeVoe,
Shelton Mitchell. There's a lot of guys on the team who's really experienced,
Mark Donnal, and just having that voice. Jaron had a big voice for us, but me
and Gabe, we were very experienced players, played in a lot of games in the
ACC and a lot of places in the ACC. Just helping the young guys really develop
and stay inspired, staying positive for the whole team.  
  
Q. Tough season last year; what is your outlook on the conference as a
whole? What are you expecting from conference play?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: I think we've got a nice conference this year, especially the
home schedule. We've got guys like Duke, Louisville, North Carolina, Florida
State. We've got a lot of good games at home. We're excited about our home
schedule, and our fans are excited about our home schedule. I think that's why
guys are like really hyped and amped up for the season.  
  
Q. Describe Gabe DeVoe as a teammate; what does he bring to the
situation?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: Gabe brings an unbelievable energy to our team. No matter if
we have practice at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. his energy to our team is unbelievable.
He has a voice, he's experienced, he makes a lot of shots, and he's just a
voice that we really need for our team to be good this year.  
  
Q. You guys lost so many close games last season; how do you address
that this year, and did that tax you guys last year, really weigh on you
heavily, and how are you going to overcome that?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: Yeah, it weighed on us heavy last year. We knew that we were
in every game last year. We were a great team, just had to figure out a way to
close games. But I think this year for us it's just staying dialed in
defensively and just because we have a lead doesn't mean we can ease up. So I
think that's going to be a big thing for me and Gabe especially being
experienced players and experiencing that last year. Just really gotten the
team through adversity and really just dialing in defensively.  
  
Q. Earlier this year you explored the possibility of going towards the
next level; what did you learn from that experience, and what did they tell
you, hey, these are areas of your game that they feel like they needed you to
work on?  
DONTE GRANTHAM: I learned that, honestly, I learned that I'm a really good
player. I can compete with the best players in the nation. I had workouts with
the best players in the nation. Honestly, they just want to see me -- what I
showed in the workouts, produced this year and the season. Last year I didn't
have my best year numbers-wise, so they really wanted me to produce my numbers
on paper as I was doing in the workouts because I did really well.  
  
Q. Gabe, tell us about Donte.  
GABE DEVOE: He's been with me the past four years, roommate for three. Great
energy guy for the team, great voice. He's been a starter for four years, so a
lot of experience. This year I'm excited for him. I think he'll have a great
year shooting the ball, and rebounding-wise, I think he'll be a big key for
us.  
  
Q. When your teammate was asked about who you are to the team, he said
the voice. You just said the voice back. What you can say about you both being
vocal on the team this year and the leadership in this room between the two of
you as you get set for the season?  
GABE DEVOE: Especially with this team having basically six new guys, 24
freshmen and a couple transfers, just helping them out in any way I can,
whether it's pulling them aside in practice, bringing them in the gym and get
extra shots for them, just being an example for them to follow.  
  
Q. Is this the year that Clemson can get back to the NCAA tournament?  
GABE DEVOE: I believe so. I think we have a lot of good pieces. I think
between Eli in the post and Donte and our guard play, I think we'll have a
great year.  
  
Q. Your trip to Spain obviously is well-documented. You all went through
what some might call a real-life situation. How did that change you? How did
it also change the team? Did it affect the chemistry of the team?  
GABE DEVOE: Yeah, for me, at the time I didn't realize how big the situation
was, but it made me just be grateful for what we do have here. I think it
brought the team closer. The whole Spain trip in general, just being able to
spend time with the guys all day every day and being able to play games. I
think it helped with the chemistry and gave us some good things to look
forward to. I mean, good film to watch going into the season.  
  
Q. What did you like most about Spain?  
GABE DEVOE: Probably being able to try new foods. That was pretty cool. I
didn't like all of them.  
  
Q. Which one did you like?  
GABE DEVOE: The Paella. That was pretty cool.  
  
Q. Which one did you not like?  
GABE DEVOE: Probably some of the seafood that we tried.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Lennard Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34263)

### [Allerik Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34264)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Just what you can say about growing through adversity and going
through your injury and what you can say you're excited about this year and
what you learned from that time.  
LENNARD FREEMAN: I learned a lot. Sitting out every game was like a film
session, and you see the spots that people should have done or the moves that
people should have done like in the moment. Like you're watching other teams
play and you're watching us place like, oh, he should have did that there. It
was just a great experience, and that time off just made me more hungry since
I wasn't able to work out or help my team out, put me in a different mindset
that this is my last one, and I've got to go twice as hard for the time I was
hurt.  
  
Q. You hopefully are going to have a good final season; what is it that
you have to do to leave the program in good shape for this time next year?  
LENNARD FREEMAN: We just want to work hard. I think just leave it all on the
table. This is my last year. I don't want to leave with any regrets. I want to
go out by going to the tournament, and that's my goal, just getting right back
to the tournament. I've been there the first two years, and my second two we
haven't been there. Me experiencing that, that's the only goal, just don't
leave anything, knowing that this is my last go-around. I don't want to be
sitting here next year saying I wish I could have done this or I wish I could
have done that. I want to leave it all out there.  
  
Q. Coach was fairly open that he said he knows you guys will not be
picked high here, and you guys will use that directly as a motivating factor.
Has he explained that to you and made it clear that you guys need to prove
yourself?  
LENNARD FREEMAN: Oh, yeah. I mean, we kind of figured that. We have a lot of
new pieces, new coaches, so I'm not surprised that we're not picked high.
Hopefully y'all pick us last, honestly, so we can only go up from there. No
disrespect, but we work too hard for us to actually like -- not say care, but
I'm a competitor, so if you sit here and tell me that I'm going to be 15 or 14
out of 15 teams, then it's just going to put me in a different mindset and
make me go twice as hard and make me want to prove everyone wrong, so go ahead
and pick us last, please.  
  
Q. What are you guys learning from Coach, and what do you think he's
learning from you?  
LENNARD FREEMAN: I feel like I can only speak for myself. I feel like that I'm
learning to compete and everything. Coach makes you become a competitor. Every
drill we do, it's a winner and a loser, so he makes you bring it every day. I
think that's the main thing with Coach -- he doesn't accept anything other
than 110 percent. Every day in practice, you know you're going to go hard,
you're going to give it your all, and I think that's what I learned from him,
just how to be an extremely hard competitor. I'm not really sure what he
learned from us yet. It's hard to get in Coach Keatts` head.  
  
Q. We're all getting to learn him a little bit. What have you learned
about this teammate?  
LENNARD FREEMAN: Al Freeman, Al is different. On the court, he's a great
player. He's a great scorer. I've been seeing him -- we graduated in high
school, same class, so I've been seeing him for a while. He's a great scorer,
a great player, and he's one of the leaders on the team off the court. He's
like the granddad of the team. He makes sure he does the right thing and he
leads by example. He's just a great leader, great player overall.  
  
Q. Tell us about Lennard. Is he just as hold?  
ALLERIK FREEMAN: Man, on the court, I would say Lennard is probably the heart
and soul of the team. He wins in practice, every 50/50 battle, every loose
ball, every rebound. He'll throw illegal screens in there every now and then.
But no, I would say off the court, he's definitely somebody that leads by
example, too. I probably am the oldest on the team, but I'd definitely say he
acts the oldest.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about your adversity and everything that you
went through in your career, coming to NC State and the decision to be at NC
State.  
ALLERIK FREEMAN: You know, I think it was -- I really have enjoyed my time
here at NC State. I just tried to take advantage of every single day. I think
it was a great choice and opportunity here for what the situation presents and
what I wanted as a player. I think I really feel like I can really help the
team, and I feel like the team really gives me an opportunity to show what I
couldn't show in the past few seasons.  
  
I think that we all go through adversity in life, one way or one time or
another, and some people go through adversity early on. Some people go through
adversity later, and it's just about how you respond to it. We're all going to
be faced with it, and just you go through things in life that prepare you.  
  
What I've been through in the past, what I've been through in my journey, it's
not the last time I'm going to go through adversity, and everybody in this
room, we're going to go through adversity multiple times in our life. What the
lessons that we learned are going to help us prepare for the future, future
challenges that we have and the success that we have and the failures that we
have.  
  
Q. If Coach yells out Freeman in practice, who most likely is he angry
at or happy with?  
ALLERIK FREEMAN: It's probably angry with me and happy with him.  
  
Q. When you think about the total of the season, we've asked other
student-athletes this, to be successful this year, do you have to raise a
piece of hardware? Do you have to have a trophy?  
ALLERIK FREEMAN: I think it depends on who you ask. For every team, there's
different goals. For us -- I can't speak for anybody else, but for our team,
at the end of the year, we want to have a piece of hardware. We want to have
the trophy for everything that we competed in, the ACC tournament, the NCAA
tournament, when we go to the Bahamas. We're not going into any game, any
tournament, any situation, any scrimmage, any exhibition, anything, not
planning on winning not planning on being victorious.  
  
And I think if anybody is, then I think you're doing the wrong thing right now
with your life. I think anything anybody does, you should always want to be
the best, you should always want to come in first. That's one thing that we
learned, sometimes the hard way, every single day in practice. It's -- winning
is -- it becomes who you are and everything that you do. That's how we try to
approach everything that we get faced with.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the decision in returning to Notre Dame
and being a part of the team this year and just what you can say about
secondly the weapons that you have on the team this year.  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, after a lot of discussion with Coach and my family, it
was just the right decision for me to come back for my senior year. I knew I
had a lot of development on both sides of the floor that I needed to work on.
But obviously getting the degree from Notre Dame is what I went to Notre Dame
for, and I knew I was a four-year guy. Speaking on the team, I think we're
hungry and we're motivated to do a lot of damage this year, and I think we
have a lot of guys ready to step into new roles and to show their talents on
the floor.  
  
Q. Where do you get your fire from?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think that's just something my parents raised me, playing
every game like it's your last, going out there, playing hard, and just
playing with that edge and that swagger. We have a great coaching staff and a
great coach like Mike Brey who gives you a lot of confidence. I think it's
just easy for you to play out there.  
  
Q. Obviously you're a senior, you're a team leader. You've played with a
bunch of great student-athletes. Is there one particular teammate that you
uphold the qualities from leadership from that you will try to model this
year?  
BONZIE COLSON: I wouldn't say there's one teammate. I think my freshman year
Jerrion Grant and Pat Carlton did a great job of leading, and they taught me a
lot of things, just how to trust your teammates, and they told me when I
wasn't playing, take my practices as my games, and I did that, and then
everything just kind of worked out from there.  
  
But yeah, leaders that give you a lot of confidence, and you have a great
relationship on and off the court, I think it makes it easy to play.  
  
Q. What is it about Mike Brey that makes him such a special coach in
your opinion to command the best out of you guys?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I think he's just a smooth, cool, confident guy who just
gives a lot of his players the confidence in the world, and I think when you
have a guy like that who comes into practice and jokes around and laughs with
you and just wants to learn about you more than just basketball, I think it's
easy to play, and he's one of those guys you can talk to about anything. He's
always there for you, and he's one of the loosest coaches in America.  
  
Q. Preseason ranking of No. 14 coming into the season; what does that
mean to you, and what are your expectations for the season?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think that's a blessing for us as a team. You know, something
that we're staying humble, we're staying hungry in practice, every day we're
battling, and it's something for us to build on. It's great thing to be
acknowledged like that. You can talk about it, but you've got to be able to go
out there and play and show the country who we are on both sides of the floor.  
  
Q. Tell us about Matt Farrell.  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, Matt Farrell, that's one of my best friends. We've roomed
together since freshman year, and he has -- he plays with that fire, that edge
every game. He's really coming into his own. He had a great opportunity, and
when coach Brey called his name, he stepped in and played his tail off. We
have a guy who can do both. He's playing first point guard but also can score.
It's a lot of opportunities for him. I'm excited to play with him my last
senior year, and go Irish.  
  
Q. Having the third most assists in the ACC last season, just what you
can say about the weapons you have this year to dish the ball out to on the
team.  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think Rex Pflueger and T.J. Gibbs are going to step into
new roles, and I think they're excited about it. But that gives me an
opportunity to be off the ball a little bit, gives a chance for those guys to
get in the lane and make plays. So I'm just excited to play with them. Like I
said, they've got new roles, and I'm really excited for them.  
  
Q. We've all watched the emotional career that you've had, obviously
family in the military, and you coming off the bench and bringing your lunch
pail with you just about every game, what's the experience been like for
you?  
MATT FARRELL: It's been a blessing for me. Since freshman year, if you were to
tell me I would be here right now, I don't know if I would have believed it.
But it's just about the culture we have at Notre Dame, the environment that we
have, the coaching staff, the players. That all makes a difference, and I
think that really helped me to just keep my confidence up and to just keep
doing what I do and just keep believing in the system, and that's what you've
got to do day by day.  
  
Q. What you can say about Bonzie and the weapon that he has been; some
consider him one of the best if not the best forward out there. What does he
do for this team and how is it playing with him?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, people ask me about Bonzie all the time, and I never
really have an answer. He just does what he does. He's a really special
player, even better person. But like you said, he has that fire, and he gets
us going. He's a workhorse on the boards, and he just plays to win. He wants
to win, and that gets our whole team going.  
  
Q. Do you have to win a trophy this year in order to call the season a
success?  
MATT FARRELL: You know, we'd like to, obviously, but our main goal is to get
better every day. We're fortunate enough to have a couple good runs the last
couple years, but like I said, we're going to take it day by day and just try
to win as many games as we can.  
  
Q. We know coach Brey is a game coach because we see it all the time.
What type of practice coach is he?  
MATT FARRELL: Like Bonzie mentioned, he's joking around. He's like one of the
boys. He's just a great person to be around. He's always having fun, and like
Bonzie said, he's always cool, he's always calm, and I think that instills a
lot of confidence in us. He's just a great coach and even better person to be
around.  
  
Q. You talk about taking it day-to-day, but it's a grind. Talk about
pacing yourself throughout the year and just kind of taking it from game to
game.  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, absolutely. We're not perfect, we're going to take some
hits throughout the year. We have a really tough non-conference schedule, and
then we've got a tough ACC schedule. It is a grind. It's something that we
embrace, something our program has embraced since I've been here. Like I said,
we're going to take punches, but we're going to take it day by day. We've got
to get better every day, and we've got to make strides every day.  
  
Q. You obviously learned about the grind as a freshman; what now as a
senior can you teach the younger kids about pace and keeping your head about
you throughout a long season?  
MATT FARRELL: Just to trust the process and trust the culture that we have
here. You've got to believe in the coaching staff. You've got to believe in

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Jim Christian from Boston College.  
  
Q. Ky Bowman earlier today was talking about how nice it was for him to
have a teammate from North Carolina in Jerome Robinson. They were really like
big brother/little brother. Did you see a lot of that, did you see that
pairing and maybe how that translated to a good relationship on the floor?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Not as much early. But I think as the year went on, I think
they kind of gained such a great respect for each other from a work-ethic
standpoint, from an appreciation for what the other guy was doing and what
they're trying to kind of build together.  
  
They knew that they were going to be the foundation of what we did. So that
naturally kind of bonds people together. And it helps when they're both really
good kids. They both come from good families. It's a natural.  
  
Q. Teddy Hawkins, top recruit for you this year coming in from Illinois
State, what's he going to bring to your program?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: He's bringing so many things that I didn't even know he could
bring. I could look at statistics and see what he shot from three or how many
points a game, how many rebounds he averaged, but that doesn't even tell the
story of what he's done.  
  
He's the best communicator on our team. He brings a toughness to our team, and
really an appreciation for winning. He came from a program, they won 27 games.
He was a pivotal part of that and we haven't had anything like that. So he's
been invaluable to us.  
  
Q. What about Nik Popovic's development this year, he's going to be a
big front court player for you. What are you expecting?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Really it's all about consistency with him. He had some
really good moments for a freshman post player. It's not easy to play the post
in this league as a freshman, but -- just because of the physicality of the
other guys in this league. He did a really good job, I think, in spurts. Now
he's ready, I think, to hopefully take that next step and be consistent.  
  
He's a really good post scorer, but his perimeter game is getting better. And
he's just a guy that again is a sophomore in this league. I think he's really
getting ready to take the next step.  
  
Q. Even Coach Pastner was saying, was talking about how dominant your
back court will be this upcoming season. Could you just talk about how they
will be dominant and the expectations you have from them?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: The expectations are for them to improve as players, not so
much scoring-wise, they're both good scorers, but now to let the other parts
of their game flourish and develop and get other guys around them to improve
their numbers.  
  
So even if the points go down and assists go up, well, good decisions go up,
that's how you become a better player. They've now -- we know they can score
and it's going to be nice they can score the ball extremely well. But now the
evaluation comes down to decisions during the course of the game and what you
did when the game was in the balance.  
  
That's the next step for any player, especially a young player, especially a
guy like Ky is a sophomore, Jerome is a junior. Now when that game could be
won, you're in part of that. And you did all the different things to help us
win, and that's how you grow and that's how your name becomes even bigger than
it is for these two guys now.  
  
Q. Do you have any expectations on what color hair Ky Bowman will have
during the season?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I can't -- I know it's not going to be black, dark black,
like he did for the Virginia game because he was awful, and I never want to
see it again.  
  
So I'm assuming he's going to go back to the traditional red. But he's yellow
now. So whatever he decides to do. His hair -- I don't care what color it is,
just play.  
  
Q. Devil's advocate question. Stats for last year's team were stats
associated with that year's team. How much do comparison of stats matter from
one year to the next?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Numbers might change. But the impactfulness of the numbers,
there's numbers and there's impactful numbers. And there are certain things
that don't go on a stat sheet that impact winning.  
  
And I think this year's team has gained a better appreciation for that. We
spent a lot of time talking about what it does take to win, what's a winning
play, and moments where we had opportunities to make those plays and didn't do
it.  
  
And now we've got to take the next step. And it's not just straight numbers.
It's not points or rebounds or assists. It's what do you do in crunch time?
What were you doing during that time on both ends of the floor? How vocal were
you? How vocal was our team?  
  
And I think, again, our trip in the summer, the best thing that came out of it
was that the nights we played, they went to dinner as a group all by
themselves. Coaches, no coaches, no managers, nobody else, just them talk
about what they want to do this season. Talk about what they did in this game.  
  
And that's what you have to do. They have to take ownership now. They have the
ability. We have the talent. They know we're going to give them a plan, and
now they've got to take ownership. That's the next step.  
  
Q. Over the left shoulder there's an image of you.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Much skinnier.  
  
Q. I don't know if folks at home can see it but what was the secret?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Diet. The strength coach says you cannot out-train a bad
diet. All the exercise guys out there, you cannot train a bad diet. I changed
my diet a little bit, and a wife, relentless on making me eat the right way.
She wasn't with me on this trip so I have to apologize to her.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brad Brownell from Clemson.  
  
Q. The makeup of the team this season, just what you can say, maybe some
of those words that best describe what you have. And then, secondly, the two
gentlemen you brought with you today, what their leadership means to the
team.  
COACH BROWNELL: I like our team a lot. We were fortunate we took a trip to
Spain this summer. So we got 10 practices in 10 days over there. And so got a
little chance to work with them.  
  
I think we have a completely different team from the standpoint of we have
five experienced players that are back that are truly guys that have played
and played well at this level. But then we also have seven new guys or seven
guys, per se, that really don't have much Clemson experience at all.  
  
So blending that group, I think is the real challenge. As you mentioned, I
think, a lot of that responsibility is going to fall to myself and then also
our seniors, Gabe DeVoe and Donte Grantham, two guys that I think are very
good players.  
  
They're guys that I think have bided their time very well and played a little
bit in the shadow of Jaron Blossomgame, who was certainly an outstanding
player in our program these past couple of years. But I think they're going to
have opportunities to get more opportunities to score, to put themselves in
positions off of set plays and actions where they have opportunities to make
more plays. I look forward to those guys having bigger seasons.  
  
Q. I know defensively you would like things to be better, number-wise,
than last year, and I know maybe at times the way you played offensively led
to maybe some of the defensive issues. But what have been some of the things
you've worked on with the team so far to get back to what you want to have
defensively?  
COACH BROWNELL: I'm excited to try -- we're going to try to go back to playing
a little bit more in the full court defensively. I think we haven't quite had
as much depth in certain years to do that.  
  
We have to be a little cautious with it, because Shelton Mitchell is a guy who
has battled knee injuries and again had a surgery this offseason. So we've got
to be careful with how we deal with him. And we were concerned about that last
year.  
  
But I think with the freshmen that we've added in A.J. Oliver and Clyde Trapp,
combine that with Marcquise Reed who is experienced in our system and knows
how we want to do things defensively. Even Gabe DeVoe, I think we can pressure
the ball more in the full court and be difficult to play against.  
  
I'm hoping our depth will create problems for teams and we can wear some teams
down a little bit defensively, much like we did in certain years here with
K.J. and my first year as the coach at Clemson when we had good depth.  
  
So I think those are some things we've really worked on, and we've begun to
start to look at a little bit of the zone. Not sure where that will go yet.  
  
But we're trying to look at a couple things to be better defensively. We know
that's where we took the step back. Offensively we were a very efficient team.
We didn't turn the ball over much.  
  
Our assist/turnover numbers were really, really good. We averaged 75 points a
game. We had three guys who shoot over 40 percent. So offensively we were a
pretty good team last year.  
  
Defensively we took a step back. And so we feel like we've got to address that
to make another step this year.  
  
Q. You mentioned Blossomgame. You also don't have Djitte anymore -- gave
you some really good rim protection, defensive rebounding. Do you have someone
else who can do that? Or are you simply a smaller, quicker team?  
COACH BROWNELL: We have two guys inside that we hope will emerge defensively.
I don't know that either one of them are tremendous shot blockers. I think
Elijah Thomas can block some shots. He has long arms. He's 6'9". He's been in
our system now for six months. He was a transfer that came late. So he really
kind of joined our team in the middle of December last year and that probably
wasn't the easiest thing for him.  
  
I think he's really grown up in our system. He's learned how to coexist with
his head coach and understand my expectations a little bit better and is
working harder to meet those expectations and responsibilities.  
  
And because of that, I see that he really is improving. And I'm excited by his
development. I think he has a chance to take a big step forward. And we also
added Mark Donnal, a fifth year transfer from Michigan.  
  
Mark will never be thought of as a shot blocker, but he is a physical
defender. He's an experienced player that's been in a lot of big games. And
he's a great complement to Elijah because you have two guys that are big,
strong, physical. Mark can actually play away from the basket, shoot some 3s
on offense. Elijah is primarily a low post scorer.  
  
Q. You guys lost an incredible series of close games last year. What was
the culprit there and what can you put in place this year to kind of avoid
that same trap?  
COACH BROWNELL: It was a myriad of things. And we did win some at the
beginning of the year and that's what was frustrating. We won one against
Nebraska. We won one at South Carolina and won one in a comeback game against
Wake.  
  
When you're winning the close games, all of a sudden we were 12-2 at one point
in the season and we looked like we were well on our way to the tournament.
Then we hit ACC play and lost a couple of games. We missed a free throw begins
North Carolina.  
  
Syracuse we had a defensive error and gave up a 3 at the buzzer. Offensively
in the Florida State game at home, we had two bad possessions and that
probably cost us.  
  
It wasn't just one thing. That's what the issue was. It wasn't one thing that
we could just fix. I will say that I think our defense not being as good as it
needed to be at times helped create more close games because we didn't defend
as well for the full 40 minutes. We allowed teams to get into rhythm and
score.  
  
We found ourselves in difficult situations that could end up in losses. We're
trying to address that. We have an offensive-minded group. I think we're still
fairly offensive-minded with the way our lineup is made up of and what guys
identity and how they see themselves.  
  
And I've got to do a better job of making sure they understand we're going to
have to win with some defense. And that's one of the reasons why we're
increasing our pickup point, pressuring more, going to play more players.
We're going to challenge older players that if you don't defend you're going
to sit.  
  
And we're going to give young guys opportunities to get out there and try to
wear teams down with some legs and do some different things because we do feel
like we have depth.  
  
We think if we do those things, hopefully that eliminates some of the close
games that we're in. But then if we get in those situations, a lot of times
it's about players making plays.  
  
You've got to have guys step up. And we had a couple of games where we did
have guys make big plays. And in those situations we oftentimes didn't get a
stop.  
  
And then we had a couple times when we didn't execute offensively and that was
the culprit. So it wasn't just one thing.  
  
Q. How will you kind of handle and manage Shelton's knee early on in the
season? Will you maybe limit his minutes?  
COACH BROWNELL: That's a good question. We've been managing some of his
practice time right now.  
  
I think the challenge for it is some days he feels really good. And then other
days, for whatever reason, it's just sore. And I think that's -- I don't know
that that's ever going to go away.  
  
I don't know that we can predict it. So we are going to try to manage minutes
sometime. It stiffens up sometimes when he comes out or when we stop practice
and shoot free throws for five minutes or he takes an extended period out.  
  
It's hard for him to get going and get back into a practice when his knee
stiffens up. So we've got to figure out some things there.  
  
I'm sure we'll have a bike on the side and try to keep him riding a bike while
we take him out. And we've got to figure out ways to play without him, whether
that's Donte Grantham playing some minutes at the point, Marcquise Reed, Gabe
DeVoe, you know, Clyde Trapp.  
  
We'll have back-up guys doing different things, and we may tweak our offense a
little bit to take less pressure off that position when he's not in the game.  
  
Q. You've called David Skara by far your best defensive player. What is
it that makes him so tough defensively?  
COACH BROWNELL: First of all, he has great length at 6'7", 210 pounds. He has
great feet as well. Laterally he moves better than anybody on our team.  
  
He just slides well laterally, it's athleticism. But he has a willing, a want
to that most guys on our team most guys in general see themselves as offensive
players, and they had a good game if they made three 3s and scored 15 points.  
  
David doesn't think that way. He knows he can have a good game by making one
basket, getting four rebounds and stopping the best player. And he's willing
to do that. He's a guy who will sacrifice.  
  
He's a guy who has the athleticism and he takes great pride in defending and
obviously in his sit-out year last year he had an opportunity to try to guard
Jaron Blossomgame every day. I think that helped him. He took that challenge
very seriously.  
  
I think he's a guy defensively is our best player in his versatility and in
terms of being able to guard perimeter players and undersized 4 occasionally.
A point guard. I think that will really help this team.  
  
Q. You talk about how guys think that they're offensive guys. How
difficult is it to recruit defense and is it becoming harder and harder as
guys see the NBA stars and things like that?  
COACH BROWNELL: A little bit. But there are guys out there. And we're
recruiting some right now. But there's no question that guys more times than
not everybody wants to know how they do offensively and score baskets and this
that and the other. I think as a coach you've got to make a conscientious
decision to recruit guys who are competitors who are team guys and who want to
do what's best for the team.  
  
We, in my first few years here, we were kind of a defensive-minded team and we
were very close and we had some very good defensive players, Landry Nnoko,
K.J. McDaniels, Rod Hall. But we were a little offensively challenged. We
weren't great shooters. We lost games but we would lose close, but it would be
low-scoring and it would be physical and it would be tough.  
  
And we got to a point where we had some good teams when K.J. got a little bit
better.  
  
But then we made a conscientious decision we've got to add more points, guys
that can score, more fire power. We brought in the three transfers -- Shelton
Mitchell, Marcquise Reed and Elijah Thomas. And they're all offensive players.
They can score. And they proved it last year and they'll prove it again this
year.  
  
But you have to be able to do both. Best teams win in the high 80s but they
can also win it grind-it-out style against Tony Bennett, 58-55. And we have to
figure out how to be that kind of team.  
  
And in order to do that you've got to have a little bit of both. So our
recruiting is getting better. Our new facility is helping us tremendously.
Can't say that enough. In the last 18 months, we've had more better players on
campus and the reaction we're getting is such that we feel like we're going to
make strides that way.  
  
And as we do that, if we can blend that group that I talked about, I think we
have a chance to take another step as a program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Bruce Brown, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34254)

### [Ja`Quan Newton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34255)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Bruce, just speak on your expanded role this season and what you can
say about trying to establish some leadership this year, as well.  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: I think we have a lot of young guys this year. As you know,
we are a young team, so me stepping up and trying to be that leader, me and
Ja'Quan, to the freshmen, I've tagged them along a little bit, trying to get
them to know certain situations, read certain things, so helping them would be
a big help.  
  
Q. You talk about a young team; what have y'all done in a way from
basketball to kind of help with chemistry?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: We do a lot together. We hang out together. We actually went
paintballing together just to have a little team-oriented thing. But we're
always in the locker room joking, laughing, having a good time.  
  
Q. Last year you kind of burst onto the scene, explosive, everything.
What was it this off-season that you were working on to improve for next
year?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: I worked on a lot of ball handling and shooting off the
dribble. I think I've heard I was like one of the worst college basketball
players to shoot off the dribble, so I needed to work on that a lot. But yeah,
it was just time to jump and shoot and shooting off the dribble, shooting off
the catch. Yeah.  
  
Q. Do you know who it was that told you you were one of the worst?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: No, I don't remember. But when I found out, I was like,
that's terrible. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. You talked about trying to bring the freshmen along. You're not too
far removed from being a freshman yourself. What did you learn last year that
helps out the young guys?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: I learned you've got to work hard, and there's no nights
off. I remember we were real inconsistent last year, and we had like a real
big game. We won by a lot, and the next game we fell off. So I'm trying to
tell them to be more consistent and take every day like it's your last day and
play really hard each day.  
  
Q. Obviously your freshman year you were very successful in the
classroom, as well. How did you respond or how did your mother respond when
she found out that you made the academic honor roll?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: She loved it. She actually cried when she called me because
I've never been on honor roll before. So just her calling me and crying meant
so much to me that I kind of wanted to tear up a little bit, but I couldn't. I
couldn't do that.  
  
Q. You had the chance to watch Ja'Quan Newton play last year a lot. What
did you learn from him?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: I learned to be poised. Ja'Quan is a really good player, is
a really good finisher, and he makes his teammates better, and that's what
I've learned from him.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about your head coach, what he's done for you
to get the most out of you and what he does to bring this team together
because Miami is that team that a lot of people have expectations of this
year, so just what you can say about that.  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: Coach L is a great guy, man. I love him. He expects the best
out of you. Even if you're having an off day, he'll bring it to the side, talk
to you, ask what's wrong, ask how your family's doing, and on the court he'll
play you play your game. If he thinks you're not attacking, he'll call you to
the side, like I don't know what you're doing. Go. He's making me the player I
am today to be honest with you.  
  
Q. In high school you played football, played basketball, you played JV
soccer. Of those sports are there any skills that have translated for you to
basketball?  
BRUCE BROWN, JR.: I think I got good foot skills from playing soccer. I
actually miss playing JV soccer, but I think the footwork helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. Talk about your teammate Bruce; how did he do as a sophomore?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: As a freshman, Bruce came in as any other freshman, he wasn't
really ready or wasn't really supposed to be the guy that's supposed to be
right now, but growing up, he grew like very quick that any other freshman can
grow. He came out there and he played hard every night, and then later on down
the line when he played against Duke and North Carolina, he showed his true
talent. He came out and he burst into the scene very fast.  
  
Q. Where would you say you've improved the most in your game going into
the season?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: This time I focus a lot on my jump shot. My jump shot has
gotten very good. It's gotten better. I've been in the gym a lot and I've been
proving it in practice. Also I watched a lot of film over the season off, just
a lot of film of other point guards. I want to make my players around my
better, and I want to get my team involved more.  
  
Q. Who are some of the point guards that you watched to try to kind of
emulate and learn from?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: I watched guys like Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Dennis Schroder.
That's the main point guards I watched because I think my game focuses a lot
on the things they do, I think I do in my game, so they're the three point
guards I watched the most.  
  
Q. Your dad, Joe, was the 1998 Division II National Player of the Year
when he was at Central Oklahoma. Tell us about the family dynamics; how does
he rub off on you? What were the skills that you learned growing up? All of
that package to make the basketball player you are today. Comment on that.  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Type of skills, honestly, my dad was a good finisher around
the rim. He had different type of lay-ups, and I think that's where I get it
from, especially my lay-up package and the things I do in the paint, flow of
the game and things like that. I think I get a lot from my dad. He's a very
good finisher around the rim. He was Player of the Year in Division II, and I
think I get my talent from him, and it runs in the family.  
  
Q. What type of feedback does he give you throughout the year?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Of course, some games he texts me after the game or he might
text me the next morning or things like that. He's not the type of dad that
compliment me too much or things like that. He'll say good win, he'll say the
things I did good, say I things I did bad, and then we'll go from there.  
  
Q. Obviously Miami basketball wants to get back to where it really was a
couple of years ago. Do you have to be successful this year by way of a
trophy? Can you be successful without winning a trophy?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Yeah, I think we can be successful without winning a trophy.
Especially if you go farther in the tournament. My sophomore year we went to
the Sweet 16. We didn't win the trophy, but everybody remembers that season. I
think this is going to be a season to remember. We're very talented. We have a
lot of guys. We have a lot of freshmen that's very good and upperclassmen
that's very good, sophomores, and I think it's going to be a season to
remember, and the goal is to win the trophy. Even if we don't, I think we're
still -- this is still going to be a season to remember.  
  
Q. What makes Miami so dangerous in your opinion this year?  
JA'QUAN NEWTON: Just the guard play. First I thought it was just me and Bruce
alone. We're very dangerous, we're very versatile. He'll be running the point
guard, I'll be running the point guard, we'll be switching on and off. And
then other guys around us, our teammates are very good. We've got DJ, he's a
very, very deep threat to us, probably one of the best shooters I've ever
seen. We've got Anthony Lawrence and Sam Waardenburg, stretch 4 man; we`ve got
Dewan Huell and Ebuka Izundu inside. We`ve got Chris Lykes, and we've got
Lonnie Walker, so we're just so deep, and we're just so talented, and I think
we put it together defensively, I think we're going to have a very special
year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mike Brey has joined us with Notre Dame.  
  
Q. The evolution of Bonzie Colson, just what you can say he's been for
you over the years, and how happy you were to hear that he was coming right
back again?  
COACH BREY: Well, I think he's just a great story in college basketball. You
know, he's a throw back, a guy that's gotten better every year. He's added
something to his game each year.  
  
Now he's stepping out and stretching the floor and shooting the 3-point shot.
But you know what was so great about him is how he handled after the season
and whether he was going to put his name in.  
  
It was like a five-minute discussion. He knew he was a four-year guy. His
family knew he was a four-year guy. I thought maybe he would at least want to
go up to Chicago and test the waters. Coach, not into it.  
  
I think he wanted to come back with his teammates. They have a chance to do
some things as a team, and he has a chance to do some things individually that
very few have done at Notre Dame.  
  
So he's a joy to be around. It's been neat to watch him grow. He's still a
humble, chip-on-the-shoulder guy, even though he's earned a lot of respect in
college hoops.  
  
Q. As you alluded, you have used Bonzie in different ways each year,
according to where you needed him. Maybe talk about some of the different
skills he's developed over the years. And have you ever had a player like
him?  
COACH BREY: No, he's really unique. I've never had anybody like him. I thought
last year as a junior his passing kind of came out of nowhere in the fall. He
was finding people and kicking it out to our shooters.  
  
By the end of the season, he was confidently hitting 3-point shots, stepping
out and shooting the basketball. He's become a better defender, a more solid
defender.  
  
He's not gambling as much. What makes him great, and I go back to the phrase
with him: When he's in junkyard dog mode, in that lane, getting loose balls,
putting it up over taller guys, that's when he's at his best.  
  
And I try to tell him, you know, now he's not the underdog anymore. He was not
a top 100 recruit. He wasn't supposed -- now he's a first-team All-American.
He could be Player of the Year. I said you still have to remember to be that
junkyard dog and find ways to put that chip on your shoulder.  
  
But he's always been coachable. He's been a pleasure to work with for four
years.  
  
Q. Rex Pflueger his expanded role, can you talk about that?  
COACH BREY: He's going to need to do more. He's a great defender for us. We
still need him to still do that. He can guard 1 through 4 with his energy. But
he'll need to score a little bit more for us now.  
  
And he's not going to be that stretch-the-floor, shoot-a-lot-of-3-point-shots
guy. He's an adequate 3-point shooter, percentages are good. But he drives it.
He drives it. He gets fouled. He drives it and makes plays. He gets out in
transition.  
  
But he has even become -- we've got a very good senior class of leaders --
he's become a real voice with this team as a junior and a very key guy for us.
He's made a lot of big plays starting with his freshman year tipping one in to
get us to the next round in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. We followed Matt Farrell, obviously his emotional connections with
his brother in the military and just coming out of almost nowhere to be that
lunch pail kid for you. What does he mean now that he is in his senior year?  
COACH BREY: He, like Bonz, is another great story, was one of those guys we
signed late. Didn't play much as a freshman and sophomore but always had a
great toughness about him.  
  
He's gotten to be more vocal. I've always been on him about talking more. Now,
as a senior ball handler, he does that. But one thing he's going to have to do
more for us is hunt his shot. He's our best outside shooter in our starting
lineup.  
  
So after he gives it up, when it comes back around to him, he's got to really
look for his shot. But there's a great toughness and edge about him that we
kind of all felt, and it kind of became contagious with us early in the
season.  
  
He helped us win the Legends Classic with just great plays against
Northwestern. And we came out of that and he set a tone for us. But he and
Bonz are roommates and rightfully so because they're running this thing this
year.  
  
Q. Pat Connaughton was a special player for you. I think you referred to
him as stretch 4. You had great center play a couple years ago, needed Bonzie
inside some. Do you feel like you've got people developing in the center spot?
Or will Bonzie need to be a stretch 5?  
COACH BREY: We never want to say we don't use the stretch 5 lineup because it
was darned good to us down the stretch last year.  
  
One of the things I'm excited about is the confidence level of Martin Geben
our senior guy, up and down a little bit last year. But he was starting center
on Lithuania's gold medal World University Games team. They beat Purdue for
the gold medal over there. He played great and he came back with great
confidence.  
  
I told my staff, when he got back, I said his confidence has never been higher
and darn if I'm going to do anything to screw that up right now.  
  
So I think he can score for us. He's always been a physical presence and a
good passer and screener, but I think he can score for us and are going to
need him to do that.  
  
Q. You talk about Bonzie and Matt being in charge; it's their show. They
mentioned this morning that they like your practice style. They like your
easy-going nature. How do you know when to get tough, the fatherly, be a
coach, and when are you their best friend?  
COACH BREY: I think that's something you're always trying to get a feel for. I
have an old group. I only have one true freshman on the practice floor. This
group is so motivated to do so well and get back to an ACC championship again
and get back to an Elite Eight.  
  
I think my biggest job, they're so driven, I'm going to have to keep them
loose a little bit. Bonzie Colson, the first four days of practice couldn't
make a shot because he was feeling the weight of the world and I'm the guy now
and I've got to lead.  
  
And I'm going to have to have to get these guys to enjoy it because both of
them want it really bad. And if you look at our schedule, especially our road
schedule, we're going to take some punches.  
  
So it's a neat senior class, though, that kind of runs this thing when I'm not
around. And I'm never worried about intensity or getting -- they always
compete. They work hard. They want it. Sometimes they want it too bad. We've
got to get them to smile every now and then.  
  
Q. If you keep them balanced, who keeps you balanced?  
COACH BREY: That's a great point. I got a good, young staff to do that for me.
I mean, there's a good young staff that keeps me loose. Rod Balanis has been
with me, my right-hand man, played for Coach Cremins at Georgia Tech. He's
been with me all 18 years. He knows when to come in and tell me to shut up or
smile or get over it. And I appreciate that.  
  
Q. Do you have to have a piece of hardware to call it a successful
season?  
COACH BREY: I would think our guys, yeah, you know it would be something I
think this group would really shoot for. We've played in two of the last three
championship games, and if Bonzie doesn't twist that ankle maybe we have two
trophies in our first four years, which we probably would have been kicked out
of the league if we won it twice in our first four years.  
  
They've tasted getting in the championship game and tasted getting deep in the
tournament. And they're really driven and I think we would be disappointed if
we didn't have something to put in that trophy case.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Ky Bowman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34260)

### [Jerome Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32044)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. What you can say about maybe some positives you're taking away from
last season, some of the things to build upon. Are there some of those areas
you can look back to to help you move forward?  
KY BOWMAN: The things that I've been working on this year, just going into my
sophomore year, is understanding the leadership role is going to be a big
point for me, and also knowing like that defense is where we needed to improve
last year, just from the losses that we had in the stretches of games. It's
like communication on defense is what we really need to improve on.  
  
Q. Ky, as a freshman, you seem to be such the go-to guy. Did you feel
pressure that the scoring at times was on you?  
KY BOWMAN: At times I determined what the situation was. I felt like I didn't
have to like rely on myself but also rely on different open players to see.  
  
Q. Making the All-ACC freshman team and averaging 14 points a game, what
are the next steps that you need to take to elevate your game going into your
sophomore season?  
KY BOWMAN: The next steps for me, just seeing different plays off the ball
screens, understanding different aspects of the game, and also bringing up a
bigger leadership role just for me and my team this season.  
  
Q. What have you taken away from your head coach at this point in your
career?  
KY BOWMAN: Right now he's always on top of me about eating right and being a
leader on and off the court. So for me, like always trying to like stay
outside of the sugars and being able to talk to my teammates off the court and
on the court because I know these relationships are going to last forever.  
  
Q. What are some things that in your relationship with John Wall that
he's given you to help elevate your game, make you a better player?  
KY BOWMAN: Him telling him that I need to really work on my change of pace,
just not going all out every single play, just really like slow it down, then
speeding back up was like one of the main things that he actually got on me
about, like just change of pace is going to be a major key to my game.  
  
Q. You worked out with Russell Westbrook a couple times this summer.
What did you learn from working out with him?  
KY BOWMAN: What I learned from him, just not letting other things like set me
back, just from -- at first beginning of the season, some of my difficulties
at home set me back. But talking to him, just letting my game keep playing,
not worrying about other things outside the court.  
  
Q. How was your first winter up in the northeast?  
KY BOWMAN: My first winter, it was bad after the Syracuse game, that night
when we got there and it was 9 degrees, and all I had was a sweatshirt and
some sweatpants. Had to survive to walk the walk on campus, so that was the
worst.  
  
Q. Coming off of an injury at the end of last season, how are you doing
going into your sophomore season again?  
KY BOWMAN: I feel better than I was before, like just knowing that my leg was
-- actually when it first happened, I was like scared that it was like MCL or
ACL, but just knowing that it wasn't, just knowing that I'm back and better is
a good thing for me.  
  
Q. Knowing that your teammate Jerome is also from North Carolina, did it
help you in your transition from high school to college knowing that you had
another born and bred tar heel on the team with you?  
KY BOWMAN: He actually made a big impact on me as far as like being here, just
knowing that I'm not the only one playing with a chip on my shoulder just to
show others that we belong in the ACC, but also playing for our family and
just having that determination to play for the ACC.  
  
Q. Jerome, same that I asked your teammate, just what you've taken away
from your time at Boston College and building upon what you've been able to
do. I know there's been some adversity, obviously, but what you can take away
from that.  
JEROME ROBINSON: It's just more than basketball, you know. BC has taught me a
lot since I've been here from the basketball side and from the academic side.
Just taking the lessons that I've learned from basketball and applying them to
my everyday life.  
  
Q. What impact has Deontae Hawkins had on the team thus far, transfer
from Illinois State, and what do you expect to see from him?  
JEROME ROBINSON: I'm expecting a lot from him. Deontae as a fifth-year has fit
in easily, the easiest that I've seen so far. It feels like he's been here
since I started. I mean, he definitely talks the most on the team. He gets us
hyped up for practice every day, and I think he's a great leader for us, too.  
  
Q. When Ky joined the squad, knowing that he was a fellow North Carolina
guy, did you assume the role of big brother at all?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I definitely did. When he took his visit to BC, it was
almost the same kind of thing. He just felt like my little brother. I have
three younger brothers, and he just fit in with them, as well.  
  
Q. One of the questions we asked one of the programs earlier, does a
successful season normally dictate that you have to have a trophy? Can you be
successful without hardware?  
JEROME ROBINSON: You can be. For us and what we've come from, there can be a
lot of success in different ways. I feel like our growth is another success,
and I feel like our production by the end of the year will be another one, as
well.  
  
Q. It's not all about you, obviously, but are there personal goals that
you have for yourself that as you think about being an upperclassman that you
want to hit?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, there's definitely personal goals, but they always tie
in with my team because if I don't succeed, we all won't succeed, and if they
don't succeed, I won't succeed, so it's all tied in together.  
  
Q. How about you and the northeast winters? Are you okay? Have you
adjusted?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Yeah, I just ordered some boots not too long ago. I missed
out on them last year. That slush gets to you when it starts melting a little
bit.  
  
Q. You grew up next door neighbors to Scotty McCreery from American
Idol, and usually whenever you play NC State he usually tweets about you. I
don't know what kind of relationship you have with him, but what's it like to
log on Twitter after you've played well and see a country music super star
tweeting about you.  
JEROME ROBINSON: It was pretty cool. Just a cool shout-out that he gave me. He
actually lives in the back of my neighborhood, which is pretty cool. We've met
like once or twice just like in the area, not like direct friends but mutual
friends, and he's just a cool guy, and I appreciate him for that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Jim Boeheim from Syracuse.  
  
Q. Frank Howard has talked a lot about a new era, new chapter for him.
Just what you can say you've seen from him and he's really spoken about
confidence and how he's grown there. Have you seen that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, I think that Frank is a player that I kind of compare to
Scoop Jardine who struggled his first couple of years and then he had two
great years for us and took us to the tournament and to a lot of wins.  
  
I think Frank struggled a little bit in his first two years. He's shown signs
of what he could do, actually more signs than Scoop did at the same time. So I
think Frank's ready. I think he'll have a good year this year. Very confident
in him.  
  
Q. How strange is it going to be for you to look over on the Louisville
sideline this year and not see Rick Pitino there?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It will be difficult. Obviously as everybody knows, first guy I
hired in coaching when I got the head coaching job. And we've been friends for
40 years.  
  
I have nothing but the utmost respect for him. I think he's one of the all-
time great coaches in college basketball. He's as good as anybody I've ever
coached against. And the game will miss him and what he brings to the game.  
  
Q. Somebody earlier asked Ty Battle is it borrowing practicing the 2-3
zone all the time. Ty actually referred to the idea that you've been
practicing some man-to-man, so we might see that this year.  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, we might. (Laughter) anything's possible in this world.
As far as it being boring, one of the things that people have not quite
grasped yet -- I've talked about it -- but it's much easier to teach zone
defense than it is man-to-man. Everybody thinks that it's hard to learn that.  
  
I can teach it to a high school team, junior high school team in about two
hours. So I hope I can teach it to our guys in four weeks or so.  
  
But man-to-man is much more complicated, much harder to learn, many more
different types of ways you play pick and rolls. There's six different ways to
play a pick and roll and different ways to switch, not switch.  
  
There's so many different parts to man-to-man. Much harder to teach, much
harder to learn. Much easier to learn how to play a zone. And our zone's a
little more complex, so it takes a little bit more than a couple of days, but
not that much longer.  
  
Q. What made Geno Thorpe an attractive player for you to pursue as a
grad transfer? And what have you seen from him so far?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We really looked at that position. We had three guards coming
back, two with experience and a freshman. So you know if you have one guy hurt
you can't really -- you really can't complete a season. So we knew we had to
get a guard. With Geno, we found a guy that can play the point and play the 2.  
  
So that was a big part of the decision to go after him. He's a much better
defensive player than I knew going in. I knew he could score. But he's been a
very good defensive player in practice in both man-to-man and zone.  
  
He's been a good guy to have on our team. He's been a very positive influence.
He's missed about the last eight days with an ankle sprain. We hope to get him
back tomorrow. But he's been really a nice addition to our team.  
  
And the difference for our team is we have more experience in the back court
with him and Frank and Tyus starting every game last year. And that really is
one of the strengths of our basketball team.  
  
Q. Tyus Battle and Frank Howard both confirmed that they think the team
is underestimated as a whole going into the season. Would you agree with that?
And what aspects of your team's game will surprise those that underestimate
them?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I hope that every player on every team that's picked below 1st
in the league thinks they're underestimated. We all want to be the best team.
And I want our players to think that way.  
  
And so that's good. I'm glad they're thinking that way. I don't pick where our
team is going to be. I think we have the potential to be a good basketball
team. I think we can definitely be better defensively than last year. We were
kind of middle of the league type of defensive team. We're used to being in
the top two or three teams defensively. So we think we can be better
defensively.  
  
Offensively we lost a lot of weapons. We were a really good offensive team
last year particularly in the league. But we need to get better in that area
to be a good team. But I think defensively we have a chance to be a much
better team.  
  
Q. You bring Frank and Tyus down here. What sort of leadership have you
seen from them in practice and how have they been sort of directing some of
those new faces on the team?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think they've been really good. I think when you have
freshmen and sophomores on the front line -- if you're going to have an
experienced part of your team, back court or front court, obviously it's
better in both, but if you have back court experience, I think that's better.  
  
But they've been good. They've really set a good example. We have a good
group. We have guys that are doing what they need to do every day.  
  
I think the pivotal thing for this team is our four freshmen came in for the
whole summer, which we don't usually ask -- we don't ask freshmen to do that.
We don't expect them to do that.  
  
But they came in for the whole summer. And I think it really helped them -- I
think they're much further along than they normally, you would expect freshmen
to be. And I think that will be important for our team.  
  
But Frank and Tyus have been very good every day in terms of the leadership of
our basketball team.  
  
Q. Frank said earlier today that he believes the team will run through
Tyus Battle. Could you talk about the importance of Tyus on this team and as a
leader?  
COACH BOEHEIM: He's very important. No question about that. But I think to
have a good offensive basketball team you've got to have balance, you've got
to have at least three guys that can score consistently. And you have to get
contribution from whatever two other guys are out there in some way, shape or
form. But certainly Tyus is going to be a key guy for us.  
  
Q. How much has your routine changed without Mike Hopkins there?  
COACH BOEHEIM: It's interesting. Mike was with me for a long time. And I've
been very fortunate through the years, starting out with Rick Pitino, and I've
had so many great assistant coaches. And Mike's certainly one of the best I've
had, I think.  
  
But the way we recruit, each assistant takes a group. So one guy doesn't do it
all or oversee it. So it didn't change really our recruiting at all, because
Adrian had been doing it and Gerry had been doing it. So we had two
experienced guys who had their areas.  
  
And then Allen came in and Allen recruited for the last six years in college.
So we have three experienced recruiters, and that's what I'm concerned most
about as a coach.  
  
Then in our practice times, Mike worked with the centers, but Adrian worked
with the forwards and Gerry worked with the guards. So none of that ever
changed. Mike had his compartment, and Allen and I have been kind of working
with the big guys a little bit together because we have two young big guys.  
  
So that didn't change too much. Obviously our defense isn't changing. And I've
always coached the offense. So we really don't have a lot of change. And I
think that assistant -- we've been very fortunate to keep so much continuity
with our assistants over the years. And I think it's really helped our
preparation, our recruiting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Justin Bibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30516)

### [Devin Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26615)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Justin, just what you've taken away, you've had some time with Buzz
Williams, we all know about his energy and what it looks like from a seat to
the sideline. What can you say about being with him every day in practice?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: Every single day is real unpredictable. You never know what
you're going to get. But I just know from my three years, you always have to
bring it every day, just be energetic, bring intensity every day. That's what
he looks forward to.  
  
Q. We've asked this question of other seniors here this morning. You got
to be a senior really fast. It's really gone by quickly. What have you
learned?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: What have I learned? I have aged, so just learning how to take
care of my body off the court, ice baths, drink the right stuff, water, eat
the right foods, and that's really it.  
  
Q. Where is Virginia Tech basketball in your opinion from when you came
in to where you are right now?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: Oh, man. When I first came in, for example, like our home
opener, it was so many open seats like in the crowd, but now it's sold out, so
that's just something to say how we've gotten better every year. I'm just
happy to be in this position where like our home opener, like I said, is sold
out, and people come to our games and are excited about the season. It's a
blessing.  
  
Q. People are coming to Castle because they want to watch the product.
How would you describe the product for 2017-18?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: The product? You know, I don't know yet because we're still
working on our brand. We don't know how we're going to play yet. But we're
excited. We just know that we're going to play extremely hard at whatever
we're going to do. Yeah, we're just excited to be out there and just play in
front of our home crowd.  
  
Q. When you think about your teammates and you think about the young
kids coming through, what is it as a leader that you're trying to instill upon
them right now early on?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: As a leader, I'm just trying to give them pointers of what I
wish I knew my freshman year, just trying to make them comfortable, make it
easier for them just to be themselves. Yeah, just trying to make them feel
like they're at home away from home. That's very important when you're away
from home the first year. Yeah, just treat them like a brother.  
  
Q. Does that mean you're a big brother?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: I would like to say that, yeah. I try to be a big brother.  
  
Q. Beating Duke and UVA at home and the fans storming the court, what
was that experience like, and how does that motivate you to succeed and win
big games like that in this upcoming season?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: Yeah, that was huge for us. Those games were monumental,
something that I'll think about forever. In terms of storming the court, you
know, we didn't really experience it because you know how Buzz is, he just
walked the other way. We didn't really experience that. It's just monumental
for us, big momentum swing, and we look forward to this year. Yeah, that was a
very cool feeling to have and to experience firsthand.  
  
Q. Devin, you had an interesting road, different from other basketball
players that play basketball. You took some time, played football and came
back. What can you say about your experience doing both and what you're
excited about this year?  
DEVIN WILSON: From the experience, I would just say it was an awesome
experience. I met a lot of different people over at football, met a lot of
different guys, great connections that I still talk to, guys like Isaiah and
Bucky. But coming back to basketball was kind of liberating because I wanted
to be with my guys, the guys I've been there with for a really long time. So
being able to see my teammates and my brothers was awesome for me, as well.  
  
Q. Buzz basketball always seems like you guys are in it to the end,
well-prepared, don't seem to panic in those waning stage of the game. What is
it that prepares you guys to stay cool under pressure?  
DEVIN WILSON: I wouldn't say it's so much that it's practice, but we do a lot
of most people call it boot camp, and in those sessions we do a lot of things
that prepare you for game like moments where you could be frazzled or confused
about what's going on. We get a lot of pre-practice before we even get to
practice of how to deal with those situations. When we get into games it's
kind of second nature and nobody is really worried about it because we've done
it so many times before.  
  
Q. What is it about Buzz Williams that you've taken away at this point?
What are some of those -- what are the key ingredients to his success from
your point of view?  
DEVIN WILSON: I think that he demands the most out of the players that he has.
He's going to get you to push you to your limits, and he's going to want you
to push yourself to your limits, as well. He's a great motivator, a great
coach, a great life coach, as well. He teaches us about things beyond the
court that I think a lot of coaches kind of miss out on. It's not that he
couldn't care less about basketball, but he wants you to be able to see what
you're going to do after the ball stops bouncing. A lot of people respect that
and that`s why people play so hard for him because he wants us to do better
than the average basketball player.  
  
Q. If we're to believe the photos we're seeing here at Operation
Basketball, he's changed his look a little bit. How is that being -- how are
you guys reacting to that as a squad?  
DEVIN WILSON: I personally like the hair and the beard. That's something -- I
think it's a good change for him. I think it's time to switch it up, maybe
show a new era of Buzz Williams basketball that's different from his past, or
it could be that he likes and wants to keep the hair, something simple. But
everyone on the team likes it. We're the ones who actually told him we're the
ones that want you to keep it because he was thinking about shaving it all
over the again. We're like, yeah, keep it, looks good, let's roll with it.  
  
Q. 32-0 with the hair this season, right?  
DEVIN WILSON: I hope so. Maybe even more than that, right?  
  
Q. What's the identity of this year's team, because it's been a history
of not really having a big man per se throughout the years. What would you say
is this year's identity of the team?  
DEVIN WILSON: We have our underlying identity that we bring to practice every
day, which is that we`re going to be the hardest-playing team every single
night. But the identity for the team, that's going to be something that's very
evident is kind of not there yet. We're still working on it, and I think
that's fine. A couple, three, four weeks away -- two, three weeks away from
the season, so I think we have time to kind of find our identity, and even if
it takes it into the season, I think that's fine, as long as we find one
eventually. We are on a good track to finding one, and I think it's going to
be a good one when it all comes down to it.  
  
Q. A question we've asked other players this morning, to be successful
this season, do you have to have a trophy?  
DEVIN WILSON: I think it's an individual thing. I think some guys like to see
that hardware, but for us it's are we going out and playing the basketball
that we want to play and that we know is the right way to play. We don't want
to go out there and think that we're entitled to anything, that we're entitled
to a trophy. I just think trophies are very -- they're evident of what you've
done, whether it's good or bad. So I think the one thing we try to focus on in
our minds and in our practices and in our program is that we want to focus on
how we can internally be the best that we can be.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Virginia coach Tony Bennett.  
  
Q. To have the transfers going out of the program as well as the
freshmen coming in, can you speak on the dynamic of the team this year and if
it feels drastically different from maybe what you're used to at Virginia?  
COACH BENNETT: Good question. It is. There's a newness to this team and an
uncertainty with that. Short term, to lose the two, Marial and Darius were
going into their last year, had a lot of college experience, had been in our
system. You never want to see that.  
  
And we lost a lot of quality play and good experience. Short term, that may
affect us. I don't know for sure. But I think what it's going to do is allow
us to -- there won't be as difficult playing time.  
  
Guys are going to get thrown into the fire -- the DeAndre Hunters, the Ty
Jeromes, and Kyle Guys, the returners. And there's going to be opportunity to
play. I think that's going to be good for the long term. But there's an
uncertainty and newness to this team that I haven't had in a number of years.  
  
I think there's some excitement. The two redshirt players, Jay Huff and
DeAndre Hunter, I think will have to continue to evolve. But I'm used to
having double digit returning scorers, guys who are established.  
  
Now we have that in leadership and guys that have been crucial in our winning
in Isaiah and Devon and Jack Salt. But the rest are either going into their
second or first year in our program which will be interesting. And again
they've been working hard. So we'll find out.  
  
Q. It's very clear that your team, since media day and then the breakout
sessions earlier, there's a lot of personality on this team and a lot of
humor, not necessarily on the court. They made it very clear when they're in
practice it was serious business. But maybe off the court. And that never
really has shown through in the last nine years. These guys, they're very
friendly with each other, very loose. And do you pick up on that vibe?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it's a close group. I think we've had great unity on our
team. But I think you gotta work like crazy on the court. I think you have to
have fun on the court. But they seem to enjoy the process.  
  
And Isaiah and Devon are great that way. I've really enjoyed this preseason
with these guys, my time with them. I really enjoy all my teams. But this
group has -- I think they know there is a proving -- we're going to have to
earn it and prove it, like we've had to every year, but there's more -- maybe
they're not as much is expected, and I think they're eager to try to show they
can do some things.  
  
But they seem to really -- it is probably feels like one of the closer teams
I've had at this point. Now what will test that is when you get into the
season and maybe playing time, though a lot of people will be playing, playing
time is maybe not quite what they think or opportunities. You go through some
difficult situations.  
  
That always tests that bond. But we really have strong leadership at the top.
And they do love life. And I've watched them do things behind the scenes that
speak to what they're about, just in the community, that no one knows, no
cameras are there, and they're doing things that have been really powerful.  
  
So there's a good moral fiber on this team. We've been fortunate that way. But
they're really going above and beyond even what some other teams have to make
a difference in our community. And I love that about them.  
  
Q. Without your two top scorers back from last season, where do you kind
of foresee the offensive production coming from this season?  
COACH BENNETT: I think it will have to be evenly distributed. Kyle Guy will be
an important player. We had just a blue/white scrimmage but he showed some
nice things.  
  
We're going to have to try to figure out ways to get a little more interior
scoring. I think that was a weakness last year. We did not go inside and
whether it's guards getting in there at times or the bigs, just all those
areas, I think evenly distributed. Some of guys that's where the uncertainty
comes in.  
  
I think everybody's going to have to step it up a little bit, find some
different ways. And we've worked hard to make little adjustments, maybe it
will be noticeable. Maybe it won't.  
  
But also we're going to have to be defensively, because without that we've got
no chance. But I hope we'll find -- we have some skill, some guys who can
stretch it and shoot it, do different things. So we'll rely on that. So I'm
hoping that it will be a little more balanced this year than perhaps in the
past.  
  
Q. How would you describe or evaluate Kyle's freshman year and what do
you see as potential differences this year?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think whenever you come in your first year, he was
pretty slight coming in. And he's still -- he's not a hulk or anything like
that but he put on some quality strength and weight. I think that will help
him.  
  
He'll know the physicality, the duration, what to expect. He showed -- Ty,
Mamadi and Kyle, all three of those guys, in their first year, as the year
progressed I thought they had nice showings and valuable experience that will
bode well for them this year.  
  
We've got to get Ty healthy. He's in a boot right now. An important part of
it. But Kyle has that ability as he showed in big games, Carolina, ACC
Tournament, hitting big shots, Florida State, where he can get it going. And
whenever you have a weapon like that, certainly you want to use that.  
  
I hope he'll be more assertive and aggressive this year with smarts. Doesn't
mean you just are wild and crazy, but that's going to be the challenge for him
to step that up with obviously more know-how and understanding and experience
from last year.  
  
Q. You talk about the fiber of your student-athletes. As you're entering
into a year in which you're really not sure what to expect, what's the fiber
of you telling you about your emotions, your feelings, how do you pack them,
how do you unpack them, how do you approach it? The idea this might be a
learning year for you your own feelings and emotions because you're not quite
sure what to expect with this team, if you've had teams in the past you can
expect things for, your emotion is pretty well much what you've known it to
be.  
COACH BENNETT: I think they have to know that I'm for them. I think that's
important. Some teams you can drive. I push hard in practice. Sometimes you
see my demeanor on the sideline and I try to be fairly positive and calm. But
in practice we challenge. And we push real hard and sometimes I can get a
little pessimistic because I know defense is not natural, the way we've got to
push it and we really go over the fine tooth comb the things I want.  
  
But I have to have sound judgment and knowing these guys know I am for them.
And there's got to be some patience and perspective with the uncertainty of
their youth and the newness. But I think that's really important. And I've got
to be mindful of that. I've got a great staff in that regard. And I think that
the players have to know that.  
  
We've done some different things this year, team bonding, however you want to
say it, that I hope will show some fruit in that regard. But that part of it,
that emotion and the feelings and the sense you get is important.  
  
Q. You spoke on the team having some fun together. Isaiah Wilkins today
said Nigel Johnson, Kyle Guy, DeAndre Hunter, Ty Jerome and Devon Hall are his
top five comedians in no specific order. Do you have top five yourself or
would you concur that's a fair list?  
COACH BENNETT: Is it that I'm laughing at them or with them. Near them. Mamadi
can be funny. They're light-hearted. I like that. I really do.  
  
I like that they're not so gripping, so tight that they're white-knuckling
everything. They do seem -- I think you need that. There's so much expected of
these young men. There's a lot of pressure. They get praised. They get cut
down. And I think if they can have a proper perspective, if us as coaches can
show them that and encourage that, I think that's a healthy way to grow and
live through life. It really is.  
  
It's a fun-loving group that way for sure. And I'm sure they make fun of me
behind my back more than I even care to know, but it's all part of being a
good team and having fun with it.  
  
Q. Do you have to have a piece of hardware to say we had a successful
season?  
COACH BENNETT: Define hardware. I mean, I think, success, we've had some
really great years and we've been fortunate in that way. Your goal always is
to have your team reach close to its full potential. Of course you want to
win. We'll be evaluated and judged by everyone.  
  
But you want to win. I know that. But it's how you go about it, the process,
that's always going to matter. And I think there's the on-the-court success is
one way and there's, of course, the off-court. And I think they're both
equally important. And I'm judged by more of the on-court. I get it.  
  
And I'll be evaluated. But we know what we're capable of, what we're pushing
for, and we're always going to be disappointed if we can't attain some of
those goals that are important.  
  
So hardware is that. The national championship, conference championship. All
those things, the NCAA Tournament. It's where you're at, what your perspective
on it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Tyus Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34258)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Tyus, you have, including yourself, four returning players. You have
four incoming freshmen. You have a grad transfer. What can you say about the
dynamic of the team this year going into the season?  
TYUS BATTLE: Well, we're definitely young, a lot of new guys. But I think we
had that time over the summer to really get to know each other and gel well as
a team. I think this year we really -- I think we really generally like each
other. We really gel well as a team. So I think we're definitely going to
surprise people. All the guys get after it every day in practice. Every time
they step on the floor, we go hard. I think we really accepted what we have to
do to win this year, which is be a defensive stopping team, so I think we're
definitely going to surprise some people.  
  
Q. With you guys losing so many guys, especially as far as offense,
where do you look for yourself as well as your teammates to kind of step it up
as far as the guard position is concerned?  
TYUS BATTLE: Well, I think we really do have really good guards this year, me,
Frank, Howard Washington, who's a freshman this year, and Geno Thorpe, who's a
transfer. So I think we really do have some really good guards, and Frank and
I are definitely going to have to step up and take that leadership role that
we were kind of missing last year.  
  
So I think overall we'll definitely be fine with scoring the ball. We just
have to step up to the plate, and I think good things will happen.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you mentioned surprising people. Are you a player
that kind of thrives off being underestimated, having low expectations, things
like that?  
TYUS BATTLE: Yeah, I think just as any competitor will play, playing with a
chip on my shoulder, being motivated. Yeah, in a lot of ways we might seem
down roster-wise, but as a competitor, I never feel that way every time I step
on the floor. I think we can go out there and beat anyone we play against. So
we're definitely confident as a team when it comes to that.  
  
Q. What are some of the words you would use to describe Frank Howard and
what he means to the team in your opinion?  
TYUS BATTLE: A leader, competitor, and he has a lot of basketball knowledge.
He's one of the guys -- one of the only guys on the team that was a part of
that Final Four run, so we're definitely going to be looking for him for a lot
of knowledge and just being that floor general this year for our team.  
  
Q. You mentioned defense, and it's rare that one team focuses just on
one type of defense. Every day in practice you guys run that 2-3 zone. What's
it like day in and day outrunning the same defense every day?  
TYUS BATTLE: A lot of you guys don't know this, but we actually practice man-
to-man sometimes occasionally. Hopefully, you never know, we might switch into
it this year, we'll see. We practicing 2-3 zone, it's definitely a lot to work
on, especially when you first learn the zone. It's a little complicated at
times, but as you learn to understand the principles and where you have to be
and in certain situations, your instincts take over, and you just start moving
together with your team.  
  
When you're moving like that, it's hard to stop. This year I think we have the
length, the size, the athleticism to go back to the traditional Syracuse 2-3
zone, and I think it's going to be definitely tough to beat.  
  
Q. How does Geno Thorpe fit into the team as a guy that came in with a
good amount of experience, and what kind of player do you think he can be at
Syracuse?  
TYUS BATTLE: I think he can be a really good player. He adds extra scoring to
the team, and again, college experience, like I said before, we have a lot of
young guys, guys that have never stepped on the college floor to play a
college game. So just having that college experience and college knowledge to
help share with the group, I mean, it's very helpful for this young team. He
can take it to the basket, knocks down open threes. He'll definitely help us a
lot this year.  
  
Q. Your freshman year, 43 steals, that already puts you third all-time
at Syracuse. What makes you such the ball hawk?  
TYUS BATTLE: I think it's just the zone, understanding the zone. When you're
moving like that, we trap a lot, so a lot of that is just anticipation and
just reading the defense, reading where the ball is going to go. So I just
have to credit that a lot to my teammates and just the zone principles.  
  
Q. Frank, same as Tyus, what you can say about having four returners,
including yourself, four freshmen, and having the grad transfer in Geno
Thorpe, just what the dynamic of the team feels like for you.  
FRANK HOWARD: I think we have a great dynamic right now. We're young,
explosive, athletic. College basketball right now is filled with young guys,
so I think we'll adjust well, get a few games under our belt. You know, we
understand it's a process. We have a young group, so we know we probably won't
hit the ground running from the beginning, but we did my freshman year, and
you've got to see what happens. I think we'll get it together and got a lot of
young guys that's ready to work hard and learn.  
  
Q. Are you a player that kind of thrives off low expectations, being
underestimated in that way?  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, I mean, definitely. We understand what the narrative is of
our team, and we play with that chip on our shoulder every day. I feel like
even if we came out the No. 1 team in the country, we would still have that
chip on our shoulder. We just want to come out, work hard, and just prove our
team to ourselves. We`re not trying to prove it to anybody, want to be the
best team we can, and I think we will be.  
  
Q. You talked about how it is you will bring the freshmen along. What
was it about your freshman experience that will allow you to know when it is
that the freshmen get it, that they are in the system and it all makes sense
to them?  
FRANK HOWARD: I definitely played with two great leaders this year, Mike
Gbinije and Trevor Cooney. They taught me how to be a leader, and I learned
from them on and off the court on what to do and how to lead by example. This
year I'll definitely be more of a voice to the team and the younger guys and
kind of explain things more in depth. I learned how to be a leader from them,
and I just want to be the same thing to the young guys now.  
  
Q. What would be some words to describe Tyus Battle and what he means to
this team?  
FRANK HOWARD: This year he'll be the guy we play through. I think last year
was a little confusion, and I think that overall hurt our team. Everybody
didn't kind of know their roles, so we know our roles this year, and he's
going to be the guy we play through.  
  
Q. Do you look at the schedule as a whole? I know it's a game by game
and you take it one game at a time, but do you look at the breadth of the
schedule early on in the season?  
FRANK HOWARD: I want to look one game at a time. It's always guys talking
about the November game or the December game, and I'm worried about our first
exhibition game. I just want to take one game at a time. I know it's a long
season, and I think this year that's the maturity we have as a team, and we
kind of have that understanding that it's a process and that overall it's all
about the end of the year and how we overall finish. We just want to keep
learning, keep growing as a team, and just want to get better every day.  
  
Q. You and I spoke about the era of what you're trying right now with
having No. 1, now you're No. 23. You wanted that to signify that you're
starting a new chapter, new era in your life. Just expand on that a little bit
more.  
FRANK HOWARD: Yeah, definitely. I think my first two years were definitely
great for me. I learned coming into college, having a new position I had to
learn. I didn't understand that I wasn't ready to kind of accept that, that I
had to take some time. But the coaches understood that, and now I understood
and I learned everything, and I'm ready to hit the ground running.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 25, 2017

  

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. You sticking around and seeing all these different teams that have
come through, what are the challenges in basically meeting a new freshman
class every year and trying to make them gel immediately because you've seen
the importance of that?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, well, the difficulty is learning to play with a brand new
group of guys each year. That's pretty much what it's been. But we have to gel
really fast, and I think Coach does a great job of doing that. It starts with
leadership with them, but then it's a lot of stuff that our captains have to
do.  
  
My freshman year, Quinn did a great job of that, and that's part of the reason
we were so successful. And then thankfully we've had great leaders, and now
this year it's a little different. We only have one senior, and that's me. But
the freshmen are doing a great job of listening and learning, and they want to
understand, but the challenge is they've never played a college basketball
game before, and that makes up half of our team right now. So we have to
prepare them as best we can for it.  
  
Q. Kind of along the same lines, have you picked up any clues as to how
this group is relative to the ones you've been a part of so far? What do you
look for to know? Or does that only show up once the games begin?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, it's hard. You can't really tell until games start, and
it's still really tough to compare groups. What I have seen from practice,
though, is this is an extremely talented group, so stuff that they don't do
yet like talk, might be a little bit late on defense, but they can still make
the play because they're talented. But we're just trying to get them to the
place where they're in the right spot, and they'll be even better. But they
are an extremely talented group, and I think that they're all going to be
ready from the start of the season.  
  
We've had great practices, and like in our blue-white game that we just had,
that's always close. We're challenging each other in practice, and I think
that's a really good thing.  
  
Q. The days of one-and-done, you've stuck around, you've decided to
finish your college career. What's your reasoning behind that and sticking
around and seeing your entire college career through?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I never saw myself as a one-and-done to begin with. When I was
coming into college, I figured I would be here for four years, and so as each
year went by, that was still kind of in the back of my mind. A big part of it
was I wanted to get my degree. I wanted to finish. Part of the reason why I'm
back this year. It was always really important to my family, and so that's one
of the big things I wanted to do.  
  
And there's also -- there's nothing like being at Duke, nothing like playing
in Cameron, and so I'm going to use every last ounce of eligibility I can to
stay there.  
  
Q. You said you're the lone senior; captaincy is a serious deal at Duke.
You lost it last year. Did you have to earn it back in any tangible way, or
was that kind of you're the senior, you need to be this guy?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, I had to earn it back, and part of it is being the
senior, I also had to be that guy. It was part of earning -- it was showing
Coach that I wanted to lead, and then the other part of it was gaining the
trust from my teammates over the summer and during workouts that they trusted
me to lead and they had the confidence in me.  
  
But I'm very confident that I can do that this year and very confident to lead
this young group.  
  
Q. It was alluded to earlier that you've played with a lot of different
guys. The count is 30. There have been 30 different student-athletes that
you've played alongside of. Is there any one of those that gave you a sense of
student leadership that has helped prepare you for this season?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: That might be a record. But I think my freshman year, the one
who had the biggest impact on me was, Quinn just because when I came in as a
freshman I was so quiet, never spoke. I could walk into the locker room and
just be completely quiet. And it wasn't because I had anything against the
guys, I was just shy and kind of nervous being at Duke. Quinn made it a point
to try to talk to me every day, get me out of my comfort zone, and that was --
and at the time I was ninth or tenth guy on the team. So I think that type of
leadership was big. Quinn led from the top of the group with Jahlil and all
the way down to me who probably wasn't going to play at all during the season.
So that really stuck to me, and that's something that I try to do this year on
this team.  
  
Q. Coach talked about this thing called Whoop that you all have. Can you
talk about that and the other technologies that you all are using this year?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, so the Whoop band measures strain in recovery. The big
thing it does, I think, for us is our recovery and sleep, tracks the quality
of sleep, how much sleep you're actually getting. Like for me a big thing was
if I go to bed, if I'm in bed for eight hours, I'm really not getting eight
hours of sleep. It's like six and a half, something like that. So it's been
really helpful for us and kind of knowing our bodies and knowing everything
that it takes to recover.  
  
We use a lot of other technology during practice, a lot of stuff that tracks
our motion and movement, tracks the load that's being put on our bodies during
practice, and the coaches are using it to just measure our workload, make sure
we're not doing too much, and at the same time not doing too little. So I
think it's been a really good tool for us, especially this summer when we're
doing conditioning and not really playing any games.  
  
Q. The blue-white game back on Friday, Alex O'Connell looked very
comfortable on the floor, packed house, of course, at Cameron. Is he nervous?
What type of player do you think he'll be this year? What are you seeing in
the locker room and so on?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, he hasn't been nervous, and that's been a great thing. He
had an incredible week of practice leading up to countdown. He's cutting off
the ball, he's making a lot of different plays, offensive rebounds. He's
understanding to learn how to make plays without the ball, and I think that's
one of the big things for our team. If he continues to do that, he'll
definitely get on the floor. Making plays without the ball, playing
defensively and just being active, that's a big thing for our team and
something that we need.  
  
Q. Which freshman that you've seen is kind of as-advertised, and you
say, yeah, he backs up the hype?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: A lot of them do. I think the one that stands out a lot is
Marvin, just because of his size and athleticism, and you don't see that a
lot. When I first met him, I was surprised to see that like this guy is
actually 6'11", and yeah, his head is going to be above the rim on almost
everything. That's something you learn to play with. I mean, in countdown,
when I saw him running down the middle, I threw the ball way too high, and he
still went and got it. It's a luxury for me. I can make some bad passes and
he'll still make them look good. But it's really incredible to see some of the
stuff he does around the rim.  
  
Q. You've got so many players. How many players will Coach play this
year?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: That question is better suited for Coach than me. I have no
idea. But I mean, as you saw, I keep going back to as -- you saw in the blue-
white game, we have a really deep team, and it's close talent-wise, and that's
why really any five that we put out there is going to be close matched up
against each other.  
  
I have confidence in guys from top to bottom, but you have to ask Coach how
many will actually get out there.  
  
Q. Fill in the blank: I, Grayson Allen, will be successful this year
if...  
GRAYSON ALLEN: If this team plays together. I think that's the biggest thing,
and all the guys want to. We actually have to put it together, and it's tough
to do because when you're a freshman, you come in and you've been the best
player on your team your whole life, and so for me, that's an adjustment I had
when I came in freshman year was learning to play with guys that were a lot
better than me. And so this year all the guys on this team have to learn to
play with each other, use each other's talents and skills, and it's going to
be really important, and a lot of that responsibility is on me to lead.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 80, West Virginia - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready top begin with our championship team, the Iowa
State Cyclones, Coach Steve Prohm, and he brought just about everybody
tonight, Monté Morris, Nazareth Mitrou-Long, Matt Thomas and Deonte Burton.
Coach, congratulations today.  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thank you. This is an amazing moment, for our program, our
university, these seniors. To win 3 out of 4 conference tournaments, my hats
off to these guys. That's unbelievable. I'm extremely proud of them. We beat a
really good team tonight.  
  
They provided us a lot of match-up issues, and our toughness and our grit had
to be at a high level tonight and we challenged our guys defensively. We had
given points up in the 80s and 90s the last two times we played them, and we
were good enough defensively tonight to win. Tough enough to win.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of them. These four guys, I told them this summer, we
met a lot, about once a week and just talked about, you know, they'd had such
a great run and we had lost a lot of good pieces. I didn't want this to come
back a little bit this year. The challenge to them was to leave their jersey
in a better place. They've done a great job of that. There is more story to
write. That's what I told them in the locker room. Stay humble. Do the right
thing, and let's get ready for next week. This moment is special and without
these four guys and their character and their leadership we wouldn't be here.  
  
Q. What's it like playing a home game in Kansas City three hours from
campus?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: We call it Hilton South for a reason. It's a blessing,
because us guys up here we didn't have our senior night two weeks. We had
another home game here tonight, yesterday, and the night before. It's an
advantage when you have the best fan base in the country willing to travel
through rain, sleet, snow, doesn't matter and come out to support us and will
us to this win. It's a blessing.  
  
Q. Monte' and Deonte, Coach said that he told you in the locker room
there is more story to write. What do you do after such a high moment like
this to make sure this isn't the climax, the peak for you guys?  
DEONTE BURTON: By taking this win and building from it. We can't be
complacent. We have to be as hungry as we was coming here. That's the biggest
thing, just not losing the "want" to win, the "will" to win.  
  
MONTÉ MORRIS: Yeah, and touching on what he said, two years ago we won this
same tournament and the next week our lives was miserable. We lost to UAB
first round, so that's definitely in our seniors' heads. Deonte wasn't there,
but he knows the feeling. He knows how it feels to lose especially in that
magnitude of a game. We just got to keep everyone together. That's our job, us
being seniors, so we are definitely going to do that. Like Coach said, there
is more work to be done. So we're going to step up to the challenge.  
  
Q. Monte', what's it like being in the shooting zone that you were in
toward the end of the first half?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: I mean, I take my hat off to my coaching staff and these guys
next to me and every guy in that locker room, giving me the confidence and the
confidence again to shoot the ball, telling me to keep being aggressive
because that's when we are at our best. When I'm attacking and guys are in
great rhythm. So, like I said, I was able to get in that zone because my
teammates found me and gave me the trust to go out there and be successful.  
  
Q. Monte', at the beginning of this news conference it was mentioned
that this is Iowa State's third championship in the last four years. To you,
what does this mean to win one for Coach Prohm for the first time?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: That guy had so much adversity on his shoulders before we left
and everybody was giving him a hard time when we would lose games, but he came
to work every day and started to turn things around. I think that's when the
face of the program turned. Fred had a great run here, but everybody knows
Fred probably won't come back.  
  
So it's his show, and once he stepped up to the plate we definitely have
turned this Iowa State season around and getting a chance to win for Coach
Prohm is big-time, especially on his son's birthday, Cass. So we got that win
tonight for his son and Cyclone Nation.  
  
DEONTE BURTON: Shout out to Cass.  
  
Q. Matt and Naz, can you guys discuss the way that you stayed aggressive
in the second half? West Virginia got it to 5 at one point in the last few
minutes and you still continued to push it and maybe how important that was in
closing this out?  
MATT THOMAS: Yeah, I think we play at our best when we stay aggressive. When
you build an 8-10 point lead with 10 or 12 minutes left you can't get
complacent especially with a team like West Virginia because they're going to
keep coming and coming. We were able to keep attacking and break the press and
guys were able to finish at the rim and knock down shots late.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: He said everything. We were executing plays and Monte'
was handling pressure all night, and Matt was handling threes. I couldn't hit
a lick and I kept looking at my teammates and everybody was pumping me up.
That's when I felt secure that we'd be fine down the stretch. They have the
best press in the country, and we handled it the right way tonight. That's why
we can call ourselves champions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, you can go back to the locker room. Good job this week.
Look forward to watching you next week. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday we talked about the spark that Deonte provided both
halves, tonight didn't do much in the first half but 10 points quickly in the
second half, talk about his spark?  
STEVE PROHM: He was big for us. I thought he struggled in the game up at West
Virginia a week ago and assistants met with him and I met with him. I thought
that was the one game in our run where he took a step back when he had been
playing so well and so efficient for us. He's done a great job of changing to
becoming a good shooter.  
  
But he drove it. We had him in the middle to make plays and drive some bigger
guys. There was one or two or three times he forced it, but for the course of
the game he made really good decisions for us. He was big. He had no rebounds
up there. Tonight he had 5. Then he gets 16 points and he was really active
and physical. Happy for him because he's made a lot of changes.  
  
Q. Steve, you heard what Monte' had to say about you and succeeding
Fred. What were your thoughts as he was speaking to that? What does this
championship mean personally to you?  
STEVE PROHM: Well Monte' is great, you know. You win with great players. I was
very fortunate to come in and walk into him being our point guard, and Fred
did an amazing job putting this program back at an elite level. Replacing him,
it's not easy. It wasn't easy. A lot tougher than I probably would have ever
imagined, coming here.  
  
But I think it's helped make me a better coach, and I think what Monte' said
is right. There was times I tried to assert myself and times I tried to take a
step back, and I think this team is better when I'm assertive and in command
and letting these guys make plays out of that.  
  
I'm happy for these guys. Like I said, it's about the players and you win with
great players. But it means a lot because, you know, you don't want to let
anybody down. We've got great seniors. I think they -- like I said, we've got
a lot more to play for and I'm glad they're talking about that because we've
got to go focused next week whether you are a 4, 5, 6. We've got to be locked
in because we want to try to make a great run.  
  
But it means a lot. It means a lot for my family. Everybody has to make
sacrifices when you take a new job, and this is a special place and a special
job and I'm very fortunate to be here.  
  
Q. Steve, your depth came through tonight and that's pretty important
when you play three games in three days. But moving forward you don't have
that kind of situation in the NCAA Tournament. How do you feel like the roster
make-up that you have can translate to success at those next rounds?  
STEVE PROHM: I played our starters extended minutes in the first two games for
stretches. I know Monte' was able to get some rest last night because of the
lead. But I think when you get into the championship round and the next day,
you know, your bench has to be really good for you.  
  
Nick Weiler-Babb, Darrell and Donovan were terrific. We've shortened our bench
a little bit. I've got a better feel for rotations, but those guys, they
produce. If they produce they're going to continue to play. The great thing
about them playing well tonight is they go into the NCAA Tournament with a lot
of confidence and a lot of "pop" to them. Our starters believe in them.  
  
So, you know, our chemistry is very good right now because everybody is
pulling for one another even when they're not playing and when you've got that
going to on then you can do special things because people are submitting to
what's best and being selfless.  
  
Q. Coach, last year it was an early exit. This year, can you share your
thoughts about the three-day sampling of the Cyclone Nation here in Kansas
City?  
STEVE PROHM: Last year, I know we were in the 3-6 game, the late game and we
didn't get off to a great start. We struggled against Oklahoma in the way they
were guarding us, and Niang put on an unbelievable second half performance and
we missed a corner three to get it to one. But the crowd that night was
amazing. The fan base that night was amazing.  
  
Then they went and followed us in the NCAA Tournament to Chicago. It was
packed. Our fan base is amazing. They're all over the hotel all week, but
they're resilient, too, to where they keep coming back. I've said it a million
times since I've been here, I've been blown away every single night regardless
of who we play we have 14,380 I think it is that fill Hilton Coliseum for a
Citadel, for Cincinnati or for Kansas, it's the same group with the same
energy.  
  
Then you come down here tonight, and I don't know how much the Sprint Center
holds, it was probably 9/10 red, and that's amazing. It's huge! Obviously, it
helps a ton when you've got the crowd behind you like that. It's a special fan
base. You just look around and put on the TV. It's just not like that
everywhere, and that's why this is a special job.  
  
Q. We're constantly told that these title games in big conferences don't
mean a lot. In a lot of cases, you're both going to next week. But it was
really fun to be in there and guys played really hard. I wonder what you think
were sort of the factors behind that?  
STEVE PROHM: You know, these things mean a lot because you're playing for
championships. The way those two teams competed, there was a lot on the line
tonight. The difference in a game tonight, you know, we outrebounded them. I
was looking at the stats right now. We were +4 and -2 on the free throw line.
We didn't shoot it great from three tonight. Naz had a lot of good lucks, he's
0-5. Monte' is 1 for 7.  
  
But the toughness and the grit those stats and then the goal was 10 turnovers
or less, but if you're in that 12, 13 range, that's huge. We were 13
turnovers, +4 rebounding only -2 free throws. That was the key to the game.
When we didn't get frustrated, we cracked up there. We reverted back in
Morgantown a week ago, which was good for us in a way because when I got back
I could talk to those guys and tell them, hey, we reverted back to our old
way. They understood that and recognized that as well, with the bad shots,
playing the wrong way.  
  
So when we got stuck on 6 and it's 12-6 or whatever it was, 14-6, we stayed
the course tonight. We didn't splinter. We kept defending. We kept defending.
Our defensive effort in the first half gave us a great opportunity to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. We'll let you go back. Congratulations.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Esa Ahmad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30821)

### [Jevon Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30568)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 80, West Virginia - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by West Virginia, head coach, Bob Huggins,
student-athletes this evening, Jevon Carter and Esa Ahmad. We will go straight
to questions for our student-athletes and come back for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Jevon, you guys came out better offensively. When Iowa State took the
lead you guys never got it back. What was going well early and what changed?  
JEVON CARTER: Early we were moving the ball, getting easy baskets and open
shots, and later on we stopped swinging it. We started playing individually
and we wasn't rebounding it tonight.  
  
Q. Second year in a row you've lost in the final. What can you learn
from this and take into the NCAA Tournament?  
ESA AHMAD: We've just got to get better. Get back in the gym, work. We missed
a lot of free throws tonight, just gotta get back in the gym.  
  
Q. Jevon, what's the specific challenge guarding Monté Morris?  
JEVON CARTER: He's a good player, one of the best point guards in the country
and he hit some tough shots tonight. I feel like I did a good job on him, but
he just hit some tough shots.  
  
Q. Jevon, if you get a roll going in the NCAA Tournament your paths may
cross with a Big 12 team somewhere down the road, but when you look back on
this Big 12 season what will you remember the most about competing against
these Big 12 teams?  
JEVON CARTER: You've got to come to play every night. No game is ever given no
matter who you are playing, the top seed or the bottom seed. You've just gotta
come to play every night.  
  
Q. It's been a long conference season. Do you look forward to playing
someone who isn't as familiar with you, especially as it relates to your
advantages on defense?  
ESA AHMAD: I just feel like, you know, we stick to doing us. If we play
against somebody that we haven't played before, of course it's going to affect
'em. But if we're not going as hard as we can, you know, any team can beat us
and that showed tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We will let you go back to the locker room. Thank
you for coming. Good luck next week. Let's go to questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Bob, could you break it down for us. What was Iowa State able to --
especially late in the first half that was so effective against you guys?  
BOB HUGGINS: We turned 'em loose, fast break points 15-4. We turned 'em loose.
They're good. They've got a bunch of guys that can handle the ball and a bunch
of guys that can shoot the ball. I think everybody says it's hard to play
against us with one day's prep, but I think it's really hard to play against
them with one day prep as well because they shoot the ball so well. They
spread you out so much. We missed some shots, and you can't go 8 for 17 from
the foul line and beat a good team. That kinda started it, kinda snowballed.  
  
Q. Are you ready to see some other teams?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think Esa said it best. I'm kinda ready to get in the gym
and try to fix some things. We have gotten to the point -- 2010, all we talked
about was do what you do, you know? Do what you do. You don't need to do any
more. Don't do any less, but do what you do. Do what you're good at doing. We
had a bunch of guys that bought into doing what they do. We were like that for
a while. Then it kinda creeps in to where guys who can't dribble want to
dribble and guys who can't shoot want to shoot, and guys that ought to be
playing off the ball and cutting and doing those things that they're really
good at doing, getting their shoulders turned where they can score the ball.
They just constantly want to do the things that they can't do, and then that's
-- then we turn it over 13 times, 10 times the first half.  
  
You asked me before, what happened? We turned it over 10 times in the first
half. That's what happened. Then you turn it over and you look at the
categories that generally we're very good at. They got 14 second-chance points
to our 10. That's usually in our favor by a bunch. Points off turnovers. They
got 15 -- we got 15, they got 14.  
  
You know, we hang our hat on turning people over and rebounding the ball, and
we got outrebounded. We gotta get more shots. You've seen us three days. We
don't shoot the ball very well. Some of them think they do, but they really
don't. So we've got to get more shots. And you get more shots by rebounding
the ball and you get more shots by turning people over, and we didn't do
either one of those.  
  
Q. I was looking at the sheet here and Teyvon got the technical. Did you
get an explanation on that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Teyvon is always talking. There's a lot of things I could say
about what went on out there, but I probably shouldn't. I don't know. I have
absolutely no idea what happened. He said he was -- he talks all the time. You
know? But let's be honest. He's played, what, 21 games in this league. They
don't know he talks?  
  
Q. Five minutes is all you need, right?  
BOB HUGGINS: Actually, he's played more than that because he played last year,
too.  
  
Q. Listening to you talk, I'm curious how you feel about present versus
potential, and can you get there, and how fast do you need to get there?  
BOB HUGGINS: We've got to turn people over and rebound the ball and when we do
those things we're pretty good. But we can't follow that up by going 8 for 17
from the foul line. It's ridiculous, and you know we've had games where we
shot in the 80s. We're shooting -- the last time I looked we're shooting close
to 70 for the year. We were before this tournament. It's a game of reputation.
It's a game of neuromuscular reputation is what it is. When you get guys you
have to fight with every day to come in and get free throws in and foul shots
in, stuff like that, they're not going to make 'em in a game either.  
  
Q. Do you have any feel for seed, or is it impossible to predict?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't have any -- I don't know. I would think a 3 or a 4, I
would think. Three or four, and we'll play somebody second round, somebody
like Cincinnati or Kentucky or somebody like that. I don't know how the
numbers always work out that way, but somehow they find a way for the numbers
to work out where Cal and I end up in the same region all the time. I don't
think they could stand both of us at the Final Four. Cal always calls me and
tells me, now you know we're playing? And most of the time he's right.  
  
Q. You win 2 out of 3 here, get to the Finals, lose in what is basically
a road game, a lot of teams would take away some positives, but I feel like
you guys didn't think you approached the level of basketball that you wanted
to play and didn't get the end result that you wanted. Is that fair?  
BOB HUGGINS: Yeah, yeah. We haven't played well all weekend or week, whatever
it is, really, in all honesty. We didn't play well against Texas. We didn't
play well against Kansas State, and we sure didn't play well today.  
  
That's not the way we were playing. We had a stretch where we played pretty
good. Ball movement was really good. We really rebounded the ball. Pressure
was so much better. You know, I've always thought if you go miss two free
throws, I'd just as soon they punt it up in the bleachers. It's demoralizing.
You know, you work like crazy to get to the free throw line and then you go
miss two of 'em. It's disheartening, but I've always felt. That's not because
of today, I've always felt that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Wesley Iwundu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30502)

### [Kamau Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32973)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 51, Kansas State - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started. Our student-athletes from Kansas State
will be here in just a second. We'll introduce Coach Bruce Weber, let him make
an opening statement, and then we will go to the student-athletes as soon as
they step on stage. Coach?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: It's a heartbreaker for us, for our kids. You guarded as good as
you could against a team that is tough and physical and gets the ball inside.
You hold 'em to 16 points the first half, 26 in the second, but to their
credit they made some big plays and made some big shots to get back in the
game and make that run and then they go zone. We just didn't have enough time
to prepare for it. We went through it the last little five minutes you get 45
minutes today, and we just didn't make the right plays when we needed them.
That allowed them to get back into it, and we didn't get the stops. Second
half, second-chance points really hurt us and then you get a rebound foul, the
difference-maker in the game.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of the kids. We played in the best league in the
country. We've played the best teams in the country. We've beaten them. Played
other ones close. It's just disappointing for our guys that we couldn't find a
way to win and get in the championship game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes are Kamau Stokes and Wesley Iwundu. Let's
go to questions for them.  
  
Q. Kamau, can you take us through that last possession and kinda what
happened there and you couldn't get a pass off and had to take that shot?  
KAMAU STOKES: I would say West Virginia played good defense end of the game.
We didn't make the play and credit to them for just playing defense.  
  
Q. Wesley, I'm curious if you could take us through your thoughts right
now coming off this tough loss and what the future holds?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: I feel good about the future for Kansas State going forward
this season. Got a lot to hold our heads high about. Just got to wait until
after Sunday to see where we fall, but I feel pretty good about our chances
with the tournament.  
  
Q. Wesley, talk about the difference between the first half and the
second half. The defense was really good the first half and what got their
offense going and what stagnated your offense?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: I don't know, man. Defense, I felt like we was even keel all
game. Second half they made some plays, did some things, and with us I felt
like we kinda got a little stagnant, whatever. That's pretty much it. Overall
they did some things in the end that we as a team got to step up and do some
more things to win the game.  
  
Q. Guys, you had four field goals in the last thirteen minutes of the
game. What was it about that 1-3-1 zone that was giving you so many issues?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: They play a good zone, you know. We had some open shots. We
wasn't making 'em. Did a lot of things against the zone, but they stepped up
and we just got to step up and make more plays versus that zone.  
  
Q. Kamau, I was curious if you could talk about Wesley, what he did
tonight and what he's meant to your team this season?  
KAMAU STOKES: He's been big for us the whole season. There have been plenty of
times he put us on his back. He's our senior leader and we need him to play
well every game, and I feel like Wes has stepped up. He's done that this whole
season.  
  
Q. Kamau, three wins coming into this game, then this game. Do you feel
like you've proven yourselves to be a quality NCAA Tournament team?  
KAMAU STOKES: I would think so, but it don't come down to what I think. Our
team, we have all played well enough to show everybody that we can compete
with the best. So I would think so.  
  
Q. Wesley, you've been through so many games at Kansas State. How tough
was the ending to this game?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: Losing a game by 1 point, that's always tough. Losing, period,
is tough. But I think it's all about how you respond. However we played in
this game I do feel good about our chances in the tournament. We've shown a
lot. I would be very surprised if we wasn't in. In a league like this, man, it
would be very surprising if we wasn't in. We did a lot of things in this
league, competed with a lot of guys, showed that we could play with the best.
We feel good about our chances, but at the end of the day it comes down to the
Committee, but we do have a lot to argue about why we should be in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Kamau and Wesley, we will let you return to the locker
room. Questions for Coach Weber?  
  
Q. Coach, the stats are striking. Only 11 turnovers. You held 'em to
26.7%. You led for 33 minutes. How do you explain it?  
BRUCE WEBER: The loss or how we played? We played well. They're a good team,
one of the best teams in the country. I thought, you know, we talked about
being tough, being determined. I thought we played that way. We guarded well.
We broke down defensively a little bit down the stretch, maybe a few minutes
-- too many minutes for some guys.  
  
We were struggling against -- we had subbed well and the bench did a great job
in the first half. Second half when they went zone probably you go with the
guys you feel more comfortable with. We got a little stagnant. We needed a
couple of -- make a couple plays. And the second-chance points down the
stretch, they out-toughed us for some rebounds and that probably was the
difference in the game.  
  
Q. Isaiah was able to give you guys some good minutes this week. Is
there anything that he had shown lately in practice or leading up to this that
showed that he was capable of contributing the way he did in those
stretches?  
BRUCE WEBER: He's played well as of late. The last stretch of the season, got
some confidence and got his mindset in a positive frame of mind. He's
practiced well, battled, means a lot. He was in there crying after. He played
20 minutes probably his career high tonight in a big game and battled against
some of the biggest, strongest, physical guys in the country. So you feel good
about, you know, his progress as a player.  
  
Q. Bruce, talk about that last possession, and did you want the timeout?
What did you diagram on that? What failed on that?  
BRUCE WEBER: We tried to go a double ball screen whether it was man or zone,
and we talked about D.J. diving and then, you know, Dean popping and having
Wes on that weak side, and they did a good job of jamming it up. Kam is a
little smaller. Wes was open on the skip, and maybe D.J., diving into the
basket. That's what the coaches said, but they did a good job of jamming it
up. I wish he would have went off a little stronger, a little quicker, and
make 'em make a call down the stretch.  
  
But he didn't do it, and then we got it on the glass. So we said, get it to
the basket. Get it on the glass and give us a chance but. Dean got a put-back,
but it was after the clock.  
  
Q. Last night, Coach, you said of course that the only way that you're
guaranteed a spot in the big tournament is if you win it. Why do you feel like
the team's performance in this tournament will merit you an at-large bid even
though you didn't win it?  
BRUCE WEBER: It goes back -- we got nine wins -- you play 20 games in this
league and we got nine wins against the best or second-best, depending on what
you look at. We've beaten Baylor, beaten them twice. They've beaten Oregon,
Louisville, Michigan State and Xavier, and we beat them twice. We beat West
Virginia. West Virginia went to Virginia and won. They've been one of the
better teams in the country, and I know close doesn't count in basketball.  
  
But we played Kansas who people had 1 or 2, and we had a shot to beat 'em at
their place. It was a tie score minute left at our place. We had some other
close games, you know. But I guess close doesn't matter. I think we're a good
team. I think you watch us, you see it, if eye test means anything, but I hope
for our kids they deserve it. I hope we get a good opportunity on Sunday.  
  
Q. Coach, did you sense any added urgency in the last 48 hours by Wes,
your senior leader? Did he say anything in the huddle tonight that let you
know that he was taking ownership of this team down the stretch?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think it's the last ten games. You've watched him closely, the
numbers, double digit rebounds and double digit points, just doing a lot of
good things for us. Great focus, looking you in the eye, talking, you know,
like we're going through a scouting report and he's making suggestions and how
shall we guard this or can we do this? Just a great, great finish to his
career.  
  
I know we're going to play in some tournament, but, you know, I hope it's the
big one and he gets an opportunity to keep playing along with D.J., Carlbe. I
believe they deserve it. They've had a great attitude. They've battled and
fought through adversity, injuries, a lot of stuff this last year. I couldn't
be more proud of 'em. A great group, and I hope good things happen for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and wish you the best next week.
Good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Deonte Burton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24937)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 84, TCU - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Cyclones of Iowa State. The head
coach, Steve Prohm, student-athletes tonight are Deonte Burton and Monté
Morris. Coach, congratulations on the victory tonight, your thoughts?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thank you. This was a great win. I thought from start to finish
we got off to a slow start. I thought the game got off to a little slow start.
Maybe teams just feeling each other out, but we need to play at a better pace
and our guys did that. I thought defensively in the first half we were very
good. You look at the numbers, we outrebounded them. We shot more free throws
and held them to 39% shooting.  
  
That was great for us, a big part of our plan, ball screen defense. Deonte got
us going the first half, but all the guys chipped in. I thought this was our
most complete from 1 to 8 or 9 tonight when you look at our stat sheet. Great
win. We beat a very good team, and now we have to get ready for a great
opportunity tomorrow against one of two really good teams.  
  
Q. Deonte, first half and second half, you really got things going, 9 of
11 points for Iowa State in the first half, the first 7 in the second half.
Was that by design or did it just come to you?  
DEONTE BURTON: It just came to me. We were playing basketball and I just
happened to have -- happened to get the opportunity and took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Monte', you're the only one up there from Iowa State who has been
here for as many tournaments as you've been here and we've seen you guys go to
the championship game two other times in your career. When you guys are
playing like this, what is it about this place, this building, this event that
seems to bring out the best in you guys?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: I think we just lean on each other, personally, and we loving
and trusting in one another to make plays and we are playing with high energy,
and when you got guys like that and we all are pulling for each other, you
know, it's easier to win games.  
  
Honestly, we got the best fans in the country and they travel well. So it
definitely felt like a home game for us and that definitely gets us going like
if we have slow starts like we did tonight. But we picked it up, and now we
are forty minutes way from a trophy.  
  
Q. Whoever you play tomorrow you've got two entirely different styles.
Do you have a preference on which style you play who you play tomorrow?  
DEONTE BURTON: No. Both teams are tough. So it's going to be a great battle
whichever team we play.  
  
MONTÉ MORRIS: No, it really doesn't matter. We played both teams twice. We
know the make-up of both of the teams. It's all about who wins tonight and we
got a good coaching staff, mask great coaching staff and they're going to put
the agenda to beat that team together whoever it may be. So we've got to watch
the game and be ready at 5:00 tomorrow when the ball go up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We'll let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on the victory. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Deonte's effort at the beginning of each
half and how much he really got you going?  
STEVE PROHM: He was great tonight. I thought he was the spark we needed in the
first half. We were a little sluggish offensively in the beginning. When we
become too set oriented we can become passive. I think those two guys got in
some two-man game action which helped us. We move the ball off ball screens.
They were trying to hard-hedge Monte', and he hit some pocket passes to Deonte
and freed him up for some shots.  
  
Deonte has put a lot of time in this spring and summer to become a better
shooter and you can see the results. He's had a really good -- this time when
we've been playing really good basketball he's been really consistent for us
on both ends of the floor and he was really good tonight.  
  
Q. What were you concerned about with TCU? I know they beat you guys
earlier this year. What was it that they could do that concerned you?  
STEVE PROHM: You watch games from us from the first half of the conference.
We're just a different team. We've changed the way we've played on both ends
of the floor to adapt what's best for this team both offensively and
defensively. What hurt us at their place was ball screen defense. It was
getting spread out, second chance points. I think 54 be points in the paint to
where at our place, 36. They rebounded half their misses in Ft. Worth, only a
fourth of their rebounds -- in aims, so post defense, doubling the post, ball
screen defense and rebounding and trying to keep Alex Robinson and Jaylen
Fisher out of transition.  
  
Our defense tonight, when it was really good it was really good. The problem
is when it's not good against them you can see, you can give up some really
easy layups. But I thought defensively the first half and for the complete
game we were very good.  
  
Q. Usually I try find a sequence, some key sequence in the game, but it
just seemed like when you got going after that slow start there was key
sequence after key sequence. Is that how you felt about it?  
STEVE PROHM: It was 4-4, then 8-8. Then it was be 11-10, 13-10, then it
started to go our way, 16-10. Guys were making shots, making the extra pass.
But I think when we're very good defensively, when we're in gaps, when our
ball screen coverage is good and when we are rebounding the way this team is
best is when we're playing with Monte' and Naz pushing the ball and making the
extra pass and playing against broken defense. When we're doing that we're a
very good offensive team.  
  
Q. West Virginia and Kansas State play entirely different games. Do you
have a preference and does it make it hard not knowing until after 9:00
tonight?  
STEVE PROHM: It doesn't make it hard. I'm glad my guys answered the question
the same way I'm going to answer the question. We don't have a preference.
Both teams are very good. They're both very well-coached. We just played West
Virginia, so, you know, obviously we know their strengths and weaknesses and
they know ours.  
  
We played Kansas State a couple of weeks ago. They are two different, two
totally different game plans. But you know what you're going to do right now.
I'll watch this game tonight and whoever we play I'll watch our last game
against them and then we will meet again in the morning. We won't show tape to
the guys tonight. I want them to watch this game and go to bed, and we will
have our edit before then when we have breakfast we will show our edit, but
doesn't matter. We got a great opportunity and at 5:00 we've got to play
really well to beat either team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow at the championship game.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Esa Ahmad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30821)

### [Tarik Phillip](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28775)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 51, Kansas State - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Mountaineers from West Virginia. Coach
Bob Huggins, and we will start with his two student-athletes, Tarik Phillip
and Esa Ahmad. So we will start with questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys switched to a zone defense in the second half. What was the
affect of that?  
TARIK PHILLIP: They were getting a lot of run-outs and penetrating to the rim.
That was giving them opportunities to hit threes, so we wanted to stop that.  
  
Q. What do you attribute the slow offensive start to?  
ESA AHMAD: To be honest, we just missed shots. We weren't attacking the basket
and felt like we were settling for threes. We talked about that at halftime.
We wanted to get to the rim. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Tarik, is this a team that always feels like it's in a game, it's
never out of a game?  
TARIK PHILLIP: We're always in the game. It's just because of the style that
we play we create turnovers and stuff like that, but we always in games.  
  
Q. Tarik, what went right in the second half after no points in the
first?  
TARIK PHILLIP: We guarded a lot better. We rebounded. We made shots.  
  
Q. For you personally, though?  
TARIK PHILLIP: I don't know to be honest. Like I said, we just made shots and
we guarded the ball a lot better.  
  
Q. Esa, ever since the back injury a couple weeks ago, slow getting you
back into things, but you got back in the starting lineup tonight and poured
it on in the second half. Any difference in the way you played tonight from
those past couple of games?  
ESA AHMAD: I started myself tonight. My teammates kept me positive throughout
the whole slump. My coaches kept my positive, and they told me I was due for a
good game. I came out here and tried to give it my all, and that's what I did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on your victory and good luck tomorrow. We'll take questions
now for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you explain a victory shooting 26.7%?  
BOB HUGGINS: Coaching. (Laughter.)  
  
I don't know. I told 'em at halftime we've just got to find ways to score.
We've got to get more shots. We just -- our whole thing is by either turning
people over or rebounding the ball. We've got to get more shots than what our
opposition does.  
  
Q. Bob, how about defensively on Kansas State's last possession, what
did you instruct your guys to do?  
BOB HUGGINS: We put J.C. on the wing and put Nate underneath because they were
trying to lob it to D.J. I wanted size back there, but other than that we
didn't do anything, just switched personnel.  
  
Q. The affect of the zone in the second half, can you speak to that?  
BOB HUGGINS: It stops penetration. When you got three guys across the foul
line you should be able to stop penetration. They were getting a lot of
penetration on us and I wanted to make 'em shoot it from the perimeter.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it mean for you and your returning players to get a
second shot at the championship after last year?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think everybody who comes here comes here to win. We've
got another opportunity to win, and that's what they were talking about in
there. Let's don't let another opportunity slip away from us.  
  
Q. Bob, you said you didn't play well last night and tonight's game low
scoring, poor shooting, a lot of good defense. What does it say about this
team that it can win these kind of games?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, Kansas State is pretty good. Let's don't take anything away
from them. Bruce has done a great job of coaching them. They played great last
night. They played really well today.  
  
We defend. We didn't do a very good job on our man and about, I don't know,
three weeks ago we decided to try a little bit of the 1-3-1. I'm not very
smart, but I'm smart enough when it works keep doing it. It's been pretty good
for us.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious your impressions of going against Wesley, for
what might be his final time against you?  
BOB HUGGINS: I really like him. He can defend the perimeter. He can defend the
post. He can play in the post. He can play on a perimeter. He's a 6-7 guy who
really rebounds with guard skills. We've always thought he was a really hard
match-up for us. Esa was much better with him today than really what we've
been. Esa has the same kind of size.  
  
Q. Bob, you guys had success against Iowa State this year. To what do
you attribute that to? The last couple years, really.  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. They started out at our place and made every shot.
I mean, it was like -- we just kept -- we just -- like we do, we just kept
trying to bother them and try to make things hard for them, but they've put so
many guys on the floor. Steve has done an unbelievable job with those guys
when you think they're playing really one big guy, because Burton is really a
perimeter guy. He's a big perimeter guy, but he's a perimeter guy. They make
so many shots and score so many points. We're going to have to score more than
51 tomorrow probably.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

### [Brandon Parrish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30518)

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 84, TCU - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the TCU Horned Frogs, Coach Jamie
Dixon. Our two student-athletes are Brandon Parrish and Kenrich Williams.
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
  
JAMIE DIXON: First off, congratulations to Iowa State, obviously they
outplayed us, deserved to win. I'm proud of our guys. They played well; we
didn't. We looked fatigued, to be honest with you, and I wasn't sure that
would be the case. But just how we played and we just didn't seem to respond
like I thought we would. Proud of our guys. It's a good run for us and
certainly something that we wanted to instill in our program going forward
here.  
  
Proud of our seniors. We know that we're going to be playing again and we got
to take this as a lesson. I think when our shots didn't go down it affected
our defense as most teams and got them outrunning and in transition and the
layups, the shots around the basket, the open threes really wore on us, the
ones that we missed and I think it really hurt us at the other end and wore us
down.  
  
Give them credit. They're playing at a high level, and, you know, they earned
it and they deserved it. I wish them luck. I just saw Coach as we were walking
through there and I wished them luck going forward.  
  
Q. Brandon, you guys came up here, obviously to try to make a statement,
validate yourselves to some degree for postseason. It fell a little bit short
tonight from an NCAA standpoint, but what do you guys think you showed here in
Kansas City over these three games?  
BRANDON PARRISH: I mean, I feel like we just came out and we gave it our all,
all three of these games. The last game didn't go our way. We missed a lot of
layups, were short on 50 to 60% of our misses. So fatigue played a factor, but
we showed our fan base that we are a resilient group of guys who aren't afraid
of any team and if we put our minds to it we can achieve anything.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Similar to what Brandon said. I feel like we showed
everybody we can compete with the best teams. We've got a great group of guys,
and we're not a team that -- you can't count us out.  
  
Q. Expanding on what Jimmy said, obviously you're going to have more
games to come this season, but as the season stands right now, just talk about
the steps that you have taken as a program. Where do you think TCU is right
now?  
BRANDON PARRISH: From my freshman year, us going 0-18 in conference to now, we
are eligible for a postseason, a quality postseason at that, just goes to show
the -- how this program has evolved. Coach Dixon has brought a new type of
energy to the program that we definitely needed and we definitely appreciate
him for that, and we just feel like coming in things never were right. We've
always been the underdog, but like Kenrich said, we showed that you can't
count us out. We're going to come to compete no matter who we're playing
against.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Same thing. We're eligible for postseason. This hasn't been
done, the NIT, since 2005. So that's great for our program. This season we
just showed resilience and we showed a lot of fight this year.  
  
Q. Coach Dixon touched on it, how much do you think fatigue played a
factor today? Did you have dead legs out there today?  
BRANDON PARRISH: Nobody wants to make excuses. We don't want to say fatigue
was a factor, but when you go out there and missing layups, most of your jump
shots are missing short, not running back on defense, not as active on loose
balls as we were the two previous games. It was pretty evident, but regardless
of fatigue we tried to fight in spite of the outcome, in spite of shots not
going our way, I feel like we still gave it our all and just came up short.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Fatigue can play a factor, but we don't want to make that
excuse. I can see it affected most of our team coming in, missing bunnies,
easy layups. I was kinda short on a couple shots. I wasn't as active. It's
just part of it. Next year we won't have to play so many games. We'll come in
a top seed, so we won't have to play four games in a row.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen. We will let you go back to the locker room.
Great week here in Kansas City. Good luck. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Beginning of each half, Deonte Burton took over for Iowa State. What
kind of a match-up problem did he give to your guys?  
JAMIE DIXON: He hurt us, no question. He hurt us inside. We know he's a driver
first, offensive rebounds. I thought they were so much more physical than us
around the rim and it was him and Solomon as well. I didn't see that coming,
but they just simply overpowered us. In more ways -- they pushed us around the
entire game start to finish, so give them credit.  
  
Vladimir, we wanted him to post up closer to the basket and he was continually
pushed off the block. You gotta repost, get to the spot, you can't give in and
so give them credit.  
  
They certainly, along with Burton and Young, those two guys especially, they
were the guys playing most of the game. They were in there 61 minutes between
'em. Simply put, that's where it was. So we didn't get it done, and you got a
lot of layups around the basket and got to the foul line. We needed to get to
the foul line more. We didn't get any free throws the first half. They did,
and that was something we said we had to do. It obviously turned the other
way.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, obviously you got more games yet to play. What do
you expect on Sunday? Are you anticipating NIT? What's your thoughts as to how
you read the tea leaves today?  
JAMIE DIXON: I haven't looked at it. I don't know who won games today or what.
The only thing I've looked at is the KenPom thing and that had us at 36 or 35.
Generally that puts you in the running, a Power Five is going to be in the
running. I didn't see the RPI today, if not, we will be in the NIT and a high
seed in the NIT and a home game and anticipate, you know, having -- this has
been a long time coming and this is a big step for us as a program, huge step.  
  
It's hard to make the NIT with the automatic bids and the automatic bids in
the NCAA and the NIT it's hard to make the NIT. There is no losing records.
There is no 500 teams. It's 350 teams. It's an accomplishment for our guys. I
want to get that across to them. It's huge progress. It's a step. It's a huge
step. It's more than one step.  
  
From a year ago when I came here it's a definite step for us and we're going
to use that as a positive going forward here. But I like how we fought. We got
to learn to -- when they get physical we've got to come back the other way and
we've got to do that. Maybe we didn't have the legs, but they had a lot to do
with it. Somewhere.  
  
Q. Jamie, you were talking about progress, just looking at this
tournament here you played probably more games than most people expected you
to play. You have a win over the No. 1 ranked team first time that's happened
in school history. How do you evaluate that as part of that building
process?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think it is a process. You've got to go in and play back-to-
back-to-back games, three in a row. You've got to get in that situation, and
win, and win close games. You've got to come back like we did. I think -- I
compare it to Pitt our second year. Second year we got to the championship
game in the Big East Tournament, and that was kind of the -- really that run
as we referred to it as the run where we won three games, lost in the
championship game and got blown out to be honest, as I remember.  
  
But it got us going into the NIT. We probably weren't an NIT team then. It was
a different time. That was kind of a buy yourself in or who you knew thing,
but this one is all about earning it nowadays and certainly it's a big step
for us.  
  
I think this is a huge thing for us going forward. To beat Kansas, in front of
their people and then obviously we know coming here to this tournament playing
up here we're going to be playing against home crowds and we certainly saw
that the last two nights. That's something we've got to prepare for, get used
to and use as motivation at the same time. It's a great event. I'm proud that
we got to the semis, and I look forward to coming back again.  
  
Q. Coach, if the NCAA is a guard-oriented tournament like a lot of
people say, if Iowa State's three, sometimes four guards playing like they
have in the past, what's that mean for Iowa State over the next two weeks plus
possibly?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think they're playing at a high level. We bet 'em early in the
year. I think by 10 and they certainly weren't that good as they were tonight,
but that's how this game goes.  
  
You can't get more experienced. They play well together. They're well-coached.
They keep it simple. They get the ball in Monté Morris' hands and the other
guys move well without the ball. They're good. I think Young may be the
difference. His physicality, if he pushes other teams around like he pushed us
around, I think he's a huge addition for them as the season progresses. I
thought he was -- Deonte Burton got -- I thought Young was really the key
tonight. I thought he man-handled our guys, and he's a freshman.  
  
But he pushed us all over the floor and what he did to our guy, No. 10,
Vladimir Brodziansky, he simply pushed him all over the place.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and good luck next week.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Barry Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32921)

### [D.J. Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32922)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 70, Baylor - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Wildcats of Kansas State, Coach
Bruce Weber and his two student-athletes, D.J. Johnson and Barry Brown. Coach,
opening comment?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Couldn't be more proud of our guys. They fought through
adversity, fought through injuries. They've stayed coachable. They've stayed
together and just a great run here. We talked last week, March Madness started
last week for us at TCU and continued at Brambridge and now we're at the
Sprint Center, and we beat a teams that's one of the top RPI teams in the
country.  
  
We talked about fighting and battling and scraping and anything we could do to
get a win and sharing the basketball. I thought one of the keys was the
decision making by Kam and Wes to get it to our big guys, and I thought our
bench was really, really important especially -- in both halves it was really
important. That was important and it's great to have D.J. healthy and doing
the things he can do; and then, you know, just for Barry to make a bunch of
free throws and D.J. down the stretch to ice the thing, just really happy.  
  
But we are not done. We told them the only way you know you're in the NCAA
Tournament is to win the tournament, so we took one more step toward that. And
now we've got to worry about West Virginia and that's what we've got to focus
on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the guys?  
  
Q. Where did that shooting prowess come from today?  
BARRY BROWN: Feel like it came from my teammates. We ran a couple of plays and
some of it was just, like the one and and-one 3, Wes was able to find me. But
I credit my teammates for getting me open and I had to reward 'em by making
the shot.  
  
Q. What's going through your mind? You ripped down that rebound and got
fouled and you were high fiving D.J. and Stokes slapped you. What's going
through your mind with an impending victory with 30 seconds to go?  
BARRY BROWN: I was just trying to hit those free throws and finish out the
game. They fought to the end of the horn. I had to hit those free throws and
get back on defense. I wasn't thinking about the game was over, I was just
trying to hit the free throws and get back.  
  
Q. For Barry and D.J., obviously you've had some huge distractions
lately, the talk about coaches future and then also your AD's decision to go
to Tennessee. Could you talk about how this team was able to stay locked in
and just focus on beating Baylor?  
BARRY BROWN: We talked about all the things that were going on off the court,
but Coach kept us level-headed and kept us thinking about basketball. It paid
off. The team stayed together, no matter what the people were saying in the
media and all of this about all of that. We stayed together and we were able
to pull out a victory today.  
  
D.J. JOHNSON: Same thing, Coach helped us to stay focused on basketball and
don't worry about anything else, just keep improving our game.  
  
Q. After that Oklahoma loss, everything seemed to change. Coach Weber
said at the TCU shootaround he got after you a little bit and said some things
that he hasn't in the past. What exactly happened to this team that you could
rattle of these three significant victories?  
BARRY BROWN: I feel like we just came together. We knew what people were
saying, and we didn't want to see the things happen that people were saying
outside of this basketball family. We stuck together. We played for Coach,
played for one another and able to rattle off three wins. So we've got to be
able to do that for the future.  
  
D.J. JOHNSON: Same, just focusing in on each other and keep out the noise and
just wanted to keep on improving.  
  
Q. Barry, you mentioned the free throws. Did hitting the first couple of
those down the stretch help your confidence? That's been a shaky area for you
this year.  
BARRY BROWN: Yeah, really I was just trying to stay focused, not worry about
making or missing. Like Coach says, I was worried about my routine, keeping my
hands up, going through my routine and taking those deep breaths, getting my
mind clear and knocking the free throws down for my teammates.  
  
Q. D.J., it seemed like you guys played with a whole lot of heart and
effort tonight. What did you think of it? Were you as impressed as maybe some
fans watching in?  
D.J. JOHNSON: Looked good from the bench, and we played as a team. When we do
that we usually have good outcomes.  
  
Q. D.J., how good was Barry on 3-pointers? What kind of lift did that
give you guys?  
D.J. JOHNSON: Geesh! 4 for 6! 4 for 4! (Laughter.) It speaks for itself, 4 for
4!  
  
Q. D.J., the bench really gave you, especially Isaiah and Xavier and
Carlbe, was that the best bench production you've had in a while?  
D.J. JOHNSON: How much did the bench score?  
  
Q. 19.  
D.J. JOHNSON: They did good. Isaiah came in and gave us quality minutes. I
think he had 8 points or so, and same with Xavier Sneed. And I think Isaiah
had 8 points in 8 minutes and he pulled down a couple of rebounds, so bench
production was great.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on your victory. Good luck tomorrow. Questions now for Coach
Weber?  
  
Q. Bruce, I'm sure you could choose a lot of things, but what impressed
most about that effort?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think what you said, effort. That's what we talked about. Play
with a determination and I told 'em before the game I said I'm not -- the word
determination coaches use it all the time you can look it up in the
dictionary, they give you some long definition of what it is. But when you
feel it and you see it and when they had it, and they had it against TCU,
Texas Tech and we had it against Baylor the first time and we had it tonight,
that determination, that effort, playing hard, getting on the floor, fighting
and scraping for everything, I think that's what -- I really appreciate, when
we shared the ball. Kam started slow then he got on a roll and started making
point guard plays and they were huge passes that we got more points in the
paint than they do.  
  
That's usually been their game, and sharing the basketball, him and you have
Wes with 4 and 1 and Kam with 5 and 3 which was really important, and we kept
talking about they execute so well out-of-bounds plays at the end of games. We
lost Manu that one time at the end on that cross screen down screen, but other
than that we made 'em earn everything. So it was a great defensive effort by
our guys.  
  
Q. Barry's game, what kind of confidence this might give him in being
able to lift your team heading into to tomorrow?  
BRUCE WEBER: We made big shots and Barry made 'em. The one thing -- one, I've
told him to put time in in the gym and be in there, and he does it more than
anybody. I think once you get that first one down, he got one down early and
that obviously helps your confidence. But the big thing, and he mentioned it,
Kam got into the zone. We got it to him. Got him open shots, and it's easier
to make open shots than ones with contested shots. All of them except the last
one where he got fouled where it was a shot clock thing where he had to get it
up there. I thought the other ones were good, open shots. You gotta give Barry
credit, three steals against. He didn't make all-defensive team, to me, I
don't understand. He has guarded all the best players. He's set a record for
K-State history for steals in a season. It's continued to grow, and he guarded
Manu and that is a tough match-up; and, you know, he will have another tough
one with Carter tomorrow. But we've had to put him on the toughest players
every game and he's rose to the occasion.  
  
Q. The 25-25 at halftime seems like a bad offensive performance but
kinda seemed like the defense was stepping up for both teams in the first
half. Is that what you saw?  
BRUCE WEBER: It's our conference. First of all, today must be the day of the
purple with TCU and our win, but you play -- every game is close. I don't
think people understand nation wide how tough the teams here are. You just saw
what TCU did to Kansas today and they played 'em close at home the first time
and battled them.  
  
Texas and West Virginia game, got so many good teams. Now you got to play 'em
not only two times, but a third time. Our players know every call that they
have, you know. They're yelling for a shoulder. We know what's coming. We
stayed there. One time Wes beat Motley to it. He ran over him. That's part of
playing the second time, third time, and if you're locked in, I just kept
telling 'em be locked in on defense.  
  
I thought we did a good job. We knew they would play more zone. We probably
didn't handle it as well, first half. Second half I thought we did a better
job against the zone and when we got 'em out of the zone that's when we were
most effective with the ball screens, getting to the hoop and making the right
decisions.  
  
Q. What are keys to beating West Virginia since you are playing them for
the third time and what would a win mean for your program?  
BRUCE WEBER: Get to the championship. That's important. You've got another --
you just beat a top-10 team, one of the top RPI teams in the country. You got
another top-10 team that we beat once and they hammered us the second time.
One, get back to the hotel and get some rest and get food in 'em and get rest
and the coaches get back at it preparing us. We talked about success is when
opportunity meets preparation, and that's when you have success. You know, we
gotta be prepared, we've got another opportunity we've got to be prepared and
dealing with their press, dealing with their zones.  
  
They've gone 1-3-1. They've done some different things, taking care of the
ball and play strong. But I think the big thing is get mentally ready and get
locked in. I told them we came here to win the championship not to just win
one game, and that's what our focus has to be, getting to that championship
game.  
  
Q. Coach, you said locked in, determination, your team has played some
good basketball at times this year, including the first half in Waco. But was
this the best forty minutes you guys have played wire-to-wire?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think so. There is no doubt to play on a neutral court and beat
a really good team like that. They didn't play bad! Both ends of the court,
sharing the basketball, making good shots, making free throws. We outdid them
at what they do well. That's what makes them special and that's what I talked
about. Great win for our kids, and now see if we can get after it tomorrow
night against the Mountaineers.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Leyton Hammonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32860)

### [Cameron McGriff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32861)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 92, Oklahoma State - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Oklahoma State Cowboys and Coach Brad
Underwood, and his two student-athletes with us today are Cameron McGriff and
Leyton Hammonds. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Tremendous amount of credit to Iowa State. They were terrific
today. I thought there were some pivotal moments in this game. We got off to a
very tough start, transition defense I think 12 of their first 16 points were
in transition. That's been a huge focus for us all week coming into this game
was transition and yet we didn't handle that very well. Postseason is about
preparing when the ball doesn't go in. How are you going to win?  
  
Allowing a team to shoot 64% in the second half, and going 11 of 30 at the rim
in the paint isn't the recipe. We've got to get better at that. Again, I don't
want to take anything away from Iowa State. They were the better team today.
I'm ecstatic looking forward to postseason play, and I'm ecstatic to get away
from Big 12 teams because this league is so good. I look forward to that
opportunity next week.  
  
Q. Leyton, could you talk more about the defensive problems today beyond
just transition? Iowa State is really good on offense, but they were really
effective today.  
LEYTON HAMMONDS: I would say just guard the ball and being there on help side
and mainly communicating, because when we didn't talk they made us pay.  
  
There were moments out there when we were talking. We were there off the ball.
We were guarding the ball, and there were times we didn't and they made us pay
and they made the shots and give them credit. They played really well today
offensively, and when we didn't do the right things out there today, they made
us pay.  
  
Q. Cameron, can you talk about how difficult it is for teams to deal
with Monté Morris and the kind of problems we presents? I know Jawun does the
same for you guys, but when you guys are on defense and a point guard like
that, what does he do to you?  
CAMERON McGRIFF: He definitely tries to control the game and he doesn't get
sped up as much, and he also goes for rebounds on both ends of the floors
which really hurts sometimes on the offensive end for them. He just doesn't
really turn the ball over, one of the best turnover ratios in the country.  
  
Q. Leyton, your Coach mentioned he's going to be happy to get away from
the Big 12 and all the teams you keep seeing. How excited are you to see
"fresh meat" in the NCAA Tournament?  
LEYTON HAMMONDS: I'm very excited. This is the best time of the year. I'm
blessed I get to play in this tournament again, and like Coach says, we put
ourselves in a place to play in this tournament and hopefully get a good seed.
I'm excited to play against somebody else, I mean, because it's kinda going to
be different. We've never played against these teams before. It's a different
league, and it's going to be exciting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, guys. We will let you return to the locker
room. Thanks for coming. Good luck as we move through March Madness. Questions
for Coach Underwood?  
  
Q. Brad, after the Kansas game the other day you said you guys can put
the ball in the basket and that gives you a chance to win in postseason. How
difficult is it, though -- how much do you worry about the defensive end? The
other team can put the ball in the basket, also.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We spent a majority of the week working on the defensive end,
and, again, give them credit. I should have mentioned in my opening statement,
you know, Monté Morris assist away from a triple-double. That's a pretty
effective day at the office. They caused so many problems because they have
tremendous size on the perimeter, and it's something that we don't have. Great
size.  
  
Those guys have a tremendous ability with their experience to jump up and make
hard shots and contested shots and Naz hit a couple, or one in the first half,
and I think Matt hit one in the first half. I mean, we were right there!  
  
But, again, we spent a majority of the week working on the defensive end, and,
again, you don't anticipate that night where you go, 11 for 30 at the rim.
Mitchell Solomon has 8 offensive rebounds and 4 points. We've got to have a
better ratio than that. That's frustrating.  
  
Q. Brad, as much of a relief as it is to get way from the Big 12 and
especially some of the guards you guys have come up against, how you should
that grind and that experience help you next week?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: That's what we're going to talk about. We've got a few days
here. I think the silver lining in losing is you get kind of freshen up
mentally and physically a little bit. Recharge. We don't know who we will
play, but I think there's a certain level of excitement about going to the
tournament. It's so special. I want our guys to enjoy that moment, never take
that moment for granted, have that experience, have that moment and then you
have to play well. But it's knowing that we've been through what is in my
opinion the best league in the country, prepares you for a lot. I can promise
you we're not going to see better point guards than what we've seen night-in
and night-out in this league.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you approach this week? You've got a full week. Do you
give the guys more than a day off, a couple of days off? How do you approach
intensity as far as practice coming up? Do you look at it as trying to help
these guys get legs, what will you be working on? How is it different than a
regular week in the Big 12?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think there will be some downtime for sure. I think you've
got to understand that if you lose you go home. So, you know, beating them up
this week is not the answer, and whether it's a week from today or a week from
tomorrow, when we play, we've got a little bit of time. But we also have
things we have to go back to the drawing board on and clean up and make a
better effort to do a few things. That will enable us to win. The important
thing is I want our players to relish the moment and to never take that for
granted.  
  
We'll talk about that some. I've talked about -- I always talk about that with
my teams in the past and I think it's something that we've got to be in the
right frame of mind and go out and have a lot of fun and play very hard.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been a while since your team has lost three games in a
row, and, again, three games against three really good basketball teams. Going
into this part of season where every game now is more magnified, are you
concerned at all that this is a first time in a while that your team has been
on this kind of a losing streak?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: No, I was bothered more by today. Iowa State on Senior Night,
that was a high-level basketball game. Kansas, No. 1 in the country, high-
level basketball game. Both teams, we played really, really well. Tonight was
more of a fluke, I think, missing 19 shots in the paint. I hope it wasn't
anything more than that. I was disappointed. I thought it steam rolled, but
everybody -- there are so few teams that are going to win their last game at
the high major level that are going into postseason. You have one conference
winner in your five power conferences, a lot of teams going in on a less. We
will approach that and get our guys mentally right for that.  
  
Q. Coach, is there an anticipated seeding that you think you guys will
get come Sunday?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I wouldn't even guess. Every time I've thought about that in
the past, I've been wrong. There's so many factors that go into it because of
where you can play teams. You know, if you're look at North Carolina and
Kansas as one seeds, we've played them. So we can't play 'em early. And how
that all factors out and where the at-larges go, man, it gets to be way too
complicated for me. I'm not near smart enough to figure all that stuff out,
but I think our league is excellent and I think that will give us an
opportunity to be a decent seed.  
  
Q. Brad, when it comes to the NCAA Tournament is there a style of team
that you fit better against or a style of team, the make-up of a team that you
don't fit well against? How much do you look at that?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think we've played just about -- I think that's the one
thing we did in our nonleague schedule. When you play UConn, Georgetown.
Georgetown was huge. Carolina was huge, had great guards. Maryland. I think
we've seen just about everything. I think the one thing that, you know, West
Virginia in this league is very big. We've had success against them. TCU is
very big.  
  
So I think it's a matter of how we play more than what the other opponent has
or doesn't have, and I think we're capable of beating anybody. I think it's
more about toughness, more about execution, and that's why Iowa State won
today.  
  
Q. Back on the defense today, sounds like you attribute today more to
just Iowa State's offensive excellence more so than maybe your defensive
shortcomings other than the transition? Would that be accurate?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, Iowa State makes you score against them. You have to
score. You have to take advantage. We have 19 offensive rebounds, and I don't
know what our second-chance, I guess we had 25 second-chance points, but you
have to score against them because they've pretty much done it all year long.
And they do it from three. If you're getting 2s, you've got to be very
efficient.  
  
When you don't score, every breakdown becomes magnified a little bit on the
defensive end. Seemed like every time we got multiple stops or had an
opportunity, we weren't able to score, take advantage of it. It was missed
layups or missed -- we got a couple of clean looks, and Jeffrey Carroll had a
driving layup. You guys have all seen, Jeff doesn't miss that. Jeff misses a
layup, and it's an and-one at the other end. I think it was a 2 or 3-point
game at that point, so they put a lot of pressure on you to be good
offensively and we weren't. When you get multiple stops you consider yourself
fortunate, but you better take advantage of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach. Good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

### [Jarrett Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32905)

### [Andrew Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22007)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 63, Texas - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, University of Texas has arrived, Coach Shaka Smart. His
student-athletes are Jarrett Allen and Andrew Jones. Coach, we'll go to you
for your thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
SHAKA SMART: Congratulations to West Virginia. They did what West Virginia
does so well. They were the more aggressive team. Over the course of the game,
I think there was a cumulative affect of the way they play. Obviously they
shot the ball better from outside. That was a big difference as well. But
congratulations to them. I think they have a great chance to win this
tournament and make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. How much was West Virginia's aggressiveness, how much did that take
you out of your game?  
ANDREW JONES: West Virginia is known to be playing hard and aggressive. That's
their MO and their style of play as a team. At certain points of the game,
them being overly aggressive on us, and on the bigs, took us out of our
offense a little bit.  
  
JARRETT ALLEN: Andrew said it perfectly. They sped us up. We couldn't actually
get into our flow and just congratulations to West Virginia.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We will let you go back to the locker room.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, how much was their aggressiveness, how much did that affect
your shooting percentage?  
SHAKA SMART: Good question. I don't think it was affecting our shooting
percentage as much as it affected our flow of what we were trying to do, which
I guess in turn affected our shooting percentage. But, man, we got a lot of
open looks that didn't go in. It's hard to be aggressive defending free
throws, and we shot under 50% from the foul line.  
  
I think some of the possessions where we turned the ball over or forced up a
bad shot, those are the ones where obviously we were really impacted by West
Virginia and the way they defended.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, for coming.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Landen Lucas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28544)

### [Devonte Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27859)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU - 85, Kansas - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Kansas. Coach?  
  
BILL SELF: Obviously we are disappointed that we weren't able to advance, but
give TCU credit. I thought they played well, especially after getting behind
12 or so relatively early and they battled back and finished the half right.
That was where they won the game, was the last three and a half minutes of the
first half and played very well. We tried, but we just didn't quite have it
today. But tip the cap to them because I thought they played very well.  
  
Q. Guys, you've played without key players before but not to have Josh
in this game, what difference was that for you guys and do you feel TCU took
advantage of that?  
LANDEN LUCAS: I think we always had the expectation to step up and replace
guys when we aren't our full team, but with Josh, in his case, I think, he's
helpful because he's so versatile and the way we have been playing with four
guards, having somebody who is capable of having some size and stuff inside
has helped. But, you know, I think guys for the most part stepped up a little
bit. TCU did a good job reading some things and going inside some, but, you
know, we are disappointed that we didn't step up better in the absence of
Josh.  
  
Q. Devonté, we know about the battle-tested games you have won of late.
At any point in your mind did you think you were about to turn it on and step
it up another gear and pull it out?  
DEVONTÉ GRAHAM: Definitely thought we were going to make a little run, and
come back and take the lead and stuff like that, but I think we kind of waited
too late to kind of wake up and get aggressive and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like TCU offensively was maybe more aggressive in terms
of taking the basket because Josh wasn't there to get rebounds for you?  
DEVONTÉ GRAHAM: I felt like they was aggressive, coming off ball screens and
tying to get the ball inside to the big fella, but they did a good job of
making shots and making clutch plays down the stretch.  
  
LANDEN LUCAS: I think that's the nature of their team going after offensive
rebounds like they were, and that's something that we knew they were going to
try to do and that's just something that they're very good at and took
advantage of.  
  
Q. You guys as players have dealt with an abnormally high amount of off-
the-court distractions this year. What has been your level of frustration with
that?  
LANDEN LUCAS: It's frustrating in a way, but we also know that when we step on
to the court and we are in practice, when we are together as a team we can get
away are from that and we have been doing a pretty good job of handling that.
I'm not sure it was a huge factor in this. Distractions happen and we
understand that we have to eliminate them going forward especially in the
postseason, and it can be frustrating and I think we've responded pretty well.
Today we just came up a little short.  
  
Q. Devonté, how did you feel you came back off that injury in the first
half, and what do you think from tonight? You have a different lineup next
week with Josh in the lineup, but what do you feel like you may have learned
tonight that can be applied to next week and beyond?  
DEVONTÉ GRAHAM: I feel fine and we just gotta come out and play from the jump,
you know. We've got to start taking teams hard, you know. Just trying to put
our foot on their throat and not give them momentum, especially if we feel
like we're the better team. Everybody just got to get aggressive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thank you for coming and good luck next week.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference in the last three minutes of the
first half and beginning of the second half?  
BILL SELF: You know, I think when Lagerald got two fouls, when we subbed. Our
bench wasn't very good today and we go from up 12 at the under-four timeout to
down 1, and then they stretched that to 9 or 11. So that's 13 and 10. That's a
23-point swing in a matter of nine minutes, let's say. That's where they won
the game. We were very poor there.  
  
But, you know, the bottom line is we had the ball up 4 with under two. We
throw a lob to no one, or we didn't jump. I don't know if it was a good pass,
bad pass. They score. We're up 2. Svi throws it to them for a layup, tie game,
get a great shot and Landen misses it and then they score and we foul on the
last play obviously so they just played such a better last two minutes. We had
a chance to win the game late and didn't take advantage of it, but the middle
eight minutes of the game is where it really hurt us the most.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the challenges now facing you and your coaches and
the players moving into the tournament off of an early and disappointing loss
like this?  
BILL SELF: Well, you know, I think we could get a little healthier. We can
certainly get rested. We wouldn't have much left for tomorrow, I don't
believe, considering five guys played above 35 minutes. But I think the
reality of it is -- and Devonté hit it on the head. I think we've got to do
things to make people play poorly. TCU shot a lot of layups today. A lot and
their ball screen offense was good and we didn't handle it very well, much
like we did the first time we played 'em down there.  
  
So certainly we gotta tighten up some stuff and, you know, a lot of that just
falls on me. Getting our guys more prepared. I don't think it's the end of the
earth by any stretch, but it is very disappointing that, you know, you work
your ass off all year long and you get to postseason where it's championship
week and everybody is excited to be a part of it and you go home early.
Hopefully that will be a good motivator for us moving forward. Doesn't mean
anything is broken, but certainly we've got to tighten some things up.  
  
Q. Following up on that last question, do you give yourself and the guys
a couple of days to kind of decompress from this before you start looking
toward the big tournament?  
BILL SELF: We'll take tomorrow off. But we'll practice hard on Saturday, and
we will practice on Sunday now. I haven't thought it through on what our
practice schedule is going to be like this week. If we go to Tulsa I'm pretty
sure that's a Friday game if I'm not mistaken, so, you know, you could go
Saturday, Sunday, Monday off and then practice -- start practicing again on
Tuesday. We will get a couple of days off, but we do need to practice even if
not long we need to be in the gym.  
  
Q. Playing without Josh, what was the biggest void for the team today?  
BILL SELF: I would say depth. That to me more than anything. Today was a day
where our bench needed to be good and obviously we didn't get much out of 'em,
out of our bench. That was disappointing because it forced guys to play too
many minutes and you shouldn't be playing -- when you play TCU and they played
last night we should be the fresher team and they were the fresher team late
because they were able to sub more.  
  
Q. Bill, you brought up five guys playing 35 minutes or more and Frank
in the locker room used the term "energy" a lot. Is it going to be nice for
you to have a break here considering the lack of depth you have had to deal
with all year?  
BILL SELF: Today was a different deal. If you have another guy that plays 32
minutes it changes your whole depth situation. But, yeah, it will be nice. I
wasn't hopeful it would be a one and out type deal at all. But it's be not the
worst thing that we can get our legs back under us. But the reality of it is,
we played on Saturday. We didn't practice Sunday or Monday. We were sharp,
really sharp on Tuesday.  
  
So I don't think it's that. I just think when you're asking Frank and those
guys to do so much. They need to be able to get a minute or two break a couple
of times a half if at all possible and of course today we couldn't go there.  
  
Q. Bill, you're not going to lose your No. 1 seed you may be No. 1
overall. You get a couple of days rest. How you should Josh feel about today,
he basically took himself out of the game with what he did?  
BILL SELF: He feels bad. He feels bad. I'm not trying to minimize anything,
but he did, you know, with the mistake, he went and took care of his business
and did that stuff. But it was a culmination of things because we had an
incident -- one other incident before. So certainly he feels bad and he could
have handled it better. Certainly that's -- it's a teaching moment not only
for me, but also for our guys to learn and hopefully be better from it. So I'm
disappointed that he didn't get a chance to play. He's disappointed, but I
think he will respond favorably to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Deonte Burton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24937)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State - 92, Oklahoma State - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Iowa State Cyclones, Coach Prohm, his two
student-athletes today, Monté Morris and Deonte Burton. Coach, congratulations
on your victory. Your thoughts?  
  
STEVE PROHM: It was just a great win. First game is always they say toughest
to get, but proud of our guys. We were up 12 first half. They cut it to three.
They responded the second half, I think they got it down to 2; but our seniors
were great. When our seniors -- they go 21, 14, 13, 17. We're a tough team to
beat. So proud of them, and now it's on to the next game. These two guys next
to me, they're the catalysts. Deonte is a tough, tough match-up, and Mr. Bob
Cousy down there is the best point guard in the country, 21 points, 10
rebounds, 9 assists. I don't know how much tape we're watching with that Bob
Cousy Award not to have him as a top-5 guy in the country. He's not going to
say it so I just want to say it for him. He would have been a great
representative for that award and what it's about, for what he's done for this
program on and off the floor. He's going to finish as the national assist-to-
turnover ratio in the country, the best ever. Lead Iowa State as an all-time
assist leader. His team is in the top 25. Lost 2 NBA guys off his team last
year, and he had it all on his shoulders and he's responded in every way.  
  
I'm going to make up my own award for him at the award ceremony at the end of
the year, but I told him then I wanted to win this game because he deserves
that recognition and for some reason he got slighted on that and it's just
disappointing because he would have been an awesome ambassador for that ward.  
  
We beat a really good team, and this is a Sweet 16 match-up, I said that the
other day and got tons of respect for Jawun Evans. He is as good as anybody in
the country as well and Coach Underwood is one of the elite coaches. So it is
a great win and now it's on Kansas or TCU.  
  
Q. Monté, does that lack of recognition inspire you or motivate you?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: Definitely. I just got to play with a chip on my shoulder.
Obviously I haven't showed enough, so I'm going to take it head on and play
with a chip on my shoulder and not talk much and be silent, how I move and
just play on the court.  
  
Q. Monté, they were having trouble in terms of getting back in
transition and closing out on you guys at the 3-point line. Does that make you
want to push it up more? What are the thoughts going on in your head when you
see their defense sagging off like that?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: We've been working on getting the ball out quick. Coach been
pushing me Donovan as far as playing with pace, and Deonte does a great job
when we get scored on giving me the ball and going out quick so I can find the
shooters. We did that a lot tonight and it hurt 'em. We was making shots and
it was good for us.  
  
Q. Monté, did you have any idea you were close to a triple-double in the
final minutes of the game?  
MONTÉ MORRIS: Yeah. People was telling me, Greg came up to me, GA, and let me
know, but you don't play for stats you play for the win. That's
extracurricular and I'm just fortunate we got the win tonight.  
  
Q. Deonte, you guys seemed to get a lot of high efficiency shots, a lot
of shots right at the basket and a lot of open threes. Is that the game plan?
Don't settle for anything mid-range, try to get to the basket for the open
three?  
DEONTE BURTON: We just -- the game plan was -- well, Coach always tells me,
don't settle; so, yes, the game plan was not settling and to be aggressive and
the plays panned out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations. We will see you tomorrow. Questions now for Coach?  
  
Q. I know you guys feature the 3-point shot, but 8 out of 9 in the
second half that's pretty good?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, in the first half in that stretch we were up 12. We had a
small lineup and we didn't get a lot of good shots and the couple that we did,
I think Naz was short on a couple and Matt Thomas. But I think Matt and Naz
shooting in the second half and then Donovan off the bench, those two big 3s
were huge. Naz's in the corner were big and Matt kinda got us going and that's
the thing we do best is we can space people out and make shots.  
  
We were 12 and 24 from 3 and we were close in rebounding, too many offensive
rebounds, but the 3 point shot is a good weapon for us. When we share the ball
and make shots we're a very good team and this last ten games our team has
improved a lot in a lot of areas.  
  
Q. Steve, would you have minded seeing Monté be a little selfish in that
final 30 seconds and try to pick up an assist?  
STEVE PROHM: No, not in that -- if it was with a minute -- I told him to hold
it and Monté just backed it out and held it and Naz being a great teammate he
went and took the turnover for him, but not in that situation. I don't know if
it was the Baylor game or the Oklahoma State on senior night, but Monté was a
rebound short of a triple-double. He's had a triple-double and then in two
games he has been an assist shot and a rebound shot in two out of the last
three games.  
  
I love that kid. I'm just really proud of the growth he's made. He's had an
unbelievable career here, and he's going to go down as one of the best. I
don't think he would have wanted it that way, and I wouldn't wanted to do that
to the game and I wouldn't want to do that to Oklahoma State. So if it
happened in a minute, minute and a half, that might have been different, but
not in that last possession.  
  
Q. When you're playing Oklahoma State that can score in bunches and
handle the ball, I think they had only 5 turnovers, do you go in thinking
we've got to outscore these guys? It's going to be hard to stop 'em, but we
will probably get some stuff on offense?  
STEVE PROHM: No, our guys are already thinking offense a lot, so we really
preach to them if we can -- the better defensive team will win this game, or
have a chance to put themselves in position. Our guys are going to think
offense already. That is in their DNA between our four seniors because they
can all really score. They can make tough shots. Oklahoma State is very good
offensively. We were lucky tonight with some threes, you know. Forte missed a
couple. Carroll missed a couple, but we held them to 39% defensive field goal
percentage, and that was huge. But run good offense. They are very good in
transition. They have got one of the elite top guards in the country in Jawun
Evans who is tough to corral. That's why they play the way they do, and I know
they're No. 1 or 2 most efficient offense in the country.  
  
So it's going to be high scoring. I think it's been 96-86, 82-79, or 86-83
last game and this game was in the 90s. But you've got to preach as much
defense as you can to our guys if we want to continue to win at this time of
the year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Elijah Macon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32906)

### [Jevon Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30568)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia - 63, Texas - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we're ready to begin with West Virginia, Coach Bob
Huggins, his two student-athletes tonight, Jevon Carter and Elijah Macon. We
will go directly to questions for our student-athletes and then we will come
back for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Jevon, I just wanted to know if you can recall the sequence where
Nathan Adrian stole the ball near the West Virginia bench, kicked it to you
for the open 3-pointer and the game had gotten tight. But that seemed to open
things up a little bit. There was no hesitation in you getting that 3-pointer.
Can you take us through that sequence?  
JEVON CARTER: We did a good job on the press. Guys were getting the handle on
the ball. Nate did what he does. He came up with the steal, saved it to me, I
caught it, and noticed I was wide open and just shot it in.  
  
Q. Jevon, after seeing a top seed loose in a tournament like this, a guy
who has been to these tournaments for -- you're the elder statesman. Is there
any message to your guys before you come out that this could happen, that you
could get knocked off and how do you get up for that game after you see the
top seed go down?  
JEVON CARTER: Honestly, we didn't really pay too much attention to what other
teams are doing. It's about us. We just take it one game at a time, you know.
You can't play the next game unless you win the current game, so that was just
a message to the team, like, just focus on this game and whatever happens
after that is going to happen.  
  
Q. Elijah talk about going up against Jarrett Allen and their bigs,
what's the challenge going against those guys?  
ELIJAH MACON: Definitely their length. They're kind of like Baylor. Once you
net inside you have to pump-fake those guys. You can't just go in and shoot a
layup. They're going to get a lot of blocks, so playing against their length
would be the biggest things and getting that ball into the middle. That's the
hardest thing playing against those guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on your victory tonight. We'll see you tomorrow. Good luck.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Knowing that you guys will be highly seeded when seedings come out on
Sunday, how do you approach these conference tournament games knowing that you
will be one of the higher seeds coming into next week?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we're trying to win. We didn't get it done in the finals a
year ago, and just no sense playing if you're not playing to win. So we're
trying to win.  
  
Q. Are your guys motivated by that, getting to the final last year and
not finishing it off?  
BOB HUGGINS: Are they what?  
  
Q. Motivated?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know, man. You ask me to know what they're thinking. I
wish I knew. We obviously didn't play very well today. Didn't shoot it very
well from the free throw line. Didn't make layups. They've been a good group
to coach because they do want to win. You think about the way we play. We had
three guys play 30 minutes which I didn't really want to do, or over 30
minutes, but we play a lot of people.  
  
You know, I think sometimes guys want to play the whole game and they take
about two-thirds of the game off when they try to play the whole game. These
guys have been really good about sharing playing time. Elijah has been great,
and Brandon Watkins has been great with sags, trying to teach him and
obviously he makes a difference for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. We'll let you go. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Johnathan Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30603)

### [Jake Lindsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32924)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 70, Baylor - 64  
  
SCOTT DREW: Coming into this tournament we knew that anyone could win it
because of the parity in the league and it didn't matter what anyone was
seeded. We've had success before, but at the end of the day, you gotta win
that first game to get things going and you really got to credit Kansas State.
I thought they've been the first or second best defensive team in the league,
and second half for them to shoot 65% from the field, 60 from the three and 70
from the free throw line. They made the plays. They earned it. We didn't make
free throws. We got 16 offensive rebounds and we only got 6 points out of 'em.  
  
So we didn't convert play like we needed to. Hopefully this will come to help
us in the NCAA Tournament because that's -- if it does, then it's been worth
it. But I really credit Kansas State for playing a really good game and really
offensively executing well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jake Lindsey and Johnathan Motley.  
  
Q. Johnathan, you dislocated your finger. Was it hard to get hold of the
ball? Did you feel like it impacted your game after that somewhat?  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: No, it happened before and I played through it. So it's all
good.  
  
Q. Jake, did you feel like -- was their defense stopping y'all from
getting into up of a groove? How did you see that?  
JAKE LINDSEY: They did a great job of overloading the paint and keeping us out
of there and we didn't do a good job initially of recognizing it and moving
the ball, getting -- moving the defense before we tried to get it into the
paint, getting it into Mot and Joe. They scouted us well and executed, so you
have to give them credit.  
  
Q. Jake, tied at 25 at half. Did they do anything or make any type of
adjustments that you guys haven't seen, or shots just weren't falling for you
guys?  
JAKE LINDSEY: Well, you said 25-25 at half?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JAKE LINDSEY: We ended with 64. So offense wasn't the problem in the second
half. They blasted us on defense. I was not good enough. We fell for pump
fakes on guys who were drivers. We didn't guard the ball. We didn't fight for
post position. We didn't get it done defensively in the second half, and
that's where we lost the game.  
  
Q. Johnathan, y'all had 16 offensive rebounds, only 6 points. How
frustrating was that missing a lot of the put backs?  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: Very frustrating because we usually do a good job of
capitalizing on offensive rebounds, and like Jake said they did a good job of
overloading the paint, making sure we were shooting over multiple hands. We
should have kicked it out for threes and things like that. Credit to Kansas
State. They did an awesome job in the paint.  
  
Q. Jake, obviously you have to put this game behind you pretty quick.
How much are you looking forward to Sunday and when the bids are handed out?  
JAKE LINDSEY: Well, you have to learn from every loss, but you also have to be
able to move on from a loss. So that's something when you are an experienced
team you've done that before and you kind of learn how to do that. But
Selection Sunday is a blessing. We can never forget that and we did a good job
to put ourselves in the position to be part of it early.  
  
So now we have to get back to what we were doing, and, you know, maybe how we
were being collectively together as a team early on in the year and get back
to that feeling.  
  
Q. Jake, it was a desperation mode there at the end but the lift that Al
gave you in trying to get back in the game and the roll that he got on there.
Talk about that?  
JAKE LINDSEY: Al did a great job. He was in the spots he needed to be in. He
made the right reads of how his man was playing him and I was able to get him
the ball and he did a good job finishing. We could have had a little more
poise in the last minute. I got beat off the dribble and that hurt us. But Al
came in and gave us a big lift. He's been a big part of our team and a big
part of the program the last couple of years. So that type of performance
doesn't surprise me. He's a great player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Good luck
next week. Questions for Coach Drew?  
  
Q. Coach, with the suspensions and the injuries over the last month and
the lineup changing the way it has, do you think that's difficult for the team
to readjust all the time?  
SCOTT DREW: It's difficult for me. So I think Manu, it's great to have him
back. He really played well. Now we will have a little more chance to practice
with him and get back into a rotation, and that will be easier on everybody.
But that's our biggest strength to our team is our depth. It's not these five
guys. It's this team, and that's a challenge as a coach. But also it's -- the
team, why we've been successful, why we've won 25 games is because we've had
different people step up.  
  
Tonight we didn't have enough people step up. I thought Brown stepped up for
them. Maurice stepped up for them. Ervin stepped up for them, and we all play
percentages, Brown shooting 25% from three, 4 for 4, 9 for 13 from the free
throw line. Going into the game, he's the guy we would have tried to foul.  
  
They made plays. They earned it. They deserved it and you gotta give them
credit. I know they were going to come out with a lot of intensity because
this was a big game for 'em, as far as the NCAA Tournament, and I thought they
answered the bell and they won this game. They deserved it.  
  
Q. Scott, did you feel like you were kind of playing a desperate team
tonight in K-State?  
SCOTT DREW: One thing is sometimes when you are desperate you don't make shots
because you're too tight, so them being desperate and making shots is a good
thing. Hopefully we learned that or execute that from this game in a week,
because we don't want our season to end and we definitely don't want it to end
like this.  
  
So if we've learned that lesson then it's been worth it. No one likes to lose
any game, but we know the most important part of our season is ahead of us and
hopefully we can learn from this and make sure that we're successful in that
part of the season.  
  
Q. Scott, did you get maybe more out of Manu than you expected, and was
there any -- he wasn't in there I think maybe the last three minutes. Was that
because it had flared up or he just needed the rest?  
SCOTT DREW: I wanted to keep him around 20 minutes. He was playing well, doing
well and stepped on someone's foot or stubbed it a little bit. We saw him
start to limp and I know he wanted to stay in, but we obviously need him
healthy for next week. So D.C. will make sure he's good to go.  
  
Q. How good was Kansas State's defense? I know you shot 45, 46% but it
seems like you were at the end of the shot clock quite a bit tonight?  
SCOTT DREW: All I know is we've reviewed three of our late shot clocks and
none of 'em have counted. Their late shot clocks went in. You gotta credit
them for making shots. This was really about our defense and their offense.
Our defense wasn't great, but they still made shots. You foul a 3-point
shooter, he's not supposed to make the shot, right? They get 4 points.  
  
So you've got to credit them. Defensively, when one is playing well you've got
to raise to their level. I thought our attention to defense, our pick and roll
one of the coaches had a heart attack on the bench because it's the worst it's
been and that's his bread and butter thing, and we will get better for it.
Credit them for executing in it.  
  
Q. Scott, how forward are you looking to Sunday, the Selection Show, and
are you concerned that this might hurt your seeding?  
SCOTT DREW: They look at the full body of work and there is no bad loss in the
Big 12. With us coming in we knew it was anyone's tournament. That's why we've
been on the 2 line, 1 line, 3 line, whatever, because of our full body of
work. We'll take the positive, go home, get rest, get healthy, practice a
little bit, and hopefully we'll play desperate and execute like Kansas State
did come next week. Then it's been a great thing for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck next week.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU - 85, Kansas - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by TCU, Coach Jamie Dixon and his three
student-athletes, Desmond Bane, Brandon Parrish, Kenrich Williams. Coach,
we'll call on you first for an opening statement.  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Thank you very much. Great win for our program, our school, our
university and a great win for these guys. Talking about battling and going
through a tough stretch, a losing streak, but never stopped believing and kept
going, and as I said I thought we were a better team as that stretch went by
where we got losses. So all we did today was make free throws down the
stretch, and that's what we hadn't done and I think that's growth and I think
that's maturity and I'm looking forward to getting ready for tomorrow, and I
know these guys are as well.  
  
Proud of 'em because it took everybody. It took the whole team and that's what
we didn't use last night and that's what we'll use tomorrow.  
  
Q. Desmond, could you just take me through drawing the shooting foul
from Svi and making the three foul shots and what's obviously a hostile
building for you today?  
DESMOND BANE: For sure. We ran a high-ball screen for one of our better
penetrators, Alex Robinson, and I know he likes to throw that drift pass to
the corner and I was spotting up, hands-free, ready, and he found me and I
shot and luckily I got fouled, stepped to the line, all my teammates came up
to me, tried to calm me down, make sure everything was cool and I stepped up
to the line and knocked 'em down.  
  
Q. How different was this KU team without Josh Jackson?  
BRANDON PARRISH: I mean, they're a good team without missing any single
player. They're a team that wins based off their team effort each and every
night. Without him it took away one of their dynamic scorers and dynamic
rebounders. So we figured if we could defend and be solid on the defensive end
and try to make somebody else beat us tonight and it ended up working out for
us.  
  
Q. Brandon, of all the guys up there you've been there the longest for
this turn-around. I'd like everybody to talk about what this means, but I
kinda think maybe it means a little more to you than anybody else up there.  
BRANDON PARRISH: Man, this is the win of my career, right here, to be
completely honest! It was a lot of times where we would look at things in the
media and people would tell us that we were never good enough, we would never
be able to get it done. I used to read articles that said me and Karvair
Shepherd weren't ever going to be good enough to win in the Big 12, and this
is a huge win for us.  
  
This is the high point of my whole career right here and I'm glad to have
these guys, my brothers with me to live it up with me.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we've been here -- I've been here for three years,
Brandon has been here for four. Our whole careers have been sort of the
underdogs so just coming here and making a run is big for us. Of course we had
a great year but the year's not over. Looking forward to the next game and
moving forward.  
  
Q. Brandon, when you talk about this series of match-ups, what did you
guys take from the previous two games you had against KU and were able to work
it in and play off of it today?  
BRANDON PARRISH: Well, in our previous two we played a good first half in each
game and we figured if we came out here this game and put two halves together
we could actually get it done. We were down double digits in the first half
and we showed so much resilience and responded. By the half we were up 1 and
we figured if we came back with the energy that we played with the last 4
minutes of the first half we could make it happen. The sky is the limit for
us, and like I said, it worked out for us.  
  
Q. You knew the run was probably coming even though you had the double
digit lead in the second half. How did you prepare for that? Especially in
this building it's almost like Allen Fieldhouse East, and you knew the crowd
was going to get into it as well.  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Of course Kansas is a great team so their fans travel, but
Coach told us they're going to make a run, and they came and we responded well
to it, and it worked out for us in the end. We really responded well.  
  
BRANDON PARRISH: I mean, like I said, they're the No. 1 team in the nation for
a reason. We've seen numerous times where they've been down, down big in the
second half and they've come back and found a way to win. So we just wanted to
be able to respond each and every time. We knew they were going to make a run,
but at the end of the day when they're making runs you've got to continue to
make plays. That's what we did, whether it was a three or a strong-finish
layup or we got to the line. We just found ways to get it done.  
  
DESMOND BANE: Building off what Brandon and Kenrich said, they're the No. 1
team in the country for a reason, but Coach has been preaching to us to stick
together this whole time through this losing streak. That's what we did. They
made a run and we stuck together and found a way to make plays down the
stretch to get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on the victory. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jamie, people will see this result around the nation and say Josh
Jackson wasn't there. How much does that diminish the effort today?  
JAMIE DIXON: None. Again, everybody has guys that play and don't play, get in
foul trouble. We had a number of guys if foul trouble. Every time we've played
them we've been in foul ball trouble, amazingly. I think it's how we did it.
We're a really good team and we somehow went down the stretch -- we lost
games. Really the main difference today was we made free throws down the
stretch that we hadn't made. I think if you look at our results and our
numbers you can see that. I know in some of the rankings where they would take
in the margin of victories, we are ranked pretty high. We're ranked as an NCAA
Tournament team. We just lost some games and whether it was youth and we had
obviously some strange plays at the end of games that everybody saw on
national TV. So I think everybody knows we're a good team that lost some tight
games, and, you know, we played 'em two other times and it was the same game,
really. But we were ahead in the second half. We were ahead in the second half
in both games. This time we talked about how they're going to preach about the
rebounding, rebounding, rebounding because we outrebounded them by 8 in the
first half, and I'm sure that's what they were talking about, talking about
and talking about. Certainly we got it done. They made up some of the margin,
but we came out ahead where we needed to be against this team.  
  
Q. They're so dynamic with that four-guard lineup that they have. When
you take Jackson out and Graham gets hurt for a period of the game, does that
allow you to focus a little bit differently more energy on Mason? I know he
still scored a lot, but how does that change things?  
JAMIE DIXON: Vick made shots the first time we played 'em. Kenrich was in foul
trouble. We had all our guys in foul trouble. We had a lot of guys sitting
out. Our whole team was in foul trouble, so we had to play through that and
it's part of the game. Every time we played them we're in foul trouble, so
we're used to -- we were used from the last two games of having guys not being
able to play. I think that prepared us, couldn't play Kenrich, Jaylen had to
sit out a lot of the second half, had to pull out Alex because of foul
trouble. Our guys have been in foul trouble and that's been the case every
time we've played them. So it's gotten us ready to play without our guys.  
  
Q. Jamie, how much did you get out of that technical in the first
half?  
JAMIE DIXON: Compared to what Bill's was, I mean, he got his money's worth. I
didn't get mine, that's for sure. It's just part of the game. It's not an easy
game to ref, two teams were playing hard, and, you know, it's just part of the
game. But I have gotten more T's in this league than I think I got in my whole
career.  
  
Q. You guys made a nice run --  
JAMIE DIXON: Right after, yeah, and so did they, too, and they made a huge run
at our place when he got a technical, too, Bill. Again, I said I've gotten
more T's in this league than in the ACC and the Big East combined.  
  
Q. How did that final play unfold from the way you drew it up? What you
wanted?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, we just ran the same thing as we did the play before. We
didn't have a timeout really, so we used it on the first time, saved it for
the second. So we ran the same action. They went and helped on Alex at that
time and obviously that's a play we work on over and over again and Desmond
got to the right spot. I was just hoping he was okay. He got knocked -- he got
hit so hard I was wondering if he was going to be able to shoot the free
throws. He's the guy we wanted shooting.  
  
Q. I think it was Brandon who talked about Josh Jackson's rebounding
presence. With him not in there, do you feel like your guys were more
aggressive in terms of attacking the basket, because they knew he wasn't going
to be there to crash the boards?  
JAMIE DIXON: No, no, I don't think that was any factor at all.  
  
Q. To come back and do this at your alma mater, personally, this win
kind of take us through your feelings right now?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I mean, at this point I think that's the first time since
the game was over I remembered this was my alma mater. Just the whole ride has
been unbelievable. It's been fun, fun for my family, fun to see friends, fun
to see guys I've known for 35 years sitting behind our bench, and this is why
I did it. I felt if anybody could turn this program around, why not me? We're
not there yet. This is one win but we're obviously making progress. The
interest is there. The fans are coming and we've gotten better.  
  
This is what you have to establish, winning a game like this when you go
through a tough road, tough losses, you're down, you have a lead, you give it
away, they go up and then you find a way. So we're just trying to teach that
fight, that scrappiness and that emotion.  
  
I think that's really what I've tried to bring to it. You've got to teach
fight and never give up and that's kinda, you know, what I've tried to do my
whole career. But this place really needed it, I believed, and maybe there is
more passion in it because this is my place. I don't know that, but I'm just
lucky that Chris hired me and Chancellor Boschini hired me because it was
always a dream. I never thought it might happen, and as things turned out all
of the sudden it came to a couple of days all of the sudden it was there for
me, an opportunity, and I thought for a second it was going to get away. I
wouldn't be able to go. But my family is excited and this is just a start. I'm
really looking forward to the road.  
  
Q. You've talked about how everybody really contributed to this win, but
in particular what you got off the bench from Desmond? What you got off the
bench from Brandon? How essential was that, and were you planning to play them
as much as you did? Or did they just earn more time as the game went along?  
JAMIE DIXON: Foul trouble. I knew we were going to be in foul trouble. You're
always in foul trouble against Kansas. You've got to be prepared to do that.
Desmond's passing was really good. I worry about him at times with pressure,
getting used to it. But he's gotten better over time. He's no longer a
freshman, but we needed him because all of our guys were in foul trouble,
Kenrich, Jaylen and we went four guards. We wanted to do that more with
Kenrich at the 4, but we just haven't been able to do it but my thought was to
play Mike. But obviously Desmond played better and earned the minutes. He
needs to play more. It makes us better. This is a big -- you know, this is a
big step. It's not exactly what he was going against in high school. It's just
great to see. How about knocking down those three free throws in that
situation. He got buried, obviously, I was wondering if he was going to be
able to shoot 'em, like I said. Just big-time play. And Alex hitting the 2
before and as you know, Jimmy, the games we lost really came down to leads
that we missed free throws and some strange games, all of the sudden we would
be -- so beat the No. 1 team, look at our record overall add these two wins.  
  
I felt this was an NCAA Tournament team that didn't get it done for a stretch
there and maybe we had to grow into it and maybe we're growing now rather than
two weeks ago.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Dixon, thanks very much, good luck tomorrow.  
  
JAMIE DIXON: By the way this is a great place to have this. You guys do a
great job. Thank you.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas - 61, Texas Tech - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Shaka
Smart, three student-athletes, Andrew Jones, Kerwin Roach, and Marelk Isom.
Coach, congratulations. Your thoughts?  
  
SHAKA SMART: I thought the second half our guys really made a decision in the
last 10 minutes or so just to be aggressive and attack and did a great job
playing together. Helps when a few of your shots go in as opposed to the first
half. Really proud of the way our guys hung in there and stayed together even
though the game didn't start off great and we had some adversity.  
  
Q. Where has that been all year?  
ANDREW JONES: We finally started to gel and click tonight. That's finally what
happened. We played with more energy and aggressiveness, and we wanted to play
for each other. I knew Kerwin was on a roll. In the second half I decided to
be going to him, feed the high man.  
  
KERWIN ROACH: We just own it. We was feeling it. We had a connection. We was
just running with it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about when you finally got that driving dunk to go down?
You've been trying to get one of those for two years it seems like, but it
finally went down and that energized you guys followed by the back-to-back
threes. Did you feel that that stretch right there? Could you feel the
momentum get goin' in y'all's favor?  
KERWIN ROACH: Definitely. It was part of it. My bench got into it. I was
feeling it for my bench. I just let my hair down after all that. I just let it
loose.  
  
Q. Andrew, could you address specifically the wild scramble play. I
think Kerwin -- I mean Kendal knocked it loose. You get it off the baseline
and kicked it to Snoop on the intentional foul, that sequence there, what
happened?  
ANDREW JONES: It was me who tipped the ball out of No. 2's -- it was one of
the guard's hands, and we know that he's a nonshooter and he's a driver. So I
played off, got my hand on the ball, poked it loose and Kendal aggressively
dove for the ball like Coach always said. Once I seen the ball get loose and
nobody had it I thought I seen ball and I had to go get it, diving school --  
  
SHAKA SMART: Paid off, huh?  
  
ANDREW JONES: It did. I saw Snoop run the floor and that's one thing we know
about each other. If one of us going for the ball and we have it go out, and I
knew Snoop was going to be running. So I just threw it ahead.  
  
Q. Mo, looking at the box score 1 for 13 for you guys from 3-point
range, first half, I don't know what the locker room half-time talk was, but
how important was it to keep sticking with it and you guys got the ball inside
to Jarrett, sticking with the plan despite what happened in the first half?  
MARELK ISOM: We did a good job of finishing the first half off strong and
keeping it close. Even though shots weren't falling we played with good energy
and we knew that it wasn't going to be like that the whole game. But we wanted
to make sure we came out in the second half aggressive on defense and still
getting stops, and in the second half we did a really good job of doing that.
That ended up leading to a lot of our offense and we got some easy ones, and
we finally got a few to go down in the second half.  
  
Q. Snoop, for any of you guys, did it finally hit you the season was
going to be over if you didn't get-goin'?  
KERWIN ROACH: Definitely. Coach said in the locker room this could be our last
20 minutes, and I think when he said that, everyone switched a flip and it was
like this is gar and bar. We have got to play for our fans. Probably going to
be that last game, so go out there and play for them.  
  
ANDREW JONES: We were not trying to go home. We knew in previous games that we
could get Tech. We didn't play our best at their place; and we just, you know,
at halftime we all dug in and started playing harder. One more degree and we
started playing for each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. We'll let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, just thoughts about playing West Virginia? You guys exerted a
lot of energy tonight. They will take more out of you. What are your thoughts
about playing West Virginia?  
SHAKA SMART: Excited. Excited about the opportunity to play 'em. One of the
two teams that played just now was going to get the chance to play them and
one of them was going to go home. So we'll definitely take the opportunity to
play them.  
  
We played them in two games. One at our place, one at their place. I thought
we had some stretches where we really played well. They keep coming at you in
waves. They've got a toughness about them. That obviously comes from Coach
Huggins and his staff and the players they recruit, and I think for us it's
about turning the page quickly from this game, and as Snoop said, letting our
hair down and being aggressive and playing with nothing to lose.  
  
Q. Ending the year like you did on that tough stretch what is it when
you have to kind of pull up your boot straps and get going after halftime.
What's a win like this do to kind of reenergize?  
SHAKA SMART: We've been in a lot of games that we're -- that have played out
the way that this game was playing out through the first 30 minutes or so. So
it was a similar script. I knew that we were going to have to change the
script if we wanted to win. I thought, you know -- obviously a lot of it has
to do with if you can make shots. When you're 1-13 the first half that makes
it tough from outside.  
  
So we made just enough shots and then we went on a run and our guys got a lot
of energy from that run, and I think they gained confidence from that. When we
play with confidence we're a different team, and that's what we're going to
have to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. With 10 minutes left, did they finally get it? Did it flash before
their eyes that this is going to be it?  
SHAKA SMART: I told those guys, I said, what have you got to lose? You've got
nothing to lose. We have a great opportunity to attack. The game is not over.
Our guys were saying all the right things, but we've said all the right things
before and not necessarily gone out and done what we needed to do.  
  
You know, maybe it was the reality that, you know, this would have been our
last game if we didn't really battle and let loose. I thought the play that
you mentioned where we played with great aggressiveness, dove on the floor.
That was a huge difference maker and that's the way we gotta play. That's the
way I want our team to play all the time and obviously we have a long way to
go to get to that point. Plays like that were the difference.  
  
Q. Was there a concerted effort on your guys part to go inside? Coming
out off halftime?  
SHAKA SMART: Yes, you know in the first half of the 13 threes, a lot of them
were good looks. Eric got stone cold wide-open looks in the first two
possessions of the game. But if they're not going, they're not going, and
you've got to figure something else out. They made a good adjustment at their
place on Jarrett. Instead of letting the ball come in directly they fronted
and fought the ball in. So we felt like we could lob it over the top to him a
few times, and we did that.  
  
Today it wasn't his best scoring day, but I thought it was impactful that we
were able to play through him for a stretch in the second half, and it opened
it up for other guys and he also made his free throws.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you and congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Khadeem Lattin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30881)

### [Kameron McGusty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32823)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU - 82  
  
Oklahoma - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Head Coach Lon
Kruger and his two student-athletes, Khadeem Lattin and Kameron McGusty.
Coach, we will call on you for an opening comment.  
  
LON KRUGER: Ball game from that point where it was tied that under four
timeout in the first half from that point on seemed like TCU dictated. They
did things they wanted to do. We were reacting next 25 minutes, and, again, I
thought they played great. We didn't do the things we needed to do to make it
tougher on them.  
  
So Jamie has done a great job. Their club has played well, and we didn't play
well enough for what we need to.  
  
Q. Khadeem, can you talk about what a strange year it's been? You come
off a Final Four season and all the struggles you've had and maybe what you're
looking forward to next year?  
KHADEEM LATTIN: It's been an emotional year, for sure. We've had some -- a few
woes, but I look forward to -- we grew a lot this year. We have been through
some wars and we learned from each one, and I'm proud of my young guys for
figuring that out, and I'm excited for what we're going to do next year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that 29-29 tie and you came out of the timeout and
sort of spurred away. Can you remember what happened? What they were doing
right? What you guys were doing wrong at that point in the game?  
KAMERON McGUSTY: They were pushing the ball and getting into transition and we
weren't executing our sets in their zone and that really hurt us. That's about
it.  
  
Q. Khadeem, you guys lost at various points in this season. Looks like
you got a point guard coming in. How much did it hurt that you didn't have a
consistent point guard play? You had to use two new guys that played well at
times but were getting adjusted to this level of basketball.  
KHADEEM LATTIN: Well, first I would like to say that Jordan Shepherd and
Darrion Strong did the best they could do. They were some really good guys on
the court, and they just continued to grow. So hands down to them, always.  
  
It definitely hurt not having Jordan on the court, a vet who knew what to do.
He's just always had a knack for figuring it out on the court, but I'm excited
for the pieces that we have coming in and the pieces that we already have.  
  
Q. Kameron, can you give us your feelings now that the season is over
and the thoughts going into your head and how you're feeling about it?  
KAMERON McGUSTY: I'm proud of our fight looking back on all that we've been
through, losing Jordan, losing some tough games, going through a lot of stuff.  
  
I mean, a lot of teams would have gave up by now, but we kept fighting and
pushing and we saw the potential we had and at times it showed what we can
really do as a team. I love the way we grew as a team and the way we gelled
together this year. I've never been on a team closer than the 12, 13 guys that
I'm close with now. I just really loved the way we fought.  
  
Q. Khadeem, when a team shoots 60% like TCU did, how much of that is
them just making shots and how much of it is your defense lacking, and how
tough is it for you as a team to come back when a team is shooting the ball as
well as they were today?  
KHADEEM LATTIN: Well, yeah, those guys definitely shot the ball well. But we
could have done way more to just make 'em tougher shots for them and tougher
shot selections. With that being said, when a team is shooting that high of a
percentage you have to give it to them. But they made a lot of those off our
mistakes.  
  
Q. Kameron, you guys seemed to struggle to find shots at times tonight.
They talked about changing defenses. How much of that was a factor?  
KAMERON McGUSTY: I mean, it was a big factor. But I think we definitely can
execute a team running a zone and we just didn't do what we needed to do and
that's unfortunate, but it happens. We're going to come out next year
stronger, ready to fight and hopefully it never has to happen again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. Questions for Coach Kruger?  
  
Q. Lon, at times you made shots and got things done. But it seemed like,
like John said, it didn't come easy all night for you this season, and tonight
were you just having to work too hard for good shots?  
LON KRUGER: Yeah, but we haven't been a club that's shot it consistently well
over the year. At times tonight we shot is well, at times we didn't. They
played zone most of the second half. I thought that troubled us. I didn't
think we had very good flow, very good movement of the ball. When we did have
shots they knocked those down. Had some free throws there in the second half
that made it tough to cut into the lead, and I thought TCU played with better
rhythm and better action than we did tonight and seemed to have the upper hand
especially the last 25 minutes.  
  
Q. Great year last year, a lot of excitement next season with all these
guys back plus Trey Young. How do you rationalize this season? Disappointing
year, but is it something you can live with because of the development of so
many young guys like Kameron and Kristian Doolittle and those guys?  
LON KRUGER: Would have liked to have done more, for sure, to get more wins.
But these guys, like Khadeem mentioned, kept working, kept plugging, kept
making progress. A lot of these young guys got experience. That wasn't the
goal in itself. We wanted to win games as well and disappointed not to win
games that we had in decent position to win on the year. But this group did
grow. They had great attitudes about making progress all year long, and,
again, all of 'em back and anxious to get back to work, I'm sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thanks, Coach.

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Kenrich Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32824)

### [Alex Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32825)

### [Vladimir Brodziansky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32826)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU - 82  
  
Oklahoma - 63  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, truly a great team effort for us, obviously a great
response playing Oklahoma just three days ago. You know, during the stretch I
felt food about this team even though we've had a long streak of losing some
tight games I've felt good about it, and their attitude has been tremendous.
Their work ethic has been great. I think they were rewarded today.  
  
Really unselfish. Alex was terrific, 9 assists, no turnovers. And Jaylen, they
ran the team and both guys, team effort. Ten guys played big minutes for us
and solid minutes and a great effort by our guys. Kenrich was terrific and has
been doing that and people are starting to realize how good of a player he is,
and Vladimir let things come to him and finished on the penetration from those
guys. So a really great effort against a team that's very talented.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our three student-athletes are Vladimir Brodziansky, Alex
Robinson and Kenrich Williams.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the emotions, getting the monkey off the
back, one of your best games of the year and just kinda making it come true
tonight in a big setting like this. How does that feel for you?  
VLADIMIR BRODZIANSKY: I mean, it feels awesome, big game for us, because how
Coach say we just have to come back and play hard and executed.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: I feel like we stuck together as a team even though we did have
that losing streak. We stayed together and we talked about it and we put our
words into actions and we have to continue to do so as this tournament goes
on.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: I feel like we came out and we got stops early and we got
stops the whole game and that's what Coach has been emphasizing at practice
the last couple of days and we came out and executed and did that.  
  
Q. Kenrich, talk a little bit about that 15-2 run. You kinda got it
started with a -- to close the first half is what I mean over the final three
minutes. You had a couple baskets to start it, couple more to finish it.
That's kind of where the game turned. What triggered that for you guys and how
much impact do you feel like that had?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Started at the defensive end. We got multiple stops and my
teammates did a good job of finding me and getting me open, in open positions
for me to make plays.  
  
Q. Alex, did you get a sense that the zone was giving them problems and
was that a big difference in change from Saturday?  
ALEX ROBINSON: We noticed when we switched defenses that there was confusion
on the offensive end which took a lot of time off the shot clock and disrupted
their offense. We figured we would stick with that and we just followed
whatever Coach told us.  
  
Q. Vladimir, after the game in Norman, Coach Dixon mentioned you guys
had wanted to get the ball inside more than you did there, and that one didn't
happen. It happened in a big way tonight. How much of a focus was that? How
much was that in your mind this time around?  
VLADIMIR BRODZIANSKY: I mean, my teammates were just finding me open and I had
the easy job just to finish the plays and we played great offense. We executed
and however to say, I was wide open. They did a great job on penetration.  
  
Q. You've earned a shot at Kansas for tomorrow, top-ranked team in the
country, potential signature win, whatever all that could mean to you. What
are your thoughts about that match-up and what does that opportunity mean to
you to have that?  
ALEX ROBINSON: Well, I think it means a lot. We get to go on to the second
round. Like Coach said, we can't get too high or too low so we've got to treat
every game the same and come in and prepare for it like we did this last one.  
  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Just like Alex said, we've got to come in and play the same
way we played. Play with a lot of energy and get stops defensively and that's
going to give us a good outcome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys we will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Speak just to your first Big 12 men's championship win, your first
shot out?  
JAMIE DIXON: Tournaments are always great, obviously I've been in some really
good ones and everybody told me how great this place was. I obviously had been
in the facility. I coached here before and obviously state of the art, top of
the line, nice facility as there is in the country, so it was great. I was
impressed by the crowd in the game. I looked up at the end, and I said, well,
it's a pretty good crowd at the end of the game there, subbing guys in, so had
a second to relax.  
  
But a lot of people in the crowd and I had been told that they come to all the
games and that's a great thing to see. I was excited about our -- I know this
is the biggest demand we've ever had for Big 12 tickets from our fans. So we
want to start a tradition of making runs in this Big 12 Tournament. That was
something we did at the Big East and what we were known for, so we want to
have a new tradition for this is the place to come for Horned Frog fans to
make the trip from Forth Worth to Kansas City for the weekend. Obviously we're
going to play Kansas tomorrow and obviously they will have a few people in the
stands I think somebody told me.  
  
It will be an opportunity, but we've played good. The biggest things is we
came in confident because I know this streak you've got to look at and wonder
about you if you look at the scores of the games and when we were playing we
felt good. We had two good days of practice, and I think they responded in a
very good way. In no way did I think these guys had given up, so I think we
saw that start to finish tonight.  
  
Q. Jamie, OU has a couple of young point guards they're playing. Fisher
and Alex Robinson give you a lot of quality play. What does it mean when a
trim has a fairly good advantage at point guard?  
JAMIE DIXON: We like our guys. This league is loaded with great point guards.
They're generally older than ours and Coach Kruger's, so there's been some
ups-and-downs with us, but certainly they were on today. They've been really
good. We played two of them. We call 'em both the points and I thought they
were tremendous with the ball, spaced it. They penetrated. Our shot selection
was terrific. We shot 60%. It's gotta be pretty good. One of the things that
we've had that's kept us from winning these close games down the stretch, we
won a bunch of them early was some shot selections and missed free throw. I'm
so excited about these two guys for obvious reasons, and I think y'all saw it
tonight.  
  
Q. You've played Kansas pretty tough for three halves this year. Is that
encouraging?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, we've played everybody. I know if you look back at these
seven losses you look at the games and watch and you would think they won a
couple of 'em down the stretch. I feel good about our team. Obviously they're
terrific, well coached. They've got obviously as good of a guard as there is
in the country.  
  
We're a better team than we were. The record doesn't indicate it, but watching
it on film we're a better team now than we were and I think it all came
together today and we've got to have it come together tomorrow as well, but I
think just handling their runs will be the biggest challenge and that's been a
challenge for us. Sometimes we don't respond with that next possession. That's
where we've got to handle them, because they're terrific, obviously, and
getting a turnover, turning a bad shot into a basket. We just can't have that.
We called a timeout on a one play after we had two questionable shots, and we
got it fixed after that, but we've got to get it changed quicker or we'll be
in trouble tomorrow.  
  
Q. KU is going to be without Josh Jackson tomorrow for a one-game
suspension. How big of a game changer do you think that could be?  
JAMIE DIXON: We played them earlier and he was in foul trouble and Vick killed
us, so it's funny how things work out. They have so many good players that
it's not like they are putting in a guy that hasn't made some baskets in his
career somewhere. They'll have a top-10 ranked guy in the country coming in,
so you're not shuffling in a guy that's just picked up a basketball.  
  
So, you know, he does a lot of different things but Vick does a lot of
different things, too. And then you've got Bragg who is playing better. So
they've got good players across the board, and like I said the first game,
Vick was the guy that beat us.  
  
Q. Can you expand on the timeout after the four-minute mark in the first
half? You guys were tied at 29 and you came out and went on a 12-0 run, took
over the game at that point. What happened at that timeout and when you guys
got out on the court?  
JAMIE DIXON: The defense -- again, the rebounding was key. They were hurting
us on some second shots and keeping them off the foul line, but I think our
shot selection was good. We got a couple of steels out of Kenrich in the man-
to-man, so the change in the defense at the timeout did something when we went
back to man at that point and that helped up.  
  
I think our zone was effective because we kept changing it throughout the game
and that helped us. We've done that a lot of times, but then we have had times
where we got hurt with the zone and didn't use it enough. I think the defense
-- our shot selection was good all the way through. The spacing on the floor
was good, and I thought our guys penetrated and looked to pass a little bit
better than we did the other day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Matthew Temple](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32850)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Texas - 61, Texas Tech - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas Tech, Coach Chris Beard. His
student-athlete with us tonight is Matthew Temple. Coach, an opening
statement?  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Just answering questions.  
  
Q. Matt, playwise did Texas do anything differently in the last ten
minutes, or did their shots just start to fall?  
MATTHEW TEMPLE: Credit to Texas. They started to knock down shots and make
some plays, but they executed in the last 10 minutes of the game and we
didn't. That was kind of the bottom line.  
  
Q. Matt, obviously a couple lower scoring performances from the offenses
to wrap up the season. What do you think was the difference offensively
especially in the second half tonight?  
MATTHEW TEMPLE: Like I said, lack of execution. Coach prepared us for when
teams switch to zone or man and we've been preparing for that. It's just a
lack of execution on our part. It's gotta get better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Matthew. We'll let you go back to the locker room.
Questions for Coach Beard now?  
  
Q. Coach, there's been so many close losses this season. What do you
tell the guys after another one like this tonight?  
CHRIS BEARD: There's only one team in college basketball that ends with a win.
That's on a Monday night in April. So as disappointed as our ending is, the
bottom line is it's an ending. So I choose to reflect on the positives. Starts
with our five seniors. Got a lot of respect for those guys. Few of them
endured a coaching change. That's tough, but they gave us everything they had
this year and couple of them chose to spend their senior season at Texas Tech
where they had other options.  
  
So I will be forever indebted to those guys helping us get the program
started. There will be a day in the near future where in this same tournament
we're winning games and doing the press conference first and not second, and
I'll think back to these five seniors that helped us lay the foundation this
first year.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think the biggest difference was in the final 10
minutes of that game? Aside from them starting to get hot?  
CHRIS BEARD: Bottom line is we have one guy on our team tonight that shoots
50%. That was Matt. We've got one guy on our team tonight that has more
assists than turnovers. There is an individual component to basketball. I'm
proud of our players, and they did great a lot of things this season, and the
bottom line is when you get to March you have to have individual performances.  
  
I think our players will be the first to tell you that. You have to give Texas
credit, too. The sign of a well-coached team is a team that doesn't quit and
Texas had every reason to lay it down the last few weeks to month, but they're
obviously in this tournament to make some noise. Our guys came to win, too.
But we just didn't play one of our better games tonight. You gotta make half
your shots in tournament play. You've gotta get to the free throw line. We had
nobody on our time that got more than 2 free throws tonight. But besides Matt
Temple and maybe Millinghaus giving us some energy minutes, I don't think any
of our individual players played well.  
  
From a coaching standpoint, we'll take responsibility, too. I wish we could
have done some more thing to help our guys. But the bottom line is, give a lot
of credit to Texas.  
  
Q. Over the season, where have you seen Keenan really improve and grow
the most?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, I think with consistency, especially in Big 12 play he
proved to be a guy that could get to double figures, shoot a good percentage.
I think the good thing for our program and for Keenan and for Texas Tech fans
is that there is a whole other ceiling for Keenan. We've got to get him better
to where he plays well in the month of March, and I take responsibility for
that. I take a lot of that responsibility. I look forward to really working
with Keenan this off-season and summer as he hopefully establishes himself
next year as one of the best players in the Big 12.  
  
But we wouldn't have had the season we did without Keenan Evans, so I
appreciate everything he's done this year.  
  
Q. Coach, as you've gone through the season maybe you have had time to
reflect, maybe just some take-aways that you have immediately from your first
season here?  
CHRIS BEARD: It always takes some time to reflect and you've gotta be careful
to talk in times like this. It's the emotions more than intelligence. What I
will say is that there's nobody that wants Texas Tech to win more than me.
We're going to get it done here. We're going to establish ourselves. We're
going to get better. Our returning players are going to get better and we're
going to recruit, and I just want everybody to know that loves Texas Tech
basketball like I do personally that this kind of season ending is
unacceptable and the way we played today is unacceptable. So we will use this
as the starting line. I look forward to greater things ahead, but the
expectations of our program is to compete for championships, to compete in the
NCAA Tournament and to play better in this tournament. So we will do
everything we can in the next 364 days to try to improve.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with Bruce Weber from Kansas State.
Coach, welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: I said that getting in the NCAA Tournament and winning the game,
it was great for our program. A nice reward for our seniors, but I think more
than anything else it was a great motivator for our younger guys. They have
had a great taste of that and we have had a great off-season. They've come to
work. Great leadership even though we don't have -- we have one walk-on
senior. We don't have any seniors on scholarship, but that junior group, the
three guys that are here today, Barry Brown, Kamau Stokes and Dean Wade have
done a great job of leading and pushing our guys and being great examples.
It's been a good group. We have had bodies, we have had a lot of injuries the
last few years and fans, sportswriters, people don't care about it until as a
coach you're involved with it and you only have eight guys at practice and you
can't get much done. This year, right now with walk-ons we will have 15, 16
guys and you get to go at it in practice, which makes it much more fun for the
coaches. I think it's going to help our level of competitive spirit and I
really am excited about our group.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Barry said a few weeks ago he feels like this is becoming his team.
Do you feel like that's a fair statement?  
BRUCE WEBER: Yeah, he watched Wes last year kind of take over the team and
they were kinda "boys" they hung out a lot and Barry saw how important it was
to have somebody be the verbal leader, not the example but also say the right
things and be the motivator at the start of practice Barry is talking, at the
end of practice he's talking, and in the locker room he's talking. He's in the
gym as much as anybody.  
  
He's kinda relished that role, which is -- as a coach it's good to have
somebody that will be verbal like that. It definitely helps us.  
  
Q. Bruce, did you have a reaction when you saw you were picked eighth by
the coaches?  
BRUCE WEBER: It doesn't bother me. Hey, we gotta do what we have to do. I feel
good about our team. A lot of times, whether it's coaches, media, whoever,
they go by stats and who did what last year and a lot of times not only stats
but where people ended up, in the standings. So we can use a little bit of it
as a motivation. We talked about even back in the summer when some of the
stuff started coming out, but all we have -- we have to be prepared and come
to work and take care of business and I think we will be fine.  
  
Q. Bruce, where do you think you're going to get rebound this gone year
and how much of a concern is that? Also, how much of is it a concern retaining
Dean Wade?  
BRUCE WEBER: There is no doubt that's the emphasis this spring. If you look at
the past we have lost our leading rebounders, Justin Evers Wesley Iwundu and
D.J. Johnson. It's a concern, and Saturday when we played an exhibition game
against Missouri State, I thought it was good for us, we had some trouble at
times.  
  
So I think it was good for our guys to go, now all the things we've talked
about, the block-out, five guys getting to the glass, defensive glass and
having people hit the offensive glass. All the things we have talked about is
backed up in that game. We have it on film. Now when we go through it in
practice and drills they will take it more seriously.  
  
Dean's gotta become -- he had seven the other day in 20 minutes. I think it
should be a goal of his to be a double-digit rebounder. I think that would be
a positive. I think he's capable of it. His physicality of strengths, his
jumping, his athleticism has greatly improved. But we have to get some out of
the other guys, the guards have to be rebounders, Coach Frazier, when he
played for me at Illinois he was our be point guard and second leading
rebounder and he's really talked to our guys about that. Having those -- Barry
could be, he's big-time on the steals, one of the leaders in the country and
in the league. He could also do the same thing on the defensive glass with
good activity. It's something we're addressing and I hope it doesn't become a
factor of us becoming really a good team.  
  
Q. Bruce, you mentioned the exhibition game and it was against another
DI team and when you play exhibition it's usually against a lower level. How
much did you get out of that and the fact that a lot of people are talking
about this is a good thing that college basketball is doing things for
charity? Would you like the NCAA to give teams an option maybe instead of
secret scrimmages to do an exhibition game where it's for charity?  
BRUCE WEBER: I actually just said something to Coach Self about it. They had a
game here, unbelievable success raising nearly $2 million for a great cause.
We didn't have quite the amount of money; but, one, it was a good game for us.
We played a team that's one of the favorites in the Missouri Valley. They have
a lot of seniors. Our guys -- we had to come to play. We played everybody. We
made sure the 8-13 got to play against each other, and, you know, I thought
our minutes were good and yet we were competing trying to play.  
  
The other thing I brought up to Bill was now with thirty days of practice over
that six-week period, I think it's -- it would be a good thing. I actually
proposed it to the Big Ten several years ago to have -- I know it's important
for the Division II guys to have the opportunity to play us and I appreciate
that, but to have the closed scrimmage against Division I. But now to have an
exhibition game and do something good out of it, I think it's a positive
thing. It was good basketballwise and raised some money and hopefully it
helped some people out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Have a great season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Coach, Shaka Smart. Coach, welcome
and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
SHAKA SMART: Really excited about this season coming up. Have Mo Bamba, Andrew
Jones and Dylan Osetkowski here with me today. They and their teammates have
done a great job all season long. We took a trip to Australia which was good
in terms of chemistry and spending time together. Also played some really good
competition over there, learned a lot about our team. Looking forward to
getting started in 17 days, our first game, and super excited about the Big 12
season as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You talked at home about how Dylan was still kind of an under-the-
radar player. Bringing him to Media Day doesn't that put him on the radar and
jokingly aside, he does deserve it, correct?  
SHAKA SMART: To be here? Well, the thing that's different anytime you sit out
and transfer, you're just not seen for that whole year and before that he was
a guy that was under recruited, played at Tulane, which is in a good
conference but not a league that maybe receives as much national attention as
the Big 12. I just told him actually back in the back about 5 minutes ago, I
said, you know what's really neat? As we walk around here and there are all
these other teams and players and coaches, a lot of them know each other. None
of them know you. Now they get a chance to -- he gets a chance to introduce
himself as a basketball player to the rest of the league and everyone else we
play.  
  
Q. Shaka, as you look at this team right now and admittedly still trying
to fit everybody in, what strikes you about where you've most improved from
last year with this team? How much improvement have you seen?  
SHAKA SMART: We just have a lot more versatility than we had last year. Last
year there was a couple of positions where we didn't have a guy at that spot
that that was his true position. And a lot of people talk about point guard,
that was one of them, but the other one was the four spot which is really
important in what we do, the way we play. Jarrett Allen did a phenomenal job
of proving to that position from where he played around the basket just in
high school and he got better and better as the course of the year went on.  
  
But for us it is important for us to have at least one big on the floor that
can pass, handle, shoot, and is comfortable on the basket. So we've taken a
big step in that area with Dylan and even a couple of our other guys.  
  
How much have we improved? I think we've improved a great deal. But then
again, we haven't played a game since March, whatever it was, when we played
here against West Virginia. So the exciting thing is getting on the court in a
real game against real competition on November 10th and moving forward and
getting a chance to test how well we're able to carry over all the things we
have worked on culturally and all of the things we have worked on on the
court.  
  
Q. Talking with Dylan, he said you guys met pretty soon after last
season and talked about starting a new culture or setting a new culture. How
much can he help you guys playing with an edge and being just kind of a tone
setter and is that something you guys really need?  
SHAKA SMART: There is no question. I think the fact that he's someone that was
under recruited, has always been a guy with a chip on his shoulder, it's huge
for our team. We have some other guys on our team that were very highly
recruited and always were, you know, maybe in that position where they were
used to a lot of things being done for them. Dylan has been on the other side
of that. He came to me as soon as the season got done he had a bunch of notes
he had written down. He wanted to talk about leadership and how he could be a
good leader for our team. We ended up formalizing our culture, putting it down
on paper about a month or two after that, giving it to our whole team,
something that we talk about and meet about on a weekly basis and he's been a
really good culture driver from that regard. So we're excited to see him get
the opportunity to actually play, because it's been a long time for him.  
  
Q. Are you confident this will be a better shooting team?  
SHAKA SMART: It better be! You know, that's definitely an area where we need
to take a big jump from last year. We shot a lot better in practice, but as
you know, carryover to the game is what really matters. I think we have some
guys on our team that are better shooters than they shot last year. It's a
matter of putting them in position to get high-quality shots as much as
possible and then for them to jump up and knock 'em down.  
  
I do think we will have better passers. There is an old saying in coaching,
the passer makes the shooter. I think we will have better guys to hit guys on
time and on target with passes to create more high-quality shots. But, yeah,
to answer your question, I think we will be a much-improved shooting team. Do
I think we will be the best shooting team in the country? Probably not, but I
think we will be much improved.  
  
Q. How much easier does Matt Coleman make it for the rest of the
perimeter guys to play off the ball?  
SHAKA SMART: It makes it easier for him because he doesn't want to shoot as
his first option. He will shoot. He shot the ball pretty well from outside,
but the first thing he wants to do is get other guys involved and it's so
powerful to have someone like that. Between him and Dylan, those guys can
create offense for teammates and for people around them and we just didn't
have that last year.  
  
I think guys are starting to recognize and learn the value of playing with
Matt and that will get even more powerful as he gets his feet under him. Right
now in practice, those other guards they go at him when they're playing
against him because he came in as the guy that everyone anointed as our point
guard but he's handled it really well.  
  
Q. How difficult is the first year for a coach in this league and
considering that. What do you think of the job Jamie Dixon did in his first
year?  
SHAKA SMART: I thought he did a great job. I think it's challenging your first
year anywhere, because there is just so much transition and so much unknown.
But I think he did a really nice job getting that team to reflect the way that
he believes the game of basketball should be played with the level of
toughness and a team orientation. They showed that almost from day one, that
seemed like. The players did a great job buying in, because as a coach you
learn it doesn't matter what philosophy you teach unless the players are all
in. And it seemed like they had buy-in with all that. They're going to be a
team to watch this year because they had such a strong year last year and they
got the vast majority of those guys back.  
  
Q. To touch on Matt again, you have in him a true point guard that you
really didn't have last year. But obviously a freshman will come with
problems. How much freedom are you going to give him to work through the
issues that are going to come this season?  
SHAKA SMART: That's a great point. He's not going to play perfectly. He's not
going to play mistake free and we not don't want his confidence to drop when
things do -- when challenges do present themselves. I think that's one of the
benefits of the fact that we went on a foreign tour. He's already been in some
game situations where he's had some success. He's taken some lumps. He's been
in some different situations and he's a fast learner. I think he is a guy that
has a lot of internal belief. But to answer your question, we believe he's a
really good point guard and he is a guy that can facilitate the game for those
around him and make the game easier for those around him. That belief is not
going to change and he's certainly going to have some good games and he will
have some games that probably aren't great. But he's a guy that we believe has
grown considerably since he got here in June and he's going to continue doing
so.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your comments and good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to start with the Big 12 men's basketball
official, Curtis Shaw. He is going to give us the rules and he's going to take
his own questions.  
  
CURTIS SHAW: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I want to spend a few minutes
to update you on what's going on with the Rules Committee, the men's oversight
and the men's rules committee dictates college basketball and how they want
the game to look and they do the rules accordingly. This year we have 26 new
rules, so it's been a busy cycle for them. Truly about 12 matter to the game,
a lot of it is administrative stuff.  
  
I want to clear up the different ones that are going to be affected that the
fans are going to notice and you in the media are going to notice so maybe we
can help explain them in advance.  
  
A couple of them, we put in a loose ball fall in college basketball and where
that is going to affect us is on two different plays. There has been confusion
in the past when the defense knocked the ball away, it hit the offensive
player and it would go in the backcourt and the offensive player couldn't be
the first one to pick it up and that didn't seem correct to the Rules
Committee. That's now a loose ball foul. Once the defense causes a deflection
there is no team control so. No matter who it touches in the backcourt anybody
can pick it up. The same loose ball designation goes in on a play where team A
has control of the basketball, team B would knock it away and as the two went
after it, team A would foul the guy who knocked it away. Under the old rule
that was team control to team A, so team B wouldn't get any free throws if
they were merited. The Rules Committee felt like the defense made a good play
but wasn't getting rewarded appropriately. So we came up with a loose ball
definition when any defensive player deflects the ball away it's now loose,
there is not team control. That will be a different one. The fans went nuts
because they didn't understand it the old way, so I think this will help.  
  
The other is a restricted area that we have had in place for a few years now.
We have allowed the defensive player to go vertical last year, so if he was in
or over the restricted area and a person drove toward the basket he was
allowed to go vertical, then if contact occurred he was not considered in the
restricted area. They've defined this a little better.  
  
In order to be legal you have to face the offensive player, you have to go
vertical and you would have had to have come down in basically the same spot.  
  
What that does, you can't turn into anybody, you can't go forward into
anybody. There was kind of a feeling among a lot of teams that as long as you
went vertical he was cleansed and he couldn't foul. That's not the case. You
have to go vertical and then be able to come down in the same spot.  
  
The last one is the emphasis on traveling, and we talked about it with coaches
this morning. We cannot allow the offensive players tougher bad footwork if
we're going to do what the Rules Committee wants and back the defense off.
Therefore, this year you're going to see a heavy emphasis on traveling both on
the perimeter and in the post whether there is defense involved or not. We've
had a lot of plays in the past where the guard is out on the perimeter, might
make a step to get started and we ignored it because there was no defender
around or they catch it in bad shooting position and they have to reset their
feet in order to get in good shooting position; and, again, there was no
defender around and we ignored it. No more. They want the footwork called by
the letter of the law. They also want it in the post. Our big guys taking an
extra shuffle step and reset to get off an offensive move they want it by the
letter of the law to the point where we designated a different official to
watch this than in the past. So if you're at a game and all of the sudden you
hear a whistle coming from one of the outside two officials, maybe not the
person on the play, don't be shocked because they're now designated to watch
the footwork. Those are three things that you're going to see that is going to
help clear up a lot of the game and a lot of the fan confusion.  
  
A couple of emphasis, let's start with the post play. The Rules Committee is
adamant about stopping rough post play from the start. Do not allow the
defensive player to initiate contact where we end up getting a second foul.
Here is a perfect example. Watch the players down in the post. It may not show
up. As you can see the player in gray starts this play. Right there he's in an
illegal position. We have designated a different referee to watch that the
minute the offensive player tries to make a move and he's got him held we want
a defensive foul. What end up happening is the offensive player retaliates,
hooks under and throws him backwards and we call it on offense. Same play here
in the post. We do not want a defensive player who gets beat to a spot to
physically be able to move somebody off that spot. We told the teams and the
players if you get beat you've got to play from behind. You cannot try to
regain it.  
  
Part two is if the offense post with the arm extended like this, he's now
illegal. You can only post legally in the touchdown position. Once he does
that and the defender tries to get through that arm, we're going to have an
offensive foul. They're adamant on getting post play cleaned up.  
  
Another example of physically moving a guy off when you lost your spot. We
want it called immediately, not waiting to see the result of the play.  
  
So cleaning up the post play is a huge, huge emphasis from the Rules
Committee. The Rules Committee chairman came to us as a group and basically
said we want the defense to have to back off. We want more possessions and
more opportunities to score in our basketball games. So they're going to limit
the defensive ability to physically attack the basketball or a player.  
  
Next, we've got an emphasis on free throw rebounding. Watch the player in the
second lane space. He moves the player under, and in the old days it was kind
of you weren't big enough to hold him off, too bad. No more. Stop right there.
As the Rules Committee said, you're getting a wide open 15-foot shot. That's
your reward for getting fouled. We have to learn to make free throws. We don't
shoot very well. We have to learn to shoot free throws. If you miss the free
throw your teammate doesn't have the right to then go get the basketball. They
can loop behind, step straight across and hope for a long rebound. But if they
displace the inside player at all, and the free throw is then missed, we want
a defensive foul.  
  
All right? Go ahead. Screens. Hold it right there. The definition of a screen
was always confusing in the past. In the past, a legal screen, the outside of
my feet were only supposed to be as wide as my shoulder. That was like this. I
didn't have a good base to set a legal screen. We never enforced that. We let
the kids get set. We've changed the definition to the inside of your foot as
wide as your shoulder. That way I can get a good screen to brace myself. I can
protect and however I want to protect I cannot have extended elbows. All
right?  
  
The number one thing on a screen is this: The screener must be stationary at
contact. That's what we teach referees. If the screener is moving he can never
be legal. This comes into play on the ball handoffs and we will show some of
those.  
  
Here is an example of a screen on the baseline where he's never set. He's
coming from behind and beside, continues to move forward and we get the play
absolutely backwards. This is what we have to eliminate. We have to make the
screeners be set and be legal the whole way. We've even changed who is
watching for this type of play.  
  
Another good example on the baseline, he takes a little half step at the end,
so he's never legal. The screener must be set at contact. Here is the ball
handoff.  
  
The minute you release the basketball you are now considered a screener not a
ball handler. You have no more rights. The only way to legally set a screen on
a ball handoff is to immediately come to a jump stop before exact or the onus
is on you to totally avoid contact. This is a difficult play. We've had
coaches say he's supposed to hand it off and go to the corner. You don't have
that right. So there is no continuation for the ex-ball handler because he's
now a screener. Here it is in slow motion, give you a better example.  
  
Right now, he's a screener. When he makes that contact that's illegal, whether
defense tries to go high or low. Here is an example of a screen that's too
wide. You can see in the slow motion coming up that his feet are definitely
outside his shoulders, therefore when contact occurs to the leg area, that's
going to be illegal. Here is another ball handoff that's extremely difficult.
I'm not sure there is anything they can do but the minute he hands off and
makes contact with the defender, either going high or low you have an illegal
screen. The Rules Committee is adamant that we're not going to let the defense
attack you on offense. We can't let the offense get away with things like
illegal screens and travels.  
  
Example of a back pick, anytime you set a pick from behind you must give the
defensive player a full step to turn and change direction. So any contact
comes from behind, a flat screen at the free throw line they have to give 'em
a step if contact occurs. What's probably the biggest change we're going to
see in a while is called the cylinder rule. We've put in a new deal last year
with the elbows that if the elbows swinging through the area hit a defensive
player you can get a flagrant foul. The Rules Committee went back and looked
at it. They decided the defense was getting too close. The old rule was you
could get as close to a player as possible when stationary short of contact.
They decided that does not allow the offensive player to make an offensive
move. If I was like this and the defense closed on me and I went to move I had
no where to go. They decided the offensive player now has a cylinder and the
way to define the cylinder is when the offensive player is stationary, has the
basketball in front of him, not extended but here, he can turn side-to-side,
low or high, and that's his cylinder.  
  
So if a defensive player, we'll see some in a trap, comes into my space and I
try to make a move and I have contact with him, whereas in the past we might
have had an offensive foul it's going to be a defensive foul. It does not mean
the offensive player can pivot into the contact, it's only when stationary
side-to-side.  
  
That means a defender from the back can come all the way up as close as he
wants because I can't hit him unless I pivot into him. Let's show them. Here
is an example after a rebound the defensive player attacks the man with the
ball.  
  
Now the offensive player tries to raise up to make a pass, knocks him down,
throws him off, this is a defensive cylinder foul. One of the key things we
look at is when the defender straddles the offensive player's leg. If you
straddle his leg you have not given him room to make an offensive move.  
  
Same example here. This wasn't even called a foul last year. But watch it in
slow motion. It's slight contact, but they want this called. The offensive
player loses possession, regains it, stop. Right now the defense is okay. He's
a little too close, but then go ahead. Stop right there. Now he takes that
extra step forward, his right foot, he straddles his leg and not prevents the
offensive player from taking the ball to the side to throw a pass. This has to
stop. Slight contact, displaces the defense, this year that will be a
defensive foul.  
  
Another example in the post with the secondary defender collapsing down into
him, straddles his leg, ends up getting hit in the face. So if you straddle
your leg you close where the offensive player doesn't have the chance to make
a move.  
  
Part two of this play is you still don't have the right as an offensive player
to use an elbow. By this year's rule, that play right there should have been a
defensive cylinder foul for getting too close then a flagrant one foul because
he hit him with the elbow. We're telling the coaches you're going to end up
with a good player who is going to get a broken nose and is going to get
called for the foul. You have to back off and give them basketball distance in
order to make a move, but offensively you cannot lead with the elbow. Elbows
have to be bent to make that move.  
  
Here is a great example on a double team how when he pivots the way the
defender closes all the way into his leg so he cannot turn his shoulders and
come backwards. Right now we're pretty good. He pivots away; the defender
closes, never stationary, moves forward, gets hit, this will be a defensive
cylinder foul.  
  
Here is a different play. Here is the offense who initiates by stepping
forward. You can see he's in good shape, he then leads with the elbow into the
defensive player. This will still be an offensive foul and a flagrant one foul
for leading with the elbow. The defender is behind, he can get as close as he
wants and the offensive player pivots with his right foot and he invades
defensive space.  
  
The things the referees are going to look for and the things the media and the
fans need to look for are did the offensive player change the pivot foot or
was he moving the ball side-to-side without extending it? If it's side-to-side
the defense can't crash. If it's pivot foot the defense is allowed to stay in
their position.  
  
That is a quick rundown of what is going on this year. Some of the things to
clear up. There are a lot of other rule changes that don't affect things that
y'all will notice. But are there any questions about things that are going on
and the goal of the Rules Committee?  
  
Again, I like to say, there is no referee on the Oversight Committee. There is
no referee on the Rules Committee. We have no input into what they decide they
want us to do. We just have to be the ones that enforce it. Yes, sir?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CURTIS SHAW: No. Well, it can be. It can be a charge if there is enough
contact for a charge or it can be a no-call. So if I go straight up and I
would have come down in my same spot but the offensive player initiates into
me and I go backwards that's a no call or could be an offensive foul. Part two
of it is, if that contact causes me to --  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CURTIS SHAW: I'm not going to penalize the defender because the offense caused
that contact.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CURTIS SHAW: The Rules Committee says we want them to back off. In talking to
some of our coaches that trap they say really that's not bad. Because if I'm
stuck here I've got a defender here who is legal, a defender here who is
legal. They're getting bigger. It makes it harder for me to get over it. When
I was closing so tight it was giving them more room to step through the trap
to get rid of it. Surprisingly a lot of our coaches don't think it will affect
their trap. It will make 'em stay further back but still be effective.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CURTIS SHAW: It gives us great concern. I quit on the floor in 2010 and you
had the abusive fans, but it wasn't the level it is today, and I read an
article about the Florida football coach saying his players and his family are
getting death threats. I think our fans have gone way overboard. Fans are
great. You're allowed to cheer, boo, be for your team, but when we start
getting into personal threats it's scary.  
  
We are worried in basketball. We're just waiting for a fan to come out and hit
a referee, or an opposing player because they lose their minds. So it's
something we're concerned about. Our teams and our game management do a great
job of educating the people down low on what they can and can't do. But it's a
grave concern right now due to our social nature and the right that I can do
whatever I want if I paid for my ticket. It is a concern.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CURTIS SHAW: I think there is more awareness. I'm not sure there are a lot of
steps. The conference office does a great job of educating the game managers
of what we will allow the people on the court to do. They get a specific
letter of guidelines they can and can't do. If we have abusive fans as
referees, we go to game management and say this person can't be here. If it's
a certain thing you can move him upstairs where you can't hear him but he can
be here. If it's a direct threat to the a referee or opposing player or
certain language is used, they gotta go all the way out of the gym. I think
there is more of a willingness in this day and age to remove a possible threat
or issue. So game management does a great job with the conference office to
try to control everything.  
  
Q. Rule changes that came about two, three, four years ago, and reaction
to the offensive flow was going down in the college game and a lot of grabbing
and so forth. Ten, 12 years from now, once everything -- these games start
going up, people are going to start complaining now there is no defense being
played. Do you see back and forth with more rule changes going defensively?  
CURTIS SHAW: I really don't think so. I really don't think you're going to
have complaints that there is no defense. Jamie Dixon and I were talking the
other day in his office about when he played and he watched films. They didn't
guard by physically attacking. One of the members of the Rules Committee said
defensive basketball was meant to get in front of your opponent and stop him
from having a layup to the basket. You were never intended to be able to
attack him. So I think the Rules Committee and what they have told us is we
want them to back off. We want these rules enforced. We know we're going to
have complaints early. We want them enforced just like they did with the hand
checks and now it's not a problem.  
  
I think the Rules Committee wants to see the scoring, I think it's gone up in
the last two years for 7 points, they would love the scoring for every team to
be over 80. I think the whole intent is the fan action of offense is more
exciting. The Connecticut-Butler game was the final straw in the Final Four. I
think it was so physically dominating. They said we gotta change. I don't see
'em going backwards. Anything else? Thank you sirs and ladies!

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Kansas coach, Bill Self. Coach, welcome
and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BILL SELF: We're excited to get started. I think we got an early jump a couple
of days ago playing here in the Sprint Center, and that was a great event, and
I know our players were excited to play. It was something that created a lot
of energy around both programs, us and Missouri's, and hopefully that will
continue to be the case up until we open up in a couple of weeks. It's going
to be an exciting year without question and of course in an unbelievable
league once again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Devonte' Graham, you anticipated -- I don't know if you anticipated
him coming back, but I know you encouraged guys to go that should go, but can
you take us through the process of your own ups and downs of him coming
back?  
BILL SELF: I don't know that there were any downs. The thing about Devonte'
Graham is he had every right to test the waters. He could have and certainly
visiting with his mother quite a bit and Devonte', you know, he likes college.
He also wants to see if he can, you know, improve himself and his positioning
much like Frank did last year, by having a big senior year. He could have been
in the game to possibly be a draft pick this past year. But certainly, you
know, he's got a chance to come back and roll the dice and see if he can
improve his position and at the same time get his degree. It wasn't anything
convincing him to come back. That was a situation in which he came to me and
said I don't think I need to -- I'm a little confused. I need to think about
it. He talked to his mom. We talked about it will a little bit and then he
came back and said I think it's in my best interest to stay.  
  
Q. You talk about Kansas math. Is there an illustration of how different
your job is from other places in the sport?  
BILL SELF: Pressure is when you have to win games and your players aren't
quite as good. So that's real pressure. You know, we've had our fair share of
good guys but I made that as a joke when I first got the job because I
remember going and speaking around the state and numerous fans would tell me,
hey, this is going to be our year. This is going to be our year. And I'm like
going, what about these last years? You had Collins and Hinrich and Goodwin
and now we are automatically supposed to be better after going back it-to-back
Final Fours and that's why I made the joke with Kansas math. And it's a lot
about this team, and a lot of people expect this team to be really, really
good, which we have a chance. We are not close now, but you lose the National
Player of the Year, and you lose, you know, a guy that's arguably as good as
anybody in the draft last year. That's a lot to replace, but somehow people
are so optimistic always that we should always be better.  
  
Q. Just wondering in today's landscape of the college game, did you find
it odd at all that five players on the preseason team are all seniors this
year?  
BILL SELF: In the Big 12?  
  
Q. In the Big 12, yes.  
BILL SELF: Yeah, that is kind of -- I would say that's odd. I don't know if it
will play out to be that way because I think we have some really good young
players in our league but most of those preseason polls that are done, you
know, people vote on what they know and they have obviously seen these guys
coming back. I do think that's odd and certainly that means our league is
going to be older and certainly usually with older brings maturity and more
consistency and usually better play.  
  
You can't have a great league unless you have great young talent, that's
obvious and this league has that. But the foundation of every league and every
team should be their veterans, so that's probably good to see.  
  
Q. Knowing Jamie Dixon like you know him, how hard of a charge would you
say he's making in this league?  
BILL SELF: Well, Jamie, you know, and his staff, they did an unbelievable job
at Pittsburgh, so him doing well isn't a surprise to anybody that coaches in
our league. We expect him to do well. TCU is -- a lot of people thought that's
been a sleeping giant so to speak with the Metroplex and the proximity to guys
that can make you better. It certainly appears to everybody in our league that
Jamie and staff have maximized their time there, their brief time there to put
together a product that certainly their team has a chance to win our league
this year. I mean, they're good! They were really good last year on how they
finished and winning the NIT obviously gives them unbelievable momentum going
forward and you return all five starters and you recruit guys that are
probably good enough to start. That's a pretty nice start! I think they're
there to stay. I don't think TCU basketball is going to take a step backyards.
We all take steps sideways sometimes based on personnel and things that go on,
but TCU is going to be a force in our league for as long as he's there.  
  
Q. Bill, what level of concern do you have about your depth?  
BILL SELF: A lot. You know, we played eight guys the other day because we only
have eight guys on scholarship that are eligible to play. So we have four guys
sitting out. So, yes, I'm concerned. We get one more Christmas, but primarily
concerned inside. If an injury or major foul problems can obviously put you
behind the eight ball, not only for one game but for the long term. So that is
a major concern. Last year obviously we were very thin up front as well after
Udoka went down, and this year I'm not sure that we could sustain another
injury like that and still have a chance to have a great season.  
  
So depth is certainly a concern. Eight is plenty as long as you're healthy,
but whenever injuries start occurring or peak guys start wearing down it's a
concern.  
  
Q. Devonte' Graham, you might have used the term earlier is him becoming
the face of the program and can you contrast his demeanor with Frank's?  
BILL SELF: Devonte' is the face of our program. There is no question about it,
probably as much right now as anybody we've had. Even with Frank last year we
still have Devonte' or we had Landen or we still have Josh or whatnot. But
this year coming in, Billy is a talented guy, but he doesn't come in with the
same hype as what some of our other guys have had in the past, and Devonte'
has been a pretty consistent performer for three years. But in order for us to
be really, really good he has to play at an All-American type level for us,
and we think he's very capable of doing that and certainly he's got the
personality that will certainly draw people to him by watching him play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck with the season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State Coach, Steve Prohm. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thanks for having me. Excited to be here. Appreciate everybody
today. Kansas City last time I was here obviously was a special moment for our
team and our program and our seniors.  
  
The one exciting thing now is all those seniors are off and doing extremely
well from our last two years and it's been a great two years and now moving on
to year three we have a brand new group. We have eight new guys in the program
now, three returners, Nick Weiler-Babb, Donovan Jackson and Solomon Young that
are back and need to be in a leadership role and an on-the-floor coaching role
to help these young new faces and we have some old guys, some fifth year
transfers.  
  
I think the biggest thing with our team right now somebody getting caught up
in a lot of hype, but get to go work and working every day and slowly building
the foundation of becoming a really good basketball team. You do that by
getting in the gym and working and watching tape and individual workouts and
attention to detail.  
  
The one thing that people harp on right now is being picked ninth, but I think
a lot of that stuff is you base that off of who is returning.  
  
So no one has really seen these three guys play extended major roles. If you
go back and look at the West Virginia game here, the championship game, those
three guys were really instrumental in our success that night. If you look at
the turn-around with our team last year, Solomon Young played a huge role in
that. I'm going to lean on those three guys. We met all summer long once a
week to establish leadership from those guys and to be player-driven. If
you're going to be very good it's got to be -- the players have to be invested
it and has to be player led and then the coach is behind them kinda pushing
the buttons, but I'm excited about this opportunity this year. Obviously, I
think it's a team that's going to get better from September to October to
November and then on into Big 12 play.  
  
Then I think we've got a great be opportunity with a great road environment to
go to Missouri on national television and play in a game that's going to have
a lot of hype to it with Coach Martin's first game and the Porter's first game
and Tillman's first game so no better opportunity to not find out where we are
as a team and win or lose what we have to do to get better from that point on.  
  
Then we go right away from there to the ESPN Puerto Rico tournament which
moved to Myrtle Beach and we have a great feel for three games in four days
there. And I will open it up for questions, but looking forward to douche
coaching this team and getting better throughout the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What is the next step basketballwise for Solomon Young? What's on his
checklist?  
STEVE PROHM: I think it's two-fold. I think it's don't forget what you're
about because I think if you watched him play last year, whether it was at
Kansas or whether it was here at the Big 12 tournament, he had a toughness and
a motor about him that he made all big plays. His ball screen defense was
terrific. His help side defense was terrific, he rebounded, he ran the floor.
Don't get away from any of that. We've got to have that and more on that end.
Hopefully we can expand his game offensively to where we can throw it inside
and if he's not a back-to-basket sort of guy to catch and face and drive
bigger guys.  
  
Then the opportunity to play off ball screens and pick and pop and make the
three or a 17-footer, you know, because that position, that fourth spot or
number five, whatever you want to call it, has been instrumental in our play
for last few years and really at Iowa State for the last five or six years.  
  
Hopefully he can take a bigger step offensively without losing what I think is
his core, and that's toughness and blue collar work.  
  
Q. Steve, how has Lindell Wigginton looked? He has big shoes to fill,
but he's a talented kid. How is he looking?  
STEVE PROHM: I think he's been good. We had a second inter squad scrimmage
Saturday and I thought he was really good. We played three 10-minute segments
and his first 10 minutes I think it was great. But as any freshman you walk
out of the gym and say, gosh, that was great today and then you have days when
you walk out of the gym and say I need to meet with Lindell and keep him tight
because the most difficult position to play especially as a freshmen is the
point guard position. You're usually defending, you've got to defend one of
the elite players. Last year in our league defending the point guard was
brutal 1-8 or 9 in our league last year. So you've got to be great defensively
from a game plan standpoint and on the ball and off the ball help side. And we
want that position to score, but you have to facilitate as well. And our
assist-to-turnover numbers have been so good that we've got to make sure we're
making good decisions.  
  
I think he's been -- obviously he's really talented and I don't want to put on
the hype train and overdo the expectations. I think he has a chance to do some
special things at Iowa State, but I want to take it a day at a time and people
want to compare Monte or the last point guard or other point guards I've
coached. I want just want Lindell to max Lindell out and if he does that we
will be in a really good place.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Nick Weiler-Babb and what he has to do to expand
his game this year?  
STEVE PROHM: I think Nick, first and foremost, he's a guy that has been around
this program for a long time with his brother playing here, Chris, for being a
redshirt my first year. The biggest thing that he can provide because his IQ
for the game is so good is being a coach on the floor. Whether he's handling
the ball at the be point or he's playing the 3 or the 2 or whatever the
position on the perimeter. He knows what everybody should be doing,
offensively and defensively, 1 through 5. So we need his coaching ability on
the floor to make sure people are in the right spots with some of our youth.  
  
Second thing, I think with his size and athleticism I think he can be a really
good defender and offensively I think he can facilitate. The one thing I would
like to see more from him and I think he knows that is offensively of really
look to go score and put pressure on the defense whether that's from paint
touches or that's from three.  
  
Q. Have you had to spend any time managing the perception of your team
to your players? You are picked low this year and that's different for an Iowa
State team.  
STEVE PROHM: We haven't talked about it. I was just talking about our media
about it. I'm not too big of a hype guy from a standpoint and I'm not going to
plaster it all over the locker room. Nobody has seen these guys in a different
role so you can't prejudge anybody until you can see what they can do. I'm
excited about the opportunity to really, you know, challenge and figure out
how to make this team great. I think as a coach and as a player this is a
great challenge for us and that's what you want as a competitor. We haven't --
like I said, I'm not a big hype guy, I think stance wins over hype, are we
doing the right thing every day? Are we getting better? And if we do that good
things will happen. The preseason poll is for Media Day and then the work
begins.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck to you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Oklahoma Coach, Lon Kruger. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
Lon Kruger: Thank you. It's great to be here. It's an enjoyable time, that
four or five weeks of practice before we have to worry about games and playing
time and everything else. Fun group of guys, still a little bit young, but
we're working on maturing quickly, they have worked hard, energy, enthusiasm
is great, looking forward to a hurricane relief game this weekend, then
exhibition game November 8th and right into the season. Excited about what
lies ahead!  
  
Q. Lon, there has been talk about Trae Young and what he can do for you.
But how does having a player like that change what you are able to do
offensively overall?  
Lon Kruger: Trae has outstanding skill. Anytime you've got a player like
that, he's got an opportunity to make players around him better by attracting
attention, by driving and attracting help defender and kicking. He's very fast
out of the backcourt so he's creating some hopefully easy buckets in
transition.  
  
He's made the transition very quickly, and, again, he's used to a lot of
high-level competition through his high school and summertime ball, so he's
doing very well.  
  
Q. Lon, you've had a lot of teams at OU that exceed rankings in the Big
12 preseason poll. Do you plays any stake in that or why do you think that's
happened?  
LON KRUGER: I'm not aware too much about that, nor worried too much about
that. We've got guys that like to play, they like to work at getting better
every day and hopefully make progress throughout the season. In the Big 12 you
have to do that because everyone else is doing that. Again, maybe not a lot of
highly Heralded guys coming in recruitingwise, but, I don't know, other than
that not too concerned about the preseason part of it, just hoping to get
better every day.  
  
Q. I'm sorry, I don't know who you play Saturday?  
Lon Kruger: UT Arlington.  
  
Q. And also, I know Buddy, it took him four years to become Buddy Hield,
but just for the sake of understanding about where Trae Young is, where was
Buddy as a freshman compared to where Trae is now?  
Lon Kruger: Of course Buddy wasn't on the radar as Trae has been, so big
difference there. Buddy from day one had the ideal attitude about doing
whenever he needed to do to get better. He was out to prove something all the
time and wasn't as highly heralded as Trae. Trae is very, very competitive but
he's motivated in a different way of going out and proving that he is capable
of doing all the things that are expected of him. Two different starting
points but I think both equally motivate to work hard every day and do things
well.  
  
Q. How has Trae dealt with the attention, the local kids stayed home
from school, McDonald's All-American, how is he dealing with the attention?  
Lon Kruger: Seems to be doing very well with it. Again, he's used to it. He
got a lot of attention as a junior and senior in high school and on the summer
circuit, so it's not something that's new to him.  
  
He's done a really good job of making it about his teammates and making it
about others, the program, and he's a guy that could go off individually and
hasn't done that. He's very -- he's smart with regard to the value of doing
things as a group and he knows, too, that he needs his teammates to play well
and he's doing everything he can to help encourage them and motivate them to
do everything they can and certainly his teammates appreciate what he can
do.  
  
Q. Coach, when Jamie Dixon entered the league he came in with a lot of
experience as you do. Do you think that made a difference for him in his first
year?  
Lon Kruger: Well, always experience is good, no question about that. And
Jamie of course has had great success everywhere he's been and did a great job
last year and returns an outstanding group. I'm sure Jamie would give you a
better answer than me. But no doubt that he knew what he was getting into and
he's well prepared for it and delivered in year one.  
  
Q. What did you think of the first year he had? Were you surprised to
see that success?  
Lon Kruger: That Jamie had? Knowing that Jamie was going to do a great job.
Wasn't surprised to see him do as well he could and that's what he did. I
think his guys stepped up and delivered for him, too. He had some guys I
thought he instilled some confidence in. He instilled a level of expectation
and I thought his guys responded well to him. I think that resulted in the
success that he had, especially that late run was really pretty impressive and
good for the league, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, and good luck for the season.

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by West Virginia Coach, Bob Huggins. Coach,
welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you. I don't know. I think we're all right. I think our
guard play is really good. I think Jevon Carter and Daxter Miles are as good a
pair of guards as there are anywhere in the country. Then we've got a bunch of
young guys. We will have to find out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. We heard Curtis Shaw go over rule changes this year. It looks like
more offense is being favored in some of these rule changes. I know you
emphasize defense. I'm wondering how you think your team will be impacted by
some of these?  
BOB HUGGINS: I'm all for offense. I just don't think you out to be able to
walk out of traps, which hopefully that gets addressed. I think the not only
thing that is a little bit alarming to me is we act like there's never going
to be any contact. They're too big. They're too strong. They're too fast and
the court is too small for there not to be any contact. So there is going to
be.  
  
I wish we could kinda go back, to a degree, of let the guys officiate the
game. If it has no affect on the play, why call it. But that's not the
direction that we're headed. We're going to adjust. We've done it for years.
My dad told me one time, I was at Walsh College and we played Urbana and I
think they shot 52 free throws, something ridiculous like that, and obviously
I'm not happy; and my dad calls me the next day and my dad was a highly
successful basketball coach. He said, what happened? I said, they shot 52 free
throws. That's what happened. He said, well, you didn't do a very good job;
and I'm like, what was I supposed to do? I didn't foul 'em. He said, you know
there is a game within a game.  
  
And the more I do this, I think the truer that becomes. Everybody doesn't see
the game the same way. It's going to vary from game-to-game just because of
the way different people perceive the game should be played, officiated,
coached, whatever. I'm going to try to be a little smarter, to answer your
question. Probably won't be, but I'm going to try.  
  
Q. Are you going to wear the vest and bow tie on the sideline at all
this year?  
BOB HUGGINS: Absolutely not.  
  
Q. Esa's absence for the first two months of the season how are you
going to replace him during the nonconference season?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we can't replace him. He's been really, really good in
practice. I was a little concerned that he would have a hard time being
motivated, but at least to this point he's been terrific.  
  
He's good, you know, I mean, he's -- it's hard to replace somebody that good.
We'll do it by committee. I don't at this time, Jeff, I would be lying if I
told you I knew what we were going to do. I don't. It seems like every time
people ask me who your starter is going to be, and I tell 'em, it ends up not
being those guys. So honestly, I don't know.  
  
Q. You know Jamie Dixon very well. What do you think of that guy coming
into the league and after one year being picked third by the coaches
already?  
BOB HUGGINS: It doesn't surprise me. We were in the Big East together. Jamie
does a terrific job. But, you know, the thing about this league that I not
didn't realize when we got in the league, we walk in and we sit down at a
coaches meeting and there are ten guys in there and I think six of them have
been to a Final Four and most of those six multiple times and the guys who
haven't been to a Final Four lost in the Elite Eight at least once and some of
them two or three times. It's the best coaching league that I've ever been in
and it doesn't surprise me at all.  
  
Jamie is a really good end-of-the-game coach and that's what our league is.
Nobody blows anybody out in this league. It's all so highly contested. There's
really good players. When you look at the stuff that the league sent out about
first-round picks, lottery picks, draft picks, and then look and think,
there's only ten he teams in this league, there are 16 in those other leagues
or 14 and we still, I think, whatever it is, I think it's the second most
amount of first-rounders or second most amount of lottery picks. There are
really, really good players in this league and incredible coaching in this
league.  
  
Q. Bob, what's the next evolution offensively for Sagaba?  
BOB HUGGINS: He's worked really hard on his jump shot. I feel really
comfortable letting him shoot 15, 16 foot. He thinks he can shoot 3's, and he
does make some once in a while, but I don't think that's the direction that we
want to go quite yet. But I feel confident him shooting 16, 17 feet. Shoots it
really well on the baseline and he's so much more comfortable. He's playing
with so much more confidence.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Baylor coach, Scott Drew. Coach, welcome.  
  
SCOTT DREW: Well, like every coach you're always excited until you lose the
first game. I know we have a lot to replace with Al Freeman, Ish Wainright,
Johnathan Motley no longer at Baylor. They achieved great things while they
were there. But each and every year you have new guys that have an opportunity
to step up. We have four seniors, Terry Maston, Nuni Omot, point guard Manu is
returning and Big Joe in the middle is returning, so excited for those four to
have a chance to lead this team.  
  
As far as the season goes, probably the toughest thing each and every year it
seems like is picking the coach's preseason poll from the standpoint there is
so much parity in the league. That's why in the RPI we finished first, first
and second the last four years. There is no easy game, there is no bottom and
so many games come down to one or two possessions, who makes the free throws,
who makes the right plays, and what makes Big 12 college basketball so
exciting. That's all I got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You mentioned the preseason poll and the coaches put Jamie third. As
you think back on your first year in the league 10 or 12 years ago, what were
your impressions of what he did his first year in the league?  
SCOTT DREW: I'm up to 15, so I like 10 or 12. Everyone knew coming in that
they returned a lot of good players, and Coach Dixon has a great reputation,
does an outstanding job in getting teams to play as a team and to their full
capability. But we knew coming in talentwise they were going to be good and
they were. Excited they won the NIT! We also won that and it gave us a big
boost for the next year.  
  
Q. Scott, is Joe ready to take the next step offensively? I know you
lose a lot with Johnathan.  
SCOTT DREW: I think every player has their own strengths and he's such a good
defensive player, led the Big 12 in blocked shots, all-defensive team.
Johnathan Motley is such an efficient scorer. Joe has improved that area but
what makes Joe special defensively he's one of the best in the country.
Definitely he will pick up some of scoring slack, but I know what makes him
special for us is his defensive prowess.  
  
Q. In that same vein, do you become more of a -- kind of the hallmark of
Baylor since you've been there is you have had some good inside scorers,
especially on your best teams? Do you become more of a perimeter team this
year without Motley or do you think you can makeup for his production
inside?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, the reason we've been so successful I think with interior
scorers is each and every year the returning players improve so much.  
  
I think, again, because of the leadership and the young guys going against
great players each and every day in the inside has made them better. Iron
sharpens, iron. I know TJ is capable of scoring. Tristan Clark, our freshman
is capable. Joe has improved. So I think we will have that interior scoring at
the same time. Our perimeter with Manu is the most proven in best returning
scorer.  
  
Q. Is there an update on Leonard Allen? Is he going to be with you
guys?  
SCOTT DREW: Right now there is no schedule of return time. So he's taking care
of personal issues and once that's resolved then he will return.  
  
Q. How difficult has it been not just Leonard being out, but Tyson is
hurt, couple of other guys banged up. How difficult has that been getting
everyone together before the season?  
SCOTT DREW: The toughest thing is it takes 5-on-5 and now we're down to seven
scholarshipped players that are healthy. The best thing is when you are going
against other scholarship players in practice you get a better indication of
what areas you need to improve in and what areas you need to get better in.
When you only have seven out there and you have guys going against walk-ons,
then it's fool's gold sometimes as far as what you need to work on and
improve. The other thing is it changes what you need to do contactwise because
you can't risk other injuries. So we will get Tristan Clark back here shortly
and that will get us to eight and then from there hopefully we will continue
to get some people back in the next couple of weeks. If you have any good
noncontact drills please pass 'em this way.  
  
Q. After your time in the league and as you said 15 years going Sweet 16
last year and a run of Sweet 16s. You're picked fifth in the league this year
behind a team that lost 22 games last year and TCU on the upswing. Is that an
accurate representation do you think of where this team is right now?  
SCOTT DREW: I think it's a tribute to what we lost. Also for the other teams,
what they returned. But I know coaches never put too much stock in the
preseason polls because injuries, chemistry, leadership, that stuff all
reveals itself during the course of the season and one thing every Big 12
coach will tell you is there is no bottom in the Big 12 and because of the
parity, if you win a couple of close games you get the momentum, the
confidence and now you have a great year, you lose a couple close games and if
you don't have good leadership now that can lead to a down spiral and a bad
year. Your margin of error is so thin in the Big 12 and, again that's why
RPIwise it's been the best conference three out of the four years and second
last year.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering, Motley was an example of what can happen when
you redshirt in college basketball which is kind of rare. Mark went through
that last year as a redshirt. How do you find success getting kids to redshirt
when they want to play right away?  
SCOTT DREW: Everybody would like to be in the league after one year. We know
that, yeah.  
  
Q. How did Mark take that redshirting last year and did it benefit
him?  
SCOTT DREW: The good thing is we have had success with players that redshirt.
Cory Jefferson, Johnathan Motley, (indiscernible) sat out one year and then
was a sixth pick in the draft. I think the big thing is when people choose to
redshirt because we never make anyone redshirt. We will present options to
them. They listen to their peers a lot and the past players, the older players
are allowed to tell them how they feel and how it went.  
  
I think because of those examples, people have been more apt to take advantage
of that. The great thing is if Johnathan Motley would have wanted to come back
he would have been able to. So that's where it's -- each person has their own
individual choices, some people are injured. Al Freeman was injured and that's
why he chose to redshirt.  
  
Again, each situation is different. Big scheme of things, normal people are
better players at 22 than they are at 18.  
  
Q. Coach, the league has changed obviously since you came in fifteen
years ago. What are the challenges for new guys like Jamie and Chris and now
Mike in this league?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think the toughest thing for any coach in the league is
just the margin of error is so small. You go into a game and so many games
come down to one or two possessions, and you can have a big win, you can have
a big loss and the next game is just as tough no matter perceptionwise you
might be playing a top-10 ranked team and then you're on the road against a
team that's not ranked and people think should be an easy win and there are no
easy wins and that's just as hard of a game as the game you had previously.
The longer you're in the league the more you understand that and I think
that's why returning players are so critical, because they can -- they've gone
through the rigors of the Big 12. They've gone through the ups and downs and
hopefully they don't get too high after a win or too low after a loss because
if you are not ready for the next game you got no chance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck this season.

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're now joined by TCU Coach, Jamie Dixon. Coach,
welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Thank you. It's great to be here and great to be back in Kansas
City. What I know about this conference is that it's really good. I have been
in some good ones and I'm excited to be a part of this conference again. I
love the round Robin, I love -- after going through the tournament, the Big 12
Tournament, I think Kansas City is an awesome place to have it. Atmosphere is
great and hopefully we can get to the a point where we're getting great crowds
in here to watch us from Fort Worth. So got a great team, some guys out now,
but I think they will be back by the time the season starts, working hard and
doing the right things on and off the floor. Excited about them.  
  
Q. What was your reaction to being picked higher in a preseason poll
than the football team?  
JAMIE DIXON: There have been a few jokes thrown around about that throughout
the summer, I guess. Gary was giving me a hard time at some points, but I
guess he's getting the last laugh right now. They're fourth in the country and
we're proud of what they're doing.  
  
I would like to be the guy like him that goes from 6-7 to 7-0 that quickly. I
thought we had a nice team and we were young last year, we got guys returning.
I think we kinda recognize that had we would be picked higher. I think it's
actually -- it speaks to more of the -- I guess we've been picked last every
year in the Big 12, so I guess it's a little bit of a change for us. But as I
told our guys beforehand, it doesn't mean anything. We've got a lot of work to
do and we've still got a lot to prove that we have to do for us and for our
fans and throughout this league. So it's nice but it doesn't mean a thing to
us.  
  
Q. Jamie, just curious, that being said about still have a lot to prove,
at the same time are you ahead of where you thought you might be after your
first season at TCU coming in there?  
JAMIE DIXON: I mean, I know from the outside and going in you never think
you're going to go tenth to first, but that was our belief. That was our goal
last year. We thought we could. I mean, obviously some would say it's
unrealistic, but it can't happen unless you do believe in it. I know everybody
talks about rebuilding plans and how long it's going to take and once I get my
guys in there and I've never been that guy.  
  
I haven't had to do it a lot. I've done it as an assistant. But I wanted to
embrace the guys that are there and say thew they're our guys. They were well-
coached. Trent left us good players and coached 'em hard and got 'em ready. I
thought there were some things there in place.  
  
We were, about halfway through the conference, we were in a good spot. We just
didn't get it done. Maybe you had to go through that process at some point,
maybe not in the first year, it happens in year three, four, that's usually
what I've seen in rebuilds that I've been a part of, but we didn't look at it
as a rebuild because our history hasn't been good enough to talk about the
past. But we look at it as a start-up. That's what I told the guys, it's a
start-up, this is the first time we've been in a conference like this with the
resources, with the new arena, with you guys as players.  
  
So everything was new and good and nothing had anything to do with the past.
So that was our mentality. I know -- I've had coaching buddies that have said
you're winning too quick or you're changing too quick. I had a few guys giving
me a hard time this summer, but it's -- I guess we've, you know, give me time.
I never was the guy that was saying it's going to take some time. We never
said that. We expected to win and we expected to win now and that was our
mentality. It was great for us. We won 24 games, nobody every thought, but in
my mind we should have won more, so I wasn't satisfied.  
  
Q. News about Jaylen's injury came at a weird time, during the summer.  
JAMIE DIXON: Right.  
  
Q. Mid to late August. Where is he with that and do you expect him to be
good to play?  
JAMIE DIXON: We will practice later today when we gets back. He's been doing
5-0 shooting skill work and he's on the verge of doing 5 on 5 stuff. So I
guess throw that in there you think he's probably going to be ready about the
start of the season, November 10. So we feel like it's -- he looks fine. I
mean, watching him do skill work and watching him run through our 5 and 0,
someone would say why be didn't he practice when you see him on the floor. He
looks fine. He goes extremely hard, always has, always does. The injury
happened on our ninth practice the next to last one before we went to
Australia and it was one of the last plays of practice. We weren't doing a lot
of live stuff, 5 on 5 stuff, and we were very short that day in that area. But
it was something that had already been there from a previous injury and we're
lucky, really, the timing of it because we think he will be ready and in
pretty good shape to start the year. You would like some game situations under
his belt, but that may come in the regular season to get him ready. So he's in
good shape. Kouat has been out with a concussion for a couple of days. He
didn't play in our scrimmage on the weekend, but he should be practicing here
in a couple days as well. Everybody else is in pretty good shape.  
  
Q. Winning too quick, huh? You were accused of too much too soon?  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, you know, it's -- I've heard people say that,
coaches have said that. Coaches speak, doesn't always mean it's accurate. We
do have to be realistic and look at our past. It's not great. So that's
probably where it comes from. We had good players there, and I knew some of
them -- Alex Robinson we recruited at Pitt. He visited us. I knew he was
sitting out, that was a big help. I heard Kenrich Williams was good, better
than I was told, better than we thought. Now he's as good as anybody in the
league, I believe.  
  
So Vlad was -- he just kept getting better because he works. There were some
pieces there and like I said. Trent won a lot of games, coached a lot of
people, coached a lot of pros. He developed some guys and made 'em tougher. So
there were some good situations as far as the improvement in the facilities,
resources, commitment, all those things that came about with it. So I think
there was a lot of things in play there, but, you know, we felt we could win
right away and they believed in it and we tried to convince them and we went
through a tough stretch and maybe we didn't believe enough or we hadn't been
through it, but as the year progressed we got better for it.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if there is an NIT bounce?  
JAMIE DIXON: You hope! That's the plan. I think that's why we're picked where
we are picked and you see a lot of things that have us in the Tournament and
winning some games and doing that. That's the plan and we have all our guys
coming back, that helps, 5 of our top-6 leading scorers, you have a guy
sitting out that would have played a lot of minutes for us in Kouat. So there
are a lot of guys, I think we added the right piece. I think Ahmed is going to
give us some great minutes inside as well. There are eight guys I feel really
good about once we get Kouat and Jaylen out there, we have got to get a couple
other guys to give us some minutes as well, get a little more comfortable out
there as well, two new guys. But it's a good group and good balance and I
think we're playing in the best league in the country so we need to be ready.  
  
Q. Wondering, you spent all those years at Pitt in the Big East, big,
physical, strong league. How much of an adjustment was it going through the
Big 12, playing styles, that kind of thing? Was it an adjustment for you? Just
a different style of play I imagine.  
JAMIE DIXON: To me, the biggest thing was playing everybody twice. Smaller
league with nine teams there was more familiarity. You know you're going to
play them again home and home, and I think the game has changed, more so than
the league. Every rule that changed, that they make is to help the offense,
scoring more. So that's more what we're dealing with I think than maybe the
change in conference. I have changed conferences as we have changed these
rules. So going from the Big East to the ACC there are no more physical
leagues, it's not allowed to the degree -- I mean, some teams are more
physical than others. But I think you still need to be physical to some degree
defensively and it's playing the right way and being just as physical, but
doing it without getting fouls called on you, without putting your guys in
foul trouble and without putting them at the free throw line. That's what
we're working for and trying to develop that reputation.  
  
I think that's important, too, because as a program we were -- our reputation
was being last. We've got to develop a reputation of being a great defensive
team, sound, fundamentally consistent and efficient at the same time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Mike Boynton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34243)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton. Welcome
to the Big 12. Your thoughts about the season?  
  
MIKE BOYNTON: Peter, thank you very much. I'm excited about being here,
obviously my first time as a head coach. Been in this profession for 13 years
in different capacities so a kid like myself growing up in Brooklyn, New York,
having dreams of hopefully one day having an opportunity to run my own program
and be a leader and to be able to do it at a place like Oklahoma State with so
much great tradition from a basketball sense, where so many great coaches have
graced the sidelines all the way back to Coach Iba, who changed the way people
coach the game of basketball all the way through Coach Sutton and his
unbelievable success, two Final Fours, a number of other great runs in the
NCAA Tournament, all the great players who played in our program. I feel
blessed and lucky to have the opportunity to be there. Got a great
administrator, system support. I feel good about our team, I like our guys and
I'm looking to the challenge of this great league and I'm sure there will be
plenty of questions that as the season comes along about my experience or lack
thereof from a head coaching standpoint. I'm looking forward to getting after
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. When the FBI news came down, what was your initial reaction?
Obviously it involved Oklahoma State. As a first-year head coach what was that
experience like?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Jeff, I appreciate the question. I know that everybody wants
answers to some of those things. Really can't answer much with regard to the
investigation. I will tell you just like everybody else in the country,
probably in the world, when that head line comes across your phone because I
was on the plane that morning, I was shocked! That's really the only thing I
can say about my initial feelings and thoughts about it.  
  
Q. I know obviously with Jawun gone, Leyton gone, there is a void with
leadership on this team. Who are you seeing step up in that role?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thank you very much. Every team takes on a different personality
and obviously you like to have as many guys returning with experience as
possible. Certainly going into my first year as a head coach if I've got Jawun
Evans to practice with this afternoon I feel better than not having him, but
Mitchell Solomon and Jeffrey Carroll who are both here today have been good in
terms of leadership and continue to preach the message that it's always about
our program and our team and trying to get better than we were the day before
and that they know the challenges in this league are great and that they look
forward to trying to continue to elevate and build off the momentum that we
had toward the end of last season.  
  
Q. Mike, when the preseason poll came out last week you guys had a
strong response, posted a video of Jeffrey Carroll crumpling up the poll. How
much a sleight is that to you and the players?  
MIKE BOYNTON: It's not a sleight, to be perfectly honest. Preseason polls
really don't mean a whole lot. I've never been into that. I haven't read a
single preseason college basketball magazine, probably haven't done so since
I've been a coach. I did it when I played because it was something that you
enjoyed reading about, maybe hopefully somebody will mention your name, but
it's not something I make a lot about, I look forward to going to practice
every day and trying to make our guys better and going through the process of
continuing to implement our system and elevate our program from where it is to
where it can hopefully be again, a nationally relevant program.  
  
Q. Have you had to insulate your team from all the stuff that's gone
outside of that in the negative news? Has that been difficult to make that
happen?  
MIKE BOYNTON: I don't feel like I've had to do anything different, to be
perfectly honest, with our team. Kids are pretty resilient and really for the
most part all they want to do is play basketball and go to school. Because of
that, being able to get to practice pretty quickly after this all happened was
something that was really beneficial to us because we got back to being able
to focus on the things that we were trying to focus on before this every
happened which was trying to be the best Oklahoma State basketball team that
we could be this year and given Mitchell Solomon and Jeffrey Carroll, Tavarius
Shine and Kendall Smith, our seniors, the best opportunity to end their
college careers on a positive note. That's the only thing that we have been
focused on.  
  
Q. With the losses that you've had, are we going to see Oklahoma State
play a different style of basketball this year? Have you had to reshape the
approach from previous teams?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Yeah, I mean, I think every year you adjust because your roster
changes. In college basketball you never have the same team coming back as you
had the year before and certainly when you lose an NBA caliber point guard and
don't replace him with necessarily a guy who is going to get drafted. You have
to adjust how you play.  
  
Again, for me, it's all about trying to get Oklahoma State back to making deep
runs in the NCAA Tournament, trying to make the Oklahoma State fans proud of
the product that they see on the floor and we do that at Oklahoma State by
being a really, really good defensive team. It's been something we have really
focused on since I took over late March and it's something we try to building
on every single day, so defense is something we try to focus on.  
  
Q. Talk about the fans. It wasn't that long ago when Gallagher-Iba Arena
was the toughest place to play in the Big 12 in terms of rowdiness and
whatnot, but the malaise that has set in with the fan base. How do you reach
out to them and get them to comeback to see what you guys are all about?  
MIKE BOYNTON: We had an opportunity to taste that a little bit last year. I'm
not sure it was the toughest arena to play in in the league last season. We
went up to Ames late in the year and that was a pretty tough environment to
play in. But all the places in our league, there are no easy wins on the road.
I think our fans need to see that there is a commitment to playing the game
the right way. To having guys that are committed to playing for each other, to
having guys that are committed to playing for each other and unselfishly and
having guys committed to representing Oklahoma State in the best way possible
in terms of trying to have success and ultimately the wins do matter. So as
you try to continue to win games you will have more people interested in
coming to watch you.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a little experience in the conference but have you
talked to the other coaches in the league to find out what it's like to be a
head coach in the Big 12?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Not specifically, but we've met all, a couple times since I took
the job, and they've all been very helpful in terms of just offering support.
But they're competitors, right? So it's not like they're going to give me
secrets on how to beat 'em! Those guys are all going to try to teach me
lessons as a rookie head coach and I think we will be up to the task from a
competitive standpoint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for coming and good luck this season.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Bob Bowlsby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14164)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Thank you very much. Good morning all. Thanks for being
here early on a Tuesday morning. Well, we're already scrimmaging, so I guess
basketball is starting, regardless of whether football is yet completed.  
  
I think you will find that we have another group of excellent basketball
teams. We've got terrific coaches and I just came from a meeting with our
coaches, and a lot of great players. So like previous years, I think you will
see us high in the RPI and I think we've got six teams that are receiving
votes or are ranked in the top 25, including West Virginia and Kansas that are
in the top ten. After a year when we had three in the Sweet 16, but didn't
move on. We had an NIT championship last year, and I think TCU was probably
playing about as well as anybody about the end of the year.  
  
One of the statistics I have seen that I've been interested in and doing a
little more research on it, the average margin of victory in our conference
last year for the entire season was only 7.9 points. We've had a lot of really
competitive games.  
  
I think that's worn itself out in our nonconference performance because we're
over 500 against every one of the autonomy conferences.  
  
Just a reminder, we do have a first and second round in Dallas this year on
March 15 and 17, so we will be -- the conference will be hosting the
postseason in addition to being here in March. Obviously, I think that this is
the best college basketball tournament in the nation. It's the best attended.
I think it's the most competitive. The balance from top to bottom is truly
remarkable; and, so I think, you know, we will have a wild time between now
and the time we're back here in March again. Relative to the broader
environment, obviously all of you have been paying attention, as all of us
have, to the Department of Justice and FBI investigations, and we really wish
we had a fair amount more information on it.  
  
I don't have anything more than what all of you have. We certainly have always
known that all of the best parts of college athletics and all the worst part
of college athletics are imbedded in the sport of men's college basketball.
Lots of high-risk academic people and high-risk social people and lots of
third parties that are involved, and I think it's impossible to know at this
point how far this goes or who might be involved in it. One thing about it,
when DOJ and the FBI get involved they have both the power of subpoena and the
weight of perjury which the NCAA doesn't have its disposal. As a result I
think this is going to be around for a while, and I think we are likely to be
in the same situation we're in now, and that is that we don't know very much
information, aren't going to get heads-up before things happen; and as a
result of that, it's a period of some discomfort.  
  
I think that our basketball enterprise in the Big 12 is impeccable. I think
it's led by people of integrity in the coaches and I think Curtis Shaw, our
coordinator of officials does a tremendous job, and John Underwood who leads
basketball enterprise from a staff standpoint is extremely good at what he
does and energetically engaged. I have a couple of other things to talk about
this morning, but I will do that after I take questions. Happy to field
questions for 10 or 12 minutes and then I will go on to the other things I
have.  
  
Q. Bob, there have been a number of exhibition games for charity, couple
days ago right here at the Sprint Center with a number of Big 12 teams
involved. A number of people saying this would be a great thing to continue
allow schools if they want to play an exhibition game for charity. Do you see
that having momentum as far as NCAA approval?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Well, first of all, I congratulate the schools that have
been involved in these things because of the amount of money they've generated
for charity. Our country has had the burden of several natural disasters that
have been truly significant, and it's a good way for the sport of basketball
to help, so I think that part of it has been good.  
  
We have settled on a number of games that are permissible under the rules and
yet we've also encountered and there has been a proliferation of exempt
contests.  
  
So what we thought was an absolute number on the number of games we were going
to play has now morphed into something very with different than that. I'm
spending most of my time on football oversight, among the responsibilities I
have with the council, so I am not in the room for the oversight -- Basketball
Oversight Committee's discussions.  
  
I know there has been concern about it just creating an additional game. When
there's those that do it for charity, everybody else gets in line just to get
an opportunity for another scrimmage or another game. I think there will be an
extended discussion about it with basketball oversight and I wouldn't presume
how that would come out. I haven't heard any momentum for making it a
permanent waiver of the rule. That would take a more substantial effort, and
if that has started I haven't heard it.  
  
Q. Just kinda wondering, the ACC I believe next year is going to a
20-game league schedule obviously because of the network. The Big Ten is
toying with the idea. I wondered from the Big 12 aspect what that reaction
might be. Is there any kind of reaction to possibility of Big 12 going to a
20-game schedule? Anything there?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Well, we would have to have some play three times to get
to 20 with ten members, so 18 is really sort of our max. I think the
implication it has for us is that it probably makes nonconference scheduling a
little more difficult with those two leagues. They made the changes in both
cases to accommodate more network inventory and were we in the same position
we might have made the same decision.  
  
So I think it may be more challenging for our schools to schedule Big Ten and
ACC schools because they're not going to have as many games to play on a non
conference basis. But we play a full double round Robin, which neither of them
do. You're never going to win the Big 12 by who you don't play. You're going
to have to see everybody twice. We love our model. We have enjoyed the No. 1
RPI for four of the last seven years. We think that our teams compete very
well at the highest levels and I don't anticipate any changes in that.  
  
Q. Bob, my guess is that the league office didn't know -- or didn't
learn about this FBI investigation until all of us, correct?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: That's correct.  
  
Q. After that happens, what did you guys do from a league perspective,
as soon as Oklahoma State was named? Did you go to Stillwater and say, hey,
what's going on? Do you reach out to other schools? What's your take on what
the league's role should be in all of this?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: Well, even the schools' roles have been somewhat unclear
because this is new territory and you're dealing with governmental agencies.
So we've provided some -- we just had an ADs meeting last week and we provided
some guidance from the center. I think everybody has the same reaction to it.
They're not quite sure where to go, but there was guidance from the NCAA as to
things that ought to be accomplished before the start of the season, going
back and making sure that all of the I's are dotted and T's are crossed from
the standpoint of certification and the squad lists and all the things you do
going into the season.  
  
But surveillance of rule compliance is something our schools do all the time.
It's a routine, almost daily part of how they operate. I don't know that any
of this necessitates radical procedures on campus, but I think it also informs
administrator and central administration individuals to ask questions and make
sure that compliance is on the front of everybody's mind as they implement
their day-to-day activities. Beyond that, I think we wait, like everybody
else.  
  
Q. Speaking of football oversight, where does it stand on the 14-week
schedule? What are the implications of that?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: We probably are not going to get a standardized 14-week
schedule. There is a Competition Subcommittee of the Football Oversight
Committee that's been working on this. Our principle intention was to get the
preseason back within the box that is the month of August. As you know, by
waiver, we went into the month of July this year. If you overlay the 14-week
schedule with the schedule that we've put together from a safety and sports
sciences standpoint, elimination of two-a-days, you find yourself up against
the end of summer school and starting the last week of July.  
  
So the proposal that is going to come forward doesn't include the 14-week
schedule. There were also a couple of elements of the 14-week schedule that
were not as they appeared. As an example, it sounds good to have two byes
during the regular season, but those two byes for some are going to end up
bye-bye during the middle of the year. Somebody else is going to have bye,
road game, bye. Some are going to have two byes in September and no byes in
October and November.  
  
When you spread it across the breadth and depth of the schedule matrix, it is
doesn't work out equally for everybody. And it also ignores what we have to do
within conferences. Some conferences have rules that they don't allow
nonconference games after the fourth week of the season. Others play
nonconference games throughout the year.  
  
It just had a disparate affect and I think you will see a proposal that
reduces the number of practices from 29 to 25 gets the start of camp back into
the August window and then takes into account some of the other safety things
that we've been trying to get. So I don't think 14 weeks is going to fly, but
it's probably off the table for good and appropriate reasons.  
  
Q. Do you worry that the probe and scandal that has enveloped college
basketball could encompass college football at some point?  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: That has occurred to me. There are some of the same
things that are present in college football, especially as you think of 7-on-7
and some of the nonscholastic aspects of it. And I think a lot of the
basketball problems are imbedded in the club programs and the fact that, you
know, if you're a top-200 player in college basketball, at a purely letter of
the law basis, you're likely to have been professionalized sometime during the
process leading up to your recruitment in college just through the benefits
you've received and those kinds of things.  
  
So there are some problems that are baked in that are perhaps a little more
prevalent because of its structure in college basketball, but I don't think
you have to have too vivid of an imagination to see this showing up in other
sports.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Commissioner?  
  
COMMISSIONER BOWLSBY: One other thing I would like to make you aware of this
morning: Our women's basketball tournament is coming back to Kansas City. It's
been in Oklahoma City. It will be for two more years, but in 2020 the women's
basketball tournament will come back to Kansas City and will be played the
same weekend as the men's tournament. It was that way many times until I think
it was last year in 2012. This will be a one-year agreement in Kansas City for
the 2020 tournament. It's one year because we wanted the agreements to be co
terminus with the men's agreement and our current contract runs through 2020
with the men's tournament. The venue will be Municipal Auditorium, as it was
before. Many of you are aware that are close to Kansas City that they've done
about $5 million worth of improvements on video boards and locker rooms and
lower bowl seating and sound systems and that sort of thing.  
  
So we will be in Oklahoma City for two more years and then in Kansas City in
2020. We feel like there is synergy between men's and women's tournaments and
the men's and women's crowds, so we are grateful for Kathy Nelson and her
Sports Commission crew here. They've been very accommodating for us and we are
looking forward to coming back with the women's tournament in 2020.  
  
Let me stop there and see if you have any questions about that. Okay. The last
thing I would like to talk about and we announced it a week or so ago is that
we have established a partnership with the Rhoden Fellows program. Many of you
know Bill Rhoden and he is here today and I will ask him to come up and
address your questions, but we did a state of college athletics forum on race
and intercollegiate athletics and we have done six of these forums now and as
you know we have taken on difficult topics and we have put people together
that we knew disagreed with one another. Ill was part of the most recent one
that we did in Atlanta and out of those -- out of that interaction we began
talk about the Rhoden Fellows that he has started with ESPN and his role
there.  
  
It is a program to provide opportunities and mentorship for young African
American people who would like to get into the intercollegiate athletics. So
today during the time that you're here you will have some opportunity to
interface with Simone Benson from Morgan State Donovan Dooley from North
Carolina A&T and from Isaiah Smalls who is from Morehouse College. They will
be with us and they have been helping in the ramp-up to this event and we
think it's a good opportunity for some young people to be involved in our
program and Bill has embraced this and provided us the opportunity to serve in
this way, and we think that not only will we get a lot of quality work out of
these young people, but it will be a good ongoing way for them to be exposed
to intercollegiate athletics at the highest level.  
  
So we are very excited that they will be with us today and throughout the year
and leading up to the March conference tournament.  
  
Bill, if you will, let me invite you up and I will turn the program over to
you.  
  
BILL RHODEN: Thank you very much, Bob. I see a lot of familiar faces out here.
I'm normally for 40 or so years I've been doing this I've always been on this
side. So this is kind of unique. I'm not going to take a lot of time. I know
when you do these Media Day things you kinda want to get in and out, but this
is very important. And let me give a lot of credit to Bob, because this really
came about as a result of a -- some what of a pretty tough conversation that
we were having. A typical forum that we talk about diversity and that kind of
stuff.  
  
Basically, I said okay, wait a minute, timeout, just wait a minute! I've
covered tons of national championship games and Final Fours and I said, you
know, I've been doing these things for so long and the only time I see the
heaviest concentration of young black people is on the court or on the field.
As you go back in the press room, as you go to media operations, it gets
whiter and whiter and whiter!  
  
It's been like this for years and we can look around now, you know? One of my
missions is how do we get more young African Americans into this industry? Not
just in journalism which obviously we need, but also in event operations,
almost every other phase of this industry! Again, where we are mostly
concentrated is on the field and on the court. So to Bob's credit, he stopped
me almost in mid-sentence and he said you know, you're right! How do we begin
to fix this?  
  
At that time, I had just started working with ESPN, as many of you know, I was
with the New York Times for almost 35 years and he said, how do we start to
fix this? We talked about it, had dinner, and I said, well, I'm working with
the Rhoden Fellows, which is six students on a two-year internship, a
fellowship through ESPN and the Undefeated. Basically they're going to be with
me for two years. I'm going to show them what I know and what I don't know.
Some of you have already met them and spoken with them. As a result of our
conversations, we're here. Three of them are here. I don't know if you met
Isaiah Smalls, raise your hand, from Morehouse College. Simone Benson from
Morgan State, my alma mater, the best HBCU in the country. Donovan Dooley is
from North Carolina A&T, arch rival, it's a miracle he's here! But he's a
great kid!  
  
I guess if I have any message, it's that I know we talk about change, people
say things are changing and you know what? Sometimes change only takes five
minutes. It takes five minutes and that's about the time that it took Bob and
I to talk and for him to realize you know what? There is a problem. It took
maybe five to ten minutes to recognize a problem and let's deal with it. It's
not really that complicated to solve these problems, if your heart is there
and the will is there, it's not really that complicated. Again, I'm not here
to make speeches and talks, I just want to thank Bob, the Big 12, we're going
to be working together hopefully for a long time.  
  
We also hope that -- the Big 12 isn't alone, whether you have covered the Big
Ten, SEC, it's the same thing in every single conference. This pictured is the
way it is in every single conference. Black kids on the field, black kids on
the court and that's pretty much it.  
  
We want to work to help change that. There are a lot of really bright and
talented kids who I'm working with who are being exposed to different aspects
of this immense industry. So, again, I want to thank all of you for being
here, my colleagues. Again, thank Bob and the Big 12 especially, thank you for
being so accommodating and Bob has been the go-between. Thank you very much.
Thank you for helping me get the ketchup off my jacket. So thank you all and
thanks for being here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Bill?  
  
BILL RHODEN: Do we have any answers? Okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, appreciate it.  
  
BILL RHODEN: I'm looking for the answers!

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 24, 2017

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Texas Tech Coach, Chris Beard. Coach,
welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
CHRIS BEARD: It's an exciting time of year for offensively us involved in
college basketball. We're looking forward to this season. We like our team. We
have a unique roster. We have five seniors which makes us one of the oldest
teams in college basketball, most experienced. We have seven freshmen on the
roster, too. So it's been interesting to say the least. We're excited about
our schedule this year, playing a tough schedule, so much respect for
everybody in the Big 12. So hopefully this will prepare us better than it did
last year. Practices are going well, relatively healthy right now. So looking
forward to being a great part of college basketball.  
  
Q. Chris, you have the seniors and the freshmen and other newcomers as
well. How does that work chemistrywise?  
CHRIS BEARD: Our chemistry is a work in progress. Started this summer where we
had 100% in our summer workouts, the only exception was Morrow who was playing
for his national team in Italy. So I guess it wasn't quite 100%, I am not a
math major. But it starts with our senior leadership. Those five guys have
done a great job taking those guys underneath their wings and showing them
what college basketball is all about but certainly our chemistry is a work in
progress.  
  
Q. Talk about Zach. Do you think he's an under-the-radar guy when it
comes to recognition?  
CHRIS BEARD: Not anymore. When you are first team all-Big 12 guy, there is no
more under-the-radar. Zach has been working hard to get his skill level to
match his athleticism. I've been really impressed with him, it started last
year as a junior getting things done individually, being recognized as an
honorable mention-type guy. Kinda went through the NBA process this spring and
summer which I fully supported. I want all our guys to have all their dreams
come true and certainly Zach is a guy that I think has the chance to play in
the NBA one day. After he got that input, decided to come back to college. He
had a great summer and he's looking to continue that this fall. We look for
great things out of all our seniors and certainly Zach is on top of that list.  
  
Q. Of all the guys you have, Odiase is the most intriguing who flashed
great potential a couple of years ago and then he got hurt. Where is he on the
come-back trail and do you expect him to be as big of a component as he
should?  
CHRIS BEARD: It's exciting. We're excited to have Norense back on the active
roster. I think he has a chance to be one of the better players in the Big 12.
I would like to have give Coach Smith credit for what he did with Keenan and
Norense in their career. We're trying to finish the story strong, but
personally I think Norense should be one of the best stories in college
basketball. Here is a guy who has endured a lot of injuries. He is the
definition of perseverance. He's a great stat. He takes care of his life on
and off the court and I think he's the kind of guy that represents college
basketball. In all my years of coaching he's probably embraced the rehab
process more than I've every season, and he actually improved his body during
the time that he couldn't play basketball which is hard to do. But I think
when you guys see him here in a couple of weeks when we get on the court you
will be pleased with the way he looks and he's stronger than every. We're
looking for a great year out of Norense.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could speak to the improvement Keenan had. He had
183-pointers, sophomore year and last year a better percentage. What have you
seen and what were the challenges that you spoke to for him to improve that?  
CHRIS BEARD: Keenan is our guy. I've never been more excited to coach a guy
his senior year than I have Keenan. I give Starks and Tubby and those guys
credit for developing Keenan his first two years, and I'll give our staff
credit for taking him as a good player who played a role to one of the better
players in the Big 12 last year. But above all I will give Keenan more credit
than anybody because he's the one that's put in the time. He's been
disciplined on and off the court. I think the thing I have seen from him the
last few months is a different level of maturity and discipline. He's not a
vocal leader, he's not a Tim Tebow kind of buy, but he's a quiet leader and he
takes care of what he's supposed to do and he's stretching himself getting out
of his comfort zone trying to be a more vocal leader. When you are recognize
the in this league as a preseason player. I think he's honorable mention. That
speaks for itself, and I think Keenan has a chance to be one of the better
guards in all of college basketball this season.  
  
Q. You were mentioning your seniors. You look at the preseason first
team and they're all seniors. I'm wondering, the college basketball game so
much today gets, you know, so much talked about freshmen and one-and-done kind
of kids. What does it say about this league that it is able to develop four-
year guys and bring seniors who can contribute at a high level?  
CHRIS BEARD: I think it's a unique year for the Big 12. I think we should be
really proud of that. I think one of the things it says it talks about the
great coaching in this league for these guys to develop over the course of
their careers and be first-team all conference players in the best league in
college basketball speaks for itself.  
  
I think the story still is about the players. College basketball is about the
players not the comps, in my opinion. These are guys that have worked
extremely hard and I'm glad to see Keenan and Zach get some attention but I
would I put Justin Gray and Norense and Tommy and Niem and our other order
guys in that same class. I think it has a potential to be a special year
especially at Texas Tech because of our seniors.  
  
Q. Coach, you and Jamie Dixon are the newest coaches in the league. Did
you guys know each other or what were the challenges the first year and what
kind of a job do you think Jamie did his first year?  
CHRIS BEARD: I've known Jamie. I was head coach at Fort Scott Community
College. He was an assistant at Pitt. He did a great job of recruiting some of
our guys. He's one of the most respected guys in our industry. He's a real
guy. Jamie hasn't changed over the years even though the title and the shirt
and the paycheck has. Specifically I wasn't surprised at all at TCU's season
last year, got good players and a great coach. I think the attention they're
receiving this year, being ranked high in the poll and things like that is
deserving. But there is no one I have more respect for than Jamie.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at recruiting in the state of Texas, between you
and Jamie obviously, and Texas and Baylor and A &M. What did you find about
that when you started that first year to try to get out there?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, I've always known about the talent in Texas. I was
fortunate enough to grow up in the state and play for two Hall of Fame coaches
Mike and Terry Priest. I'm proud of my background coaching at different
institutions? Texas. I'm proud of my background and my relationship where high
school coaches and junior college coaches. It used to be a little bit of a
surprise early in my career we could sneak a guy out of Texas, but now it it's
no secret. I think the best coaching and the best talent is in the state of
Texas. So it is certainly an identity in our program and we're proud to have
guys like Jarrett Culver and Zhaire Smith that we think are going to be great
players for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck for the season.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 74, Creighton - 60  
  
COACH WRIGHT: First, I want to congratulate Creighton. Really good basketball
team. And we might have played our best defensive game of the year. And I
think it's because these guys know how good they are offensively. There was no
problem getting their attention to prepare for their offensive execution and
their tempo.  
  
And then just, again, great leadership from our seniors, and these two guys
were just special, really special.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about what winning two Big East championships in
the last three years?  
COACH WRIGHT: It's really good players. Kris Jenkins, Josh Hart, Darryl
Reynolds were on these teams and so was Mikal. And so was Phil Booth. We've
got good players. And that's what does it.  
  
Q. Early in the season you had mentioned about wanting to develop the
other players as the season goes on so that by the end of the season you'll
have I guess a deeper threat as far as -- have you reached that? Because it
looks like you did?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think we have. And Dylan Painter was the final piece, he's
doing a great job. We didn't really need him tonight as much, but Donte
DiVincenzo, Eric Paschall, even Mikal, who we thought early in the year would
be coming off the bench if we had Phil Booth. Those guys have really developed
into big-time players. So it gives us a good eight-man rotation now which is
very important, especially this time of year, three games in a row.  
  
Q. Josh, the celebration didn't really seem like a big celebration --
businesslike, a couple of hugs. What was the mindset there. Aren't you
happy?  
JOSH HART: I thought about the same thing. We didn't -- I think last time we
ran on, we stormed the court, everyone's jumping around, doing all that.  
  
But I think part of it was just exhaustion. We just played as hard as we could
for 40 minutes. And then definitely we know we've got to get a lot better.
We've got to keep being coachable. I think that was the other half of that.  
  
And obviously we're very humble, very honored to win this against a tough
Creighton team. Give them all the respect and credit. But we've got to keep
getting better.  
  
Q. Jay, talk about how Josh has evolved as a player since 2015, last
time he got selected as Big East Tournament MVP?  
COACH WRIGHT: It's amazing, he was tournament MVP as a sophomore, and he's
better in every aspect of the game. He's such a better player, which is
amazing if you think about it, that he won it and he's better in every aspect
of the game.  
  
And finally going into this tournament, I think he put it all together. It was
his leadership, it was his decision-making, his defense, his rebounding.  
  
And then putting the team on his back last night, making the big plays. He's
just done everything. I think he's a complete basketball player. I think he's
the best, most complete player in the country.  
  
And I'm sure I'm biased. I don't spend time with those other guys, but I don't
see anybody that does everything like he does.  
  
Q. Jay, what do you think changed four years ago? There's -- the league
changed and not that you guys weren't playing well, but obviously not to the
level you've been the last four years. What do you think happened? Why do you
think you guys have taken off like this with the new conference?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think the group of players that we had at the time it changed,
the group of players were ready to be really good whatever conference we were
in. And then the conference changed and we got into a great conference with
home and home and real basketball. Everybody a basketball team.  
  
I think it just exhilarated everybody. Everywhere we played, you don't have
any games where you go and you know, like, this place is half full, nobody
really cares. The league and the group of players we had -- really Josh and
these guys, freshmen -- it really started with Ryan Arcidiacono and those guys
as freshmen when it changed. We had a great group of players.  
  
And what's interesting is when the Big East went to 16 teams -- that might
have been '06, '05 or '06 -- we had the same situation. We had Randy Foye and
Allen Ray and all those guys and we had a great team. I think we won the
league in '06, right when the change came. We've been very lucky.  
  
Q. Jalen, now that you guys have won this, can you be more honest about
how much losing it last year drove you guys during the offseason and really
through the year?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I think it was, Coach brought it up plenty of times about how
our demeanor was in the locker room after we lost. And coach didn't want our
senior class to go out like that again. So we just brought in, the other guys
bought into what Coach was saying. Obviously the seniors did as well. We have
a group of seniors who lead us but also want to get better every day. Just
shows the type of character those guys have.  
  
Q. Coach, as defending NCAA champions, no team has won back-to-back in
20 years. What's it going to take for you guys to repeat? And is there more
pressure on you guys going into this tournament?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know what, I don't know yet about the pressure. There's
different kinds of pressure during the year. There's definitely a hangover
from last year, which however you define it put pressure on us through this
season.  
  
And I thought we handled it really well. And now this is the final piece going
into the tournament. I don't know what we're going to feel like until a couple
days ahead. We're so focused -- this tournament was like a break from all of
that, because you just get here and you know the NCAA Tournament's coming. You
get here, you're just in New York, it's just Big East teams, it's that New
York, Madison Square Garden vibe.  
  
This was a really nice break. I feel like we were like everybody else here,
because we weren't defending champions, you know? So we gotta deal with that.
I'm not sure how yet that's going to impact us.  
  
Q. Jay, how does this Big East title feel and why do you appreciate
it?  
COACH WRIGHT: It feels a lot better than I'm probably showing. I just -- I
grew up watching the Big East. Probably from your age, and it was always my
favorite basketball, all my favorite teams, Villanova was my favorite team.
And every time -- and I coached here in New York so every time I come back
here there's a lot of friends.  
  
I think the Garden is the mecca of college basketball. So I just enjoy seeing
my guys enjoy it and win because I know it's special to them, too. I get the
feeling -- a real good glow inside seeing these guys be happy and accomplish
something.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you executed on multiple facets of the game tonight.
Talk to me more about how you guys shut down Creighton -- 17 turnovers, 21
points?  
COACH WRIGHT: I thought against Seton Hall our ball pressure was not really
good. We were kind of lax on the ball.  
  
And these guys really executed. I think Greg's teams execute as well as
anybody, if not the best in the country. We knew if we just let them run their
stuff we could get sliced up. So pressure on the ball was really important.
And I thought we did a great job of it.  
  
Q. Jay, what do you think your biggest obstacle is as a team going
forward?  
COACH WRIGHT: Just staying humble. You get a lot of attention. To the previous
question, you know, we're still in this Big East mode. We're going to stay in
New York tonight. We're going to enjoy this. Then we're going to go home and
it's going to be Selection Sunday and start dealing with all the repeat, 1
seed, all that. Handling all that is going to be the biggest obstacle.  
  
Q. Josh, I know you're not done yet, but have you had a chance to put
everything you've accomplished so far in your career into perspective, and now
topping off this season you've had so far in the Big East?  
JOSH HART: Not really. I don't think I will for another month or so. And a lot
of that comes from the guys to the right of me. He wants us to keep getting
better. He wants us to keep being coachable. And last night we talked as a
team. And I think every team right now would be happy -- well, last night --
happy that they're going to be in their conference championship game.  
  
And Coach, he was talking to us, telling us the truth, telling us honesty and
telling us that we have to get a lot better. So when you have a coach who has
accomplished everything that he's accomplished and he keeps talking about how
we have to get better, there's no better example than that.  
  
You don't have to look other places. He keeps wanting to get better as a
coach. He keeps wanting us as a team to get better. So I'm following his lead.  
  
And I'm not thinking about that now. I've got one month left of my college
basketball career. And I can't think about that now.  
  
Q. Jay, you talked about being a 1 seed. Do you think you've earned the
overall No. 1 seed?  
COACH WRIGHT: Probably. Probably. But we don't really care. I'm more excited
about what you just said right there. We're going to be fine. We're going to
be fine. Wherever they put us, whatever our seed is.  
  
Q. Jalen and Josh, what do you feel is your greatest, like, strength in
this Big East Tournament? How has that prepared you for the tournament as a
team?  
JOSH HART: I would say responding. I think that's the biggest part. Attitude,
really.  
  
We had a very rare game with St. John's where everything really fell. And then
we had Saturday, the adversity, the feel of that game was just like a
championship game.  
  
And we had big mistakes down the stretch of that game. I had a late turnover.
And we kept -- we didn't let that define us. We said attitude and we came back
and got stops. I think that's really one of the things that we can really
build from. That's something that we had really this whole week and I'm proud
of that. I'm proud of our guys having that mentality of no matter what happens
on offense, no matter what adversity strikes we're going to get through it.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked earlier about ball pressure wasn't the greatest
against Seton Hall. Going against Creighton you guys defended the perimeter
very well and hard. Was that something you incorporated in your game plan for
the championship?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. It was part of the reason that Seton Hall did a good
job against us, because we didn't do a good job of ball pressure. But we also
knew it could be a lot worse against Creighton if we didn't do that.  
  
So it's easy for a coach to say it, but when the players take responsibility
and do it, that's hard to do. And these two actually did the best job.  
  
Q. Jay, how do you balance what you have to do now with the team.
Obviously you want to congratulate them and pump them up and make them feel
really good about what they've accomplished, which is a lot. Yet you see
things, obviously, if you played the game last night in the tournament, that
might be it. So you see things that you have to correct. So how do you balance
the patting on the back and the kicking in the butt?  
COACH WRIGHT: Just honesty. And you just listened to Josh. We're honest with
them. Then you have seniors -- are they going to take it and listen to it and
fix the things you need to improve? Or are they going to say to themselves, we
won the Big East championship, and that doesn't matter.  
  
They listen. It's simple when it works that way. But it's not -- but when you
have people that listen and are humble -- I've said about these guys, I think
the two characteristics they have that are so unique is humility and
intelligence. They're humble and they listen and they know they won the Seton
Hall games, they know there's things they have to do better. They know they
won this game but there's some things we have to do better. And that's the way
we'll handle it going forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Cole Huff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26708)

### [Ronnie Harrell Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32995)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 74, Creighton - 60  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: First of all, I'd like to congratulate coach Wright, his
staff and his team. Very deserving champion.  
  
You know, they're very -- in a lot of ways, from a coaching perspective, the
way they play is how we all aspire to get our teams to play a little bit more
like they do.  
  
Because they're so disciplined. Their shot selection is incredible, attention
to detail, their hustle plays.  
  
And I thought our guys, for the most part, executed what we needed to do
defensively. Hart shot a lot of jump shots the first half and made a lot of
jump shots.  
  
I think they only had eight points in the paint at halftime. But our mistakes
that allowed the baskets for them, that was 11 to zip points off turnovers and
ended up 21-7 and we lose by those 14 points.  
  
That's too much to overcome against a team like Villanova. If you're going to
be successful, you have to value the ball, you have to take care of the
basketball and not allow them to have those easy scoring opportunities.  
  
So they're a very good team. And I'm really proud of my team for what they've
accomplished this week. We just weren't quite up to the challenge today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Cole, when you're playing a team like Villanova and you know you have
to be -- you don't have to be perfect but you've got to play really well -- is
that tough to just sort of mentally bring that mentality or that idea into the
game, thinking -- does that ever weigh on you when you're on the court
thinking that you've got to be assignment-sound and then take care of the ball
and just because they don't make a lot of mistakes?  
COLE HUFF: We're conscious of it all the time. Whenever we watch film we see
just how quickly things can turn when you play against this team because
they're not going to beat themselves.  
  
So if you miss an assignment, if you miss a closeout or turn the ball over
it's going to add up extremely quickly. And I think in the first half we
turned the ball over a few too many times.  
  
Part of it could be we were being careless with the ball, but I think we all
just wanted it so bad we were trying to make things happen that weren't there.  
  
And it's tough when that happens. But you've got to tip your hat to them. They
are the defending national champs, and it's another game we'll learn from and
get ready for next week.  
  
Q. Mack, what was going through your mind when you inserted Ronnie into
the game at that point. It seemed like it gave you some life there late in the
game, felt like it was going away?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I talked to Ronnie last night, told him he needed to be
ready. Some of the matchups, some of the switches are difficult for some of
our guys. And Ronnie's length, athletic ability, work on the backboards I
thought could have an impact today. And to his credit he was ready. And he
gave us a chance.  
  
The game was over if he doesn't come in and we get it back to 12 and at least
have a shot at it. But his activity was great. He made three assists -- he had
13 minutes and he leads us in assists. And those type of plays are the type of
plays that are going to get him on the floor more, that and with his activity
on the glass. So he was good today and he'll be important to us moving
forward.  
  
Q. What do you take away from the entire week, moving ahead?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: You know, as I told the guys I had so many of our fans come
up to me last night or this morning almost with tears in their eyes because of
the memories that we've created for them here this week.  
  
You know, we've been in this league four times. We played in the championship
game twice. We've had great followings out here every time we've come out to
play. And it's a special place to coach, it's a special place to play. So I
wanted them, while they're disappointed now, they've got to get over that in a
hurry because they've accomplished a lot this week. Selection Sunday is
tomorrow. There's 36 teams out of 350-some that will be selected as an at-
large to the NCAA Tournament. We're going to be one of them.  
  
That's hard to do. And you need to really enjoy it. So I want them to hold
their heads high, to stick their chest out when someone congratulates them, I
want a firm handshake and say thank you and understand that we lost to the
defending national champ and the likely No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. But
we have nothing to hang our heads about.  
  
Q. They have a lot of guys who can do things, big things, but what was
it like to try and stop Josh Hart in this game?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: It's real hard when he's -- I thought some of those jump
shots early Khyri and sometimes Marcus who was switched onto him. I thought
they were relatively challenged. But once he hits a couple he's so hard to
stop because you always have the threat of him getting to the rim, he's so
powerful when he gets there. And you have to respect the 3-point shot.  
  
And then to go with that, he's got that intermediate game where he can stop on
a dime and rise up and shoot over you.  
  
And he did that and Kris did that to us, Jalen hit a couple. They understand
who they are. And they execute what they do. While it's relatively simple,
their perfection makes them exceptional.  
  
Q. Coach, Jay Wright with the seniors have been through this so many
times. It's experience. Do you take that element into account trying to
prepare your team for a game like this?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Absolutely. We rolled two freshmen and a sophomore out there
in the starting lineup. Ronnie played a bunch in the second half. He's a
sophomore.  
  
So we have -- Martin Krampelj is out there as a freshmen. We're rolling some
guys out there where this is an invaluable experience.  
  
It's one thing for me to talk about what it's like but to experience it and
feel it, what the Garden is like on championship Saturday, it's something
that's pretty incredible. And our experience here this week is going to help
us moving forward and I think help us in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But those guys, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how well that Kris and Josh
and Darryl, what great ambassadors they've been for the Big East Conference.
And the Villanova program in general, for a basketball purist like myself, the
way they won it last year, team basketball, and just the way they carry
themselves.  
  
And it starts at the top with Jay, obviously, but that senior class, what
they've accomplished, is incredible. And it makes the rest of us -- and I
think I speak for the other coaches in the Big East -- when we watch what they
did last year and how they've backed it up this year, it makes you proud to be
part of this league because the team that's kind of been our shining star does
it the right way. And they represent the game of basketball and our league in
a very professional way. And it's been -- it's hard to play against, but it's
also fun to sit back and watch and enjoy.  
  
Q. I just asked Cole about it, I know you said the turnovers were the
difference or partly the difference. What did you see -- why did it sort of
spiral out of control for that stretch?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Well, I mean, it's as simple as that. You know, those
turnovers don't allow you to set your defense. And when you're trying to play
against Villanova without setting your defense, you're mismatched, you've got
the guys on guys you don't really want them on.  
  
You're asking for trouble. And while we forced some turnovers with our
defense, you know, that 14-point gap and points off turnovers is a big
statistic. It's one thing when you make a mistake. But can you correct the
mistake by getting a stop? And today we weren't able to do that.  
  
And some of them, they were broken plays where they had an advantage and it
was going to be hard for us.  
  
Q. Ronnie, when you come in there, looked like at that point the game
was pretty much in control, like there wasn't going to be much of a chance
unless you guys got really hot from the perimeter or something. But you did,
you know, through your hustle and effort plays, bring them kind of within
striking distance. When you got in there, what were you looking to do? Did you
think you could make enough plays to get you guys back in the game?  
RONNIE HARRELL JR.: I felt like I can, just kind of provide a spark for us in
any way possible. I hit a 3 early, but it goes further than just shooting,
trying to bring some pressure on the defensive end, grab some rebounds and
help in areas I felt we were struggling.  
  
Q. Coach, how much more either encouraged -- or what do you feel about
your team after this week looking ahead?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Well, we won kind of a slugfest on Thursday against
Providence. I don't think it was a pretty game but as I thought back I'm not
sure we've ever played a pretty game against Providence. It's a result of how
Ed gets his guys to play.  
  
And we ended up a shootout last night against Xavier. So we've seen some
different things and we just played against one of the most disciplined teams
in the country.  
  
I think what that does to prepare you for the NCAA Tournament is invaluable.
The negative is we've had a lot of guys play a bunch of minutes, and you could
be leaving Tuesday morning for an NCAA Tournament site. So you don't have a
ton of time to prepare.  
  
But it's been an incredible experience for our guys, and while they're
disappointed now, I think hopefully by the time they get off that plane and
sit back in that plane and reflect on what's taken place and what's transpired
this week, I hope they feel really good about what they've accomplished.  
  
Q. Both players, considering all the distractions you guys have gone
through in the last month, the injury and things like that, what did it take
for you guys to kind of come together, put that in the rearview mirror and
make sure that -- because at the end when you're playing Villanova, you were
the two teams that probably most of the league thought should be playing in
the game this day, but the road wasn't smooth by any means. What did it take
for you guys to get to this point?  
COLE HUFF: I mean, things happen. Stuff off the court, stuff on the court.
You've just got to put it in the rear view. There's nothing we can do to
change the past other than grow from it and learn from it.  
  
There's still more games to be played, and that was our mindset after every
loss, after every win, after everything that was going on, there was still
another day.  
  
I mean, that's still our mindset now. And although it may be tough sometimes,
especially when you have days like today where you're competing for a
championship and we came up a little bit short, like Coach said, we put
together a hell of a weekend. We just have to look at all the things that we
did wrong and learn from it and make sure that next weekend we can accomplish
some good things in the tournament.  
  
RONNIE HARRELL JR.: I would just say stay in the moment, focusing on what's in
front of us. It's like you said, it's so easy to get caught up in everything
that's going on around you that you forget what's happening in front of you.  
  
So we've talked as a team, coaches included, about just staying in the moment.
Having each other's back as well as having everybody else's back, so I think
that was the main thing for us. And I think we've done a great job of that.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 55, Seton Hall - 53  
  
COACH WRIGHT: A lot of credit to Seton Hall. I think we got outplayed tonight.
And we just found ways at the end. Great players make great plays. Jalen and
Josh just individually made incredible plays. It's just a great Big East
basketball game, great defense, physicality.  
  
I think Kevin did a great job preparing the team and he always does. I think
they're playing -- I told them last night I thought they played their best
game of the year.  
  
And tonight probably not as well as they did last night but they're playing
good basketball. They're going to get some people in the tournament.  
  
So I just give them a lot of credit, and as a coach I've got to say our
players just made great individual plays.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how the grind-out this win tonight?  
COACH WRIGHT: Like I said, the things they did, their game plan was better
than ours. That's on me. But our players just made plays down the stretch. The
plays Jalen made, we ran plays. They didn't work. Seton Hall defended them and
then Jay just went and made a individual play.  
  
At the end there, the Chris shot took was not the shot we wanted to take and
Josh went and offensive rebounds.  
  
So we just had players that gutted it out. And defensively we had some great
stops. Eric Paschall on that last play did a great job on Delgado. That's not
easy.  
  
Q. Jay, a lot of similarities with last year's Seton Hall game here in
the final as far as getting down double digits early, fighting back, taking
the lead and then they take the lead. Did that -- was there a point where you
were, like, here we go again early when things weren't going well?  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, they've played us so well so many times. It's not just
last year's game to me. It's going into the game I know, I just know what a
Seton Hall-Villanova game is going to be like. Sometimes we have gotten them
big scores and they're more anomalies.  
  
We've got a lot of games like this. Not just in the Big East Tournament, at
their place.  
  
So I really expect this coming into the game. Maybe it's self fulfilling
prophesy, maybe that's why it happens so much.  
  
Q. Jay, you only shot 7-of-26 in the first half. Did you almost feel
fortunate to only be down seven at the half at that point?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. We were poor in the first half. And we weren't that
bad defensively. Offensively we were just terrible, and just not playing the
way we like to play.  
  
But guys definitely don't come into a game thinking I'm going to play poorly.
It's the defense that does it. They do a great job. They can switch every
position. Delgado does a good job playing ball screens. And they stay on the
guys on the perimeter. They're a really good defensive team. I really did feel
pretty good we were only down seven.  
  
Q. Erik came out the second half wearing No. 44 rather than his normal
4. What happened there?  
COACH WRIGHT: Blood, right?  
  
JOSH HART: It got ripped.  
  
COACH WRIGHT: Jersey got ripped.  
  
Q. Jay, you said earlier that you know what a Seton Hall-Villanova game
is going to look like. Why do you struggle so much against them?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think they're just really good defensively and it just seems
when we get them in the tournament we're coming off a win and we expect things
to be easy, and when they're not we just, you know, lose our personality.  
  
But I think they do a great job of it. Their athleticism and their
physicality, they're more physical than any team in the league. And they just,
they do a great job guarding us. The things that we do they match up with
really well.  
  
Q. Coach, just a little residue of the last game you played a couple
weeks ago, you shot 67 percent. Today was a different game. What did you tell
your team to prepare for this game, because you knew you played them before?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, when you're making shots, everything looks great. And in
that game we made -- they played pretty well defensively. We made some
ridiculous shots. Ridiculous. So everything looks good.  
  
Tonight, those same shots we took early, we showed the guys showed them on
film, we're making a lot of the shots Chris hit against them last game, they
were in their face. We said this isn't going to happen. We've got to get
better shots than this. We took the same shots. They didn't go in, same
defense.  
  
Q. Josh, could you go through the sequence that led to your game-winning
basket?  
JOSH HART: Yeah. I think it was a -- I think we got a turnover, I'm not sure
what happened but somehow we got the ball in transition, I kicked it to Chris.
I think he was kind of surprised he was so open. And I just saw him shoot it.
Right when I saw him shoot it I knew when he shot he put a little too muster
on it, and I was, like, you know what, just go get it.  
  
And luckily it bounced in the perfect spot, and I was able to just get and it
go up with it. And then the last play Eric Paschall played, he played Delgado
as best as anyone could. And we were fortunate enough to come out with the
win.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about what changed at halftime, what you talked
about. You went in trailing and, Josh, you in particular get seven second-half
points. Strong comeback perhaps to get revenge in this tournament against the
team that beat you last year?  
JOSH HART: Yeah, you know, Coach, he challenged us. We know we didn't play
Villanova basketball for the first 20 minutes. But, like he said, at the
beginning we had some shots we forced, especially myself. And we didn't get in
the lane, get other guys shots. We didn't turn down, okay, good shots, great
shots, we didn't do that. So we challenged ourselves. Coach challenged us to
play Villanova basketball for 20 minutes.  
  
And we knew it was going to be a tough game. We knew we weren't going to go
out and just blow them out by 20 in the second half. It was a grind. We just
challenged each other.  
  
Q. Josh and Jay, after the final buzzer you went over to Angel Delgado
who was on the ground and you said something to him. What did you say to him
and why did you do that? And Jay what did you make of that scene?  
JOSH HART: Yeah, I have so much respect for that program. We've had some
battles over the last four years. Got all the respect for Coach Willard. He
gets the most out of his guys.  
  
And they're tough, physical and very well-coached and I told Angel you're a
heck of a player and just keep going, you've got a bright future.  
  
And we felt this feeling last year. And I said you have this feeling right
now. NCAA Tournament time, don't have this feeling again.  
  
Q. Jay, what's it say about your guys, I mean the offense was bogged
down, you weren't shooting well, and final minutes you still make tough shots.
What's it say about the mentality of your guys?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, we got -- first of all we've got talented players. And
that was, that was the point I was trying to make earlier, it's purely
talented players making plays at the end of the game. It wasn't really great
execution or game plan.  
  
And they got guts. They have no fear of failure. And I think that's what you
saw at the end. Some of those defensive stops were big time at the end because
Seton Hall is good at that. They play in a lot of close games and they isolate
you at the end. They're very good at that not just finishing the play but
getting the rebound, the offensive rebound, which they got a couple.  
  
But not only do we make big shots but guys came out with big-time defensive
time games. Josh, as big as his offensive rebound was, he got a deflection-
steal right at the end that was big.  
  
Q. Which is more difficult, playing for the buzzer beater or defending
against the buzzer beater?  
JOSH HART: That's a good question.  
  
COACH WRIGHT: I'll tell you what, it's more nerve-racking playing against the
buzzer beater. When they're bringing the ball up -- is that what you're
talking about -- when you're on defense? Yeah, it is, because offensively you
feel like we'll make a play. If we miss it, we'll foul, get another shot
maybe, or someone will get an offensive rebound. Defensively you don't know
what they're going to do. At least offensively you know what you're going to
do.  
  
Q. Josh, in your fourth year at the school, just such a tough grind it
out league, grind it out Big East Tournament. What's it mean to be in the
third final tournament of a row?  
JOSH HART: It's amazing. You grow up watching the Big East Tournament in
Madison Square Garden, all the battles. There's so much history in this
league, this tournament and to be in three straight it's amazing.  
  
And I guarantee in 20 or 30 years I'm going to be one guy that brags a lot,
but right now we won't think about that at all. We will only think about who
we have tomorrow.  
  
We know we're going to have a tough opponent tomorrow. And we can't celebrate
being in our third straight. We've got to come focused and ready.  
  
Q. Jay, 10 less 3-pointers tonight. Against Creighton couple of weeks
ago you had to grind it out to win. Is that what's been impressive about this
bunch is that this kind of game is one of the ways how you've had to win this
year?  
COACH WRIGHT: Proud of those guys, very proud of them. That's what good teams
do. If you win 30 games, there's five or six of those that it was not pretty.
And it was against a good team. You can't just beat the team you're supposed
to. You've got to beat some good teams. And some of those games are not going
to be pretty and you've got to find a way to gut it out. I'm proud.  
  
It's the leadership. It's Josh and Kris Jenkins and Darryl Reynolds. We have
just incredible leaders.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Madison Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32952)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 55, Seton Hall - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Kevin Willard and Madison Jones.  
  
Q. Kevin, just what can you say about the fact that this team beat you
pretty handily twice. Your guys, pretty handily twice. And tonight you just, I
mean, almost won, could have won. What kind of an effort did your guys give
tonight?  
COACH WILLARD: The guys played phenomenal. Their effort was off the charts.
This is also the first time we've played them even.  
  
I mean, the first time we played them, the third game in six days, it was
three in a row on the road, and second time playing, they were coming off a
bye week, we played Creighton at 9:00 on Wednesday. So I actually knew this
game was going to be just like this.  
  
I had a lot of confidence in the guys. I love the way we're playing. We're
playing great defensively. Brunson hurt us, made some great plays towards the
end of the game, but we still had a chance to win it. So proud of my guys.  
  
Q. Kevin, after the game, right after it ended Josh Hart came over and
consoled Angel Delgado and told him: We had this feeling last year; you don't
want to have this again in the NCAAs and you won't. What can you say about
that act of sportsmanship, the way it unfolded?  
COACH WILLARD: If I've got to lose in the Big East Tournament, and I hate to
lose, but there's not -- I have enjoyed Kris Jenkins and Josh Hart develop as
young men. They represent this league at the highest level. They play the game
tremendously. And I couldn't have more respect for Josh and Kris for the way
they represented not only Villanova but the way they represented the Big East
throughout their career, just shows you what a great program Jay has.  
  
Q. Obviously this one hurts, but how good does it feel to be playing
this well going into the most important games of the year of the tournament?  
MADISON JONES: It's definitely a great thing to be playing. Feel like we're at
the top of our game right now especially this time of the year.  
  
And we've got a lot of momentum, even though, like you said, this one hurt, we
still are positive and coming back strong on Sunday, back in the gym, and just
ready for the NCAA.  
  
Q. Madison, your team held Villanova to 23 percent shooting in the first
half. How important was it to just kind of set the defensive tone right away
with a team that can easily rattle off shots and put you out of the game
really quick?  
MADISON JONES: It was definitely important. Starting the game off, we just
stayed solid on the defensive end. That was our game plan, stay solid and stay
focused on their key players, and I think that's what we did coming out
strong, don't let them get anything easy.  
  
Q. Kevin, what did last year's kind of experience and kind of big-time
atmosphere weekend, Big East game, did you take anything from last year into
tonight's game?  
COACH WILLARD: No. No, I thought the atmosphere was great. I thought both
schools really showed up well. It's good to see that everyone was worried
about -- all we hear about in the spring meetings all the conferences are
coming, it's -- I'm so tired of it. This is the best basketball tournament in
the country. And the fans show up; they're great. It's a tradition. It's
phenomenal.  
  
Q. Madison, you shut down 3-point shooters for two nights, the whole
team, a lot of good 3-point shooters, you really dominated them back to back
nights. Do you feel at this time you can just force any team to beat you with
tough twos, that it's going to take a play like at the end?  
MADISON JONES: That's what we want to do. It's tough twos. Especially a team
like this, we've got to force them off their line. And like I said that was
our game plan coming in, making them shoot tough twos. And that's what we did
pretty much the entire game. The ball fell that way at some times. And we knew
they were going to make great shots. They have great players. Take your hat
off to them. Definitely want them to shoot tough twos all night. And that's
pretty much what we did.  
  
Q. Kevin, last year Villanova took a gut-wrenching loss on this stage to
you guys and turned it into a springboard for something great. What can you
guys do? What can you guys get from this for that next tournament?  
COACH WILLARD: That's just what we talked about in the locker room. It's
tough. You give your heart out. You play arguably the best team in the country
right down to the wire; you lose -- obviously Josh Hart makes a phenomenal
play.  
  
But we've got to bounce back. I've got a lot of confidence in these guys, I've
been saying it all year, when we were 3-6, I have a lot of confidence in this
group. We'll bounce back. We'll fight back. It's who we are. It's what we've
done.  
  
And we'll get back to work on Sunday and Selection Sunday will come and we'll
get ready to see who we play, we'll fight and battle whoever we have to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Justin Patton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32965)

### [Marcus Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27910)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 75, Xavier - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Creighton, Marcus Foster, Justin Patton and
Coach McDermott.  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: That was quite a game. Xavier obviously really jumped on us
early, and we spent a good portion of the evening trying to dig ourselves out
of that hole. Defensively, the second half, while we weren't great, our fight
on the backboards was better.  
  
They had ten second-chance points at halftime. We had two. Second half we got
five; they got four. Something we talked about in the locker room at halftime,
that that had to change, that we had to hit them before they hit us on the
glass.  
  
And our efficiency offensively, we talked at halftime about when we penetrate
against some of their switches, we have to penetrate to make a play for a
teammate, not make a play for ourselves. That changed the second half from the
first half. Marcus gets six assists, Khyri gets eight. Those are the two guys
that are putting on it the floor to make plays for our team and they made
great plays for their teammates.  
  
Terrific win for us. We've been in this league four years. This will be the
second trip to the championship game, which is a credit to the people in the
locker room, staff and the players.  
  
We've been through a lot the last five or six weeks, and for us to be sitting
on the stage getting ready to play tomorrow night is a credit to the character
of the people I have in that locker room.  
  
Q. What does it mean as a team and as a locker room to advance to a game
against Villanova tomorrow night?  
MARCUS FOSTER: It means a lot to us. We've been putting in work since last
spring, since the season was over, so I feel like we deserve it. Our guys in
the locker room, great guys, great teammates to be around and we work so hard
together. So it showed tonight on the court by how we kept fighting and
getting back into the game even when they kept on giving us their best shot.  
  
Q. Coach, you just mentioned how you handled their defensive switches.
Was that why you resulted in such great efficiency from 3 in the second half
and overall in the game?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: We were able to collapse the defense versus some of the
switches with their bigs. And Justin slipped out of some early, got a few
baskets at the rim, and all of a sudden your defense mindset changes because
you're giving up an easy two, and they're late getting to some shooters. Then
we executed an out-of-bounds play that we just put in this morning that we saw
from last time we played them that we thought we could get a corner 3. And
Khyri did a great job dribbling up the floor and Marcus hit that corner 3
which was a huge play, and obviously Marcus made a big-time play at the end of
the game.  
  
Q. Marcus, we've talked a lot about the journey to certain points
throughout the year, based on this being your first year at Creighton. What
does it mean to you today to even in that moment give up a game-tying 3 and
walk down the court and with all the confidence in the world try to put your
team into the title game?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Means a lot to me, especially growing up always wanting to play
in Madison Square Garden and having this moment. It's just an amazing feeling
to have. And me and Justin redshirting last year and not seeing much time on
the court, it means a lot, shows how all the hard work and effort we're
putting in is paying off.  
  
Q. You knew Marcus was talented. But everything you've gotten this year,
obviously being a great scorer, before Maurice went down, and expanding his
game since Maurice was hurt, has he surprised you with how well he's handled
everything?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: What he and Khyri have done is really difficult to do. They
had to really change their stripes in terms of their responsibilities with the
team right in the middle of the season.  
  
And if you -- Marcus, I would guess, has close to twice as many assists in the
last 13 or 14 games than he had in the first 19, because our team, if we were
going to be successful moving forward, our team -- it was going to be required
that he does that.  
  
So he's added a lot to his game in the time he's been here. His ball handling
has improved. His defense I'd like to say could get a little better, but it's
come a long ways as well. But he's always had the confidence in himself, in
situations like that. I remember obviously we recruited him out of high
school. I watched him freshman year against Oklahoma.  
  
MARCUS FOSTER: Sophomore.  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Sophomore against Oklahoma both games he hits a game-winning
3 at the end. He's got confidence. He works on that shot. Obviously gets it
off quick. And now that he has the ability to attack the rim, it makes
guarding that 3-point shot all the more difficult.  
  
Q. When Maurice was down I read you talked to Marcus about having to
change his game. Do you remember exactly what he said to you?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: The biggest thing he had to change was we needed his voice.
Maurice's voice was a dominant voice with our team; he was our leader.  
  
And somebody had to take that and last night we don't win the game, Marcus is
in foul trouble, but if you watch his actions on the bench and watch how
engaged he was during that game and timeouts when he was sitting there with
foul trouble, it's a sign of maturity as a player.  
  
But Marcus embraced what we've asked him to do. And his assist numbers, they
speak for themselves. He's not only scoring the basketball for us but he's
making plays for other people.  
  
Q. Justin, Tyrique had quite a game in Omaha the last time you played
Xavier, was that matchup weighing on you tonight, was it personal in any way,
and what does it mean to come out and have the game you did particularly in
the interior tonight?  
JUSTIN PATTON: He's a really good player. I try not to make things personal
when I play basketball. He just happened to be the opponent tonight in front
of me.  
  
And with all my other big men I play with, they did a good job of wearing him
down. And like Coach said, we wanted move the ball. And he got tired and they
all got tired. That made it better for us and that's why we got the tip-ins
and the extra points and the slip-ins.  
  
Q. Marcus, can you just go through the sequence that led to your game-
winning shot?  
MARCUS FOSTER: Yeah, Trevon Bluiett made a great move. I thought he was going
all the way to the goal but he stepped back to the 3 and made a good shot.
Pulling it down I stood by Coach Mack just to hear what he was thinking if
they were going to call a timeout or what he said just let's play. And by then
I got into my routine of how I usually play and just took a big shot for my
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Quentin Goodin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32841)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 75, Xavier - 72  
  
COACH MACK: Obviously a great game between two teams battling, and a team that
had, I shouldn't say had the ball last, because we obviously had the ball
last. But big shots on both sides. And a lot of times when teams hit 3s on you
like that, you really want to complain about your defense.  
  
I thought a lot of their 3s were really contested looks. Cole Huff
specifically. They shot the lights out. Not a whole lot you can do about it.  
  
We tried to go zone a little bit, and they were getting the ball where they
needed to in zone. And when a team's shooting that well, I don't know if our
secondary defense is one that's going to contain a team that was shooting that
well.  
  
So we have nothing to hang our head about. Guys competed for three days. And I
think our team grew up over the weekend. And so hats off to Creighton. They
played extremely well, especially in the second half. And they earned the
victory.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously your stay here in the city won't be as long as you
would have liked, and you kind of just alluded to this, but are you happy with
the work you got in this week, and do you think you're an NCAA Tournament team
at this point?  
COACH MACK: Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt. It's hard to say I'm happy
after we lose. We came here with different intentions. But so did nine other
teams. So we gave it what we could.  
  
We had guys that were playing heavy minutes all weekend. They battled. It's
all you can ask for as a coach. And I'm proud of my team just as I was last
night. And we'll live to fight another day.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you contested all those 3s pretty well. What's
that like to watch you contest it so well and just three after three go in?  
COACH MACK: It's tough. That's the thing I really appreciate about my guys is
they didn't hang their head. They didn't cave.  
  
They responded on the other end, and we did what we could defensively against
a team that was having a terrific shooting night. But we battled for it to be
a one-possession game down the stretch. I think it says a lot about the
quality of our team as well.  
  
Q. Quentin, would you say fatigue was a factor, this being the third
game in three days, did that come into the equation at all down the stretch?
And, Chris, if you wanted to weigh in on that?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: For it being such a close game going down the stretch, I
honestly don't think fatigue was a factor. I feel like we really wanted to
win. We would do anything to win that game.  
  
You would think, outside looking in, fatigue was a factor. But going down the
stretch there was a whole lot of timeouts and that allowed us to get our
breath back.  
  
COACH MACK: Yeah, I feel fine. (Laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Donte DiVincenzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32854)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 108, St. John's - 67  
  
COACH WRIGHT: Really proud of our performance, obviously. And I want to give
St. John's credit for the season they've had and last night. They did a hell
of a job last night. That was a pretty beat up team, tired team that we
played.  
  
I thought the game they played last night was gutsy old Big East game, pretty
cool to watch.  
  
And they've done a great job with that team this year. A lot of young guys are
going to be really good. And I think we played like a mature team today.  
  
I think -- we have seniors. Josh Hart. Kris was outstanding offensively, but
Josh Hart just set the tone defensively on the boards, getting shots for his
teammates, not trying, not trying to do too many things, not trying to prove
he's player of the year in the conference, just going out there and playing
for his teammates.  
  
I thought that was really impressive. And obviously Kris was great
offensively, and Donte just continues to get better for us every day.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about your performance, how you jumped all over St.
John's?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, I just want to talk about maturity. You watched that
game last night. That was a pretty tough game.  
  
If you're smart and you're experienced, you realize that team can come back,
and they're playing with a lot of emotion that can beat you. But that team
could be tired if you come ready to play. And if we wouldn't have come ready
to play, they were ready to get us. But we were very prepared and rested. I
think that was the difference today.  
  
Q. When you shoot like this, what do you do for an encore?  
KRIS JENKINS: I just have to give a lot of credit to my teammates. They do a
great job of making the right play. And like coach said, Josh set the tone for
us defensively. When your best player does that, then everybody else, it's
easy for them to fall in line.  
  
COACH WRIGHT: What's your encore for the next game?  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Next game. Next game.  
  
Q. For Jay and for Kris, I think 52 points from the bench, I think the
bench combined shoot 16 out of 19. Just talk about how big that is, especially
when you don't have Mikal today?  
KRIS JENKINS: It's great. We have a next-man-up mentality. We don't want Mikal
to go down or anybody. But our guys are ready. They've been put in this
situation before. They just get more minutes, more minutes for E, more minutes
for Donte, more minutes for Dylan who played great for us today, gave us great
minutes. Hopefully we'll get Mikal back for tomorrow and get better.  
  
Q. Can you remember a first half or any half where there were no fouls
called on your team? And, B, is that like symbolic of your maturity to be able
to defend so effectively without fouling?  
COACH WRIGHT: I hope so. That was a pretty good effort for us defensively. It
really was. And again that is maturity. It's experience. Just really, again,
you are watching, the whole team watched the game together last night. If
you're not prepared for that game, you know, you're not really paying
attention. And I think our guys had a great grasp of the scouting report, and
I think they played very intelligently the first half.  
  
Q. Jay, couple of weeks ago you made the comment you felt your guys were
a little tired given the grind. And you had only one game in, I think, 12
days. How much do you think that's recharged some of your guys' legs, and do
you think that's reflective in the shooting stats today?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. I think that was -- that week, when we looked at it
at the beginning of the season, having a week at the end where we didn't play
a game, we looked at the schedule and thought, wow, that's going to be tough
because no teams like to practice for a week.  
  
But when it happened, when we came upon that week and we had just played five
games really with six guys basically, we really needed it. And I thought our
guys did a good job. Jeff Pierce, our trainer and our strength coach, did a
great job getting our guys' legs back.  
  
Then we added Darryl to that week so it got it to an eight-man rotation. We
went into the Georgetown game fresh and I think we've come into this
tournament fresh.  
  
Q. As you look ahead or go through this tournament, having that
flexibility of having a more extended rotation, something like happens today
with Bridges or a guy gets in early foul trouble, you didn't plan this
flexibility, but it happened. What do you see that doing for you down the road
or potentially doing for you?  
COACH WRIGHT: We always plan to have that, we planned at the beginning of the
season to have that.  
  
When we didn't have Omari we thought, okay, we can handle that. Then we didn't
have Phil. Then it got a little shaky. We said it's going to take time to
develop this. And you never know if it's going to work.  
  
But we've actually developed, not us, these guys -- Donte and Eric Paschall
and Dylan Painter -- have really developed this rotation for us.  
  
If they weren't playing at the level they are, we wouldn't be able to do it.
And it really does give us the ability to stay fresh in tournaments.  
  
That playing seven guys, you can get away with it during the league season but
in tournaments like this, that's when it gets to you.  
  
Q. With three seconds left in the first half you called a timeout and
right after that Jenkins got another buzzer beater. Do you look forward to
using that during the tournament (laughter)?  
COACH WRIGHT: I hope so. We take advantage of all those opportunities. There's
no better practice than the game. You can do that in practice all you want and
it works. It's nice. But you have to run that against another team and get
that experience.  
  
And every experience you can get in the game makes you stronger for the next
game. So I don't care if anybody knows about it. There's a lot of good coaches
out there -- I'm more concerned that our players can execute.  
  
Q. You had a career high today of 25 points and seven made shooting.
Tell me how did you feel going into the game and what kind of lessons have you
learned from the leadership from the upperclassmen?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Going into the game I was confident, as in every game. But
the only thing I can say about the 25 is it's all because of the seniors and
Jalen, E, everybody was making the right play and I found myself open and
today I was knocking down shots.  
  
Q. Coach, you have 34 points in the paint. Of course everybody knows
your perimeter has always been pretty good. How do you feel about your
interior?  
COACH WRIGHT: I felt good all year. Kris as good as a shooter he is, could be
our best post-up player. Josh is good in the post. Brunson is good in the
post. Part of that points in the paint come from having shooters and being
able to drive the ball and get to the rim. So it's a combination. I feel good
about that. I feel good about our balance.  
  
Q. Donte, could you just talk about the mentality you guys, Erik, Dylan,
all the guys on the bench have as far as not having any let-up when you get
into the game?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Just come in and bring energy, bring energy defensively, get
as many rebounds as we possibly can and when there's so much attention to
players as good as Josh and as good as Kris, you find yourself open. And when
you find yourself open just make a play, whether it's a shot, extra pass or
get in the lane.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

### [Andrew Rowsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32863)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 82, Marquette - 76  
  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Seton Hall.
Kevin's done an outstanding job with his team. They present a very difficult
matchup for us defensively with their athletes and their versatility
defensively. They can really smother you.  
  
And honestly Delgado inside is a load for everyone, but he's been, in
particular, thinking the last two games we've played them he's had 35 rebounds
in two games, which is pretty incredible. But Kevin's done a great job with
his team.  
  
I'm proud of the way our team has handled our Big East play. I'm sad that it's
over right now. But we're hopeful that there's more basketball to be played
for us.  
  
Q. Both regular season games seemed to be grind-it-out plays where it
could have gone either way in both cases. What made the difference in this
where they were able to pick up a large win like that?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought where we really started the game pretty well.
We were moving the ball really well. We got some good looks we normally make
that we didn't make. And I thought that had an impact on our decision-making
offensively, later, and it impacted our defense as well.  
  
There's no secret. We're a good basketball team. We have a chance to beat
really good teams like Seton Hall when we shoot well. When we don't shoot the
ball well it's harder for us.  
  
Q. How hard is it for you as a team that shoots well when you're getting
the looks in the first half and they're not going? What's the mental process
you guys go through as the game goes on?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I just feel as a team as a whole we have to find ways to make
other things happen when our shots aren't falling.  
  
Even though when our shots aren't falling we have to find ways to defend and
also try to be uplifting and bring energy. When our shots aren't falling we
still have to find ways to stay in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you came out really small today, obviously your two
sharpshooters there as well as Duane. And that strategy, did you think it
worked? Seemed to disrupt their offense?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought we started the game fine. That's the lineup
that allowed us to win four of five and put us in a great position right now.
That lineup served us well. We played nine guys double figure minutes. So we
do, we play a lot of guys.  
  
Q. Do you think that in spite of today's loss you've done enough to go
to the NCAA Tournament?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: We're hoping so. Nothing is guaranteed at this point. We can
just hope for the best. In my opinion I believe we've done enough. We've
proved ourselves multiple times. And I mean nothing is guaranteed at this
point in the year, so we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. Coach, they score 40 points in the paint tonight. It seemed like
especially early on where there were a lot of passes where that created space
there. How difficult is it, even when you have a normal 3-point shooting
night, to keep up statistically with just how many points they were able to
get?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: They're a tough matchup for us. I'm not sure there's a
more physical team in our league. And Delgado is just an absolute beast.  
  
And you look at, when you say, well, he only had 12 points. He had nine
assists. To me he was the guy who dominated the game.  
  
It's not just us. It's the reason why he's first-team all-conference. He's got
to be an All-American type player. I've been doing, playing or coaching for 20
years; that's an All-American-caliber player right there.  
  
Q. Andrew and Markus, do you feel in the first half you moved the ball
really well and got a lot of shots. They started not to fall. Did you feel
yourselves kind of moving away from spreading the floor, moving the ball all
the time as the shots stopped falling?  
MARKUS HOWARD: Yeah, a little bit. I feel when the shots aren't falling some
guys, we feel the need to be that person to bring it back and get us back
rolling on offense. But in times like that we just have to stick to our game
plan, the one we've been using for the three, four games that have been
working really well. We just have to keep playing Marquette basketball. Even
when things aren't going the right way.  
  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: You have to trust the pass even when shots aren't
falling. Our team has the ability to play some really pretty offensively
basketball, and it's when our team is trusting the pass. Sometimes when shots
aren't going in, shots that you're normally used to seeing go in, there's a
tendency to go to, like, I gotta do it because we're struggling.  
  
We're not struggling; we're just missing shots. If you play the percentages,
we're going to make enough high-percentage shots to score a lot of points.
It's -- when we get in trouble is when we don't early in a game make shots and
we start thinking, you know, I've got to put the team on -- we don't have any
guys like that. We have to continue to trust the pass. If we do that, we're as
good as an offensive team I think as there is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Angel Delgado](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30693)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 82, Marquette - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Willard and Angel.  
  
Q. You won five games in a row. You won now again at MSG. Do you have a
feeling of deja vu from last year?  
COACH WILLARD: No, I mean, I think both years are a little bit different. Each
opponent is a little bit different. We've been battling for the month of
February and it feels good.  
  
I mean, I think the biggest thing in the feeling this year is I think these
guys understand the excitement and the importance of the Big East Tournament.  
  
So I just think we've been battling for a good month and proud of the way
they're playing.  
  
Q. Can you give your thoughts about playing Villanova tomorrow in the
semifinals?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah. It's like waking up on Christmas you're all excited, you
go down, you open up the present and you've got a bunch of coal. (Laughter)
No, they're a fantastic team. They really are. I think Jay, this is his best
job by far. I think it's his best team by far.  
  
They're balanced. I think the way Paschall is playing is really impressive. It
puts a lot of pressure -- it was a difference in our second game. He came out
and he banged two 3s. Our game plan was to let him have them and he made them
and it was kind of a backbreaker. So I think they're probably the best team in
the country, and we're going to have to get to work and figure out a way, but
we'll come battle.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the importance of the Big East Tournament. Just
on the road, the ACC is playing their tournament today. I just wanted to ask
you: What sets apart the Big East from, I know the Big Ten is also coming to
New York pretty soon, what separates the Big East from the rest of those
conferences?  
COACH WILLARD: First of all, I think the ACC's in Brooklyn, right? That's a
different world, man. I got three guys from Brooklyn. They can have fun with
that over there.  
  
I love my Brooklyn guys but I ain't hanging out over in Brooklyn all that
much. (Laughter) I went to Lincoln High School so many times over the last
couple of years, I said I'm never going back to Brooklyn.  
  
I think it's great for New York that the ACC is going on at the same time. I
mean, our fans are still going to come to our games. Their fans are going to
come to their games. I think it's exciting for the city. I think it's exciting
for both tournaments. The coverage has been great on Fox and on ESPN.  
  
I don't see a downside. I think last time I checked there was over 8 million
people in Manhattan. So I think people have plenty of options.  
  
And our fans are going to come. Villanova's fans are going to come. I'm sure
tomorrow night is going to be just like the Big East final was.  
  
Q. Angel and Coach, were you aware of your stats that you're one assist
away from a triple-double.  
ANGEL DELGADO: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you say anything to Coach about maybe running a certain play so
you could get that last assist?  
ANGEL DELGADO: Yes, but I told Coach, put me back in. He was like, nah, you
might get hurt. I was, like, all right, I'm just staying here then.  
  
COACH WILLARD: I knew he had nine for a while, but once it got down to them --
if they had missed a couple of shots and we could have been up 14 or 15, I
would have kept him in. But they were just fouling anyways. But if they
weren't fouling I would have put him back in.  
  
Q. To follow up, this is your fifth Big East win in a row. You had so
much confidence going into this stretch. What was it about this stretch that
you knew that your team was going to turn it on at this point?  
COACH WILLARD: I've said this all year long, I thought we were playing good
basketball all year long, even when we were 3-6, he'll tell you, I put up on
the board, I think it was against Georgetown, at Georgetown, I said guys our
RPI is better, our strength of schedule is better.  
  
We've had a brutal start to the conference season, which I've said about a
million times. And I knew that once we could get past that stretch that the
second half of the season really looked good to us.  
  
I just kept telling them you've got to just keep believing in what we're
doing. We haven't really changed anything. I think the schedule kind of fell
into our favor just a little bit more.  
  
Q. Angel, Coach doesn't seem like he's so happen about playing Villanova
tomorrow night. What about you? You told me the other day you said it's hard
to beat a good team three times?  
ANGEL DELGADO: I'm happy to play anybody. I'm always happy, I tell the Coach
and the guys, I'm playing ball to have fun. That's what I'm doing right now.
When we can play a NBA team, I don't care, I want to go and have fun.  
  
Q. What about Villanova? They beat you up pretty bad twice.  
COACH WILLARD: It happens.  
  
ANGEL DELGADO: It happens. They're a really good basketball team. Tomorrow is
going to be a good team and I expect us to win.  
  
Q. Do you feel you have something to prove?  
ANGEL DELGADO: No, we don't have nothing to prove. We're just coming tomorrow
and just playing ball.  
  
Q. Coach, Big East has a chance to get seven NCAA Tournament bids this
year. In your opinion is this the best version that this league, in its
10-team form, has been?  
COACH WILLARD: Oh, yeah. Marquette's definitely an NCAA Tournament team. The
way they can score, the wins they've had all year. I think it's exciting the
fact we can get seven in.  
  
It's as balanced of a league as you can play in. The true round robin makes --
it also makes it a lot of fun. I've had fun getting to know Josh Hart and Kris
Jenkins, and watching them grow as players. And Travis Diener, who's on the
staff of Marquette, twice a year. I think the league has good coaches. They
all want each other to do well. And Markus Howard is as good as a freshman
there is. It's got great young talent and great veteran talent.  
  
Q. Coach, both regular season games seem to be like a grind-it-out, it
could have gone either way. What made the difference in this game that you
were able to pick up?  
COACH WILLARD: I thought we had -- I think we had a six-minute stretch where
they didn't score in the second half. I thought both teams were a little
sloppy the beginning of the second half. But we were able to really defend.  
  
We made them take some tough 2s. We chased Rowsey off the line a little bit.
He really hurt us. We were able to chase Howard off the line which really
helped us.  
  
And I thought we really shared the ball well. I thought the big fellow was
tremendous in making extra passes and just getting everybody involved in the
offense.  
  
Q. Myles Powell plays in his first Big East Tournament game, and he goes
ties the team high in points with 17. How big is that for a guy like him
getting his feet wet for the first time and for the team to see a youngster
play with so much confidence?  
COACH WILLARD: I mean, we were 10-2 in non-conference. And he was averaging
almost 15 points a game. And he's a guy that we've continued to need. And he
went through a little tough stretch at the end of February.  
  
But he's played this way all year long. He might not get as much attention
because of the big fella and Khadeen and Desi, the way they're playing, but
Myles has had a phenomenal freshman year. Everybody forgets, I have to limit
him minutes-wise and I have to limit him practice-wise because he's coming off
a broken foot from high school.  
  
So I battle that. That's also kind of hurt him a little bit where some of the
other freshmen in the league getting 36 minutes and twice the shots. I've had
to be very careful with his foot, especially this time of year.  
  
Q. Coach, how far has Angel come offensively passing out of the post
drawing double teams, just how much has he improved?  
COACH WILLARD: Where he's improved dramatically is his mental approach to the
offensive game. And I think that's, for big fellas, he always works hard on
his offense, works hard on his 15-footer, puts the time into his post moves.
He's a relentless rebounder. Eight offensive rebounds.  
  
I got nothing to do with that. But I think what we've really tried to work
with him with is understanding offense. When you get double teamed, kick it
out, that means they're going to scramble you're going to get a guy driving
you're going to get an offensive rebound. He's matured come light years, I
mean light years from his freshman year where he would run around try to make
a post move. I think he's come a long way in understanding the offensive game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 108, St. John's - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Chris, to have to play a game so fast after the last one, to play a
team like Villanova, were you guys just behind the eight ball from the
start?  
COACH MULLIN: Quick turnaround, but that had nothing to do with it. Villanova
is one of the best teams in the country. So give all credit to them.  
  
And we welcome that. That was a good position to be in, to be able to play in
today's game. So no regrets.  
  
Q. Coach, despite what the win/loss record may show, there was some
substantial progress made from how you faired in your first year of coaching.
What are some of the takeaways you'll carry with you when you eventually
embark into year three?  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, improvement; progression, individually and collectively.
And lots to look forward to.  
  
Q. What do you think has to happen next year to take the next step? You
obviously add two very good players in Clark and Simon, but are there certain
areas you guys need to get better in to make the challenge to be a tournament
team?  
COACH MULLIN: I think defensively we need to improve. I do think a lot of that
will come with strength and maturity. I think a lot of people, me included,
players improve a lot in the offseason. That's the best time to do it.  
  
But I also think probably, more so in the college game, like, when they're in
summer school and they're around each other. It's a really good time to
develop team chemistry. And so I think having more guys playing with each
other, working out together in the summertime will be another part of
something we haven't had.  
  
And you look at the really, really good teams, Villanova being one of them,
they've got experience. Game experience. They've won and lost together, and
they've spent summers together.  
  
Q. Coach, when you first got the job at St. John's you said you were
going to try to bring more home-grown talent, like Shamorie Ponds being one of
them, a building block. How much interest has there been for the players that
want to come and compete and play at St. John's?  
COACH MULLIN: Interest is one thing and getting to be on the team is another.
That's always going to be a focal point. And we'll see how that materializes.  
  
Q. Villanova played the first half without committing a foul. A, have
you ever seen that, and what does that say about their experience to defend
without committing a foul?  
COACH MULLIN: It's pretty good defense.  
  
Q. In looking back as a seasoned coach including last night, anything
either stand out as a highlight, game or performance, or anything that the
team improved in from the start of the season to today?  
COACH MULLIN: I'd probably say last night was the highlight. For this group of
kids to get the first tournament win in five or six years, whatever it was,
but also to prove to themselves and to get on that big stage.  
  
And I think before last night, we probably had like 84 practices. So after all
the film sessions and practices and pep talks, halftime talks and all the
stuff that goes on, there's nothing better than those guys going out and
proving to themselves that they can perform on that stage. And so I thought
last night was probably something they'll remember and take into the offseason
and use it as a positive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Davion Mintz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32920)

### [Khyri Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32919)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 70, Providence - 58  
  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I'm extremely proud of our team. We kind of won a rock fight
tonight. Neither team shot free throws well. Particularly in the first half
neither team shot well. But I talked to the team at halftime. They had scored
30 points in 36 possessions the first half, and I felt like if we continue
with that defense, that things would loosen up a little for us offensively.  
  
And we were able to force some turnovers -- Khyri was terrific defensively.
And I thought Davion, after maybe having some freshman jitters playing in this
tournament the first time in the first half, I thought he really settled in
and was great on both ends of the floor the second half.  
  
So extremely proud of the team to get back to the semifinals, to have an
opportunity to play in another championship game.  
  
Q. Really the first time you dominated a great team since losing Watson.
You have a sophomore and freshman there but did it a different way. Only seven
assists but both had three steals. This man did great from the line. Is the
team learning to win a different way than you did with that 18-1 start when
you had the senior passer to run things?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: While we've scored some games, we probably don't have the
spreadability that we had prior to Maurice's injury. But we've had to reinvent
ourselves. And I've said it many times, Khyri and Marcus, in particular, the
first 20 games of the season they were secondary bought in, secondary decision
makers. And the last 12 or 13 they're primary decision makers and ball
handlers.  
  
And that's quite a change to make 20 games into a season. And there's been
some peaks and valleys to that. There's been games they've been terrific.
There's been games where they turned it over a little bit too much.  
  
But they've gotten better. Davion went from not playing much to playing a
significant role. Isaiah is playing some point guard he wasn't before. Tyler
Clement is playing a bit. We've had to move pieces around but they've stayed
together. That's a credit to the leadership in our locker room and these young
guys. As you said I've got a freshman and sophomore up here. They've grown up
fast.  
  
Q. Khyri, you didn't guard Cartwright much in Omaha the last meeting,
but tonight you were switching off him and Bullock. And Bullock goes 1-for-8.
Khyri turns the ball over six times. What were you doing tonight to make
things chaotic for both of them?  
KHYRI THOMAS: For Bullock, I wasn't really doing a whole lot. I don't think he
was being as aggressive the first two times we played him. And Cartwright he's
super quick. He blew by me every time. But with him I just kind of laid off
his shot and laid back off the 3-point line and made him drive. And he kind of
made some tough shots and missed some as well.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team that you were able to win this game
when your leading scorer was on the bench with foul trouble and really not on
the court when you made that big game-changing run early in the second half?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Well, you bring a guy like Isaiah Zierden, who's in his fifth
year off the bench. Isaiah has played every role we've asked him to play. He's
dealt with three major injuries during the course of his career. He's led us
in minutes last year. He's coming off the bench. He just does what he does.  
  
He was instrumental in that run. He brings a calmness to our team. But we had
to balance a lot of foul trouble. And while Marcus was in foul trouble, he was
our best cheerleader over there on the bench, talking to the guys at every
timeout and never became unengaged in the game while he was sitting on the
bench with foul trouble. And that's the sign of a pretty mature player.  
  
Q. You had eight free throws in the first half, jumped up to 25 in the
second half. Was being aggressive and getting to the line one of your points
of emphasis in the second half?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: When you're not shooting 3s well you better do something
different. Obviously the threat of our ability to shoot the 3, because we've
been one of the better teams in the country all season, opens things up and
allows us to maybe get to the rim a little bit more than some teams. But Khyri
was terrific. Justin was active, slipping out of some ball screens and getting
to the rim and putting pressure on the rim. But without question, getting into
the bonus early was really critical for us that second half.  
  
Q. Davion, coach just mentioned you got some turnovers to start the
second half, but looked like you were just playing with a little bit more
energy as a team. I guess, did you notice that? And why do you think you got
off to such a good start in the second half?  
DAVION MINTZ: I want to say I have best teammates in the nation because the
first half it was ugly for me. When I came into the locker room they uplifted
me and calmed me down. I came out a little anxious, just ready and excited.
But once I calmed down and got my groove, that's when I could hype myself up
and it started with them. I thank them and the coaching staff for sticking
with me.  
  
Q. What does it say about the league the same day that the 2, 3, 4 seeds
get knocked off?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I said it a long time ago, when we lost Maurice and Xavier
lost Edmond, you could take -- obviously Villanova separated themselves on the
top, and DePaul, while they got a lot better, didn't win a lot on the bottom.
But you could take the other eight and put us all in the hat and pick us out
any night. There's not much difference and any given night anything could
happen. I think that's what you've seen happen in the league over the course
since those two injuries have taken place.  
  
But there's great basketball in this league. And I think that's going to be
evident when Selection Sunday rolls around.  
  
Q. You talked leading up to this about 50/50 balls and wondering why not
everybody is kind of sacrificing their bodies. And I think at one point in the
second half there was a possession where all five of your guys touched a loose
ball at half court. You pushed it to 10. Did you feel like that was when the
game switched in your favor, and what's changed in the days leading up to
that?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: We've talked about it after the last game. And those guys
that made those hustle plays at Marquette fueled something that in everybody
in the program -- and that possession was a great microcosm of the game for
us.  
  
We talked about, really simple before the game, you don't have a lot of time
to talk to your team when they have 20 minutes to get ready. So we talked
about intelligence and toughness, shot selection, being in the right spot,
communication, and then winning the 50/50 plays. And for the most part tonight
we were able to do that.  
  
Q. You've alluded to this a little bit, but in a game like this, where
you don't play your best, to find a way, just how important is that, and what
does it say about your team that you were able to get this win?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: This time of year you try to survive. You're trying to get to
the next day. And that's going to be the case this weekend and then next week
the NCAA Tournament is the same way.  
  
You see what you've got that night. Do you have your A game? Do you have your
B game, shooting the basketball? And you just adjust and you try to find a way
to win.  
  
But our guys really competed tonight. And we were playing a team, Ed's done an
unbelievable job especially these last three, three and a half weeks of the
season to take a team that was 4-8 and get them into the NCAA Tournament.
They're the hottest team in the league. And for us to be able to frustrate
them with some of our defense is really a credit to our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Malcolm Bernard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32901)

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 62, Butler - 57  
  
COACH MACK: Beat a really good team. Our guys are very aware of the
togetherness, the toughness and the resiliency that Butler has played with all
year. But at the same time, coming into the game we felt like for the 80
minutes that we played in our two regular season games, 72 of those minutes, I
don't think you could tell who the better team was.  
  
And we let turnovers plague us in game 2 at our place a couple of weeks ago.
And I switched up how we defend the dribble handoffs and brush screens and all
that stuff from game 1 to game 2 and it helped our team.  
  
Tonight I think our team did both things. We handled their dribble penetration
for the most part, and other than that stretch in the second half, we did a
good job in the last four, five minutes taking care of the ball and getting
good shots, getting to the foul line.  
  
Q. Chris, are you able to verbalize what a relief this one is?  
COACH MACK: I don't look at it as relief. We have competitive guys. And they
understand what's at stake. I don't know how you can't, 2017, everywhere we go
guys have their phones up to their noses. So I'm sure they're Snapchatting,
but at the same time they're probably checking Twitter and seeing the bottom
line on ESPN and Fox Sports 1, Stewart Mandel. We're aware of all that stuff.  
  
The bigger issue is making sure we play our best against really good teams.
And Butler is a really good team, good program, and they've had a special
year. And wish them well in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned yesterday that you were uncertain as to where
this team stands in regards to the NCAA Tournament. Does that change after
tonight's win?  
COACH MACK: No, I mean I still don't know where we stand. Again, I only care
about the Big East Tournament right now. And I talked a lot at the press
conference that we had before we left here for New York about how I felt about
my team and our resumé, if you will. But I'm here to talk about the Big East
Tournament and a game that was well-played tonight, two teams that battled
tooth and nail.  
  
I mean, the game could have gone either way down to the wire. Our guys made
some big time plays, and Malcolm probably had his best game of his career,
next to me. And Trevon has done it all year. That's why we put the ball in his
hands. Let's talking about the Big East Tournament. And it's special to be
playing Friday night, tomorrow.  
  
Q. Trevon, bring us through that play where you hit the big shot there
late in the second half?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Coach wanted me to get the ball around the elbow and just kind
of make a playoff that, drive and kick or throw high-low to the big or just
drive to the basket. When I turned around and saw the basket I felt like I had
an advantage trying to get to the rim. So I tried to use my body a little bit.
And the main thing was just to stay poised and just got a shot off.  
  
Q. This is for all you guys. First half against DePaul you guys really
looked a little lethargic, and now you're at this point now. What did you guys
have to do to get from point A to point B now, for anyone who wants to
answer?  
COACH MACK: I want these guys to answer the majority of questions, but I would
say I disagree with you that we were lethargic. I thought if anything we
pressed. Defensively we played pretty well. I thought our guys were pressing.
We couldn't make a shot. And that's -- we're no different. A lot of teams that
come in the Garden with the bright lights and miss a lot of shots. But our
team settled in.  
  
Q. First half, guys were close. What were some of the adjustments you
made mentally and physically?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Well, mentally, he just told us to stay in the game. The other
two games that we played against them it's been the same way.  
  
So we couldn't let that get to us. We knew that it was a game of runs. And we
were still in it from the get-go.  
  
I think from the on-the-floor standpoint, I just think that we kind of lacked
getting those rebounds that we talked about leading up to this game, and he
just told us that it's something we have to improve on.  
  
We were getting open shots. We just didn't make them count and take advantage
of them. But overall just keep playing the way we're playing and just stick to
it, and eventually everything's going to fall through.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the decision to send Baldwin to the line to
take the free throws for Savage, what went into it and why you picked him?  
COACH MACK: I think at one point I picked all four guys. Fortunately I didn't
say anything to the referee. Number one, Travis is a senior. I mean, he's been
down this road before. He was 4-for-4. I don't think he touched the rim. I
eliminated him.  
  
And you had Kelan Martin, big-time gamer. He's made big shot after big shot.
He already had been to the line a minute or so before. He made the second one.
So I felt like he would sort of get a rhythm. Then I looked at Fowler and
Baldwin. Both of them are great free throw shooters. I just think Nate, he's
very stoic. I don't think the moment is going to get to him. Every time I
watch him shoot a free throw, it's like a machine, ball hits the net the same
way.  
  
I picked the best free throw shooter on their team. Fortunately he missed one.
But any of those guys could have missed one or made one; we just got lucky.  
  
Q. Malcolm and Tre, I think you scored about 100 points in the paint
this week going back to Saturday. You're going into Friday now. Are you
surprised that that area of the floor has been as open as it has been up to
like this standpoint still?  
MALCOLM BERNARD: I think Coach emphasizes a lot on getting paint touches and
getting to the box. I mean, we all know that we can shoot the ball well. We've
put up a lot of shots, probably more than most teams, and so like our big
emphasis is getting to the box. So that's what we try to do every single time
is get to the box. That's a huge emphasis for us.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you stop, your defense completely switched it up, not
only from games you played against earlier in the year. But at the same time,
last night, you were going with a zone almost the entire game, putting
pressure up on top they weren't swinging kept doing it never got the ball down
low. Today you basically went man-to-man -- you did switch it up a little bit
in the first half, but went right back to man-to-man. It was very effective.
Looking at two statistics. One, 21 percent Butler shot from 3-point range when
they've got shooters. What did you do on top? How they miss that much?
Obviously get a lot of credit for your defense.  
COACH MACK: Number one, DePaul isn't near the shooting team that Butler is.
For us I think being able to switch a lot of their dribble hand-offs, it
creates a little bit of mismatches at times. You're going to have certain guys
maybe on their point guard, certain guys on Travis who is going to roll you in
the post. But we felt overall if we switched for the most part there's going
to be a man on a man everywhere on the floor.  
  
And again I think our guys have great respect for the type of shooting team
that Butler is and being able to contain the basketball is the most important
thing defensively. If you do that, it doesn't require a second defender to
help and I think our guys did that.  
  
We tried to mix it up because I think our team's been pretty effective playing
zone. But we couldn't do what we did against DePaul, in my opinion, and feel
like we could be successful.  
  
Q. Malcolm, after playing at Florida A &M, you're on the verge of
playing in the NCAA Tournament. Can you talk about your emotions, how this
might cap your career?  
MALCOLM BERNARD: Honestly, it's unexplainable.  
  
Q. One happy cat right there, I'll tell you that.  
MALCOLM BERNARD: It's really unexplainable. That's the reason why I came here,
and to see it actually happening, I mean, knowing that it was going to happen
already but to actually see it, it's truly an amazing feeling. And I don't
think I'm going to feel anything better than this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Andrew Chrabascz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28820)

### [Kethan Savage](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32900)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 62, Butler - 57  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Give Xavier credit. They made plays and the free throws down
the stretch that we just weren't quite able to make. So I thought we had some
guys really play to win today and that was good to see.  
  
I thought our togetherness was really good, but you're going to struggle when
you turn it over late and teams shoot 60 percent in the second half.  
  
So that was disappointing. But I thought there were some good things to take
from this and we'll learn and move on.  
  
Q. Any common thread between losing the lead late in the Seton Hall game
and also in this one or they just two different scenarios?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No, completely different in my mind, other than we fouled a
little too much here. But completely different in terms of our offense. I
thought we got what we wanted in the last five minutes.  
  
And I'll take the shot Kamar had there late, a clean 3. That was a great look
for us. And I thought Kethan did a good job attacking the rim there.  
  
So I felt much better about how we managed. We just fouled too much and we
didn't really -- I thought Drew worked his fanny off. We probably needed to
give him some more support against Bluiett. Put him on the line too much.  
  
Q. Do you start to feel a little bit jinxed here, 0-for-4?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No, we played pretty much a good team every year. We're not
ignoring the fact that we're 0-for-4. We want to win. Our guys want to win.
We're disappointed. We're disappointed for our fans. We would have loved for
our fans, everyone who came, to stay here a little longer. But you've gotta do
it. You've gotta go win.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of adjustments you want to make, what are some things
that you're going to take with you going into the tournament?  
COACH HOLTMANN: You know, we'll kind of leave that between us. I think there's
some things we've got to improve on. Fouling has been a little bit of an issue
for us. That's one thing. We've gotta do a better job of that.  
  
And, again, we can't turn the ball over in certain situations. I think that
was critical for us, that we've gotta do a better job of that. But we'll look
at it. Again, I think I was really pleased with a couple of guys today in
their play and we had a good way about us. We just didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Were Avery Woodson and Kethan Savage both dealing with some kind of
nagging injuries?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yes. Yeah, so it was -- they both got injured this week in
practice. But we didn't -- we weren't necessarily sure that they would impact,
they were cleared and ready to go but it might have affected Avery more than I
even anticipated.  
  
And Kethan is dealing with -- a little bit banged up, but he performed well.
But those guys did have some time off this week trying to recover from getting
banged up in practice.  
  
Q. Can you say what the injuries were?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think Kethan's just had a little bit of an Achilles strain
and Avery just had a foot sprain.  
  
Q. Curious from an encore perspective and also from a coaching
perspective, what you guys saw that they were doing defensively, because I'm
looking at the second half, 3-pointers, 1-for-8, overall game 21 percent. At
one point you were shooting, Butler was shooting 90 percent. And when Tyler
missed two free throws, it went down to about 79 but finished the game at 68.8
percent from the line. So 3-pointers 21 percent for a team that can shoot.
What did they do defensively?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: At the same time I think we missed some shots that we
normally make. They ran us off the line. They're a physical team. And they
were able to play physically tonight. Obviously late in the season it's going
to be that type of game. Like I said, we made a lot of shots we missed today.
We give them a lot of credit. They played really especially in the second
half. I have the utmost confidence in our players. Going down the stretch at
the free throw line, that's very uncharacteristic of us to miss free throws
like that. So, yeah, we'll be fine from that.  
  
Q. I know it was a tough loss, but could you tell me what did you learn
about the integrity and character of your team tonight?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think what we've known all year that we've got a pretty
resilient group. We knew we were going to play a really hungry Xavier team.
And we were hungry ourselves. Our guys wanted to play well and wanted to win.
I don't think we played poorly. I think we need to play better. But I don't
think we played poorly, but we do need to play better. And hopefully we can
learn some things and move forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 70, Providence - 58  
  
COACH COOLEY: Well, that was a masterpiece there. We just didn't play well. I
give Creighton a lot of credit. That was, pick who played worse in that game.
That probably wasn't one of Mac's (Doug McDermott) better games as a team.  
  
26 points on turnovers, uncharacteristic turnovers for us. I thought we were
lackadaisical. Just we didn't play well. We picked a bad time to play our
worst game in probably five or six weeks.  
  
If you would have told me that they would be 4-for-20 and miss those free
throws and have seven assists I'd like to say we have a chance to win the
game.  
  
Again, give them credit; they advance. In tournament play you can't play
poorly and expect to win. So hopefully we have another game left in us in the
NCAA Tournament. I think we've done some good things as of late. We just
picked a bad time to play poor. Proud of our kids, very, very proud of our
team finishing the regular season well.  
  
Unfortunately, we didn't play well in our tournament here in Madison Square
Garden. But our league shows how tough it is night in night out and hopefully
we get invited to this party on Sunday.  
  
Q. Talking about uncharacteristic turnovers, is it just sloppy, mental
mistakes?  
COACH COOLEY: I think a lot of them were mental mistakes, they really were.
For whatever reason, guys, it happens. You get games that -- normally games
like that in November and December. But come March you've got to try to play
as clean as you can and we just didn't play clean.  
  
I thought we played tough. I thought we were really, really tough we just
didn't execute at all. It was really poor.  
  
Q. Your team shot almost 50 percent from the line tonight, how
concerning is that?  
COACH COOLEY: It's been -- we've been struggling all year from the line. I
don't have an answer for that. We practice it as much as we can. Hopefully if
we have another game, hopefully we shoot 90 percent. It happens sometimes.  
  
Q. The team's putting a lot of pressure on themselves defensively when
they're missing shots. Do you think that's also the effort they're expending
on defense is affecting the free-throw shooting?  
COACH COOLEY: No, I mean, come on, these kids are 18 to 22 years old. As my
pop says, they should be able to touch the sky two out of three times. They're
young, energetic. No, it's what you play for.  
  
Who cannot play in this building and be excited you know what I mean? That's
what you're playing for. You want to get stops, which we did. We got some
unbelievable stops but we gave it right back to them on six different
occasions. We took the ball, we got the stop and threw it right away to them.
So I don't think it was us focusing on defense, it's just we played bad.  
  
Q. Quick perspective, you were 4-8, you would have taken this 10-9
conference in the end. Is this a game you throw away the tape, say, hey, guys
we're on a roll, hopefully looking forward to things next weekend?  
COACH COOLEY: I think your question is great. We definitely don't need to see
this. I saw it once. Right now -- what I just talked to the team about is
anytime you have a chance to control your own destiny, not just in basketball,
in life, when you have a chance to control what you want to do and you don't
take advantage of it, don't complain. We had an opportunity to cement
ourselves clearly and we didn't take advantage of that.  
  
It's a great learning point for my kids. It's a great learning point for me as
a coach and hopefully if we get invited to that dance there's some carry-over
from this poor performance today.  
  
This loss is on me. Not those players. It's a players game. The coach did a
bad job today. But the players, they deserve more credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Rodney Pryor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28663)

### [L.J. Peak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32189)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 74, Georgetown - 73  
  
Q. From your perspective what happened out there in that melee, whatever
you want to call it there. And then when Coach Mullin came up to your bench
and said some stuff, what kind of transpired there?  
COACH THOMPSON: It's just competition. It's the Big East Tournament. It's just
competition. That's all.  
  
Q. Did it catch you off guard when you saw Coach come up there and kind
of engage your bench at that time?  
COACH THOMPSON: No. Kids were playing hard, and coaches were coaching hard. I
think it was L.J. goes in, takes a hard foul. I think it's just the heat of
the battle. As kids -- they're not kids, people, tempers flare a little bit.
But I don't think that there was any, you know -- I don't think at the end of
the day (indiscernible) -- it's just competition, man.  
  
Q. Rodney, first time in the Big East Tournament game. What was it like
out there for you with everything that went on right down to the bottom, the
last second, the scrum, the spirit, the atmosphere?  
RODNEY PRYOR: It's just a blessing. It's what I signed up for. I knew the Big
East was going to be like this. It was just a blessing to be part of it.  
  
Q. L.J., after the fracas, I think it was part of 14 straight points you
had for Georgetown, and you helped bring them back in the second half. Could
you talk about what that inspired play came from and what you guys talked
about as a team to come back in the second half to hold the game really
close?  
L.J. PEAK: Just wanting to win. Just fighting hard, two teams fighting hard
and just making plays.  
  
Q. L.J., you sat the first half in foul trouble. How much did you want
to come back in the second half to make up for lost time?  
L.J. PEAK: That's just how I play. I don't think I come out aggressive. I come
out aggressive. It's something I do, and I have to impact the game somehow.  
  
Q. Second straight losing season. Could you assess the state of the
program, what do you see and where are you going forward?  
COACH THOMPSON: After a loss like that right now I don't think it's the time
to do that.  
  
Q. When is?  
COACH THOMPSON: I'm not sure. Not tonight. I'm worried about the group that's
in there right now, the student-athletes that are in there right now, how
they're feeling right now. So not tonight.  
  
Q. Rodney, strong first half, but maybe not as strong as the second
half. Any difference? Did they play you differently; did you start missing
shots or not getting shots?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Just missing some looks that I normally knock down for my team.
L.J. did a great job of attacking the rim and we was playing through him.  
  
Q. John, I know you're optimistic about this season. What do you think
went wrong with not being able to get into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH THOMPSON: I will give you the same answer that I just gave. Right now at
this time I'm concerned about the young men that are in there and later on
tonight, tomorrow, I don't know when, I'll sit back and assess the season and
all that but right now we have a group of kids that played hard. They played
hard. They gave themselves for each other, for their institution and they're
hurting right now and that's my concern at this second.  
  
Q. Rodney, obviously your last NCAA game. What do you tell your
teammates in the locker room?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Just thank them all for allowing me to come here and play
basketball with them and just tell them to keep moving forward and play hard
and representing Georgetown the right way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Shamorie Ponds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32815)

### [Malik Ellison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32816)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 74, Georgetown - 73  
  
Q. What does it mean to win a Big East Tournament game, St. John's
hasn't won one since 2011 on your home floor. With everything with the fracas
and all the emotion for you guys.  
MALIK ELLISON: Big time win for us. Obviously there's been a huge rivalry over
the last 40 years. And it was great that we came together as a team and we got
the victory.  
  
Q. Shamorie, what did you see happen there, with Ahmed after the hard
foul?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: A lot of emotions came up and it was a hard foul. And the team
just thought, like, it was like intentionally. Personally, I don't think it
was intentionally. They just -- everybody got riled up.  
  
Q. Looked like Amar got pushed from behind by Hayes and there was
nothing called. Did that fire you guys up at all?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: I don't know. I don't recall that play. I didn't see it. I
wouldn't know.  
  
Q. What was it like out there, just the whole game, because they were
hard fouls pretty much start to finish from this one?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: It was a physical game. I think we just came out and end of
the first half we set the tone. We wanted to run. They came out in the second
half and got on a run, and we just took over the game.  
  
Q. Shamorie, can you just speak on being a New York City player and what
it feels like playing here in the Big East Tournament?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: It was amazing. Like the crowd everything was amazing. So I
think this is, like, the best tournament in the country.  
  
Q. Both of you, did Coach Mullin talk to you guys at all about the
Georgetown-St. John's history and all the great games that were in this
building back in the 1980s, because there were moments, particularly with the
scrum where this brought back some great memories for all of us who covered
this thing for a while?  
MALIK ELLISON: We were very aware of the rivalry. Obviously it's a big
rivalry. When Coach Mullin was playing they were very physical and they were
very competitive. So we just came out here and we really fought for him and we
just got the victory.  
  
SHAMORIE PONDS: Yeah, he definitely talked about it a lot. This is a big
rivalry so we just wanted to come on and get it done.  
  
Q. Shamorie, what were your thoughts today on finding out you weren't
rookie of the year and it went to Patton? Were you sad about it,
disappointed?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: No, I just wanted to get the win.  
  
Q. No reaction?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: Not really. I just wanted to win, at the end of the day. It's
a good accolade but I just want to win.  
  
Q. Did you think he deserved it?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: Personally, I think so. But it is what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, could you explain the slow start and with such a quick
turnaround how do you avoid that tomorrow?  
COACH MULLIN: Well, the way we've been playing that wasn't such a slow start.
We've had much slower starts than that. But to me we played tough and it's
just an old-school type of game. Both teams played hard. As far as the
turnaround, like I tell them all the time, get their rest and come out and
play.  
  
Q. Shamorie, after the incident and L.J. Peak took the flagrant free
throws, you came back hit a 3 and turned around and the arena is a rough
thing, what was it like for you a big shot and big moment in the game, can you
talk about that moment?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: It was a lot of emotions. I love games like that. So when the
crowd is going and both teams are playing physical, I just live for moments
like that.  
  
Q. Coach, you took two of three from Georgetown this year how big of an
advantage was home court advantage for you guys?  
COACH MULLIN: We played well here as of late. Not last Saturday. But I tell
these guys it's nice it's great. The home court advantage is tremendous and
the enthusiasm they still have to go out there and perform. That energy and
enthusiasm before the game is nice but you have to maintain for 40 minutes
especially this time of year. The crowd was great. But more importantly they
made big plays when they had to.  
  
Q. Coach, after the fracas, you went after the Georgetown bench, got a
technical foul, from your perspective what happened?  
COACH MULLIN: I just went out there to see what was going on. I saw Marcus go
into the stands. I wanted to make sure he was okay. Everything else just
nothing really going on. Close game like that, the whole team is going to
lose, their season is over. And I think it was just really competitive juices
flowing and towards the end of the game there. But initially I just went out
there to see I saw him walk and fall into the stands and that's it.  
  
Q. That's basically what I was going to ask. But Chris at the end of the
game you said something to Patrick Ewing Jr. And looked like everything was
fine after the game. What did you say to him?  
COACH MULLIN: Asked if he was going to beat me up like his father did. He said
no, I love you, so I said OK. He was on the trip with us in Barcelona when he
was a little baby. So, yeah, just tremendous respect there. There really is.
And it was nothing more than competitive juices, nothing more than that. This
time. In '85 there was more to it. (Laughter) not in the year 2000.  
  
Q. Shamorie, you haven't had many come down in the last minute this
year, blowing out teams like Syracuse, Marquette. (Indiscernible) you haven't
seen it at the college level really. What was it at the college level?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: It was definitely an experience I never experienced -- that
moment was like nervous. I mean I'm just happy that my team got the win.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Billy Garrett Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32842)

### [Dave Leitao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30496)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 75, DePaul - 64  
  
COACH LEITAO: Two points of emphasis today. One about the game. I thought
their ability to come right after us at the beginning of the second half and I
think we made the first four, five shots. They got point-blank in what we were
doing defensively started to break down because they drove. They drove and
kick. And we didn't rotate. We didn't keep the ball in front of us.  
  
So credit to them to stay with it and it's what happened a bunch of times this
year, we had those lapses on either end of the floor. We stop being in sync
and it costs us. They went up eight and now we're playing an uphill battle.
And they've got too many shot makers to have to come from behind.  
  
So credit to Chris for keeping his guys and moving forward. This time of year
you've got to play it one game at a time, one possession at a time actually. I
thought they did a really good job of that. And what I thought was going to be
a nip and tuck battle because I thought both teams were ready to play.  
  
The second part of it is when you conclude a season, you have to put some sort
of a cap on it. And for us, in year two, the biggest thing for me right now is
having to say goodbye to not only team, but Billy most importantly. He's a guy
that we've talked a lot about him. He came here and what he has not gotten in
terms of success on the court, he epitomizes what you want a man to be about.
And I'm going to miss him dearly. I think getting both the sportsmanship award
and scholar-athlete award, it really doesn't do justice to who he is.  
  
And it's sad. On one hand to see him complete his career and then the other
hand to not enjoy this tournament for a longer period of time and have more
wins under his belt.  
  
But we all have faith and knowing that there's a reason that he's been tested
like this because he's set up tremendously, and especially now because he's
gone through some really difficult times as an athlete, to enjoy some of the
things that come along with having to persevere. So credit to him and the rest
of our seniors as we say goodbye to him.  
  
Q. Bluiett started 0-for-7 at halftime and he winds up being the leading
scorer for the game. So what was the difference in how you defended him?  
COACH LEITAO: Well, you know, part of it is that the coaches voted him first
team All-Big East for a reason because he has the ability and a great knack to
score the basketball.  
  
But I thought what he is he's a really good shooter, but today he was a really
good player.  
  
And he made one 3, but it was his ability to drive, his ability to rebound,
his ability to pass. He had four assists. To be a bigger part of the game than
just seeing the ball go in the basket. And sometimes guys can get caught up in
that. And when the ball's not going in the other parts of the game suffer.  
  
But on the stage where you have to, and particularly if you believe what's
going on with in/out whatever, for a guy to do that speaks volumes to his
talent and his ability to diversify himself.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)  
BILLY GARRETT JR.: It was tough. In that situation you have to play smart
defense, still can't give up anything easy.  
  
Still have to play the middle there. Nobody wants to do that. He's definitely
got to be cognizant of it. So you know it was tough. But I made it out of
there without fouling.  
  
Q. Billy, I know it's tough in this moment, but what could you say about
your time being at DePaul?  
BILLY GARRETT JR.: From a pure wins and losses standpoint, it hasn't been
ideal. But I get that question a lot. And people ask me if it was a bad
experience. No, not at all.  
  
No experience -- I believe like nothing in life is necessarily bad. I mean,
everything is a learning experience. So being at DePaul was no different.  
  
I met a lot of great people, and learned a lot of valuable lessons, and dealt
with a lot of other people. I'm coming out of here as a lot stronger person
and it reaches beyond basketball, you know what I mean? But overall I think it
was a positive experience. And I'm coming out of here a lot stronger. I'm
coming out of here a lot more mature and ready for life. That's why I went to
school regardless of basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously it's going to be looking at next year. So what was
the takeaway from your first two years here and applying it to next year, what
are you hoping for next year?  
COACH LEITAO: You know, there's that inevitable word of "a process." And the
thing that I've thought about is obviously we all are judged on whether you
win or you lose and that's how it gets determined. But when you're trying to
do what we're trying to do that becomes the culmination of everything that
goes into a process. And I think we're ongoing in that process.  
  
I feel really, really good about the direction of where we're going and what
we're doing. And I'm going to try to make some significant strides forward
between this spring and next fall to put us in a much better position. But I
know when you get guys like Billy here to my right, you know, it becomes a
standard of how you want people to be part of, the definition of going to
DePaul University means we educate you. And as a student-athlete the way he's
come through it, then all I have to do is make sure I go out and find as many
Billy Garretts as I can.  
  
When the true definition, when you look at the scoreboard on Fox or ESPN, you
determine a program or a player on a win and a loss, I don't think you do
justice.  
  
Most of you probably can't come up with Billy's career record, but you can
certainly come up with his evaluation or your evaluation of him and his
character. And that means that when you thought of him, his score was a whole
lot more than his opponents and that's what we want for our program.  
  
That's what a process is all about is finding the right combination of guys
that will live for each other and we think we brought some of that. We've got
to continue to add a lot more pieces.  
  
We've got to get the guys in our program better. But we're at a very critical
part in our history. We're moving to a new arena. We have a lot of new things
going on and it really means a new direction.  
  
So I'm really excited at the same point in time my heart is heavy because a
guy like Billy, really wish he was around for a couple more years, because
then what you see or what you will see when you turn on the television and
watch the scores will be the same thing as what's going on in the day-to-day
operations of our program.  
  
Q. Billy, you started your career at DePaul with winning rookie of the
year and you finished it with winning the Big East sportsmanship award. If
there's one thing at your time at DePaul that sticks out what is it, is it one
of those awards or is it something else?  
BILLY GARRETT JR.: One thing in particular that sticks out, I really can't put
my finger on one thing. It's been such -- I've been through a lot since I've
been here. It's been a fun experience.  
  
I mean, if anything, the one thing that sticks out is just the everyday life
at the university, dealing with faculty and the staff and all the students.
That's something that I'll take with me. I'll keep with me forever. And don't
get me wrong. All those awards are great. I'm proud to be named sportsman of
the year and to receive the academic scholar-athlete award. But I mean the
thing that sticks out to me is just the life at DePaul. It's a great place for
me.  
  
Q. Billy, along with that question, you've experienced a lot as far as
this conference is concerned. What would you take away from having experienced
the Big East?  
BILLY GARRETT JR.: I grew up watching the Big East my dad was at Seton Hall
when I was younger. I remember the Big East when it was an 8-team league to
now.  
  
I've seen the change. But Big East is in my opinion the greatest conference in
the world with the greatest conference tournament in the world and you see
other conferences trying to come to Madison Square Garden. I was talking to my
teammates, this will always be the Big East team and I'll forever consider
myself a part of the Big East.  
  
And I think it's just an historic league with a lot of great players and it's
been an honor to play in it. But it's tough. It's a conference where you don't
get a night off. You run into Xavier and you might go to Creighton. You know
how it goes. But it's just a tough conference and it makes the best players.  
  
Q. Billy, 432 assists, not many 6'6 " guys can do that. A lot of assists
here. Guys who are coming back next year, what do you feel your leadership did
to advance the players who will be here and carry on the team?  
BILLY GARRETT JR.: Hopefully I set a good example for those guys, on the court
and off the court as far as the work is concerned and everything you've got to
do to be a good player. So hopefully -- I'm confident with those guys that
they'll take that and everything that the coaching staff gives and bring it to
next year and we've got some great guys coming in.  
  
So I've got confidence in the program. I've got confidence in the coaching
staff. I'm going to be sad I won't be a part of it. But I'll be around. Wish
the best of luck to everybody.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

### [Quentin Goodin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32841)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 75, DePaul - 64  
  
COACH MACK: Well, we're just happy to be moving on. I thought, I told our team
I thought our first 20 minutes of the game we didn't play great. I think we
were pressing.  
  
I don't blame them. They're kids. They want to play in the dance. They want to
continue their season. So there's a lot of pressure. It's hard to beat a team
back to back like that.  
  
So give our guys credit. We came out of the locker room and played a little
bit better offensively. I thought defensively we were fine, other than not
being able to rebound the ball out of the zone. But offensively we loosened up
and played a lot better, a lot more confident in the second half, along with
getting some offensive putbacks. So we lived to fight another day.  
  
Q. You obviously avoided a bad loss tonight so even with what -- regards
to Butler tomorrow you think you're in the tournament?  
COACH MACK: I don't know. I'm going to stick with my buddy, Jim Boeheim.  
  
Q. In the second half, you guys started going, what I saw in the first
half, you guys started coming to the middle. Coming to the middle, taking the
ball right to the hoop. They didn't have a defensive big guy. Tomorrow, I
don't know if you guys practiced for two games ahead or if you just practiced
for the one game, when you have 19 hours to turn around right now and play
Butler. But can you do the same kind of thing tomorrow and take advantage --
because DePaul at times only had four guards?  
COACH MACK: Give those guys credit. They really slough off. They really crowd
the lane. They put -- defenders are off the ball in the lane. So while they
may not have the size and strength to maybe deal with a Rashid Gaston or Sean
for us, they do it with numbers.  
  
I thought in the second half we took a little bit of advantage of the
interior. I thought Quentin did a great job getting in the lane. That's always
our game plan. We want to get the ball into the lane. Whether it's post-ups or
drives or offensive rebounds, we did it much better in the second half than
the first.  
  
Q. How much did J.P.'s shot change things? I know it's only three points
but seemed like you really sent you guys into the locker room feeling good and
obviously the second half was a different game?  
TRE'DARIUS MCCALLUM: I thought it brought a lot of momentum in the locker
room. We were going in down four, I don't think we had hit a shot in a while,
come down hit that shot, it brings more life into us in the locker room and it
just gave us more confidence.  
  
COACH MACK: Knowing you're down one with the ball coming out with the
possession, echo Tre's sentiments, big time shot and you don't expect much
less out of J.P.  
  
Q. Trevon, you started this game 0-for-8, then started to hit some
shots. What's your mentality when you're 0-for-8 and nothing is going in?  
TRE'DARIUS MCCALLUM: When that happens still be aggressive but find better
shots, easier shots, maybe start inside and work my way out and kind of get
lost into the game, just take what the defense gives me pretty much.  
  
Q. Trevon, you started out 0-for-8 as he mentioned, ended up being the
leading scorer. Was there something that the coach said to you or what was the
mentality there?  
TRE'DARIUS MCCALLUM: No, he just kept instilling the confidence in me, telling
me those were great shots. Some of the shots I was taking was pretty good just
fell in and out and just being aggressive and when I, like I said, get lost in
the game, make great passes, play hard defense, everything else will follow.  
  
Q. You may have had the toughest entry a year ago, do you feel the
team's adjusted two guys there that don't get to sit on the bench much J.P.,
do you feel the adjustment has been made or do you feel the experiment with
Sumner gone a month now?  
COACH MACK: I wouldn't say it's an experiment at all. We're not as deep as a
team as we used to be, but that freshman down there has done a terrific job
and he grows more confident each and every day. The one thing he's done a
terrific job all year long, whatever his role has been he's been a really good
defender for us.  
  
And we don't have a luxury at times for any of our guys to get in foul
trouble. So that's prevented us from being more of a man-to-man team here down
the stretch. But I think our team's adjusted. It's just we're just a little
bit different team.  
  
Q. You mentioned a lot of pressure on the players early. What kind of
advantage is it to you to get that out of the way tonight and then build
momentum with the victory going into tomorrow?  
COACH MACK: Well, I can tell you it beats the alternative (laughter). I don't
really know how to answer that question. I just know that we got a big
challenge tomorrow. Our guys understand how good Butler is, the type of year
they've had all year. And I expect us to play better tomorrow than we did
tonight. But that will be determined tomorrow.  
  
Q. Quentin, obviously the injury to Edmond Sumner put you in a bad spot.
You guys struggled, six-game streak before these games. Can you explain how
well you did tonight and if that's given you some confidence?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I feel like I just took advantage of what the defense gave me.
My game is to get to the rim and then make my team better (indiscernible). But
my whole mind set today was to get to the rim, do the same thing you usually
do. Just worked out today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Illinois head coach Brad Underwood.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: It's a pleasure to be here in New York City. I'm very excited
about this opportunity. Being here in Madison Square Garden, I think, is very,
very special. I think it's every coach's and every player's dream to get the
opportunity to perform here.  
  
Equally, I'm just as excited to be a part of the Big Ten. And I think it's a
league filled with tremendous passion and fan bases as the 41 years of
consecutive attendance records show. Great, great coaches, along with
tremendous student-athletes.  
  
I think it's something I'm very, very excited about. I've been very, very
excited at Illinois to this point in terms of our fans and our passion. And
getting to fill the State Farm Center is something I'm excited about.  
  
I'm excited about this group. We return a nucleus of guys who have some
minutes. We're fairly inexperienced. I think it's one of the challenges we
have with this team, is to -- everybody's going to be in somewhat of a new
role.  
  
Malcolm Hill led this team last year, and yet we have two guys here today that
I think are ready to take on that role in Michael Finke and Leron Black. Both
of those young men got valuable experience. Michael was hurt at the end of the
year. He's now healthy.  
  
And I'm excited about a young guy that started the last 15 games last year,
Te'Jon Lucas, kind of my type of point guard. He's a pit bull. He can really,
really guard and he's a guy that's developing into leadership.  
  
He's been slowed a little bit. He's coming off a concussion in practice. And
we just had him yesterday for the first full day back, but excited.  
  
We added a fifth-year transfer, Mark Alstork, from Wright State. Mark was a
very, very big scorer there. I think he gives us a punch. And we have a very
youthful exuberance about us with our group of freshmen, a group that I'm very
high on. I think they're very talented. They're all a little bit different.
And they're led by Mark Smith, a young man who is Mr. Basketball in the state
of Illinois that has a very gifted body and physique. He can play multiple
positions. He'll play a lot of point for us as well.  
  
So I'm excited about this group. I think they've committed to both feet in and
working hard and changing a culture. And I'm excited. We get better every
single day.  
  
Q. Is Mark Smith different from most freshmen? Does he already have some
leadership qualities and all that type?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Mark's very special. You're talking about a young man that
physically looks the part of a 21-, 22-year-old guy, a guy that's been in the
program. He's 6'4". He's 220.  
  
It's unfair for me to compare him. But I do compare him a little bit to Jason
Kidd back in the day. He's got that type of athleticism.  
  
More importantly, his natural instincts are to lead. And I think once the game
slows down for him and he understands exactly what we're trying to do, he's
going to be a guy that's a fantastic leader, and he's a guy, I think, you'll
see us play all over the court. He'll play a variety of positions for us, as
we pretty much play position-less. But he's a tough matchup because of that
body.  
  
Q. Brad, on a 10-point scale just for the sake of discussion where last
year's Oklahoma State offense is a 10, what's your goal for this year's
Illinois offense?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: 9-plus. I think that's to be determined. I think the one
thing that I think -- we've got guys who can offensive rebound.  
  
I think one of the things that we did last year was get to the foul line a
great deal. We shot almost 80 percent as a team. That helped in terms of our
efficiency numbers.  
  
Last year's team didn't turn the ball over. We were a 9-, 10-turnover team in
a high-possession style of play.  
  
I think we're going to turn it over a little bit more than that early. We're
still feeling each other out, understanding a new system.  
  
But you know, I think we can be a team that's pretty proficient on the
offensive end. And we're still every single day working to get better at some
things and we've got to get better at some things. But we're different from
the fact that Michael Finke and Leron Black are two interior guys that maybe
we didn't have that much luxury with last year. But those guys are very, very
capable of having big nights.  
  
Q. I didn't know this, but Teddy -- I just read something that Teddy
wrote about that you changed your defense in midstream at Oklahoma State last
year from pressure to pack line, which is pretty contrasting. What drove you
to do that?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: 0-6. 0-6.  
  
Q. But that's pretty dramatic for a coach to do that in the middle of
the season.  
COACH UNDERWOOD: We were 10-2 in the non-league and we were leading the
country in turnovers forced. And we were leading the country in free throw
attempts at that time.  
  
And the one thing that happened is we got into league play, we got exposed a
little bit at the 4 spot. We were in all those games, very, very close games.
And, yet, we had difficulty in the Big 12.  
  
You're talking about a league that had Josh Jackson, Deonte Burton, Wesley
Iwundu, guys who all played the power forward spot. Those were the guys who
hurt us. So we got off to a tough start.  
  
And I felt like a change was needed. And we needed a shot of confidence. We
were right there knocking on the door in all those games. And something had to
give. And I had to help them. And it's a long night or couple nights of
evaluation, and we just decided that we're going to back it up a step or two
and try to lengthen possessions. And, yet, it didn't hurt our offense. But it
gave our guys just a little bit of confidence because we did change.  
  
Q. Big Ten just announced an in-state rivalry, a protected rivalry for
the first time. What do you know about Northwestern's history and what Chris
has done for the program?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I think the one thing that excites me is it's -- Chris, one,
he's done an unbelievable job there of establishing an identity, a basketball
identity.  
  
And their recent success is something that doesn't go unnoticed. I think any
time you have two teams in the same conference, in the same state we should
play. That to me is what the fans want.  
  
I think it's exciting for college basketball to have those rivalries, to have
those games. And obviously they're in Chicago we have a tremendous amount of
alumni there. We play a game there every year in the United Center.  
  
So it's something that excites me, and I think with going into 20 games every
year, which I think is something that's great for basketball -- I'm excited
about the early December games -- I think it's one thing that getting the
opportunity to play them twice in each other's home venues is something that's
really special. And I think it will be great for both sets of fans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Mark Turgeon.  
  
COACH TURGEON: Great to be in New York. Love this city. I've got a lot of
great memories as a player and as a coach in this city. So it's good that
we're bringing the tournament to The Garden. Should be great.  
  
We've got a great alumni base up here in New York. Planning on having a lot of
fans in The Garden come March. With that, like my team. Looking forward to the
season.  
  
Q. What do you think about the week off before the NCAA Tournament,
after your conference tournament, is that a good or bad thing? And having
postseason tournaments here in the East Coast, here in DC, how much can that
help your recruiting going forward?  
COACH TURGEON: First of all, personally I don't mind the week off, because
I've experienced it when I was at Wichita State. It actually helped us. Going
into that tournament, we were able to get fresh, put in a lot of new plays. We
could disguise a few things, steal a few buckets, so to speak.  
  
So I don't have a problem with it. Ask me in March, if we're lucky enough to
be in the tournament, I might have a different answer. But my experience has
been positive.  
  
We love that Delaney decided to do this on the East Coast. We obviously wish
we would have performed a little better in DC last year. But having it in The
Garden, it's terrific. It's an area we recruit very hard, the East Coast. So I
think it's terrific. It's terrific for us, and I think it's terrific for the
Big Ten.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 20-game schedule, and in terms of your
rivalries, Penn State and Rutgers, how that affects your overall strength of
schedule and just the whole new concept?  
COACH TURGEON: I think the idea behind the 20-game schedule is hopefully to
get more teams into the NCAA Tournament. And data showed when we went from 16
to 18, we started getting more teams in the tournament. So hopefully that's
the case when we go to 20, because that's such a big part of today's world.  
  
I think being new to the league, rivalries are going to take time to establish
themselves in the area. But Pat's doing a terrific job at Penn State. Steve is
going to do a great job at Rutgers.  
  
If those do become our rivals I guess we'll play more local games, I'm not
sure the real breakdown, but got a lot of respect for their programs.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how practice is going in terms of the new guys,
Morsell and Bruno, and what you've seen from them and how you feel they would
help you guys?  
COACH TURGEON: Practice is off to a great start. I wasn't able to work with
them at all this summer. So we're just getting started and I'm very pleased. I
think he said 10 people back from last year's team -- I think it's eight of
our top 10. So practice has gone well. We have a lot of great leadership.  
  
Our young guys have grown up quickly. We have a lot of experience coming back.
Practice is great. Darryl and Bruno have been fantastic. We haven't slowed
down for them. They've kept up, with everything that we've put in.  
  
You know, when I signed both those players I wanted to add toughness and
physicality to our team, and we did that with both of them. Darryl is a big
guard. He's playing point guard. He played point guard on his AAU team, did
not for his high school team, he has a lot to learn there. And he's got
Anthony up in him every day which is hard. Anthony is obviously pressuring the
ball.  
  
But Darryl is doing a terrific job. Really doing a great job. Worked hard on
his shot. Shooting the ball well. And going to be a great defender for us
also.  
  
Bruno is kind of a guy that we really haven't had since I've been at Maryland,
just a 6'9", really strong, hard-playing, really, really good basketball
player. He's talented. He can do a lot of things.  
  
I think he'll really help us defensively in shot blocking and rebounding. And
he runs the floor. He's probably one of the hardest playing and practicing
players I've ever coached.  
  
So it's exciting, two good pieces, and we added Sean Obi a physical player, a
transfer player, who makes our practices much more physical.  
  
Q. When you talk about Justin Jackson, just what he did at the end of
the year last year and going through the NBA draft process, how do you think
that will affect him and just how he might respond to having more of a target
on his back this year?  
COACH TURGEON: To me, about Justin, it was just learning how to work hard
every day and push himself. And that's where I've seen the most growth with
Justin. It was something that we talked about when the season ended, if you
want to be the type of player we think you can be, you've got to put in more
than just what the coaches are putting in with you, extra time in the weight
room, extra time in the gym.  
  
So he's done that. He's gotten a lot better. We're going to use Justin a
little bit differently than we did last year, the ball being in his hands
hopefully a little bit more. He'll play perimeter. We played four perimeter
guys last year with him. But his position, he'll play two positions for us.  
  
He only played one last year. He's really doing well. He's an amazing scorer,
shoot the 3, he's got mid-range game. He's got post up, scores around the rim.  
  
He's really a good player. He can really pass the ball. And hopefully we're
going to put him in positions coming off ball screens and isolations where
things not only is he making plays for himself but he's making plays for his
teammates. And I think it will be a big change from what you saw last year.  
  
Q. You said you were going to play Justin at two positions, you didn't
specify which two. Are you going to go bigger with him at the 2 guard or
smaller with him at the 4?  
COACH TURGEON: We'll do both. So he'll play wing for us, and we'll have a
bigger lineup. As long as we're staying healthy. And then we'll go small. If
you consider small with Dion Wiley at 6'5" and Kevin Huerter at 6'7", almost
6'8", and Jared Nickens in there and Justin Jackson, it's still a pretty big
team. But he'll play the wing and the 4 position for us.  
  
Q. After three years of having at times one or two dominant ball
handlers, how much different is this year's team with the way it lines up?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I thought we've done a really nice job the last three
years sharing the ball. I like our system. I like what we run. It depends guys
playing together. I think we've been fun to watch and fun to coach. But we
have a lot of guys -- being a point guard, you know, I like having a lot of
guys on the floor that know how to play. And so almost every perimeter player
on our team, including Justin Jackson, played a little bit of point guard for
their high school team, except Jared Nickens, and they all think that way.  
  
So if practice is any indication, we'll have a lot of different guys in
position to make plays for us. And even Bender is one of the best big guys
I've ever coached as far as passing the ball, having a great feel for the
game. So have a very intelligent team that's talented. So that could be a good
sign for us.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Minnesota head coach Richard Pitino. Go ahead
and start with an opening statement and open up for questions.  
  
COACH PITINO: Excited, obviously, about the year. A lot of guys back. A lot of
guys have gotten better. Certainly an unfortunate injury with Eric Curry that
will hurt us from a depth standpoint. So we're going to have to have other
guys stand up, step up. But we got a good team. And we've got to be ready
right away because we have a very tough schedule. Excited to get going.  
  
Q. Going into the first practice last month, you had a few guys banged
up and Reggie Lynch, one of them, and he's not here today. Can you talk about
just the importance of being healthy going into this season and the status of
these players?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, it's been difficult because we have had a lot of guys who
are allowed to practice but not do contact. So it's tough to figure out where
are we at from a defensive standpoint, a rebounding standpoint, all those
physicality things that you can't work on.  
  
So Reggie, Davonte and Dupree have consistently been on contact restrictions
of 15 minutes at the most so far. So Reggie's got a meeting with the doctor,
we expect him to be cleared soon. Probably today would be my guess.  
  
And Davonte will be extremely patient with, just because of his medical
history. And Dupree is another guy has had that stress reaction, all summer,
just trying to get him healthy.  
  
I've been like an NBA coach where I've really, really limited those guys. So
it's been difficult to gauge where we're at. But we'll get healthy. I don't
think any of them are major concerns. We've just got to be patient and I've
got to be patient. Nate Mason was another one who missed a couple of days of
practice, but he did a little bit yesterday so he'll be fine with a minor
ankle sprain. Get it out of the way now, right, hopefully.  
  
Q. There's been some talk that the one-and-done rule could change in
college basketball. I wondered what your thoughts are on the impact that rule
has had and how you would ideally like that to play out going forward?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I don't have the answer. So I'm not really sure from a
one-and-done standpoint. We obviously haven't had any. So it hasn't really
affected our program from the sense of all the turnover, et cetera. But I do
think that it seems like the NBA is now, they care to kind of acknowledge it
and change it.  
  
I don't really know what the answer is. I don't know if I'm smart enough to
figure that out. But I do think that where it's at right now is not good. If
kids don't want to go to college, we probably shouldn't make them go.  
  
But I'm not sure what exactly it is. I think the trendy thing that everybody
said is the baseball model. I don't even know what that is. So I'm not sure.  
  
Q. With a guy like Reggie Lynch who is that gifted defensively but also
finds himself in foul trouble, what have you done to maybe advise him as to
how he can stay on the floor and avoid some of those fouls this coming
season?  
COACH PITINO: Begged, pleaded, interventions. Tried them all. I think he needs
to realize from a foul-trouble standpoint it's not always blocking shots
that's getting him in foul trouble. I think if you cut down on the other
things, maybe it's him getting tired and making a silly mistake. You know,
improving the fundamentals of how you're guarding it and just teaching him,
because we don't want to take away from that aggressiveness from a shot-
blocking standpoint because he's as good as it gets when it comes to shot
blocking.  
  
But we've got to find a way to cut down the other fouls. I think if we cut
down the other fouls, I think he'll be fine. I think he'll still be able to be
aggressive from a shot-blocking standpoint because we need him to do that.  
  
So we just continue to teach him as best we can. And I know he's a willing
learner. I think last year, more than anything, because he jumped up in
conferences from -- obviously Missouri Valley is a very good one to the Big
Ten, but there's different personnel in there. So that was an adjustment. I
think he'll be better this year because of it, a little bit wiser.  
  
Q. How do you work Isaiah Washington into this group? You've already got
some really talented guards.  
COACH PITINO: Isaiah's an interesting one because he's very, very talented but
he's a freshman. He's got a long way to go with little things.  
  
Freshmen need to understand sometimes it's what you do on the court that
prohibits you to get on the court. And with Jamir Harris and Isaiah, whether
it's mistakes and so on, if they can minimize those things they can play a
lot.  
  
But Isaiah brings a dimension that we haven't really had. He's a phenomenal
passer. End-to-end, he goes as good as anybody out there. I've tinkered with
lineups to find a way to get him on the court. But when you're talking about
playing time and how do you fit guys in, that's a great problem to have.  
  
We had our first time in four years, NBA scouts coming to our practice. It was
a great feeling. We haven't had that. So it's a good problem to have.  
  
Q. With the tournament coming to Madison Square Garden, moving up a
week, have you thought about how that's going to affect just the schedule and
just everything for you throughout the season?  
COACH PITINO: I haven't thought about it much. I guess I'm a little bit
superstitious. We went to the tournament last year. I want to go again. So
it's one of those things where I'll cross that bridge when it comes to it,
when I come to it.  
  
But it's made the schedule a little bit funky, a little bit different, but
that's okay. Anybody who has played in this building knows the opportunity
that it presents and how special it is to play here. And sometimes you've got
to sacrifice a little bit. So if we're fortunate enough to be in the NCAA
Tournament again at the end of the year, great problem to have.  
  
So I think when you get towards the end of the year, a lot of it is rest, but
a lot of it is making sure you're sharp with certain things. But, again, I
welcome that challenge because that means we're in the NCAA Tournament again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Rutgers head coach Steve Pikiell.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: It's great to be back. World's most famous arena here. Excited.
Excited about year two getting ready to start. And our guys have worked very
hard. I think you'll see an improved Rutgers program.  
  
And I'm proud of all the time and hard work that my staff has done to make it
that way. So we're looking forward to getting this thing started.  
  
Q. What's it like for you and for the players to have the Big Ten come
to Madison Square Garden and New York City?  
COACH PIKIELL: I tried to share some of my past experiences, being an old Big
East guy, with them in the world's most famous arena and tell them the
excitement.  
  
But New York is an exciting place anyways. And this is such a historic venue.
I think for the whole league, I think people will get a chance to see it's the
best league in the country, from 1 to 14 teams in this league, academically
and basketball-wise.  
  
It's going to be great to be able to bring this to this great city and this
great area. And I think our players are very excited. And I guess we're the
home team in this area. I know our alums are. So it will be great.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask about, last season the team was much better
defensively, obviously, far improved since your arrival. In terms of one
issue, though, interior defense in conference play, how have you addressed
that in the offseason, and how have the additions of Mamadou Doucoure and
Myles Johnson helped in that area?  
COACH PIKIELL: I'll let you know. This is obviously a talented league with
tremendous size. And we made some strides last year, certainly, from the year
before.  
  
I think we have a tremendous way to go on the defensive end. I thought we were
very average most of the year with that and defensive rebounds really hurt us
a great deal.  
  
We've emphasized that a lot in the preseason here. We've added some guys. And
I also think just the experience of having experienced guys back that know
what I want from them.  
  
And our practices have been better. We're more competitive. We're a better
basketball team now than we were a year ago. And I feel very confident in a
lot of those areas, offensively the improvements we're going to be able to
make, and certainly defensively and rebounding-wise, but it's a heck of a
league with some tremendous coaches and some tremendous size. And we've got to
recruit some tremendous size to compete.  
  
Q. What do you think about the week off in between the conference
tournament and the NCAA Tournament for teams that make it and how much will it
help your recruiting having the postseason tournament here at The Garden, do
you think that will facilitate getting New York and New Jersey guys?  
COACH PIKIELL: I think it will really facilitate letting people in this area
know how great this league is. It's great coaches and great players. You don't
know the names sometimes around here of the Wisconsin team and what
Northwestern has and those kind of things.  
  
So I think bringing Big Ten basketball here to this area is going to help
tremendously our profile.  
  
I would love to have that week off if we're one of those NCAA teams. I would
gladly take that week. I haven't thought really down the road to that point.
But I think if Rutgers ever is in a position like that, it will be a great
week.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the 20-game schedule, and even though you
don't have a protected team, per se, who would you like to see a regional
rival, Penn State, Maryland, do they make sense?  
COACH PIKIELL: Geographically, yes. Excited that two more great games we're
going to play. It's going to be -- our schedule every year is a top 50
schedule at the end of the year. Now it will be maybe a top 30, 35.  
  
I mean, banging heads for 20 games against some of the best coaches and
players, just makes it difficult. Makes it difficult for any program. But
we've added two more nationally televised games and two more opportunities
that people see teams home and away. And so I'm excited about that. And I'm
really looking for this year. We'll deal with that next year.  
  
Q. Mike Williams being a senior and being a New Yorker, how have you
seen him develop over your time coaching him?  
COACH PIKIELL: I will tell you, first, Mike loves this venue. Plays well here.
So I'm excited about that. But I think all of our seniors, we have three
seniors, and Corey is here today, too.  
  
In my short time with them, they've really developed both as students and as
people and workers in the gym more, have really helped establish -- hopefully
down the road, when people talk about Rutgers basketball, and hopefully people
will be proud when they talk about that, it will have started with Deshawn and
Mike and Candido and Corey, building a core that's built on guys defending and
guys being tough and guys coming to Rutgers.  
  
And Mike wanted to be at Rutgers, and very much appreciate that he stayed on
with me during the transition and very much appreciate his hard work. And he's
a little symbolic of what we're trying to do.  
  
We're trying to get kids to overachieve, kids to graduate, kids that want to
stay close to home and play basketball here and have a chance to play in these
kind of venues.  
  
And Mike certainly will be symbolic of that for us moving forward.  
  
Q. Does it give you guys more added pressure knowing that the conference
tournament is here at MSG?  
COACH PIKIELL: You know, I love the fact that we have a tremendous alumni
base. People are excited about it. People are calling me about the tournament
now.  
  
We didn't get that same buzz last year maybe in the past because the
tournament has been held way away from here. So I'm kind of excited about
that.  
  
Everyone expects teams to win and play well in the tournament. And so it's
just regular pressure that you have every night that you go out there. But I'm
excited because I think this venue is terrific and it's terrific for our
league.  
  
Again, we can move this league around and show people what great basketball
and great coaching. We've just added three great coaches to the league. It's
just getting better and better. And people on this stage will be able to see
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Purdue head coach Matt Painter.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously we had a really good summer this year. I think it's
probably the one thing for us that was great. Losing such a quality player in
Caleb Swanigan, for us to be able to represent the U.S.A. in the World
University Games and get a lot of practices in and play a lot of quality
opponents in Taiwan, I think, has really helped us as practice has started.  
  
So obviously looking forward to the season. I think we have a lot of guys that
can really shoot the basketball and play and have a lot of experience.  
  
And I think it's been very beneficial to have a lot of big guys. But with that
being said, I think Isaac Haas has been a guy that's never been the go-to guy
for us down low since we've had A.J. Hammons, we've had Caleb Swanigan. And I
think for him to have a breakout year for us this year would really help, to
go along with a versatile all-conference guy like Vince Edwards, a guy like
Dakota Mathias, who's to me an all-conference player with his value on both
ends of the court.  
  
And then the leadership of P.J. Thompson, with the best assist-to-turnover
ratio in the history of our school. So it's a great place to start.  
  
Carsen Edwards played on two U.S.A. teams this summer and had a lot of
experience there. Ryan Cline started for us last year. And we've had some guys
that give us depth, freshmen, and a couple of experienced guys that really
played well on our trip.  
  
So we're excited for the season. And I think our ability to shoot is probably
the number one thing that jumps out. But we're going to have to be able to
compete on both ends if we're going to be in a good position at the end of
February.  
  
Q. Why were you such an advocate for the protected in-state rivalries,
beyond what it means for Purdue, I guess what it means for the conference
overall?  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously when it comes to rivalry you're thinking about
yourself. Do I think it's good for our conference? Yes. But I think it's more
beneficial to Indiana and Purdue when I'm thinking about that and our fans.  
  
The fans want to see that in our state. Both schools want to see that. Our
players want to see it. It's a long list of people that it benefits in the
state of Indiana.  
  
But I think within conferences, I think rivalries like that that have been
going on for a long time, I think those are very good, not just our rivalry
but Michigan-Michigan State, and some other people.  
  
And so it's just one of those things where when you see your fans and they
talk about it, it makes no sense to them why you're not playing twice a year.
And you can sit there and talk about an unbalanced schedule, you can talk
about 14 teams. That doesn't make sense to them.  
  
They just want to see Indiana and Purdue play at least twice a year and
hopefully connect in the Big Ten Tournament. Because I think we share -- I
think Purdue people share the same thoughts about that as Indiana people do.  
  
We finally found something we agreed upon. So hopefully that's the case and we
can continue to do that here on out.  
  
Q. You mentioned how the rivalries, a lot of it you think a little
selfishly how that benefits. What about coming here? You spent a lot of time
at Purdue and a lot of time playing Big Ten Tournaments in the Midwest. What
does it mean to Purdue and you to come here?  
COACH PAINTER: I think for us the Big Ten originally is a Midwestern league
and now it's not. We moved with the additions of other schools on the East
Coast and you've got to come here.  
  
You just can't have people in your league and the only time you come here is
when you play at Maryland or at Rutgers or at Penn State.  
  
So I was playing when Penn State joined the Big Ten. You have to be able to be
visible. And obviously being able to come here and play the tournament here is
the right thing to do. It's the right thing for those schools, but it's also
the right thing for our conference. We're excited about it.  
  
And the ability to play in venues such as this, it was pretty cool. Our guys
get excited about -- they don't take a step back and say, hey, I wish I was in
Indy or I wish I was in Chicago. They get excited about playing. We were
excited about playing last year. It's a basketball game.  
  
We don't set the rules but we go by them. But I do think it's the right thing
to do.  
  
Q. It goes back a little ways, but you had experience at Southern
Illinois where you had the week off in between the conference tournament and
then the NCAA Tournament. With the Big Ten making the change this year, your
thoughts on just the difference between those two?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, obviously it's something you have to adjust to. But I
don't think it's anything huge. It's not a huge adjustment. Obviously you're
going to have that week off and hopefully it's that week off where you feel
comfortable about getting into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Obviously when you have -- the week off more at that level, at Southern
Illinois we went sixth straight years, counting Coach Weber's two years and my
one year as head coach and then Chris Lowery's was the head coach for three
years. When you look at that and you're helping build a program as an
assistant, people don't realize those six years they got five at-larges.  
  
So you wait in that week to see, are we getting in? And if you feel good about
it and you're right there on the bubble you still get nervous as teams start
to get beat and everything.  
  
I think that's probably the only thing that's really different. People always
talk about that week. But it's basketball. You recruit these guys and they
play a lot of basketball.  
  
They'll play three games in one day. And so like we never play three games in
one day anymore. And so like they're not the same quality of games that
they're playing in college. But it's still these guys grow up playing. They
play a lot of games.  
  
For us to be able to condense some things and be able to finish our season a
week earlier, I don't think it's that big a deal. It's something we had to do
to get the venue. So sometimes you have to do some things necessary and play
some games in December. But to me it's just a basketball game; it's not that
big a deal.  
  
Q. You have four seniors here. Just what do you think the value of that
experience is going to be come this season?  
COACH PAINTER: I think we have -- people always talk about experience, but I
think what's more important than that is the experience of having success
together. That's more important. A lot of people say, hey, we have a bunch of
seniors. But, yeah, have you won with them? We've gotten third in our league
their freshman and sophomore year. And obviously last year we were able to win
the league.  
  
So they've had a lot of success together. And I think that's more important
than anything. And so we're excited about playing this season, but we also
know we lost a really good player, and he brought a lot of mental and physical
toughness to our team.  
  
I think those guys are going to be able to have to those qualities for us to
be successful. And I think we have a great non-conference schedule to go along
with playing at Maryland and Northwestern in December.  
  
So it's going to be a challenge. When you have those types of challenges, you
know, you would much rather have experienced players, especially talented ones
like we have.  
  
Q. Through your basketball experiences have you seen foreign tours make
a difference with teams? And do you ever worry that it might tire you out
eventually as you go on?  
COACH PAINTER: I think the foreign tours that everybody traditionally goes on
are the 10 practices, then you play four or five games. The thing that I
really like about those trips is the bonding, the guys being together. I like
that piece of it.  
  
I like the educational piece of it. You go to Italy. You go to Spain. I think
that's good. But then the competition at that time is not great. A lot of
people -- a lot of us go on those trips in early August and it just isn't.  
  
So that's what's missing out of the equation. You would rather have -- you
have 10 practices -- I think what's good about it is your incoming guys now
have a little bit of experience of being around the coaching staff, the
terminology, the system. And so now when they do start, now the end of
September, they've got a little bit of a head start.  
  
Sure they have two hours a week and those workouts and that's really not that
much, but I think it really benefits. I don't think it wears you out. Guys
play year-round, whether they're with you or not with you, especially you get
guys -- I always say about the Big Ten, it's one of the best conferences in
America. If you're able to get a scholarship there and you're able to work
towards being a starter and you have a chance to be all-conference, you should
start thinking about being a pro.  
  
And a pro works on his game. A pro puts a lot of time in, and a pro is
normally a 12-month guy. So those are the things that you're really looking
for.  
  
In terms of burning out -- the thing we were worried about our trip this year
was different because you represent your country. So you don't have those
limitations. You can practice as much as you want. So we're getting 25 to 30
practices, eight real games, two exhibitions -- which we played Canada, which
was a good team.  
  
Then we had one scrimmage versus Norway. We had 11 games, 30 practices this
summer. And so that's different than the traditional one that we did the year
before where we had the 10 practices and we went overseas and we didn't play
great competition.  
  
But we all try to play the best competition we can on those trips. It's just
really hard to do that. I don't believe in that. I don't believe in guys
getting worn out. Even though I didn't practice longer than two hours in any
of my stuff because that was my thinking in my mind, like, man, there's no way
we're going to go and try to win this gold medal and that's going to be our
key goal when we get judged on what we do in March.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up now is Indiana head coach Archie Miller.  
  
COACH MILLER: Great to be part of the inaugural MSG, Big Ten Tournament
season. Very excited to get the season kicked off and underway at Indiana. We
obviously have a lot of work to do in trying to instill what we're doing every
day. It's a lot different for everybody.  
  
But at the same time we've had a great response from the returning group, from
day one, and that has continued all the way through our last practice.  
  
And just trying to keep building, having great perspective on it's going to
take time to teach and can't really be in a rush to get somewhere when you're
not ready. So we're focusing in on the day. I like our group and looking
forward, as the weeks progress, getting to the games.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of success keeping your 2017 recruiting class
together, had a lot of success in 2018 already, can you just talk about the
message you gave the guys in 2017 that stay committed and what your message is
to the guys in 2018 and how important this class is in 2018 to build?  
COACH MILLER: Sure. Our 2017 class that was recruited by Coach Crean's staff
is a tremendous group of kids. They really are a great group.  
  
And as you get ready to get started and you're unsure on who is who or what's
what in your own program, the one thing you want to try to do is keep
everything intact for as long as you can and inevitably you'll run into some
speed bumps. We were fortunate that the three guys in the spring loved
Indiana, the university. There was a purpose for them all going to IU. It
wasn't just a basketball decision or coaching staff decision, all three of
them were really bought into the university, they got locked in obviously to
the tradition and the fan base, and they fell in love with it.  
  
And it's a credit to them and their families and also the great job that Coach
Crean and his staff did in terms of their sell.  
  
We had to recreate their vision on how we play and how did they fit. And we
took some time on all that. And very thankful that their families and the kids
all joined us. I think they're all going to be a big part of the future as
time goes.  
  
Moving into the future and just recruiting for us, I think I said it for us,
day one, recruiting at Indiana starts and stops with the state and it kind of
moves itself out. And I operate or we've always operated that distance from
home is a great factor in deciding.  
  
And there's unbelievable players within a three- four-hour radius of IU. Once
we get them to campus the place sells itself. It's an unbelievable place to
represent.  
  
So I think as time goes forward we'll continue to stay with that philosophy
and trying to get guys that can do what we're asking them to do and that can
play for our coaching staff and fit in our style.  
  
Q. You inherited four scholarship seniors. Does that make the job a
little bit easier for a first-year coach?  
COACH MILLER: I think you hope so. I think the older you are in many ways you
at least have some guys that have been in college basketball that have played
in big games -- Robert, Collin, Juwan, in particular -- those three guys,
being seniors and juniors have played in big games. They've won big games. So
you know they've been there.  
  
But at the same time, you know, they're learning the same as our freshmen. And
that's the unfortunate thing, when you take over you start from scratch, that
you wish your older guys obviously were the guys that were helping run the
younger guys, that's how it always should be.  
  
But in this case everybody's on the run. So we have a lot of thinking going on
right now. So we're probably not seeing the best out of all of our players,
whether they're older or younger.  
  
But through the offseason, through our early fall and through, whatever, 14
practices right now, I can't say a bad word about not one guy, but in
particular the senior class has done a great job. They really are about the
right things. I think you can generally see those guys wanting to go out in a
positive way. They've been there, endured a lot.  
  
My job is to push them. And at the same time my job is to help them kind of
get to the end and feel good about themselves and their career.  
  
Q. Just to finally get that IU/Purdue rivalry protected, obviously it's
your first year with the program, but what that's going to mean for you and
the state going forward?  
COACH MILLER: Very early on as I got the job, I don't know if it was on the
recruiting circuit right away, on our couple of weekends or Big Ten meetings
when I first got there, Matt really came to me and talked to me about it. And
I felt that he felt it was very, very important for Purdue and Indiana.  
  
He also felt, more importantly, representing the Big Ten for as long as he
has, it's great for the Big Ten. As I got the chance to kind of figure it out
myself and look at our administration and their feelings, it's a great thing
for the Big Ten. It's a great thing for college basketball when you have two
programs that have obviously had great traditions.  
  
Matt is as well regarded in college basketball as any college basketball
coach. And to get started to be on the forefront a couple times a year is
unbelievable for the state but it's great for college basketball and in
particular it puts the Big Ten in a good light.  
  
Q. Wonder as you sit up here and get ready for the Big Ten and being a
head coach in the Big Ten, can you reflect at all emotionally what this might
mean to you as you've gone through your coaching career and you've been in the
Midwest, but what it means to sit up there right now to be a Big Ten coach and
getting ready for your first season with Indiana?  
COACH MILLER: Yeah, I think you try to take a step back and try to reflect and
think big picture on how far you've come and how you got here, really, to be
honest with you. How am I sitting here? And as much as I sit here in awe about
the opportunity to represent Indiana and all the great things that comes with
that program. But to be a part of the league with an amazing stable of coaches
it's incredibly daunting.  
  
But you think about how you got here. And the University of Dayton, where I
came from, was an incredible place with incredible people who allowed me to
flourish and go through the ups and downs. And we were able to create some
unbelievable moments for our program and school there.  
  
I feel very confident that as I sit here, you know, I think I know what we do
works. I believe in what we do. I think it's going to take some time, some ups
and downs like every person, but just can't deviate from it. So I'm excited.  
  
At the same time I know I'm in an unbelievable league with tremendous coaches
and players. And I'm going to have to figure out how our stuff works within
this conference as time goes by. But at your disposal is Assembly Hall. At
your disposal is one of the great fan bases in college basketball.  
  
I think when you have that behind you as a driving force, that's something
that obviously puts you in a position to be successful. And to me that's one
of the reasons that I took the job, it's one of the reasons I wanted to be
here was to be a part of something that's that big.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our first coach up this morning is Nebraska head coach Tim
Miles.  
  
COACH MILES: They always have me early. I feel like I'm the "Good Morning
Vietnam" guy. But I love following the Commissioner. You know a guy is highly
intelligent when he can say that much and say that little. So, good luck
writing all that stuff, folks.  
  
We're picked 13th by most of you in this room and some others, and that's
fine. I think we're going to outperform that. I would expect we do. I like our
guys. Should be a fun year. The Big Ten has obviously got some elite teams at
the top. I think Minnesota is really good. I think Michigan State is elite.  
  
I think there's a lot of good teams. Iowa is going to be much better. But I
think it feels like when you get 3 through 12 or 13, feels like the NFL.
You've got extremely successful coaches, well-resourced programs. You've got
teams that are prepared. You've got teams that, you know, if you get injured
you're dead. If you get on a roll you could be real good.  
  
But it certainly feels like what you see in NFL season where one team out of
nowhere is all of a sudden in the playoffs and making a run, and there
certainly are those teams that are steadfast, but on any given year something
good can happen.  
  
So, we're excited to make that work for the Huskers is what I'm trying to say.
So with that, are there any questions?  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on the league going to a 20-game schedule and how
it's going to affect you guys going forward?  
COACH MILES: Originally I didn't love the 20-game schedule, especially with
the in-state protected rivalries. It felt like -- almost felt like -- because
there were some -- felt like a tier. Like we've got these guys that are
traditional powers. And we're going to make sure we protect them. But I know
that's not the case.  
  
But as we get more into it, I think playing valuable games and more valuable
games and consistent teams is really good for us. I think it's probably
overall very good for the league.  
  
Will it get us another team or so into the NCAA Tournament, which would be the
goal? I think that just depends on anything.  
  
I think factors, anytime you play high-level games -- the Huskers have played
as many high-level games as anybody in the regular season in the last two
seasons, and I think we played 21 two years ago and 20 last year or whatever
top 100 teams, and I think only Michigan State has played more.  
  
But when you look at that, we don't ever want for much when it comes to
playing an ambitious schedule. So we're always going to play that way. I'm
excited about whether it be a 20-game schedule or an 18-game schedule, the Big
Ten is what I grew up in, and it's an elite league and certainly one of the
best, whether it be in March or January.  
  
Q. You went through quite a 20 -- 12 month as far as people leaving,
people coming. Did you get any cohesive reason for why all that happened to
you? Was there any one kind of reason that you heard from these kids who got
out or what?  
COACH MILES: That's a very good question. What's interesting about it is this
team is probably more cohesive than any team I've had now in about three or
four years, what's left. And so, one, no one likes losing. There's no doubt
about it.  
  
When you're struggling, you know, kids don't want to be part of losing, even
kids who start 67 out of 69 games. You understand that. And so young people
get frustrated. There's no question about that.  
  
One interesting thing, I think, that I had four kids in my office last year
before we played a game that asked me about their position. And this year I've
had zero ask me about their position.  
  
And so I think that that may tell you a couple of things. One, I need to start
saying we play position-less basketball, but, yes, you're guarding the center
on the other team, the position-less center, the big tall guy, the Isaac Haas
who's 7'9", 280, and darn good at sales, by the way. I think he just sold me
something on the bus on the way here. He's going to be a successful dude.  
  
When you look at that, when people get all caught up in their role and it
becomes this kind of rumination about what about me, things get tough. And
usually that hurts the team.  
  
And so you get young people that are going to leave because they're more
concerned about their well-being than they are the condition of the program.  
  
That's the way it is in business, in life. That's why you have divorce. That's
why you have people that leave businesses, and that's what happens to
basketball teams, too.  
  
Q. You mentioned cohesion. When did you get a sense that this team sort
of developed that, at what point during the summer, I guess, what indications
did you gather from the group that it's going to be pretty tight knit?  
COACH MILES: You know, last spring, and Shawn was right with us and our staff.
So we have two guys that are starters that transferred out that were part of a
coveted recruiting class. And all heck is breaking loose. That's to put it as
mildly as I can.  
  
All of a sudden Shawn is my office, Shawn Eichorst is the athletic director in
my office, and Kenya walks in and we're going to lose another starter. There's
rumors out there, this coach called us to say he's hearing this and that. And
you really feel like you see one of those movies with -- "Too Big to Fail" or
whatever it might be, you feel you're in the room with the Wall Street bankers
saying this can't be happening.  
  
And more than anything I think that galvanized us, going through those moments
together, figuring out, all right, who is really in here and why are you in?
And who is out?  
  
And there's nothing wrong with being out. There's very few things in life you
get where they say you've got four years to do it. You have four years to be
married or you have four years to drive a car.  
  
But college basketball you've got four years to play college basketball. So
you've got to get it right. It's got to go right for you. So kids are going to
leave if it's not right. And it has to be right to their taste palate and
their preference too. Because there aren't many things in life that are like a
college basketball career.  
  
I don't mind if they leave. I think then with some other feeling that, oh boy,
what's going on with the Huskers? This is a bad deal. It actually just made us
stronger and better. That's why I really liked this team. I think there's more
cohesiveness. We're a stronger team. I think we've got plenty of talent, too.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I really like this team. I say that all the time. But I
really mean it. It's the deepest team we've ever had. We had an opportunity
this summer to practice 10 extra times and travel overseas and play four
games, assimilate our younger players -- Luka Garza and Jack Nunge and Connor
McCaffery into the lineup. I think that puts us in the place where with the
experience we have coming back, our young guys getting ready we can absorb the
loss of the Big Ten's leading scorer in Peter Jok.  
  
Q. You just mentioned having to replace a guy like Peter Jok, and seems
like last year you had a lot of guys that helped you bridge that transition
when he was injured. What is that like guiding that when you rely on a guy
like that for so long, he does so many great things and you have to have guys
ready to take over when he leaves. How do you bridge that sort of transition
during the latter part of the season and into this year?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think what happened was it really manifested itself in the
beginning of the season. We were really relying on Pete. I remember the
Memphis game, Pete goes for 42.  
  
We lose 100-92. The message was if we don't start playing defense we're going
to struggle to win. And if we don't give him some help, then we're not going
to win either, not in this league.  
  
So we started playing better defense. Others started stepping up. You knew it
was going to happen with Tyler Cook. You knew it was going to happen with
Bohannon. But it was Nicholas Baer, Cordell Pemsl, Isaiah Moss, and the
critical thing there is with Pete gone and having already played four games
overseas, those individuals have now stepped into new rolls as well,
particularly Isaiah Moss.  
  
He's a guy that's incredibly talented, had phenomenal games last year. There
were times when I didn't play him down the stretch. I played Peter Jok and
Nicholas Baer.  
  
But this year it's going to be his opportunity to shine. And you know he's
playing really well. Played really well over the summer. Shot close to 70
percent for the trip, shooting mostly 3s.  
  
Shot well over 50 percent from 3 on the trip. So there's a guy who is now in
his third year of college that's, I think, ready to step up and fill that
role.  
  
Q. What did Jordan Bohannon's play mean for your team last year and what
are you expecting from him this year?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It's interesting, because obviously the position was open
upon the departure of Mike Gesell. It was either going to go to Christian
Williams or Jordan Bohannon. The season started with Christian in the starting
lineup. He was playing really well. It ended up flipping with, Jordan in the
starting lineup. Christian coming off the bench. So the position was well
handled. Both are dramatically different. But I think what we had in that
position with Jordan was a legitimate scoring option. He could make eight 3s,
like he did against Maryland. He could go for a big night.  
  
But the other thing he did was make big shots late in close games. Did it
against Michigan. Did it a number of times. He has the ability to hit those
dagger 3s and those big shots late.  
  
So that gives you a weapon. Especially when you're trying to get the ball
inside to Cordell Pemsl or Tyler Cook. And Ryan Kriener this year, Luka Garza
and Jack Nunge, we have legitimate low-post scoring threats. You have to
surround them with guys who can pass and guys who can make threes. So you have
Jordan Bohannon, Isaiah Moss and Nicholas Baer, Brady Ellingson. I think we
have that.  
  
Q. You've got Tyler and Jordan here. They both mentioned you want them
to be leaders this year. Why them? And what have they shown in practice so far
to step into those roles?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, they're going to be starters. I think you want
leadership out of your starting lineup. Jordan, of course, is the point guard.
You want leadership out of that position.  
  
And you just want guys that establish themselves as two of the better players
in our league to kind of take that next step. They were all-rookie players,
and you hope eventually they become all-league players.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on the 20-game schedule and, I guess, specifically
the protected in-state and regional rivalries, and why or why not that's a
good thing for the conference and college basketball at large?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think in terms of the rivalries, I think that's for the
fans in many respects, it creates interest in that state, television interest.
So I think it stands to reason, when you have traditional rival, you play
those teams. I think it's good that our league recognized that and has
provided those opportunities.  
  
The 20-league schedule, I think, is a matter of just sort of what you have to
do. I think the analytics will tell you that playing 20 league games will
provide a greater strength of schedule for all of us.  
  
Typically, the numbers tell you it gets one more team in per year, per
conference. And we all want that. Certainly for us, last year we were First
Four out. I think we were the first team out. So by playing two more league
games, there's so many positives there. I think, TV, once -- great TV
matchups, the fans want it. But ultimately, I think it helps your strength of
schedule, your RPI, and I think it plays well with the committee.  
  
Q. You were talking about regionalization of part of the rationale for
that. What has ever come up when the coaches have talked about making the Big
Ten into two divisions the way football is? Has that ever been a consideration
in trying to foster a regional feel in this conference that's so sprawling
now?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think that's a legitimate question, but I have to be honest
with you, we really didn't talk about divisions. It makes sense when you talk
about certainly my previous answer, but that's not something that really had
any legs in terms of the conversation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now up is Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo.  
  
COACH IZZO: It's great to be here in New York. I mean, this is the mecca of
basketball. It always has been. And I think it always will be. So that's
pretty exciting and it's good to be here with a good team coming back.  
  
Last year we went through some growing pains with those freshmen. Gave me
maybe a different perspective and appreciation for the job John Calipari has
done with his team year after year, because we played four freshmen a lot.
Started three freshmen, sometimes four.  
  
And that's a unique experience. But we kind of found our way through the
season, kind of grew as a team, fought through some injuries, and then got a
Christmas present in April when Miles, shockingly to me, decided to come back.  
  
So you add those four sophomores with two guys that were hurt, Schilling and
Ben Carter. So we have some size now. The addition of a 6'8" and 6'11" guy in
Xavier Tillman and Jaren Jackson has made a different kind of practice.  
  
Last year Nick Ward could go against a 6'5" walk-on and score whenever he
wanted. This year it's been a little bit different. That's been good.  
  
Surprises: I think getting Kenny Goins, Matt McQuaid back after they missed
seven, eight months last summer and did not have very good sophomore seasons,
they've had great spring summers and fall. And Cassius Winston, he's kind of
gotten to the shape he needed to get in, and has really improved his defense,
has really improved his offensive shooting. Which I guess he always had, just
never utilized. But he's been a pleasant surprise.  
  
And of course, being the senior that is maybe the best leader I've ever had,
him and Cleaves, he's just been a special player in a lot of ways that keeps
this team, the glue together.  
  
And Miles is I think somebody special for all college basketball, because he's
-- I call him my blue-collar star. And he's got the humility and the
humbleness of an everyday player and the skills of a very, very good player.  
  
So we are expecting big things out of this team. But there's a lot of good
teams in this league this year.  
  
Q. What would you say to the fans who have maybe lost faith in this
sport after everything that's happening with the FBI investigation?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think the biggest thing -- and not knowing everything
that's gone on -- I mean what you read is -- no insult to you guys -- it isn't
always 100 percent true. And what you see, what you hear, as it comes out,
could be worse.  
  
But I think like every walk of life right now -- Jud Heathcote, rest his soul,
used to always tell me about the 10 percent rule. There's going to be 10
percent problems in every profession, whether it be coaching, whether it be in
business, whether it be writers. I guess you could go to policemen to priests
nowadays to everybody, there's a 10 percent.  
  
So I wouldn't paint the brush over college basketball or football or
athletics. But I do think we need to shore up some things, to be honest with
you. I think there's just getting to be too many people involved with these
kids in general where their circle used to be very tight. In the last 15 years
the circle has grown. In the Twitter era the circle has exploded. I'm not sure
that's good for them or good for us or good for basketball.  
  
Q. Given how well such a young team did last year, not just with Miles,
but with Josh and Cash and Nick, do your personal expectations change this
year, given getting to the second round of the NCAA Tournament last year, do
they change now that they're a year older?  
COACH IZZO: Well, my expectations change enormously, number one, just having
some depth and some size makes a difference.  
  
But I wouldn't consider last year a success. I mean, not in the standards of,
I think, of what we built but considering -- I guess we could give us a
passing grade, not a Michigan State grade by any means, as far as I'm
concerned.  
  
We still lost some games I thought we could have won. And some of that falls
on me. Having to adjust to some things that I didn't.  
  
This year the biggest adjustments from a coaching staff is going to be
figuring out how to put all these players together. Because I have some depth.
I have more than I've had back to like '05 or '09 when I had a lot of depth.  
  
And both those years were good years. Depth can be helpful, especially this
day and age where it seems like more guys are getting hurt. But expectations
should be strong from every Spartan fan, our coaches and our players.  
  
But keeping a realism that in this league, there's so many good coaches in
this league -- and I look at -- I heard we were picked to win it. But I heard
there were like five teams picked second. And it just goes to show what this
league has, and that's parity.  
  
And I think last year we had it maybe at the bottom. Two years ago we had
tremendous strength at the top three or four.  
  
And I think this year we're going to have strength at the top six, seven or
eight, and the bottom is going to be a lot better than it's been. So it should
be a great year for Big Ten basketball.  
  
Q. You guys usually played such a good non-conference schedule. Do you
have any reluctance to go along with the new 20-game conference slate?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I had reluctance when it went to 18, to be honest with
you. And then it's kind of worked out. I was in favor of it going to 20
because I think everybody, I think now the fans, television, even the coaches,
you want to play the best people.  
  
Does it give us less of a chance to play a couple of teams? Maybe. But I've
also been a big fan of the truest champion you could have, and I think that
when you're only playing 16 and an 18, sometimes the schedule determines some
of the championships over the performance on the court.  
  
This gives us the better chance to have the performance on the court, do it.
We're going to get better games. How we fit it all in, you know, that's Jim
and Mark's job. We're just going to play the games. I hope we can fit it in
right to make it good. But I think 20 games is going to be great.  
  
Q. I know you've wanted it for a while now. Protecting that rivalry with
Michigan, how important is that to you that that's going to be a thing moving
forward?  
COACH IZZO: We can make a big deal of Michigan/Michigan State. Every rivalry
in sports is important.  
  
I mean, it's a rivalry, usually, because there's some proximity, would be one
reason, you know, whether it be Indiana/Purdue, whether the USC/UCLA,
Oklahoma/Oklahoma State, all the different rivalries, North Carolina/Duke. And
second, both teams have to be good. And if both teams are good, rivalries have
more meaning.  
  
It's no fun when you go to the water cooler and you're winning one out of 10
games, but it's fun if every other year your team is winning. Not as much fun
for the coaches, but it's a lot more fun for the people.  
  
So I think preserving rivalries that people have grown up on in this changing
world was a very good move by the Big Ten. And I think it's going to benefit a
lot of us and hopefully it will catch fire around the country. If it hasn't,
where all those rivalries should be protected, in my humble opinion.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Chris Holtmann.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Great to be here, great to be with everybody. It has certainly
been an exciting and whirlwind last few months. This is a terrific time of
year for all of us as coaches. I'm sure you've heard that echoed. It's an
exciting time.  
  
I feel very grateful to be coaching the group we're coaching led by some
outstanding upperclassmen. And we're excited to get started. Cannot wait to
get started.  
  
I think this league -- I left a league of outstanding coaches. And one of the
things I know for certain, with this league, is it has some incredible
coaching and terrific talent, terrific players. This league has led attendance
in the nation, the last 41 years, and I think that speaks to the quality of
play and the excitement in the Big Ten. Can't wait to get started and looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the experience you take away from being in
the Big East with Butler and bringing it to Ohio State?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Sure. Well, obviously got great respect for the Big East. It's
an outstanding league. I think it's proven that over time in the new formation
of that league.  
  
I will say I have not had the best success in the Big East Tournament here. So
maybe I've got to change the leagues to see if I can change that dynamic a
little bit there.  
  
But I think anytime you're a part of a power league, it prepares you for what
is coming. And this is -- we were talking to a couple of coaches here as we're
passing through the halls here, there are no easy nights, as is the case in
most leagues, but certainly in the Big Ten, there are no easy nights.  
  
And I think our guys understand that having been through what we've been
through the last couple of years.  
  
Q. You were a coach in the Big East at the time when the Big Ten
negotiated to have their conference tournament here. Were Big East coaches
concerned about the presence of the Big Ten in their building? Should they
be?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Well, it certainly came up. And I'm not sure we had a
tremendous -- we didn't have a tremendous role in that process, but it
certainly came up. I think at that time what we were concerned about was we
didn't want the dates to change for our league, for the Big East.  
  
I think that was the biggest concern there. I think this is certainly a big
enough city. It's one of the most iconic venues in all of sports. And I think
to play here, this city can certainly handle both leagues.  
  
And I expect our conference tournament here will be an outstanding one. And I
think our fan base is really going to enjoy coming to this city and playing.  
  
Q. Columbus has a tremendous fan base in Ohio State. And the
uncomfortable of expectations for you this year, particularly what can help
also having the experience of being in the Big East and understanding the
recruiting base that you possibly can get here?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Can you repeat that question?  
  
Q. First, the uncomfortable expectations of Big Ten fans particular at
Ohio State, they want something very quickly. But also being in the Big East,
knowing that the expectation of recruiting that you know already that can be
attracted to the Big Ten?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah, we'll want to recruit certainly nationally, but this
area obviously, our home state is really important to us as well in
recruiting. That's going to be paramount for us.  
  
But I think anytime -- listen, we all have expectations. And as we talked to
our players, we're defining what we're going to be on a day-to-day basis.  
  
So we don't concern ourselves really with what people expect of us right now,
good or bad. We think we're in control of defining that on a day-to-day basis.
And that's our goal.  
  
I'm excited to be at a place that wants to be really good and wants to be
really good in basketball. And that's exciting for me.  
  
Q. You're a couple weeks in now to the preseason, you've talked about
trying to get to know your team. Where do you think you are in that process,
and how much more settled do you feel on guys and having a feel for them than
maybe you did when you started the preseason?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We're getting there. I think we're slowly but surely getting
there. They're getting a chance to know us. It's a little bit unique because
during the summer, when you typically have your team and have a chance to work
out with your full team, we weren't able to do that, because we had, at that
time, seven or eight healthy guys.  
  
So it's been a little bit unique in that we've gotten to know each other
quicker here. And I've started earlier this year than any other year as a head
coach for that reason just to have a chance to spend more time with our guys.  
  
But as I said, Jae'Sean Tate is here, Kam Williams is here, Keita Bates-Diop.
Those are guys that have been part of our program for a number of years. Coach
Matta and his staff did an outstanding job recruiting impressive people, and
I'm excited about this group, and I'm excited about the fact that those three
are going to be leading this group.  
  
Q. You've talked about the point guard position. And who do you see and
how far along is maybe Jae'Sean coming in playing that point and maybe getting
some relief to C.J., and who else might factor in that position for you this
season?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think it's an evolving position that we continue to kind of
learn about. It's going to be really -- as is our back court. We're obviously
really thin in the back court. I think C.J. has done some really good things
in practice.  
  
I felt really good about his growth in this short amount of time. And I'm
excited about what he can grow into. He had a limited role last year. But he's
going to need to be really good for us.  
  
JT, Jae'Sean, he's been learning what we expect from that position. He's never
played it before. He's going to need to play it this year and he's going to
need to play it effectively for us. I think he'll slide more on the perimeter
than he has maybe at any point in his career.  
  
And Andrew Dakich will be asked to help as well in that. And he's obviously
got experience playing. And we brought him in with the expectation that he's
going to have to give us some depth at that position. He's elevated our
competitiveness in practice, which has been a good thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard.  
  
COACH GARD: I'm not sure on the numbers, this is year three -- I'll check out
some other stats. Obviously off to a really good start.  
  
We had two weeks in Australia and New Zealand in August. So our preseason got
a kick start and a head start. And now, 12 days into practice, just building
off of that, what we learned in Australia and New Zealand. Got a great group
of young men that are working extremely hard, want to be good, very easy to
coach.  
  
So, just for us, knowing we have to replace a lot that graduated from last
year's team, it's been a process of working through youthful experience and
continue to grow and get better every day.  
  
So great culture. Like I said, terrific group to coach to this point. They're
really eager to learn and get better. And we're excited as we go through the
fall.  
  
Q. How will the 20-game conference schedule affect how you approach
future nonconference schedules and how you schedule games?  
COACH GARD: That's a good question. I think we're continuing to study it. I
think we -- obviously the schedule we've always had and built from a
nonconference standpoint has been extremely competitive. We're typically in an
exempt event. We're playing typically in both Challenges, both in the ACC
Challenge and the Gava Cup (phonetic) and home and home in our home state.  
  
We've got a pretty full plate, normally. And now you add two more conference
games, obviously, Power Five games. And you have to make a decision on what
you're going to substitute out.  
  
And the numbers, obviously, tell you that it's going to help RPI and help the
league and those things. So I think it's to be determined yet how each school
will go about that and how they will build their schedule. But from our
standpoint, strength of schedule has never been an issue and being tested and
being ready for what comes. Obviously the league now is going to come earlier
than normal, including this year.  
  
So I think it will be some trial and error of how you go through it. But it's
going to be great for the game, I know that. It will be maybe not -- put a
little more stress on the coaches a little faster, but I think our players are
excited about it. I know our fans will be excited about it. It will really
increase the quality and spread the quality out of the games you're going to
be playing obviously well into December.  
  
Q. Can you talk about one of the games you have on your schedule this
year when you guys are playing Temple?  
COACH GARD: Yes, that was a home-and-home that was done a few years ago. We
played Temple I think two or three years ago at our place and had to move the
return a few years down the road.  
  
So I'm excited to do that. I know our players will be, to be able to come to
Philadelphia and obviously Fran does a great job of coaching, always has.  
  
So it will be another one of -- you look at our schedule, from mid-November
all the way through the end of the first semester for us, by the time we
flipped the calendar to 2018 we'll be extremely tested and we'll know where we
are and where we need to go. And obviously the game with Temple will be one of
those pieces of that challenge.  
  
Q. Just wonder what sort of role you might have played with recruiting
D'Mitrik Trice and what sort of season you expect out of him this year?  
COACH GARD: I've known his family for a long time because I recruited his
older brother, maybe not long enough with Travis. But terrific family.
Obviously dad is a coach.  
  
Has all the blood lines to be a really good leader. And the one thing I always
liked about Meech, I have an affection for guys that play football and the
toughness and some other elements it brings, and really multi-sport athletes.
I'm a fan of it.  
  
And D'Mitrik being a high school quarterback, that leadership quality that
comes with that, I thought was really important. So for us it was -- we were
able to advance the relationship pretty quickly because we knew the family and
I trusted all the things that were involved with the family and how he was
brought up.  
  
So I'm expecting him to take another step in the leadership role. I thought he
did a really good job last year as a freshman of stepping in with an upper
classman-dominated team and figure out his role, and his role this year has
changed.  
  
He's in a leadership role. He's my point guard. He's doing a really good job
of that. And he does a really good job of trying to communicate and
understand. Part of being a leader is understanding what makes each teammate
tick. And they're all different. You have to approach every teammate a little
bit differently.  
  
And I think D'Mitrik's ability to communicate and develop relationships with
his teammates is what's jumped out. And he's improved himself as a player.
He's stronger. He's quicker. He's improved his skill set. His shooting is
better.  
  
So all those visible things are evident. But I think the areas where he'll
take the biggest jump and have the biggest impact will be off the court and in
the huddles and those type of things when the leadership quality that he
possesses kind of really shines.  
  
Q. You lost a lot, Ethan's left. He's a really, really good scorer
around the 10, can do all sorts of moves. Does it matter to you that he
doesn't shoot jumpers? And do you want him to shoot jumpers? Do you want him
to shoot more far away from the basket to help you out, because he'll have to
help out in different ways?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, the one -- one of his greatest qualities is that he
understands who he is. And he understands where his bread is buttered and what
he's the best at. Has he worked on his perimeter game? Yes. Has he tried to
improve that part? Yes. Is it essential for him to shoot from the perimeter
for us to have success? No.  
  
We'll be able to surround him and will surround him with a lot of very capable
players, maybe not experienced players right off the bat, but guys that are
going to give -- we're going to be a little more multi-dimensional. We'll have
a little bit of different look to us.  
  
I think he's improved his game. Physically, he's bigger. He's obviously
quicker, stronger. But I wouldn't say it's essential for him to have to shoot
the ball from the perimeter.  
  
He's got to continue to do what he does well and that's the one thing that I
appreciate, or one of the things I appreciate about him, is that he's blocked
out all the outside noise in terms of, well, why don't you shoot this or why
don't you -- he's been compared to other bigs that we've had in our program
over the years that shot a lot of 3s.  
  
And his strength, he understands what his strength is, that's around the rim,
and his quickness and size and how he's able to attack people and his
footwork, those things.  
  
His perimeter game has improved, but, again, he understands what makes him
really, really good and that's playing with two feet in the paint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Jim Delany](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24310)

### [Dan Weinberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34230)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We open with Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany this morning.
Delany is in his 29th year as commissioner of the Big Ten Conference. He's led
the Big Ten through significant periods of growth that have helped the
conference maintain its preeminent position as one of the Nation's leaders in
quality, providing quality academic and athletic experiences for young men and
women. Jim?  
  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Good morning. We're excited to be here in New York City
at the world's most famous arena, Madison Square Garden. We thought this would
be a unique opportunity for our players and our fans and our coaches. And our
coaches and administrators evaluated it, made some changes, and we're here
today. So I know in being with the coaches last night and seeing some of the
players today, it really is a very unique opportunity.  
  
College sports is thriving in New York City, a Gameday has been here. We've
got super Saturday for the third year coming up with the hockey basketball
doubleheader in later January. There are three college basketball tournaments
in the area, and obviously Disney's new deal with Altice signifies even more
college sports available in this unique and important city.  
  
We have slightly less than 100,000 Big Ten alums living in the area, slightly
less than a million in this corridor, so we'll be serving not only fans from
the midwest, but also many of our new fans and many of our legacy fans who
have moved into this very important corridor.  
  
In a short period of time, we've really been able to establish a presence out
here. We said we wanted to do it, but whether it's the pinstripe at Yankee
Stadium, variety of events with marketing partnerships at Madison Square
Garden or a variety of other tournaments. Last year we were in DC, this year
we're in New York. We've got offices here. We've got lots of reasons to come
and live, and it's what we wanted to do, it's what we thought we should do,
and I appreciate all of the collaboration with people throughout the Big Ten
to make these things possible.  
  
Basketball in the Big Ten is in great shape. Whether you look back one year,
five years or ten years. We've got three new coaches in the league with Brad
Underwood, Archie Miller, and Chris Holtmann. We welcome them. These are
successful coaches before they came here, and we expect them to have success
here as well.  
  
We've got a number of returning players on the first, second, and third teams,
and we do a great job of not only recruiting players but developing players.
In the last eight years we've had five national players of the year, Denzel
Valentine in '16, Frank Kaminsky in '15, Oladipo and Trey Burke in '13,
Draymond Green in '12, and Evan Turner in '10. So many of our players are able
to not only succeed academically but athletically, and in particular I think
these players indicate how you can rise to the very top of college basketball
by playing in the Big Ten. We've got quality and we've got parity. Seven
different teams have shared a Big Ten regular season championship in the last
15 years. Seven different teams have won the Big Ten men's tournament. For the
41st straight year we've led the country in attendance.  
  
Going back -- we're going back to Chicago and Indy. Back to Chicago in '19 and
'21, and Indy in '20 and '22. Looking out into the future, as noted earlier,
we've got a tremendous fan base in this region of the country. We will be
returning to the Midwest as noted, but we'll probably try to aspire to maybe
an 80/20 split between Midwestern venues and Eastern venues. So the great
majority will be out in the Midwest, but we'll be back here from time to time
to reflect where our schools are located as well as where our alumni live.  
  
Going back over the last decade, 13 of our 14 teams have made it to the NCAA
Tournament. All time, all 14 with Northwestern qualifying last year which was
a great story. All 14 of our schools have played in the NCAA Tournament. In
the last decade we've had seven teams in the Final Four, ten teams in the
Elite Eight and 28 teams in the Sweet Sixteen. The only conference to qualify
multiple teams into the Sweet Sixteen over the last decade. We've averaged
over six teams per year, 63 teams in ten years, winning 93 tournament games.  
  
This is amplified by television. This year '17-'18 will be the 11th
consecutive season where all games are nationally telecast. And with FOX
joining the Big Ten alignment of media partners, we'll have FOX, ESPN, BTN,
and CBS. People continue not only to attend our games but also to watch them.
Last year CBS was plus-18% year over year in ratings, and BTN was plus 10%.  
  
So we're very excited to have FOX in our partnerships in addition to their
joint venture with BTN. And they have had great success in the first six weeks
of college football, and we expect them to have great success going into
basketball.  
  
So we've got partners with big platforms, big promotions, and we're quite
proud of that.  
  
CBS will televise the semifinals and finals for our tournament, and that goes
all the way back. They've been doing this since 1998, and a new feature is
that BTN will telecast 10 of the 13 events. So they'll have a tremendous
presence here, not only on super Saturday, but also with our tournament.  
  
At this juncture, I'd like to bring up Dan Weinberg from CBS. Dan is point
person for CBS. Our relationship with them goes back to the early '90s, and as
noted, back to 1998 with our tournament. So at our football kickoff luncheon,
we brought up ESPN, BTN and FOX, and since CBS's relationship with us is
football -- excuse me, is basketball, I wanted to bring Dan up to say a few
words on behalf of this partnership. So welcome, and thank you.  
  
DAN WEINBERG: Hi everybody. Good morning. Thank you so much to the
commissioner. We're very, very appreciative to be part of the program today
for a short bit here. On behalf of all the men and women at CBS Sports, we are
extremely pleased and really proud to be continuing this longstanding
relationship with the Big Ten. It goes back almost three decades now.  
  
Big Ten basketball has been and continues to be an incredibly important anchor
for CBS Sports college basketball coverage for several generations. You all
know we eat and breathe college basketball at CBS Sports. It's part of our
DNA, and Big Ten basketball has been a corner Stone of that for a long, long
time now.  
  
Every year we enjoy telling the stories of the Big Ten student-athletes, the
Big Ten institutions, the conference as a whole. We relish the opportunity to
cover the league every year from November right on through the NCAA
Tournament, and as you mentioned, Jim, we're very proud of the fact that the
semifinals and the championship game of your conference tournament have only
had one home, CBS Sports, since its inception a couple decades ago.  
  
Overall, CBS Sports, we take a tremendous amount of pride in this partnership.
We value it a great deal. It is a priority for us, and we're pleased it will
be that way into the next decade. Thanks to you Commissioner Delany and also
to the team and league office led by Mark Rudner who we work with so closely
all the time. We look forward to many successful seasons of Big Ten basketball
on CBS Sports moving forward. We'll see you all on the road to the Final Four.  
  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Thank you. So I've completed my remarks, and I'll be
happy to answer any questions that you may have.  
  
Q. When did the idea of having the conference formally come to Madison
Square Garden?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: I can't give you a precise date, but I can tell you that
when Rutgers and Maryland, as new members, came into focus, it occurred to me
that we needed to be very proactive about developing a presence in the
corridor. It led us to make some decisions about locating an office here. It
made sense for us to push very hard for a BTN distribution.  
  
So the date is not clear to me, but it was one of maybe the most important of
many decisions that we wanted to make to live here not visit here. We moved --
it wasn't easy to move the schedules in the way we did, but we got
collaboration. Thanked our coaches last night for that. It was a little
challenging because Northwestern's facility is being renovated and with the
Super Bowl in Minneapolis, we lost some additional dates.  
  
So we got great cooperation from everybody, and we're very much looking
forward to being here.  
  
Q. I just wonder, as commissioner, when you look at the coaches
throughout the conference, what role do you feel you play, and what needs to
change to create more minority coaches and more opportunities for minority
coaches in the league?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, of course we've had minority coaches. We don't have
them on our roster now, but we have had over many decades. And the role we
play is a more general one both in the conference office as well as on our
campuses. Equity is important, opportunity is important, fairness is
important. So it's pretty much bred into everything we do.  
  
As you may know, we've had five or six people leave our office to run leagues,
Division I leagues, a couple women, a couple African-Americans, a couple of
Caucasians, and across our coaching, our ADs, our Presidents, as well as minor
sports, it's important. It's a meritocracy, and everybody should be provided
opportunity to compete. So I think it's in our DNA.  
  
How the actual search comes out is a local decision based on what the
institution needs and wants at the that time, and what the pool of candidates
is. But we're foursquare for opportunity, for diversity. You know, it's
something to talk about regularly at all levels of our governance.  
  
Q. 20-game conference schedule. What are the benefits of that, and what
were the challenges of making it happen?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, so we've been looking at basketball and took a
pretty hard look this year as we were navigating a shorter season, the same
number of games. We looked at the place of basketball, not only in the Big Ten
but nationally, and really came to a conclusion, which we talked with our
coaches, talked with our administrators, that we needed to control the number
of quality games. We felt we could add quality games in basketball. We felt we
could spread out the games a bit, and therefore there would be a couple games
in early December we thought we could experiment over time.  
  
In terms of making the presentation of Big Ten basketball even better. We've
sold out -- not sold out, but we've led the country for 41 years. We've had
pretty good television ratings. But we're also conscious of the fact that
college football has grown tremendously. Part of that, not all of that, but
part of that has been by increasing the quality of games going from 8 to 9.
The addition of the College Football Playoff. The addition of the major
intersectional, and some control on playing schools with fewer scholarships
and fewer resources.  
  
So we thought that taking the approach to college basketball, similar to the
one we did with college football, would help us lessen compression in January
and February with good planning, trying to capture some interest we have with
other games. We have an ACC challenge now, we have two additional games in
December, and albeit we'll lose two non-conference games. But we think in
general, people respond more to the conference game than the non-conference.  
  
We're also able, I think, to build on the historic rivalries. We have three
that are in the state, in Indiana and Purdue -- and Indiana-Purdue, Michigan-
Michigan State, Illinois-Northwestern. But also to build some regionalization.
If you look at the release, you can see that those three will play 100% of the
time. That regional rivals and there are four in the east, four in the west,
will play ten times in a 12-year period, and all others will play nine times
in a 12-year period. So we just thought playing against each other, more was
good, and good for the Big Ten, and good for college basketball generally.  
  
Q. With the F.B.I. investigation that came out a week or so ago, I'm
wondering what the Big Ten's reaction is to that? Is there anything as a
conference moving forward to alleviate some of those issues?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, we're all concerned, and we should be. We don't
know what we don't know. We sort of know what you know, what we read about in
the paper. We've had no contact with the government. We really don't have any
facts other than what we've read. I'm sure it will unfold and it we'll learn
more as things, as investigations become more public.  
  
I'm not shocked about this. This is the 10th, ninth or tenth intersection
between college basketball and the F.B.I. going back to 1950. Southern
District of New York uncovered a very wide ranging gambling scandal in 1950.
In 1960, same thing. And in the late '70s, a more narrow set of gambling
investigations, middle '80s again. Later '80s agents came into the scene.
Early 90's, gambling again. Later 90's gambling and agent-related
investigations out of Detroit. 2000 in Kansas City and 2017 back in the
Southern District of New York. So there have been at least nine intersections
between college basketball and the F.B.I. in my life, and I can remember, I
grew up across the river in New Jersey, and waking up as a 12-year-old and
seeing two individuals being taken out of their dormitory in handcuffs by the
F.B.I. for their engagement -- alleged engagement in gambling.  
  
So, we should all be concerned. We don't know what we don't know. Our coaches
will coach, and they will do the best they can to get students to class and
get them on the right path. But beyond that, the Big Ten does not have any
information that you otherwise don't have. Speculation probably doesn't
benefit anybody at this juncture.  
  
Q. Good morning. I know it's not in your conference, but it affects
college sports and it's related to a school that you have a close relationship
with. Any reaction of the NCAA's decision on North Carolina to essentially not
punish them for the academic issue?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Not really. I mean the story is the story. The NCAA
concluded that it didn't have jurisdiction. So no matter how much someone may
view the merits of those, those were not good practices that occurred there.
They were not good practices for students. They were not good practices for
the university or its athletes, they've taken a lot of collective action. And
the NCAA simply concluded they didn't have jurisdiction. So beyond that, I
can't really say much. I don't think it was a win or a loss. I think it was
NCAA has some limitations in terms of the applications of its by laws. And
listening to Commissioner Sankey, that's what I took away.  
  
Q. Getting back to the F.B.I. investigation. What are the things that
you would do to try to clean up college basketball right now?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, well, we've talked to our coaches. I've given them
Gene Smith's phone number, and encouraged them. I know he's encouraged them.
He'd like to hear from them. I think internally we'll have some discussions
and pass on our recommendations to the commission. I think President Emmert
put it well, half steps are not sufficient.  
  
There are obviously a number of things that could be done structurally, but
also one of the things that stands out to me is is that in the first
investigations it was external people working with players to fix games. In
the last three or four there's been more engagement on the agent side, the
advisor side, still some, perhaps gambling. And in these most recent cases,
there are people inside of our programs. That's a big difference between being
inside and outside.  
  
But different kinds of federal laws apply. There is an NCAA side to this a
Federal government side, and there is also a value side to this. So I think we
have to be very honest, once we know what's going on, to address it the best
we can. I don't have a list of five reforms I'd like to see. But I do think it
starts with abiding by the rules that we all agree to. You may disagree with
the rules and their methods for changing those both at the NCAA, some people
go to court. But until rules are changed, you abide by the rules, period.  
  
Q. To follow-up on that, do you see a conflict between the constitutions
right against self-incrimination, versus the NCAA's requirement to report?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: I hadn't thought about the right against -- one is a
criminal standard, the other is an administrative standard created by a
voluntary association. So I don't think there is any conflict. I've never
heard that argued at NCAA. You could belong to it, not belong to it. You could
subscribe to its rules or not. You could try to change its rules. In any
organization, whether it's private or public, you're expected to follow the
rules of the organization. I've never seen anyone challenge it under a Fifth
Amendment basis.  
  
Q. Can you discuss about having the conference championship tournament
games at Madison Square on the week before championship week?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, I mean, that was a known variable when the decision
was made. We had a lot of discussion. It's not where we've been in the 20 or
so years that we've had in the tournament. I know that the coaches had some
discussion about how they would use that last week. Most of them coached at
the mid-major level before coming here, and they've experienced that there. I
have as well when I was in the Ohio Valley Conference. So most people have had
some experience with it.  
  
I mean, with the two sides, you get more of an opportunity to rest, and on the
other hand you get more opportunity to maybe get a little rusty. So I think
each of them have had an experience. I think all of them have concluded that
they don't want to play a scrimmage or competition to my knowledge. So they'll
rest up a little bit. I know the way it will play out if we have a successful
tournament, they'll probably attribute it to playing well. If they probably
don't have it, they'll probably attribute it to the layoff.  
  
We won't know until it happens, but it happens for a good 10, 15 of the
conferences, and you still see teams playing well with the time off, but we'll
see what happens.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier an 80/20 potential split as far as for down the
road with tournaments. Are you thinking New York City or other strategic spots
on the east coast? And had there been other cities that have reached out?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, my thought would be that over time we'd be out here
a couple of times. Where we would go and when we would go is subject to
discussions. I don't have any preconceived notions. Obviously New York and
D.C. are really important venues, but there are other important venues, so
we'd be open to that. But we went to D.C. and New York first because we
thought those were the two best fits for us in the early stages.  
  
So what I wanted to signal as much as anything else is that it most of our
institutions and most of our fan base is in the Midwest, and we will be there
a good bit, but we'll also be living here and trying to bring those two
regions together from the standpoint of competition, fan exposure, television
exposure, marketing exposure. Because I think it's an incredibly important
area for us, and we want to be here. So it's just a signal that we'll be back.  
  
Q. Obviously, there is a lot going on with the sport. If you had to give
college basketball a grade, A, B, C, D or F right now, what grade would you
give it?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Well, fortunately, I don't have to give anybody a grade.
I'm not a teacher. I'm very concerned, yet I'm not shocked. You hear things,
you don't have facts. If you did have facts, you would share them with the
appropriate people. We've always encouraged our coaches to abide by the rules.
We've always encouraged our coaches to help young people move towards
education. There are some very good things going on in college basketball, and
obviously by recent reports, there are some things that are very wrong. But I
would be reluctant to give it a grade.  
  
Q. In terms of you sort of addressed the whole timing of the Big Ten
tournament coming the week before the Big East is here. To the layperson, who
is just a hard core, Big Ten fan, can you explain why New York is so important
that you possibly put these teams that are going to make the tournament at the
disadvantage of having all that time off?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, well, I would disagree that it's a disadvantage.
You won't know if it's an advantage or disadvantage until you have results.
We've had years where we've had tremendous success in the tournament. We've
had years where we've been less successful.  
  
So, I think that it's important to us, because I've noticed from time to time
when you see expansion, you don't see a proactive follow-up on it. You add
institutions, but you don't embrace them. You add geography, but you don't
live there. You don't make significant or sufficient effort to become part of
communities that are new to you.  
  
So while the Big Ten has been around for 122 years and we have the largest
alumni base and probably the most disparate Big Ten distribution, we want it
to be more than clear. We wanted to actively compete and participate in this
corridor. Why this corridor? I think it's probably the most important corridor
in the country. Maybe the world, if you look at media, if you look at
politics, if you look at banking, if you look at finance. So it was important
for us to be here, to live here, participate, and to do everything we could to
facilitate integration athletically, competitively, culturally, and that's why
we're here.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Northwestern head coach Chris Collins.  
  
COACH COLLINS: It's good to see everyone. Always an exciting time of year to
get going with the college basketball season, especially being here in New
York City. Really looking forward to seeing what our group can become this
year. We have a lot of continuity from veteran players that have been around,
that have played a lot for the past two, three years together.  
  
And it's been a big key to our success, especially with last year's team. So
we have great leadership with Bryant McIntosh; Scottie Lindsey; Vic Law, who
is a fourth-year junior; as well as Dererk Pardon, who is our returning big
man who started all year last year.  
  
So we have a core four that's really done a great job with this team so far in
this summer and the fall of leading this group. And we have high aspirations
of what we can become and we know it's going to be tough playing in the
league. And we're excited to see what we can do.  
  
Q. What sort of research have you done about having to transfer your
home games to Allstate? Have you talked to anybody else who has gone through
that, and what sort of arrangements have you made to try to enhance the
atmosphere to what you get at home at Welsh-Ryan?  
COACH COLLINS: Certainly it's going to be different this year not having an
on-campus facility. Excited about what's coming down the pike. But for this
year, logistically, it will be different.  
  
I was able during the offseason to pick the brain of DePaul staff a little
bit. Being around those guys, you see the coaches out on the road in the
summer and during the recruiting period, just to get an idea from them, how
did they approach the travel from campus out there. What did they do, what
would they have done differently if they could? Things of that nature.  
  
So we tried to get out there and practice a handful of times here in the early
part of the season, just so the guys get a familiarity with that travel, with
what the gym is like and new locker rooms, all those kind of things.  
  
And I'm just relying on my older guys to be mature about it. And I've told
them, like, we just have to make it our home. And it's going to be our home
arena. I do believe that people are going to come out and watch this team.  
  
I think the players that we have that they've watched in the past, it's a fun
group to follow. It's a fun group to watch. I trust that our fans are going to
come out and support us even though we're going to be 25, 30 minutes from
campus.  
  
We're just trying to do as much as we can in the preseason so that once it's
for real, once the season starts, from a logistical standpoint we're not still
scrambling which may distract us from playing good basketball on the court.  
  
Q. I feel like there's a human-nature tendency sometimes when you
achieve something special to maybe exhale or take a deep breath. What did you
try to do as a coach to sort of combat that? And what did you see from your
players in terms of their ability to do so this summer?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, I think for the first time going into the summer, you
know, our guys, even our staff, myself, you're going around, there's a lot of
patting on the back. There's a lot of "Great job," "It was so fun," all those
kind of things, which as a person you like hearing those things.  
  
It's like you said, the human-nature quality in all of us. I think for me
personally I can tell you when I came to Northwestern, the NCAA Tournament was
a goal but it wasn't the end goal.  
  
The end goal was to try to build a program that could be respected and could
be relevant year in and year out. And we still have a lot to accomplish to get
to that point.  
  
I think having the senior class -- in particular, Bryant McIntosh, Scottie
Lindsey, Gavin Skelly -- those guys I've sensed from them, although they loved
what we did, loved being a part of the postseason for the first time in school
history and all that came with it, they have one more year to kind of further
enhance what their legacy is going to be in our program.  
  
And so their leadership has been vital, the way they've approached the summer.
And we don't talk about last year. I told the guys, like, there's nothing to
talk about. Every team is different. Every season is different.  
  
So even though we have a lot of players back, this is a new journey. It's a
new group. Guys have gotten better. Some guys are going to take on new and
different roles. And we have to figure out how we can become the best with
this group.  
  
And so that's kind of been our approach since the start of practice. And we
can't sit back and rest on what we did or didn't do last year. It's time to
get going with a new season, and we know it's going to be a tough league like
it always has been.  
  
And if you don't have that edge, if you don't have that chemistry, the fine
line from winning and losing in this league is a very, very narrow margin.  
  
So we know what our formula is and our guys know that we have to have those
same qualities if we want to be successful this year.  
  
Q. You mentioned -- that was a threshold for Northwestern to make that
thing. What was going through your mind during the Michigan game, the
Vanderbilt game, and especially really the Gonzaga game where your guys came
back and you saw that they had something that Northwestern had never had
before?  
COACH COLLINS: I think the most pressure that we faced was at the very end of
the regular season when we still felt we had work to do to get into the
tournament. There was a lot of pressure on us that last week of the season. We
were playing Michigan and Purdue at home, two of the better teams in our
league, and probably the two hottest teams in our league.  
  
And there was a lot of pressure on our players. And to see those guys rise to
the occasion under that kind of pressure and to do what they had to do to win
a big game like that to kind of ensure us to be part of the tournament for the
first time was very gratifying as a coach, because really for us as coaches
it's not about what we know, it's not about what we can do, it's about helping
our guys being able to perform under pressure.  
  
And that was as great a pressure as I probably ever have been a part of with a
team, just with the media and the fan base and the alumni and everybody
wanting it so bad.  
  
And I knew the guys could feel it. For them to step up and meet that pressure
and to win. And then to kind of stamp it, to go to the tournament, I thought
we performed very well in the Big Ten Tournament. We went to the NCAA
Tournament, had a good win over Vandy, and then to come back from a huge
deficit and kind of show who we were all about with our fight in the second
half against Gonzaga.  
  
So it was a special team. It was a special group of guys. And I hope we can
recreate some of what that group had with grit and toughness and will, because
they had those qualities that made them good. And we're going to need that
this year if we want to be successful in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your new protected in-state rivalry and what do
you know about Brad Underwood?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, I've known Brad for a long time. I mean, coaching and
basketball circles are small. I've had a great respect. I admired everything
he did at Stephen F. Austin. He goes to Oklahoma State and has a terrific year
there.  
  
He's an old-school basketball coach. He's very bright, very smart. He's going
to do a great job at Illinois. He just falls in line. To me the coaches in
this league are as good as it gets anywhere in the country when it comes to a
conference. And Brad is certainly of that ilk, and he's going to do a great
job.  
  
I think it's important, I think they feel it's important at Illinois for us to
play twice every year. I think it's a great thing for our state. It's a great
thing for our conference.  
  
I think with hopefully us -- for a long time it wasn't a heated rivalry and
probably mostly because, and even my first couple of years, you know we didn't
deserve to be in a rivalry like that. But now that we've gotten kind of better
and improved as a program, I think any time two in-state teams can play twice
in the conference, I think it's important for both schools.  
  
And I know it's something that we're looking forward to. I think it's an
important rivalry that I'm glad the conference was able to make that happen
with the new schedule.  
  
Q. Can you discuss how you're going to prepare your team for that week
of the conference tournament being held a week before championship week?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, I mean, you can't really think about that right now. I
mean, you might have ideas, what you would do, but I think it's a great
problem to have if you're still playing after the conference tournament. And
for any of us to just kind of assume that that's going to be the case, I
think, is wrong. Because we have a lot of work to do to be in a position where
we are still playing.  
  
And I think what you have to do at that point of the season, if you're lucky
enough, at the end of that Big Ten Tournament here in New York, to still be
playing in the postseason is understand where your team's at.  
  
Are you a little bit banged up? Do you need to practice hard? Do you need to
get guys healthy? And I think none of us are really going to know this at this
point. I think what you all see is the conference season is as condensed and
as rigorous as it's ever been in terms of logistically with more games and
fewer days and less off days.  
  
And so where is the health of every team at that point? And I think a big part
of that at the end of the year is going to be getting your guys fresh and
recharged and reenergized to play in the postseason if you're fortunate to be
there.  
  
And you've got to win during the year. And you've got to do enough to be in
that discussion. So we're not talking about that at all right now, because we
know that we're a long way from being in March. And I hope to be in that
position. I hope to have that problem. I hope to figure out what we need to do
for that couple of weeks to get the guys ready, because it means you're going
to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State head coach Patrick Chambers.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: It's great to be back in the Garden. We were here a few years
ago in a doubleheader with Michigan, which was a great experience for our
program, our fans and alums.  
  
We were here last year as well. We played St. John's. So it's great to be back
here in this historical arena.  
  
This summer we had a fantastic summer. Our players committed to summer session
one and summer session two, which was fantastic. And we had those 10
practices, actually brought our pros back in Tim Frazier, Talor Battle and
D.J. Newbill, which was great as far as words of wisdom, passing the torch
down.  
  
And then to go to Atlantis, go to the Bahamas and really bond and show some
chemistry, you're always looking for that connection. And I feel that put us a
little further ahead this year, especially with the Big Ten starting so early.  
  
Our team, we have close to 80 percent of our production back. First time for
me. And so I'm really excited about Tony and Josh and Shep and Lamar and Mike.
You add Julian in, a fifth-year senior. And then Satchel set out last year.
And then Nazeer Bostick, towards the end of the year, got injured. So we'll
have him coming back with a good freshman group that's coming in and really
filling in some holes for us.  
  
I'm looking forward to seeing the development from this group and the
experiences that we learned from last year.  
  
Lastly, we had our program we talked about climbing and we're climbing in
everything we do. Sometimes that climb is never direct. It's never a straight
line. You can go left, you can go right. You fall off. But you have to get
that handle back and get your footing back. And that's what we're doing. And
with this group and where our program's headed we feel like we're on the right
trajectory.  
  
Q. You had not elaborated on Mike Watkins not being on the summer trip.
I assume you probably won't. But can you give us an idea if he's back in your
good graces?  
COACH CHAMBERS: There's a standard that we have at Penn State, as you know.
And Mike has to check those boxes to be a student-athlete at Penn State. And
he's currently working towards that. He had a heck of a summer, though, as far
as on the court and in the weight room, and he continues to do everything I'm
asking him to do.  
  
Q. Josh is a great defensive player. Do you expect him to be a bigger
part of the offense going forward? He kind of exploded with 20 points against
Iowa late in the season?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Josh worked really hard this offseason. And what we can't have
is -- Josh is great at what he does. He's that energy guy. He defends. He
rebounds. He's all over the floor. He's got to continue to be that.  
  
But he's worked really hard on his shot and making good decisions and going
both ways and doing the little things that we're asking him because we do want
him to step up his point production.  
  
And I think you're going to see the increase in percentage from 3, but he's
also going to get to the free-throw line and get some more rebounds for us.
But you're exactly right. We want more from Josh, for sure.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the week-long break between the conference
tournament and the NCAA Tournament? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? And
just playing here at the tournament, will it help -- how much does that help
in recruiting in this area? Obviously you've had success here already, but
will this help it more?  
COACH CHAMBERS: It's going to be interesting to see how that week off affects
each team. But it could help mentally and physically for sure to give them a
couple of days off and to actually get away from me for a little bit as well,
might be a good thing for everybody. But with that energy and juice, I think
that week is going to be a positive.  
  
It's great, the footprint that we have is northeast corner, obviously, at Penn
State and where I recruit and where I'm going. And to bring them -- to be here
at Madison Square Garden and play in this incredible arena, just another
opportunity to showcase Penn State and what we're all about and the process
that we are on. But it's great for our fans and alums.  
  
We had great fan turnout for Michigan and great fan turnout for St. John's. So
anytime I can get back to New York, we're going to get back to New York.  
  
Q. Having so much of your production back, what kind of adjustments does
that allow you to make offensively?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We scored 72 points last year, the most since 2001. We had
great offensive production last year. But with Satchel and Mike's development
and Julian being a fifth-year senior, and John Harrar, our freshman, I think
we're going to be able to play inside/out a little more.  
  
We have the bigs up front, if we're in one of those scoring droughts that
every team goes in, I feel really confident in putting the ball inside and
being able to score from short range or at least get those guys to the free-
throw line where they can knock some things down.  
  
Q. Are there any perimeter shooters that we might not know about or
might not be aware of that are going to help you this year?  
COACH CHAMBERS: So, I was ready for you. So Minnesota and Northwestern
averaged six 3s a game last year. We averaged seven -- 6.8, to be exact.  
  
They went to the NCAA Tournament. They finished in top four. I don't think we
have to continue to focus on 3s. We have to continue to focus on defending and
rebounding. We were 13 out of 14 in rebounding. We gave up 73 points.
Positive, right? 72 points on offense. Negative, you gave up 73.  
  
That's not a good combination. So we're going to focus on defending and
rebounding. But I think with Shep, Tony's development, Lamar's development,
Josh's development, and we're going to let Satchel shoot some 3s from the top
of the key, I think that's going to add to our arsenal.  
  
Q. I was pretty tough on the schedule. Do you want to address that, the
non-conference?  
COACH CHAMBERS: The schedule, we knew the Big Ten was going to have those
early-season games. So really condensed the schedule on where we could put
non-conference.  
  
Duquesne, it just didn't work out scheduling-wise. And then it was tough to
get any high major to -- Big East, Atlantic 10 teams to do a home-and-home. So
we had to do the best we could with what we had, the footprint that we had. I
think it worked out well.  
  
If you look at it, you're at ACC-Big Ten Challenge, you've got two Big Ten
games, then you have GW and George Mason, that's a heck of a few weeks there.
So that two, three weeks is really going to show who we are and what our
identity is.  
  
Q. You scored a lot of points per game but a lot of it might have been
because there were so many possessions. You worked at a really fast pace. Are
you working on becoming a more efficient scoring team this year?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know, we were right around 70 possessions a game. And I
like where we are with 70 possessions a game. That's going to put us between
72 and 75.  
  
If we can defend and rebound a little bit better. I know everybody is focused
on offense. But I think where we lacked was that grit, that toughness on the
defensive end to get stops.  
  
I look forward to saying we're not going to be a feel-good team this year.
We're going to be a team that can grind one out or show its grit, especially
when you're not making shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan head coach John Beilein.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: It's great to be in New York. Having coached in the Big East
Tournament and in the Big East in Madison Square Garden, it's a tremendous
experience.  
  
As many of you know, Michigan has a great fan base here. And to be back in the
Big City this time of the year, March, it's a great thing. I know our team's
excited about it. And I'm excited about it.  
  
And so it's time to get into our regular season and just three weeks we'll be
playing our first games. We maybe have the most challenging schedule that
certainly I've ever had at Michigan or maybe Michigan's ever had. And we're
going to have to be ready for it and be ready early for it.  
  
Q. You had Andrew Dakich transfer out and go to Ohio State. What was
that conversation like when he decided to transfer and what does he bring
maybe off the floor and on the floor in terms of his talent?  
COACH BEILEIN: Chris called me first. I didn't hear from Andrew yet. And
Andrew -- that was almost simultaneously. But I support it 100 percent. Andrew
paid his way for three and a half years to go to Michigan.  
  
And we wanted to save a redshirt year for him to be able to go on scholarship
somewhere, work on his Master's degree. That was actually the plan. I don't
know if the plan was for him to be a Buckeye, but he grew up in that state.
He's a wonderful young man and really like Chris and his staff and it's good.
He'll really help them. He helped us win a lot of games, not on the floor but
in practice.  
  
Q. You were a Big East coach. Can you sort of share what the experience
is going to be like for the Big Ten teams getting to play at Madison Square
Garden? And do you think that that experience justifies moving the whole thing
up a week?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when we were in the Big East, you
know, there would be the Syracuse fans and the Georgetown fans and the
Villanova and West Virginia. And it was like you would walk down the streets,
particularly in this locale, and there's just energy.  
  
It was like an early March Madness type of energy. And who was going to still
be here on Saturday? So it's the same idea, only it's on Sunday.  
  
And so I think it's going to be tremendous. Our fans -- I mean, who does not
want to go and spend a few days in New York City? I think for all the fans,
there's so much to do and it's a great idea.  
  
We certainly have to make some sacrifices with the week and the schedule and
all those things. In the long run, it will be worth it.  
  
Q. Michigan/Michigan State rivalry now being protected. I guess what's
your feelings on that and also on the 20-game schedule, if that is one of the
big things to help get that rivalry protected?  
COACH BEILEIN: In our meeting, it was pretty unanimous to go to 20. And there
was no doubt, as Tom and I talked about this, that we should be playing twice
every year.  
  
There's never a doubt in any way, shape or form. And it's what should be
happening. I think it's the way that -- it's really smart scheduling for us.
We're doing it in football, and in basketball it just makes so much sense,
both interest-wise, financially, the whole deal. It's just like a great
concept that we've both embraced.  
  
Q. You play five high major teams in a two-week stretch, both conference
and non-conference, you'll be zigzagging back and forth across the country. Is
there a different type of preparation you would have in those games versus
games in conference where the traveling is a little bit less? Do you treat it
like a mini NCAA Tournament or have you not thought that far ahead yet?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think about it all the time because we'll also be coming from
Maui before we get into that. So it's really going to be difficult. I think
the biggest thing is going to be about rest. And hopefully that's why this
month has been so important to us.  
  
We were virtually -- we practiced five days a week. We're virtually using four
hours every day, whether it's film, walk-through, a couple of hours of
practice, because we know during that time, time probably off our feet is
going to be more important than practice.  
  
So, no, it's really challenging. Obviously we set that up with UCLA and Texas
before we knew we'd be playing that weekend. But we embraced that sudden
change, and we're going to do the best we can. And I know we'll be really
prepared for the second semester based on that schedule.  
  
Q. Having to replace three starters and adding three freshmen into the
mix, how do you see the offensive character of the team being different from
last season?  
COACH BEILEIN: It's going to be difficult. Right now, if you saw yesterday's
practice, you could say we have no chance of scoring a point in any basket in
any game. But we're just -- every day is a new way of discovering where these
young guys can help us.  
  
Isaiah Livers has played well. Eli Brooks, they've done a great job. Jordan
Poole, we can see his development. And we have Jaaron Simmons and Austin
Davis, guys that have never played in a game at Michigan. These are important.  
  
A few of those guys we need to step up offensively. But that's not the bigger
concern. The bigger concern is can they step up defensively as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

### [Nigel Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26720)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 71, Wisconsin - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Gard, then
open it up for questions.  
  
COACH GARD: First of all, congratulations to Michigan on the run that they're
on. Obviously playing very well. We knew that coming in. One of the hotter
teams in the league, if not the country.  
  
Also proud of our guys, to get it to this point. They've grown throughout the
year. We allowed too much confidence to get going, specifically early from
three, which gave them some momentum.  
  
In the first 10 possessions of the second half I think is really where we
couldn't get back over that hump, specifically offensively. We go I think two
points on 10 possessions in that start of the second half, which allowed them
to get a little more separation when it was a one-point game.  
  
Proud of our guys, how they battled. Didn't play specifically well in the
first half defensively, for the most part, the whole game offensively in terms
of how we were executing, converting on possessions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Nigel and Bronson.  
  
Q. Bronson, they held you to 26% shooting in the second half. What was
effective against the offense that you were running?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I thought they didn't adjust much other than just, you know,
saying get up on the shooters a little more. We were trying to do our best to
get it inside. We weren't finishing as well as we have been inside. Obviously
some shots weren't going in that were going in the past few games.  
  
So, yeah.  
  
Q. Nigel, yesterday you emphasized defensive rebounding, saying that was
a big key. Michigan finished with three offensive rebounds today. Was that a
product of focusing on defensive rebounding or was it them not missing
shots?  
NIGEL HAYES: Probably them not missing shots. They shot the ball extremely
well. A lot of tough shots. That's kind of their offense.  
  
Some of it is they are good shooters. And sometimes the ball bounces their
way. That's what happened for them today. We just needed to do a better job in
other areas.  
  
Q. You've obviously been here before. How hard or easy is it to readjust
your sights and start focusing on the next opportunity in front of you?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I mean, we've been here before, like you said. We know what to
expect. We celebrate the night of our win and start looking forward to the
next team we play. Our coaches do a great job of letting us know what the
other team is going to want to do that next day.  
  
I mean, just like any other tournament really.  
  
Q. You maybe weren't getting the results you wanted late in the regular
season. What you guys did here this week, what kind of confidence does that
give you going forward?  
NIGEL HAYES: We were good for the first two games. We played how we practiced,
how we were supposed to play. We played how we knew we could play. We played
how we expected ourselves to play. The results showed.  
  
This game, we kind of took a detour from that, kind of played how we were
doing in February. Still credit to Michigan. They played some tough plays,
made some good shots.  
  
But we just got to remember the first two games we had here, how we played,
the way we shared the ball, the way we defended, try to get that back from
this tournament.  
  
BRONSON KOENIG: Just like what Nigel said, we were playing really well for the
past three games or so. We just kind of went away from what was working a
little bit. A little bit of that, a little bit of just, like I said before,
not finishing, not making some shots, not getting stops. Just a combination of
those things.  
  
Q. As seniors, all season you talked about wanting to close your careers
with a Big Ten title. Now that this moment is gone, is there a sense that you
need to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament to close your careers, leave
the legacy you want to leave?  
NIGEL HAYES: Obviously we just want to win. It shows how hard it is to do
that. We knew that going in. We knew we had the ability. We put ourselves in
there for a good portion of the year. As we said, we got into a little rut
where we got away from what we were doing. We kind of gave it away. Did the
same thing again tonight.  
  
But, you know, we just got to make sure we refocus, adjust for this. We
wouldn't be the first team that could do something incredible without having a
conference championship our a tournament one.  
  
Just got to refocus, do what works best for us, what works well, play from
there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Nigel and Bronson.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Gard.  
  
Q. What can you take from the way you played the first two games here
moving forward into next week?  
COACH GARD: Well, it's how we need to play. I mean, it shows how good we can
be when we are connected defensively, share the ball. Obviously it helps when
the ball goes in. Makes things look a lot easier than what it really is, or
the game a lot simpler.  
  
We played pretty well here. We didn't play specifically well today. Probably
more so from the defensive end at the start than we had been playing. That's a
credit to Michigan. I mean, we gave them some things, but they hit some shots,
too, timely shots when we were making runs.  
  
Duncan has one basket all game. It was a huge three, when we cut it to six. We
got to remember, as these guys said, when we're on, what it looks like, what
it feels like when we're playing well. Obviously Friday and Saturday we did
that, and not so much here today.  
  
Q. I don't think the first field goal you had was until just a little
over eight minutes into that second half. How much of that was you guys and
how much of that was them?  
COACH GARD: We had a lot of opportunities. I'll have to go through and see
exactly where the shots came from.  
  
We were two points on our first 10 possessions of the second half. You're
going to have a hard time against anybody when you're having that type of
struggles offensively.  
  
We got it to a one-point game. I thought we had made some adjustments through
the first half to kind of cover up some of the threes. Guys felt comfortable
about the plan, what we were doing the second half.  
  
But then to offensively not be able to score... It's not like they ran away
from it. It got to 39-32. We couldn't do anything.  
  
Like I said, that number right away, when I heard two points on our first 10
possessions, that told the story.  
  
Q. Some of the critics argue that some of the losses towards the end of
the season could be attributed to not getting the ball in Bronson's hands
enough. Is that something you'll be looking at going into the tournament, part
of the game plan?  
COACH GARD: He's had the ball in his hands a lot. You look at it, when we're
at our best, we share it really well. It's not dominated by one person.  
  
Compare Friday and Saturday to other games, how we shared, how we moved the
ball, we had multiple guys in double figures, specifically I think Friday we
had five guys in doubles.  
  
That's when we're at our best. We don't necessarily have to be one player or
person dominated. Types of shots are more important for me than volume.
Obviously the efficiency that comes with those types of shots is important.  
  
Bronson is an important piece to us, as is everybody else. I look more at the
type of shots we get versus who's getting how many.  
  
Those three guys, Hayes, Happ and Koenig, get the vast majority of what we do.
We'll continue to work and try to play like we played Friday and Saturday.  
  
Q. When you look ahead at the next few days, talk about the experience
that Nigel and Bronson have, and how much does it makes your job easier?  
COACH GARD: They understand it's one game at a time. If you don't play well,
it will only be one game.  
  
I think they understand. They don't let the outside noise or all the drama
that comes with it, which obviously it's a terrific tournament, they do a very
good job of filtering that, just understanding our preparation, how we go
about this next week, depending on when we play, where we go, understanding
that the focus needs to be on our preparation, our opponent, and not get
caught up in terms of the pomp and circumstance that comes with being in the
tournament.  
  
They'll be able to do a good job of that, understand we'll get back to Madison
tonight, find out who we play in a little while, get ready to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH GARD: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 71, Wisconsin - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined up on the stage for the Michigan press conference
by head coach, John Beilein, Derrick Walton, Jr., and Zak Irvin.  
  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: We're obviously so proud and happy for these kids, the
University of Michigan, our athletic program, that they could come and win
such a coveted championship.  
  
Winning four games in four days is incredible. Our message was, Somebody's
going to do it, why not us?  
  
They really came in, and this team has bonded, not just because of the events
last Wednesday, but in the last month. We lost a home game to Ohio State. Our
kids really felt bad about that. The coaches felt bad about that.  
  
After that, we gained an edge from that loss that has propelled us to this
point.  
  
We've handled the prosperity thus far. Now we have to handle it again with a
difficult game next Friday. Right now, we're going to enjoy this Big Ten
championship. You don't get a chance this very often. Really pleased for these
young men.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the students.  
  
Q. Derrick, talk a little bit about that second half, the way it started
for you guys, the defense, getting off to the run that you guys did.  
DERRICK WALTON: Before the half even started, we talked about how important
the first two possessions of the half is, the first four minutes of the half.
We came out firing. We made some consecutive stops. We hit tough shots. I
don't know what their defensive percentage is. A lot of teams don't score at
that rate on them.  
  
I'm proud of our guys. I'm really relieved to finally get here and do what we
wanted to do.  
  
Q. Derrick, coach the other day relayed a conversation that you had in
the car, in which you guaranteed basically you were going to win the Big Ten
tournament. How did you get that confidence? Are you going to carry that
confidence into the NCAAs?  
DERRICK WALTON: Well, we was on our way to Nebraska. We rode together in the
car. I just told him how bad I wanted to win the Big Ten tournament
championship, how much the guys did as well.  
  
We just felt like we was playing really good basketball. We had some minor
tweaks we needed to make to make a long run in March.  
  
Going into March Madness, the NCAA tournament, we got a lot of confidence. We
think we're a really dynamic team. We can score in a lot of different ways. We
think we pose a huge threat against other teams.  
  
Q. For both Derrick and Zak, describe your emotions, your feelings in
those final seconds when everybody was starting to feel the championship.  
ZAK IRVIN: It was a great feeling, just knowing all the hard work we put in
throughout the whole season. Just to be able to experience that with all your
brothers, after all the adversity we've been through, to finally say we won a
Big Ten championship, that's a huge accomplishment. It's a memory that we'll
always remember.  
  
DERRICK WALTON: I say probably God is good. That's all I can really say.  
  
A lot of things we can't explain that happen happen. We just bonded together
as family. To finally do this, do something that hasn't been done in so long,
it's something that will stick with you for a really long time. The
friendships and bonds we have with this team, it's something that's
everlasting.  
  
Q. With the way this whole week started for you guys, getting here, to
be able to accomplish what you did, what does this mean for you going
forward?  
DERRICK WALTON: When the event first happened, basketball was the last thing
on my mind. I talked to Zak. We got home. I just said, Basketball is a small
spectrum in life, what we just experienced. I just let him now what really
could have happened.  
  
But once we got here, I just let that all be what it was. I really focused in
and bought into what coach was talking about, the rest of our coaches. They
work so hard with the scouting report and everything. We just wanted to pay
them back by doing special things like this.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Like Derrick said, we had a conversation after everything went
down. Once we landed in D.C., we agreed that why can't this be the greatest
story ever told. Everybody had that mentality: Why not us?  
  
When we were tired and fatigued, whatever it might be, that was the extra push
we needed to win this championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, guys. Good luck in the NCAAs.  
  
Questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. This week, how much will you concentrate on working on your stuff,
what you guys do? How much work do you concentrate on your opponent coming
up?  
COACH BEILEIN: One of the things I took note of, I know it's a very good
Oklahoma State team, is I wanted to -- are we playing Thursday or Friday? Here
we are, the last team probably playing right now. All of a sudden, we're
turning around Thursday afternoon at noon. That would have been a little bit
different.  
  
The Friday gives us -- these first two days, we're not going to do very much.
We need two days' rest. We played Sunday night. Our kids need to rest.  
  
Those other days, I'm sure we'll talk about whoever wins, I don't know who
Louisville is playing, but whoever wins them in their matchup, at some point.  
  
It will basically be all about, All right, how can we find ways to stop
Oklahoma State? How to also score against Oklahoma State.  
  
With our younger kids, we do fundamentals every day, trying to get them to
become like these guys. But overall, it will be a lot like we would in a
normal two-day prep.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Save travels home.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Nate Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28499)

### [Dupree McBrayer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32984)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 84, Minnesota - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Pitino to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH PITINO: We battled. To be down 16, to come back, proud of the effort. To
have Nate and Dupree not get a sub, Amir only gets one minute out of the game,
was obviously very, very challenging.  
  
It was difficult off a one-day prep. You feel so bad for Akeem and his injury.
But from a team standpoint, it's very challenging. You have less than a
24-hour turnaround, to get guys kind of in the right spot.  
  
Some time off will help. We'll be able to acclimate some other guys, be able
to go to the bench a little bit more.  
  
Our guys showed terrific heart, terrific toughness. We just couldn't get stops
at the beginning. We just didn't set the tone from a defensive standpoint.
They were really shooting it well.  
  
Tough one. But we'll go home, and we'll get some rest tonight. We'll get
excited about the fact we're in the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Nate and Dupree.  
  
Q. Talk about the defensive mistakes in the first half. Obviously
turnovers hurt you on offense.  
NATE MASON: Mainly, like we said, the turnovers really hurt us. We really
couldn't get back in transition like we needed to.  
  
First half, we started off very slow, not talking. On the defensive end, they
took advantage of it.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Same thing. They jumped out on us early. We was a little
sluggish. We thought it would be handed to us. That's it. We got to come out
with more intensity.  
  
Q. Dupree, this is your first start in a couple months, obviously with
Akeem going down. You played all 40 minutes. How exhausted are you? How do you
keep going forward next week?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Well, just be prepared for anything that comes our way. Coach
is going to do his best to get us all in a position to do our best. That's
just it.  
  
Q. Talk about the fact that you guys will be playing in the NCAA
tournament. What kind of mindset, focus do you have to have, no matter the
opponent, to be able to make a run?  
NATE MASON: I never been in the tournament, so I really don't know. I know we
can't start off like we did today against any team. We got to be locked in
from the jump ball, be able to play defense on the defensive end.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: You're going to get everybody's best shot. Anybody can beat
anybody. We have to come out with the mindset that we're one of the better
teams.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Pitino.  
  
Q. Derrick Walton, obviously amazing game. He scored 19 of his team's 37
the second half. As a coach, defensively, are you trying to throw the kitchen
sink? How do you deal with guy who is scoring and scoring?  
COACH PITINO: Try to do a couple different things. Switch some ball screens.
Getting up aggressively. Hedging hard on ball screens.  
  
I thought he hit some tough shots. He's a really good player. To my mind, he's
one of the most underappreciated point guards in the country. Doesn't surprise
me when he plays well.  
  
I thought he was terrific.  
  
Q. There's been a fair amount of criticism on the tournament being on
the East Coast. What were some of the positives from your perspective? Next
year at the Garden, with the family history, the week early schedule, what are
your thoughts on that?  
COACH PITINO: I loved it. I thought it was great. I don't think it's something
you need to do every year, but if you're doing it 10% of the time, I think
it's a nice change of pace for everybody.  
  
One thing I'll never question is what Commissioner Delany is doing. He's done
an unbelievable job of building this conference, its brand. He feels it's
necessary, when adding Maryland and Rutgers, that we live in their region as
well.  
  
The Garden is a special place as well. Getting our guys to D.C. is a terrific
opportunity. I'm not going to question a lot of what Commissioner Delany does.
He knows what he's doing.  
  
Q. Early on, how much of the defensive issues you guys were having had
to do with adjusting without Akeem?  
COACH PITINO: It wasn't a whole lot to do with the guards. The bigs were not
getting their hands up. We tell them, after one of the media timeouts, you
have two deflections, that's a problem. Over the next four minutes, we got
seven.  
  
Our hands weren't active enough. They make you pay. That's what they do. They
have terrific offensive personnel.  
  
Q. In the first half with Lynch out, you went smaller. Talk about Curry.
The first game, he had to replace Murphy in there. Tough matchup for him on
Bridges. This time he fouled out. What do you need to see from him and the
front court in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH PITINO: Eric could have scored a lot more points. He missed a couple
chippies. He could have been close to a double-double.  
  
We go smaller against Michigan because of all of the five shooters. It becomes
a tough cover for Reggie and BK. That's been successful in the past.  
  
Our front court is extremely important. Whoever it is that we play, we got to
show great toughness. We rebounded the ball terrifically. We got to be doing a
better job of throwing the ball out to three-point shooters, especially Reggie
on the last one.  
  
That was tough to come back with Akeem going down. Regrouping is the best for
us right now. We'll be excited to go home and then get excited about Selection
Sunday.  
  
Q. What do you feel you learned from the last couple games that can
benefit you going forward?  
COACH PITINO: Well, we're a totally different team now with Akeem out. Akeem
was a starting two. Whenever Nate needed a sub, we put Dupree at the one,
assigned Akeem to the two. Totally different team. I'm extremely disappointed
with Akeem that he has to go through that.  
  
But we're going to have to start teaching some guys some different positions.
That was a huge blow. He was a starter, playing a lot of minutes.  
  
Q. I know the Big Ten throughout the season had a lot of heat on it.
Going into the tournament, what do you feel like your team deserves as far as
a seed?  
COACH PITINO: That's not my decision. If it was, I'd say we deserve a 1 seed.
But it's not, so...  
  
I don't know. I'm just excited that we're in it. I'm fired up. As
disappointing as it is for Akeem to go down, to see a guy that's so important
to us, for his career to end, it was emotional for everybody. Then to come
back, guys had to play a lot of minutes.  
  
I want these guys, when they get on the plane, to flush all that. Close the
book on the Big Ten tournament, get excited about the NCAA tournament.  
  
Wherever they put us, whoever we play, we're going to be really, really
excited. We'll be proud of what we accomplished this year and be excited about
moving forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck next week.  
  
COACH PITINO: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Bryant McIntosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28555)

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Wisconsin - 76, Northwestern - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Collins to make an opening statement, then
questions for Bryant.  
  
COACH COLLINS: Just credit Wisconsin. I thought they were very good today.
They were very sharp. They were very physical. They beat us to all the loose
balls.  
  
I thought early in the game, both teams were kind of struggling to get a
rhythm early. I thought their ability to beat us in the hustle stats was big,
offensive rebounds, loose balls. They were good. Their big guys were
tremendous. They made shots, 12 threes. That's why they're a championship-
level program.  
  
For us, we just never could get in a rhythm. I thought we had some shots early
in the paint. We needed to see it go in a little bit to find some energy. We
just weren't able to do that.  
  
Credit Wisconsin. I thought they played very well. They deserve to be playing
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bryant, you shot so well in your first two games here. How much of
what happened today was the result of Wisconsin's defense and how much was the
shots not falling?  
BRYANT McINTOSH: A lot. I think they guarded us pretty well. They took a lot
of our stuff away, pushed us out on the floor.  
  
We didn't do a very good job of sharing the ball either. We only had a couple
assists for the entire game. That's something we have to be better with. When
we cause them to collapse, we got to share it.  
  
They did a great job of trying to take our stuff away. It's a credit to them.  
  
Q. Between not having shots fall for you, what they were doing
defensively, when the lead starts to get into double-digits, how tough is
that?  
BRYANT McINTOSH: Yeah, it's tough. They had it going. They were hitting shots.
I thought especially in the second half, when we were trying to make a push,
we could never close the gap. Trying to expend that much energy after playing
a couple games in a row in the past couple days is tough.  
  
They're a really good team. You can't dig that big of a hole in order to try
to expend that much energy trying to get back into the game if you're wanting
to win at this level.  
  
Q. Bryant, what do you think the vibe is going to be like within the
team in terms of how long you think about this one, when you start thinking
about what's ahead?  
BRYANT McINTOSH: Yeah, I think we'll think about this loss. We'll have to sit
on this one until we figure out what our next game is. If we're fortunate
enough to get our name called, then it's time for us to move on once that
happens.  
  
I'm sure that's how the coaches will be. I think that's how we will be, as
well.  
  
Q. Bryant, this is your first extended Big Ten tournament run. How did
you deal with the highs and the lows? What did you learn over the past three
days?  
BRYANT McINTOSH: I think we handled it fairly well. It's so much about when
you get this late into the tournament, it's about energy. It's about effort.
We didn't have enough of either today.  
  
They beat us every 50/50 ball. They deserved to win the game, and we didn't.
Didn't even deserve to be on the floor at some points. They put it on us
today.  
  
Just disappointed in our energy and effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Bryant.  
  
BRYANT McINTOSH: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Collins.  
  
Q. 25 points over turnovers yesterday, only four today. Is that
something you realize that's happening during the game?  
COACH COLLINS: Wisconsin notoriously is a team that takes care of the ball.
It's not as easy to turn them over. I mean, they're playing all seniors out
there. They have guys who played in these games their whole careers. They
understand the stage. They're poised. They're tough.  
  
We knew we weren't going to turn them over 20 times. That's not how they play.
Against Wisconsin, you know they're not going to beat themselves. If you want
to compete against them, you want to beat them. You have to beat them. They're
not going to make mistakes.  
  
So you have to execute well. You have to be very tough defensively. You got to
lock up the boards. You got to get the loose balls.  
  
I thought those were the areas, especially when they got some distance with us
there late in the first half, I thought those were the areas where they were
able to stretch out the lead.  
  
Initially our defense was pretty good. We had a few breakdowns. A lot of their
buckets were coming off offensive rebounds, throwing out for threes, a loose
ball they got which led to a basket or transition.  
  
You know when you play these guys what kind of game it's going to be. It's
going to be a possession-by-possession, execute-based game. We weren't able to
match that today.  
  
Again, they were the better team. They deserved to beat us.  
  
Q. Looked like you had a nice moment there in the handshake line with
Greg Gard. Was some of that in relation to what happened a month ago?  
COACH COLLINS: No. I was just wishing him luck. Yeah, they're a great team. I
have great respect for their program and him as a coach. At the Big Ten level,
I wished him luck for tomorrow, wished him luck in the NCAA tournament.  
  
I've talked all along how much I respect their program. We've emulated, try to
do what they've done. It was more just well wishes.  
  
Q. You had a great win last night, a tough one today. How do you make
sure on the precipice of history that your team doesn't get too high or too
low? Where do you feel your team's mentality is right now?  
COACH COLLINS: I think we're going to be fine. We're going to be fine. We got
beat today. I think sometimes psychologically we talk too much about all that
kind of stuff.  
  
We had two great wins. We got beat today by a really good team. We get rested
up. We dust ourselves off. Hopefully, nothing's guaranteed. Tomorrow night,
whenever that show is, we see our name called, and we figure out and start
preparing for who we're going to play.  
  
But we're going to be fine. We got character in our locker room. We're going
to be ready. We'll get rested, get prepared. We'll try to play our best next
Thursday or Friday, if we get that chance.  
  
Q. I agree nothing's guaranteed, but it's been a heck of a six months in
Chicago. Cubs fans waited their entire lives. I assume that the school and its
alumni have waited their entire life. What do you expect in terms of the
players, school, alums?  
COACH COLLINS: If that happens tomorrow night, I think there will be a lot of
happy people, which makes me happy. I love Northwestern. I love the people,
the community, the fans. Everybody has really embraced us, embraced this team.
I know it's a long time coming for a lot of people that followed the program
for a lot of years. Hopefully there will be a lot of joy.  
  
I'll be most happy for the players, though. Those are the guys that have
earned this right. They're the ones that have gone out there and performed
night in and night out, losing key guys throughout the year, Pardon, Lindsey,
for extended periods of time. Just finding a way to win, be effective in this
league, get to the semifinals of the conference tournament.  
  
It will make me happy to see a lot of smiles and hopefully excitement on
people's faces. For our guys, a lot of the guys came here because they wanted
to be a part of the first -- not just the first tournament, but a first of a
lot of milestones that this team has been able to accomplish, which they
deserve.  
  
They've been a great group to coach. I'm excited to continue the journey. I
hope we can keep playing for a while, because this has been a really fun team
to coach.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team here in D.C.?  
COACH COLLINS: I mean, I don't know what I learned. I felt we were a good
team. I think we're playing well. I really do.  
  
I sense when we played Indiana a couple weeks ago, even though we lost that
game, I feel like until today, where we just got beat, were a little bit out
of gas, I feel like our level of play has been really good for a four-, or
five-game stretch.  
  
We're sharing the ball, playing hard, grinding defensively. That makes you
feel good heading into next week. I feel like we're in a good place. I know
we're excited to hopefully keep playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
COACH COLLINS: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

### [Nigel Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26720)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Wisconsin - 76, Northwestern - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Gard to make an opening statement, then take
questions for Nigel and Ethan.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously terrific team win, terrific effort. Played exceptionally
well. Played really hard. Just proud of our guys, of how they've continued to
improve and grow, take little things we have worked on throughout the year and
continue to get better at it.  
  
Guys off the bench did a terrific job. Obviously Northwestern has had a heck
of a year. For us to come in and play this well, show we're getting better at
this time of year, it's a huge step.  
  
Like I said, proud of our guys. Try to get as much rest as possible and get
ready for Michigan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Ethan, coming into this game, a rough stretch at the free-throw line,
today unbelievable. It seems like the crowd and your alums and fans go nuts
every time you make a free throw. What was the secret today? Confidence?
Technique? Practice?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, coming into this tournament I, felt more confident. Last
game, I only got one crack at a free throw. I put in a lot of time. Coach Gard
has helped me with my free throw, as well.  
  
We put in a lot of time, worked on a lot of things. It's good to see it start
to pay off a little bit.  
  
Q. Nigel, you're playing a team that's gone for its third time in three
days. You guys are known for your defense. Is that a pretty good combination
for Wisconsin, your defense against a team that's somewhat weary?  
NIGEL HAYES: Yeah, definitely. We'll take that advantage for us. That's kind
of the benefit we receive for doing semi-decent in the regular season, the
regular conference.  
  
We know they're playing hard, playing inspired, playing well right now. If
they're going to be a little tired, we'll definitely take it. We don't want to
run around like spring chickens or anything like that.  
  
Q. As that lead is starting to grow, what is it like playing with a lead
like that and the confidence it gives you throughout the game?  
NIGEL HAYES: It's a process, definitely. We're trying to become better. It's
something that I've noticed. Freshman and sophomore year when we played the
good teams, we watched the other really good teams, the teams that go on to do
good things is when they get a lead, the things they do. Again, our coaching
staff and Coach Gard stresses that you continue to play the game the right
way.  
  
I said that to the guys. We had a 15-point lead. I said, We've done the big
things to get the lead, makes threes, and-ones, et cetera. To extend the lead,
we have to continue to do the little things right now.  
  
I think we did a fairly good job of that. We got away from it a little bit
throughout the second half. For the most part, we've taken a step in the right
direction of, you know, closing out games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Questions for Coach Gard.  
  
Q. They had one assist until the eight-minute mark of the second half.
Wisconsin, known for its defense, but 48 points, that kind of play, you had to
be impressed with your team's play?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, I think we've gotten better as the season has gone on,
specifically defensively. We got bent sideways a little bit offensively. We
had a hard time scoring two, three weeks ago. Defensively, other than maybe
one game or a game and a half, we've been pretty consistent.  
  
These guys understand that's where it starts. We have to be very good at that
end. I think this group has taken ownership of that. They take pride in what
they do defensively, in how consistent and good they can be.  
  
We'll just continue to build on it, continue to get better.  
  
Q. Towards the end of the game, you had a chance to work in some of your
bench. Did you see anything you liked that you hadn't had an opportunity to
see earlier in the season?  
COACH GARD: Well, I think Alex, for one, is starting to turn the corner a
little bit as a sophomore. I've noticed how he's practiced the last two, three
weeks. Hence, I've used him a little bit more.  
  
I think him, Jordan Hill I thought did a good job of stepping out. We were out
with Khalil Iverson. He's home with his family right now.  
  
Guys are continuing to grow. Every opportunity they have, they need to take
advantage of it, whether it's in live action in a game, what they get in
practice, in the scout team, or over with me on the other side of the floor.
Just take advantage of your opportunities, continue to grow. Our young guys
have definitely bought into that, definitely improved.  
  
Our program has typically been developmentally based, in terms of guys growing
through the process, getting better. Hence, you see a lot of juniors and
seniors on the floors, a freshman here or there. They work and improve as they
go through our program.  
  
Q. How gratifying is it to see this team respond from what was a little
bit of a rough patch second half of the season to play the way you're playing
now?  
COACH GARD: It's the right time of the year to be playing like this. We'll
continue to try to get better.  
  
We never lost faith in what we were doing, lost hope. It's just a matter of,
Let's do what we do better. There weren't any radical changes, anything
outside the box. It was just, Let's get back to doing what we do really well.
Let's try to improve upon it. That was specifically on the defensive end.
That's where, I think, we've taken another step forward here in the last week
or two. That's helped us. We've been able to really be pretty effective and
efficient defensively. It's helped our offense because we've been able to do
that. They've kind of played off one another.  
  
The defensive end is really where I think they turned the corner.  
  
Q. In your first game against Michigan, when you won, Bronson was your
leading scorer. In your second when you lost, he didn't play. What do you
expect and need out of him tomorrow to succeed?  
COACH GARD: It will be all the other guys, too, that will be a part of it.
Michigan is playing really well, not only in our league, but in the country.
Won 8 of 10, something like that. John has done a heck of a job over the time
he's been there.  
  
They got really good players. They have a lot of seniors. They have more
seniors than we have. They're playing well at the right time, as well.  
  
We'll have to be very good defensively. There's not going to be anything
secret. They know what we do. We know what they do. It will be two pretty good
teams going at each other.  
  
Q. Vitto just talked about how the focus today was shutting down the
guards. Tomorrow, with this Michigan team, is the help defense going to play a
bigger role than the individual matchups, sort of guarding as a team?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, I never get too caught up in individual matchups because we
are so help oriented. We change some things. There's rotations that are
involved within it. We have to have all five pieces working together, not
disjointed in any way.  
  
Michigan does test you in different ways. Obviously with bigs, they can
stretch you, shoot the threes. Walton is playing as well as any point guard in
the country right now. Obviously they've got experience in other areas with
Irvin and the other guys that play along the frontline for them.  
  
We'll have to play well. You get to this point in time, you're in a
championship game. They're not there by accident, and neither are we. Like I
said, it will hopefully be a really good game between two good teams.  
  
Q. Going into this championship game, is there a sense that you want to
use this to vault yourselves into a tournament run? Is that a world away,
you're focused on this game?  
COACH GARD: No, I mean, we haven't talked about the tournament at all. We've
talked about the tournament, this tournament, just trying to take three steps
in this. We talked about step one. We couldn't get to today until we took care
of yesterday. Same thing today, Sunday wasn't going to happen unless we took
care of today.  
  
All we're worried about is the game in front of us. That's how we've
approached all year. We'll rest up here, get ready for Michigan, get ready to
go tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH GARD: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 84, Minnesota - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Beilein to make an opening statement, then
questions.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: It was another day that as a coaching staff, you had
opportunities to really appreciate your team many times during the year, and
that was a great opportunity to sit back and watch them play ball again.  
  
The first, I don't know, five to ten minutes, with a simple game plan, a few
plays we just put in this morning that were just options to look at, all of a
sudden they were making everything work.  
  
What I like best is they played connected again. It was just a gutty
performance. When Minnesota made that run to come back, Derrick, Zak, put the
team on their back and we got the W.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Zak and Derrick.  
  
Q. Derrick, yesterday against Purdue, three of ten, four turnovers.
Today I believe you scored 19 of your team's 37, one turnover, nine assists.
Is this a senior showing there's 20 minutes left in your season and you got to
show this team that you know what it takes to lead, stuff like that?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: At this point of the year, the last game doesn't matter.
Like we said before the game, nobody cares that you were tough yesterday. It's
all about what you do today.  
  
I took that approach. Helped my team win it whatever way I could. Yesterday's
performance is whatever it was. It wasn't even on my mind.  
  
Q. Derrick, you've had a tendency this year to rachet up your offensive
game at the end of the game. I think you scored 14 points in the last seven
minutes. What is your mindset, how does it change, when the game starts to
kick into the final stretch?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: For the most part, I just try to read the game to see
what is necessary at the time, who has a good matchup. For the most part,
these guys have faith in me to make a play. That's all I need, to know they
trust me. It's easy for me to make the right play.  
  
Q. Zak, the first half, you shot 63%. Did it feel like you couldn't
miss? What did you see from the Minnesota defense in the second half that
slowed that down a little bit?  
ZAK IRVIN: Like Coach B said, we put in some new plays that we executed very
well. People were just getting downhill, getting easy layups. That got us to a
great start.  
  
We knew Minnesota was going to make their run, like they did in the second
half, end of the first half. We were able to stay resilient and win the game.  
  
Q. Two days ago, we were talking about what could have been a tragic
incident, how you were going to respond coming into D.C. Now a couple days
later, it seems like you're a team of destiny. Do you think that incident
helped you at all?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think the incident just brought us closer as a team and as a
family. We're just going out there playing really connected, playing for one
another. We're trying to keep that going for the rest of the season.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: For the most part, this team is really close, aside what
happened. I think once we got to this tournament, was able to focus on
basketball. We wanted to do something special. That's all it really boils down
to. We have another opportunity to do so tomorrow. We're going to focus our
minds on that.  
  
Q. You are roommates, seniors. Talk a little about your mindset, Big Ten
tournament, March Madness. Do you talk about it, has the urgency changed?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: He's been my roommate for four years now. We got this
camaraderie and telepathy, we know what each other is thinking on the court
and off the court.  
  
We talked about two games left in our regular season. This means a lot to us.
We got her our freshmen year, wasn't able to finish the job. Being one of the
two leaders of this team, we want to make sure we get back and finish the job.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: This is March. We want to be playing our best basketball in March.
Derrick and I, one of other team goals was to win the Big Ten championship and
the tournament. We have a great opportunity in front of us. We just want to
keep it going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas. You may return to the locker room. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. With Wagner's decreased offensive production in the second half, any
concerns on the back?  
COACH BEILEIN: Not really. His defense was our concern. He came out there, was
very listless on defense. Got to fight through that. He's been through a lot
of these type of situations. The people he's been guarding in the post are
some big men. He saw that again with Lynch. He didn't come out the second
half. When you play like that, you are going to get in foul trouble.  
  
He was terrific in the first half. I was shocked he had the 17 points. The
good thing we have, we have an experienced senior in Mark Donnal. DJ has
played there before.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BEILEIN: No. The same. At the five-minute mark, he's probably going to
get a sub. The big man has more to do than anybody. He's hedging ball screens,
running back, while the two guards stand in the corner guarding their man.  
  
He has to be in tremendous shape, which he is. But it's hard to do that. He'll
play probably 28 to 32 tomorrow. Mark will play anywhere from 12 to 8.  
  
Q. When they come back and get it tied up, then all of a sudden, it's a
ballgame again, what is your mindset?  
COACH BEILEIN: Here is what I saw. I'll tell you exactly what I told the team.
That timeout was nothing to do about basketball. For the first time all year,
I saw us bickering at each other. Somebody didn't play defense. Somebody
backed out. Somebody didn't run a cut right. That was what that timeout was
about.  
  
We talked to each other. Listen, forget basketball right now. We're the most
connected team. Now you're disconnecting. You're not going to win.  
  
It's a great lesson for them going forward. Tomorrow, post-season, that can
happen again. You have to stay connected during that time.  
  
There was no yelling or screaming. Settle down, we know what we have to do.
Let's guard defense. Let's be together as a team.  
  
Q. Between the circumstances surrounding your arrival in town here, now
winning three in a row, that's a wide range of emotion to have to deal with in
a week. How are you dealing with it as a coach? What is your message for
tomorrow for the team?  
COACH BEILEIN: Before we knew what was going to happen last Wednesday, our
whole thing was, Pack your bags for four days, right? I told them, I'm
bringing four suits. We're going to get this thing done.  
  
When Derrick went to the airport with me last week, when we flew to Nebraska,
he rode with me. I drive sometimes. I just wanted to talk with him, not about
basketball. I just wanted to talk with him.  
  
Coach, we're going to go win that tournament. That's my goal, is to win that
tournament.  
  
This has been the message going forward. It wasn't as much where I'm probably
looking at the bubble and say, We have to win one or two games and win the
tournament. These guys changed my whole mindset, Coach, let's go win this
tournament. Derrick did. Four days, pack your clothes, let's go win it.  
  
Q. The new plays that you put in, how common is that? How much
confidence in Derrick do you have in terms of being able to execute things on
the fly?  
COACH BEILEIN: I haven't been an assistant coach, so I don't know what other
people do. We have, like, a format. You can change one cut. It can change the
whole play. They're high enough IQ kids to be able to get that.  
  
It was just a couple of things, things that we were going to run against
Purdue, that we didn't run, now you could run here because we knew them well,
just slight things.  
  
It wasn't that. That wasn't it. They really played with each other. We got a
lot of shooters, a lot of passers, a lot of unselfish players. That was the
difference.  
  
Q. Based on the last 10 minutes of the game, it seems like you had the
home-court advantage. How surprised are you being so far from home?  
COACH BEILEIN: The Michigan difference (laughter)?  
  
Wherever we have gone, I'm just telling you, if we play in New York, it feels
like a home game. The East Coast, right? Michigan has so many great alums, so
much support in that area of the country. A lot of schools in the Big Ten have
that. I just think Michigan is really special, that we have so many students
coming from there, just so much interest there.  
  
It was really nice to have that support. I could hear it. I think with
Maryland knocked out, some people might have been rooting for an interesting,
unique story, behind us being here. It's easier for probably people to adopt
us in those situations. When we played in New York, it feels like a home game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Kevin Huerter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32972)

### [Melo Trimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28602)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Northwestern - 72, Maryland - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Turgeon to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH TURGEON: Real quick. I thought Northwestern was the better team. I
thought they were tougher than we were. Really disappointed in the way we
finished the game.  
  
What a great crowd, crowd was amazing. We just didn't play with the toughness
we needed to play with. We didn't play very smart. They were good. Give them
credit.  
  
We missed a lot of free throws during a stretch. We couldn't score for a long
period of time. We just weren't tough enough to run our offense against them
tonight.  
  
Happy for Chris. Doing a great job with his program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions to Kevin and Melo.  
  
Q. Kevin, you played this team at their place a few weeks ago and had a
rough shooting night. Tonight 19 points. Was it just a bad night a few weeks
ago? How have you developed offensively as a player?  
KEVIN HUERTER: I think it was a bad night last time we played at their place.
For us, I mean, he got hot when we were there. When a guy gets hot, we
definitely try to give him the ball more.  
  
I just put it to a bad game. Tried to be more aggressive in this game.  
  
Q. Melo, you played against these guys a couple weeks ago. You scored 30
points. What did they do tonight against you to cut down the scoring?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I mean, they just took us out of our offense. We wasn't able to
execute the way we executed at Northwestern.  
  
They played in the gap. Everyone collapsed whenever I went to the basket. They
just tried to put a lot of hands up, tried to take charges, tried to find a
way to affect me.  
  
Q. Vic Law, what did he do tonight that you weren't able to stop a few
weeks ago?  
MELO TRIMBLE: He just hit shots. We wasn't able to keep him out of the paint.
He was able to do whatever he wanted. Like I said, he hit shots.  
  
Q. Now that this is over with, you do have the NCAA tournament to look
forward to. What has to change for you heading into that?  
KEVIN HUERTER: We just have to try to forget about this game. Obviously take
away what we didn't do very well, which is obviously we got out-toughed. We
didn't execute offensively.  
  
But we got to try to get past it, move on, realize that there's still great
things for us to do hopefully.  
  
Q. Is there any extra disappointment that you had a chance to play this
tournament so close to home, you're out after the first game?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I mean, we had a good crowd there, obviously. I mean, that was
the best that we've seen them all year. Unfortunately, like you said, we lost.  
  
But we have another week. It's the bigger tournament. So we're going to
prepare for that all week. Have a lot of days. We're just going to start over,
get back in the gym, just get back to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. You can return to the locker room.  
  
Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Mark, what did Northwestern do to kind of take you out of the
offensive flow?  
COACH TURGEON: They were just physical. They were sitting on a lot of things
that we do. But we allowed them to do it. They pushed us out a little bit
further than what we're accustomed to.  
  
We just weren't cutting hard enough, trying to score out of what we were
doing. We were just kind of going through the motions a little bit. Stay on
them to keep getting through it. I mean, just couldn't find any consistency
with our offense. Of course, we had that big drought. That was really the
game.  
  
Q. Northwestern had two different runs of, I think, 20-2, 20-4. Anything
you can say to the players during that to keep their spirits up, help in the
future prevent something like that from happening?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, I mean, this time of year, your defense has to be
consistent and your offense has to be consistent. We had a lot of turnovers
from our point guard position tonight. Then when we weren't going well
offensively, we stopped guarding.  
  
Yeah, it was a game of runs. It was amazing. We started well, and then they
were up eight or nine, and then we got the lead, went up ten, then they
dominated from there.  
  
We just got to play better. We just got to play better. We got to handle the
stage better and play better. Hopefully we have time to practice. Hopefully
we'll get better between now and our next game.  
  
Q. What did Northwestern do that was different tonight than the last
time you played them in Chicago?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, they had a pretty good player that didn't play, Lumpkin,
played tonight, didn't play in Chicago. Had a lot more depth. He made a couple
tough ones out there. Gives them more confidence. They had more confidence
because of it.  
  
Vic Law played much better tonight than he played there. Their defense was
much better. We were able to do whatever we wanted at their place. We couldn't
do anything tonight.  
  
I think Lumpkin has a little bit to do with that. Gives them more length and
athleticism on the perimeter. Then guys like Skelly, Skelly was a lot better
tonight than he was there, too.  
  
They all played better, and we didn't play as well.  
  
Q. You're down. The front court is struggling with foul issues. How
difficult is to keep changing the rotation over and over again?  
COACH TURGEON: We were in foul trouble tonight. We are who we are. We're
better than we played. We're 24-8. We were picked 10th. I've loved coaching
this team. Tonight we weren't tough enough.  
  
I told them starting Monday, the practice plan, whenever we practice, Sunday,
practice is going to stay practice plan number one. We're starting a new
season with a fresh attitude, see if we can play well in the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
COACH TURGEON: Thank you.

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Reggie Lynch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28390)

### [Amir Coffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32947)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Minnesota - 63, Michigan State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Pitino to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH PITINO: Toughness wins for us. We didn't have a problem with trying to
beat them at their game. I thought it was a little bit better to grind it out
than to play fast with them because they're so good on the break.  
  
But we just found a way to win. We continue to do that.  
  
I thought these three guys sitting here were extremely tough. Reggie obviously
gets his tooth all knocked sideways. We put it back in place. He comes back,
makes some huge buckets down the stretch, some great blocks.  
  
Jordan Murphy had 10 big-time rebounds in the second half.  
  
Amir obviously was terrific getting to the basket.  
  
We've won nine of ten. We're excited about that. We're proud of where we
stand.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Jordan, with the two early fouls, did you know you were done for the
first half? How did you change your strategy in the second half?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think mainly at halftime we knew we were down in the
rebounding battle. That was one thing we really emphasized during our talk in
there.  
  
I really had to get back to what I was doing, just rebounding. The rest was
going to fall.  
  
Q. What happened with the tooth getting knocked out? Any hesitation to
come back in?  
REGGIE LYNCH: I've never had my tooth knocked out before. When I got hit, it
was a feeling I never really felt. When I went down, man, something's wrong.  
  
Got pulled off the court. Coach checked to see if I was good. Went back and
checked it out, put it back. They asked me if I wanted to wear a mouthguard.
I'm not really a mouthguard wearer. I said, I'll do without it. Went back and
it felt good. It was kind of knocked back a little, so put it forward.  
  
Q. Amir, talk about the Wisconsin loss. You hadn't lost in a long time.
What motivated you coming into this game about how you played in that game as
a team?  
AMIR COFFEY: The Wisconsin loss was tough. We just got kind of handled in that
game, out-rebounded, out-toughed. We wanted to come into this game mentally
prepared and physically also, and really take it to them.  
  
Q. Jordan and Reggie, I saw you guys watching the end of the game that
preceded you guys. What did you make of the atmosphere during that game and
during your game?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I thought the atmosphere was really good. That was a really
competitive game between two really good teams. Their fans were really
cheering them on. I think they were giving a good, hard-fought game. Michigan
pulled it out. It was really close.  
  
REGGIE LYNCH: For me, it was a very great atmosphere. Down the stretch, it was
a very close game. Watching that and seeing Michigan pull out the win against
Purdue doesn't really surprise me. They are a very good team, as is Purdue.  
  
I'm just excited for having that type of environment, as well, coming down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Reggie, can you talk a little bit about the balance of this team?
Four in double figures, what that means to this team collectively?  
REGGIE LYNCH: This team has got a lot of weapons. I love playing with this
team so much. Like, if someone doesn't show up, there's a lot of guys that can
step up, including me. The last two times we played against Michigan State, I
didn't have the greatest game, and other guys were able to make plays.  
  
But this game is just great interior play. Our guards were getting to the
basket, making big shots. I just love playing on this team because we just all
have so many weapons. We all celebrate each other's success.  
  
Q. Do you feel like in some ways you guys are America's biggest secret
right now? You're rising up. Not a ton was expected of you. Now you're showing
what you got.  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, we don't really feel like a secret. We just go out there
and play, let all the other stuff take care of itself.  
  
Like coach says, he wants us to gain respect. I think that's what we've been
doing, just playing good basketball.  
  
JORDAN MURPHY: I agree with Amir. We just worry about playing. We know respect
is going to come as soon as we start winning games. Have to play our hardest,
leave it all on the court. That's what our main focus is on.  
  
Q. A year ago you're losing in this tournament by 33 points to Illinois.
Can you imagine a year later beating Tom Izzo and the Michigan State
Spartans?  
REGGIE LYNCH: This year I can imagine it because we knew we were going to be a
great team before the season even started. As the season has gone on, we knew
we were going to be one of the better teams. We're trying to climb to the
highest seed we could get. I'm just very proud of our guys, the way we've
handled the five-game losing streak in particular, just bouncing back and
winning nine of ten, I think.  
  
It's really just been a great year. We're not done yet. We just feel that we
need to execute down the stretch when it comes to Michigan.  
  
Q. Jordan and Reggie, talk about the difference between playing the
Michigan bigs as opposed to the Michigan State bigs. Very physical. Michigan's
bigs are versatile, can shoot the three.  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, Michigan bigs are really versatile. Mo Wagner is
obviously really good. D.J. Wilson is good, as you saw today.  
  
The difference between them and Michigan State, Michigan State has more
physical bigs, obviously, are less mobile. Miles Bridges is really mobile as
well. D.J. Wilson is a little taller, a little bit more versatile, I'd say.  
  
REGGIE LYNCH: Yeah, same here. I was just guarding in the post all day. But
now I'm going to have to move my feet on the perimeter, get to some pick-and-
pop action. Help Murphy out with D.J. Wilson down low. Just have to be in the
help.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thanks very much.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Pitino.  
  
Q. A year ago, where you were, does a day like this bring into relief in
your opinion mind? Does that feel like another universe?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I mean, I think it's excitement. There was nothing more
demoralizing than going to a conference tournament last year with three
players suspended, Joey King broken foot. I walked out of the elevator today,
there was our band, our cheerleaders. I don't remember anyone there playing
songs last year. Maybe they did, I don't know. I might have gone out the
backdoor (laughter).  
  
So this is what March is supposed to be all about. We did believe we would be
a good team. We just felt like we were going to have to eat crow for a little
while, for a couple months. Internally we believed that we were really going
to make a huge jump.  
  
Our guys have shown that. I mean, we've won nine of ten in this conference. We
won eight in a row. That's pretty special.  
  
Q. What happened with Akeem? What is the latest?  
COACH PITINO: I don't think it's looking good. We think it's a popped
Achilles, unless our doctors don't know. I think they're pretty sure of it.
It's a huge blow. If that is the case, I feel awful for Akeem.  
  
My heart dropped. It was a weird play. I didn't see it. All of a sudden, I
turn and look, he had crutches. It was kind of a crucial point of the game. I
couldn't tell at the time.  
  
But I hate it. I hate it. He doesn't deserve that. His leadership has
transformed this team. He's such a tough kid. I know he wants to play at the
next level.  
  
If it is the case, we'll be here for him. Our guys, they need to rally around
him because he deserves that. He came here with no ego. He transformed our
locker room. He made some huge shots.  
  
If it is a blown Achilles, it's a huge blow for it.  
  
Q. Obviously Akeem was put in the starting lineup for Dupree McBrayer.
Do you see him filling that role again? Who steps up if Akeem can't go?  
COACH PITINO: We will play Amir at the two-some and we will have to play Mike
and JR a little bit more at the three-some. We're going to have to adjust.
Obviously less than 24 hours is not ideal circumstances.  
  
But it's part of the game. I hate it. I truly hate it for Akeem. I really do.
He's a great kid. I'm very, very appreciative of all the hard work that he's
given us. You hate to see that.  
  
Q. With Wednesday's events, today Michigan starting to get a team of
destiny feel to them, what type of atmosphere are you expecting tomorrow?  
COACH PITINO: Don't get me wrong. What Michigan went through, it makes you all
think twice. I'm so happy for those guys, that they're safe, that they're
playing for each other. Something like that puts everything in perspective. So
happy that all those guys are safe. They were able to get here. They're
embracing the moment. They're not rattled by it, which is special to see.  
  
But I think we got a pretty special story, too. So our guys feel like they got
a little bit of that, as well.  
  
Q. A common theme in your locker room is not being particularly
respected, feeling of that. How big a driving force is that right now for your
kids?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I'm not a big 'nobody respects us'. I don't really get
into all that 'cause I think I'm confident enough in ourselves that I don't
really try to worry about that.  
  
Our motto going into the year was 'respect'. More than anything, it was about
respecting the opportunity that we had. We're a really young team. Obviously
we didn't get it done on the court last year or off the court. A big thing
that we talked about is taking ownership of who we are, what we're all about,
and respecting a terrific once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  
  
Then I would say after winning 24 games, winning nine of ten, I think it's
morphed into a little bit of the other thing.  
  
So I try not to worry about that too much. I know our guys, whatever gets them
to play hard, I'll roll with. But for us, we know we got a good basketball
team. You don't win eight in a row, you don't not lose in February, and not
have a good team.  
  
We'll see where that takes us. I'm extremely proud of our guys. I think
there's been a lot of awesome stories in this league. Northwestern obviously,
what Chris did there, that's a Hollywood-type story, the way he's been able to
do it, build it the right way.  
  
Michigan, to get that scare. Thank God, everybody's fine. To win two games
especially.  
  
I think our story is great. We went into the season with a lot of question
marks, a lot of uncertainty. We ended a season with, you know, nobody really
believing in us. I'm not sure they should have. We just dealt with it. We
believed in what we were doing. We turned it around.  
  
Our players deserve a lot of credit for that. There's a lot of great stories
in this conference. I think it's a special conference. I wake up every day and
I kind of pinch myself that I'm a head coach at 34 years old in this league.
There's so many great coaches, great universities. The basketball is obviously
terrific.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.  
  
COACH PITINO: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Isaac Haas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27912)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 74, Purdue - 70, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with questions for Carsen and Isaac.  
  
Q. Isaac, how much of this was the struggles that you or any team would
defend what Michigan does with its length and shooting range?  
ISAAC HAAS: It was break down defensively. We weren't getting shots. They were
getting open ones. They made them. That's what won them the game.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) how would you say that changed the complexion of the
game?  
ISAAC HAAS: I honestly don't know. I felt like we were doing a pretty good
job. Right at the end, Biggie fouled out. That hurt. It's part of basketball.  
  
Q. Isaac, they had 18 second-chance points. What do you have to do
better to keep opponents off the offensive glass? Been a bit of a thing here
lately.  
ISAAC HAAS: Just step into our guys on long rebounds. When a three-point shot
is going up, you have to step up to them because it's either going to go in or
go long. We didn't do that tonight. They got offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Carsen, you are up three with 30 seconds left. What was your
confidence level at that point?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: What was our confidence level?  
  
Q. Yes.  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I think we were up two when P.J. went to the free-throw line.
I thought he was going to make the free throw. It didn't fall. That's it.  
  
Q. Carsen, can you walk us through the charge on the inbound, what you
saw, what you thought it was?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Just came down the court, did a cross over. He just kind of
jumped it. I was going to pull it out, but he failed. Just a good play. That's
it.  
  
Q. You guys obviously are disappointed, but you have more basketball
ahead of you. Talk a little bit about that, putting this behind you heading
forward.  
ISAAC HAAS: Yeah, so I would just say that, you know, we just got to work on
things defensively. We can't have breakdowns like that moving onto the NCAA
tournament because it's win or go home, like we are now.  
  
Every game could be your last game. You have to fine tune those things and
come into the NCAA tournament playing your best basketball.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, just put this behind us. We learned from it. There's
mistakes we made this game. Learn from it so we're ready for the games ahead
of us. Just trying to prepare now for the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Painter.  
  
Q. Matt, Michigan's second-chance points tonight, how much of that did
you see as them capitalizing, how much was it things you weren't getting
done?  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously, they get 11 offensive rebounds, we get 10. They did
a better job of capitalizing and scoring the basketball off their second-
chance opportunities.  
  
You have that a lot with teams that shoot a lot of threes. They had a lot of
misses. We did a good job of defending the arc. They were 6-25. With that, you
get a lot of misses. You have to step to your man, pick up the basketball, be
able to pick up the flight of it, pursue it.  
  
Give them credit for getting those offensive rebounds, but also give them
credit for scoring the ball.  
  
Q. The charge on Carsen coming out of the timeout, that would have been
a three-point play?  
COACH PAINTER: I didn't think he was there. He was turned, wasn't square with
his body. I thought it was a good move with Carsen to continue on because he
was so late in coming over there. You have to be set when he leaves his feet,
not on contact.  
  
A lot of those times, they got a tough time because they got to handle the
arc. Just because you're out of the arc doesn't mean it can't be a block. He's
got to get out of the arc. He has to be able to officiate that, then he has to
officiate is he set once he leaves his feet, not necessarily on contact.  
  
I thought it was an easy block call. I don't know how we didn't get that one.  
  
Q. First time was Wagner. This time it was Wilson. What kind of
challenges do they present?  
COACH PAINTER: We switched a lot more here in this game. With Isaac, we're not
going to switch. That's why you see him so productive, 17 points in 15
minutes, because we have a tough matchup.  
  
In that one stretch in the first half, we get up seven. I kept him in there.
We were trying to flip it offensively and get him the ball every single time.
Those guys were in foul trouble. Just score the basketball.  
  
On the other end, they really exposed us there. It was hard. It's hard when
they go that small for those guys to be able to handle that. With Biggie, we
just switch it, knock out of action. Then they try to drive us a lot, play off
the mismatch, whether that's a post-up or a drive.  
  
Q. Coach, Caleb had 10 points in the first half, just three in the
second half. Was it something different that Michigan was doing? How can you
get him the ball in the post more?  
COACH PAINTER: They were doing a good job of playing post D. Early on, they
were calling the fouls. As the game progressed, they stopped.  
  
But we had the ball at the rim a lot, whether that was Vince Edwards or Isaac
or Biggie, or drive some guards, we were around the rim. That's what you want.
You want the ball at the rim as much as possible.  
  
But it's just one of those games where we had some chippies not go our way.  
  
Q. With Michigan's last 48 to 72 hours, were you surprised at the energy
they had?  
COACH PAINTER: No. They're a good team. They're experienced. They have a lot
of guys that have been through it. So, no, not at all.  
  
We told those guys we were going to get their best shot. They played well
against us in Ann Arbor a couple weeks ago. I thought this was an evenly
played game. They have a distinguished team. They bring good guys off the
bench. They have good balance.  
  
When they stretch you out like that, it's really difficult. Sometimes in
travel, sometimes when things happen, whether it's an injury or an incident
like this, sometimes it can kind of refresh. You focus a little bit more. I
know that doesn't sound like it makes a lot of sense. When you've dealt with
it before, you have experience, like Walton, Irvin, Robinson, some of those
guys, it's like, Let's go out and have fun and play. Give them credit for
winning the two games.  
  
Q. You've been an outstanding free-throw team all season. Today you
missed more than you made.  
COACH PAINTER: It was just one of those things. We shot 82% in league play
this year. It was pretty good. So to go 6-13, it kind of shocks you.  
  
We had a chance to close this game out of the. The guys that missed a lot of
free throws, they closed out a lot of games for us this year. It's one of
those things. It's a law of averages. It's unfortunate. If we would have made
our free throws, we would have won the game. There's a lot of games this year
we can say we won it because we made free throws.  
  
Q. Isaac said you want to be playing your best basketball going into the
NCAA tournament. Do you think you guys are doing that right now?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think today we didn't convert. Sometimes it's hard to
say you're playing well when you didn't shoot the ball well. A lot of times
people equate that, a lot of fans equate those two together.  
  
You're making a bunch of shots. You guys are playing well. In reality, we
turned the ball over too much today. You can't have that many turnovers, get
out-rebounded, lose the possession game, think you're playing well. I think
Michigan had a lot to do with it.  
  
Hopefully we can get some time in the gym, practice, figure out who we play on
Sunday, and then play better Thursday and Friday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

### [Tum Tum Nairn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32948)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Minnesota - 63, Michigan State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: I've been very proud of this team the last 10-12 games. I have to
admit, I was disappointed today. I do not think we competed with the same
grit. I was worried about how my young guys would react to a half-a-day prep.  
  
So either the coaches did a bad job, or we just didn't play with the same
spunk we played with. We did a decent James Blake in the first half of staying
on the boards. That was the only way we stayed in the game. We kept saying on
the bench, How are we in this game?  
  
I give Minnesota credit. They must have checked us awfully well for us to
shoot probably a season low in both field goal and three-point. But I was
disappointed in our performance, I really was. I'm sure the players are, too.  
  
It's a learning lesson. It seems like the whole damn year has been a learning
lesson. We learned again today, if you don't come at this level, it's not an
AAU tournament, and play 40 minutes, you can play better the second half, you
can play better in different parts. It's not going to be good enough.  
  
I think we'll learn from it, grow from it, hopefully do a better job if we get
a chance to play again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. You just heard your coach say all that. What is your reaction? Do you
agree?  
TUM TUM NAIRN: I put that on myself, not bringing everybody ready to play. Got
to do a better job as a leader of the team to make sure guys are locked in and
ready to play.  
  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, we just didn't come ready to play. Myself, I didn't
rebound well. We just got to bring it every 40 minutes, man. We can't just
come half of the game. We have to bring it every 40 minutes.  
  
Q. I hear there's a cliché that it's hard to beat a team three times in
a season. You swept them in the regular season. Did they do anything different
the third time around?  
MILES BRIDGES: They just played harder. They rebounded better. They just
wanted to win worse than us. That's on us. We got to come ready to play. We're
playing for a championship. We didn't bring it today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You may return to the locker room.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
COACH IZZO: I want to quantify his statement. Wasn't like we didn't care. I
just don't think some of our young guys understand. Miles played okay. We
didn't get much out of Nick early. We didn't get anything out of Cassius. We
got a lot better second half out of Josh than first.  
  
I just don't think they understand yet that it gets racheted up. That's what
these games are all about.  
  
We tried to warn them. I do give Minnesota a lot of credit. They played hard.
They played tough. I mean, we did out-rebound them, which is hard for us to
do. We're not that big. We were out-rebounding them by eight or ten at
halftime.  
  
We just didn't make some shots. We missed some layups. They did a better job.
They hit some shots. It's not like they shot the lights out of it either.  
  
So probably played a little better D than I give us credit for, but we did not
execute. We stood around a lot. I thought they just had more zip.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Do you think the guys seeing what happened today will have a
different approach next week?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you hope so. I said it's been a learning year for me and for
them.  
  
Maybe it's my fault, because I talked to them about it last night. I guarded
against this. I know what happens.  
  
You win a game. You get back to the hotel. You got an hour, then you're going
to a gym to practice on the next team.  
  
But that's what one-and-done time is all about. But they don't know that. AAU
ball, if you lose this game, you probably play another one in a couple hours,
right? Then another one tomorrow morning. If you lose that, you play in the
afternoon.  
  
I think that's really hurt these kids personally. I just think too much,
winning is never valued. It's not like they on purpose said, We're not going
to play hard. They just don't understand the rise of the level that it takes.  
  
The two threes they hit were just scouting report to the T. Scuffle dribble
left and shoot. One thing we've been really good at over the years, why we've
been a good turnaround team, is taking one game, by the next day being
prepared for the next team.  
  
It is a little more difficult when you have so many young guys. So I'll learn
a lesson, too. Maybe we got to change how we did it. I just couldn't believe
we were in the game, because I thought they played hard, and I didn't think we
played nearly well enough.  
  
Q. After a pretty big win yesterday, do you think their youth and their
ability to handle or not handle success played into this? Do you not allow for
that?  
COACH IZZO: I don't think it had anything to do with beating them three times.
Like I said, we played them so long ago, I feel like we played them last year.
In fact, one of the games was last year, 2016.  
  
I don't think it had anything to do with that. It wasn't like they ran all
over us.  
  
I don't know if we didn't handle that, to me, the word 'intensity'. It seemed
like we just couldn't get through that you just got to play harder.  
  
Man, I got great kids. I got the greatest kids. I'm going to have to live with
it. It's part of the process. I hate the process, but it is part of the
process.  
  
Q. You mentioned having a very young team. They didn't seem scared to
me. Do you think there might be some nerves because there's freshmen and it's
the conference tourney?  
COACH IZZO: I'd like to say yes because it would make me feel better, but
nerves would make you miss shots, but I don't think it would make you not run,
not be up on ball screens. The things that we didn't do, I don't think those
are nerves.  
  
Missed free throws, missed threes, yeah, that can be nerves. I'm cool with
that. They should be a little nervous.  
  
That's not why we lost. We lost because we just didn't bring it early. I was
disappointed. There haven't been many times, guys, that I've been disappointed
in this team this year. Today was one of them. I'm disappointed in myself. I
must not have done a good enough job last night.  
  
We got beat by a team that's probably a little better than us, but it would be
interesting to see how Richard thought they played. They shot 40%, 31%. We
out-rebounded them. I'm not sure he's tickled to death. But they found a way
to win. Those juniors and seniors did a better job of finding a way to win. We
just didn't do as good a job.  
  
That could be in coaching some. Seriously, I got to do a better job. I just
felt like our players did not realize, you know, the sense of urgency is
needed for 40 minutes when you play in one-and-done time. It's such a unique
thing to do.  
  
So maybe this helps us. Maybe we'll do a better job if we get to play again in
a tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much.  
  
COACH IZZO: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

### [D'Mitrik Trice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32959)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Wisconsin - 70, Indiana - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Gard to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously extremely happy for our guys and proud of 'em. Thought
they played for the most part really well tonight. Shared the ball. They had
15 assists on 27 baskets. Really did a terrific job on both ends of the floor
defensively, other than a couple breakdowns here or there, to be able to try
to keep Indiana under control with what they can do offensively to teams was
evident here and yesterday with what they did to Iowa in the second half, Ohio
State at the end of the regular season.  
  
A complete team effort. I thought guys off the bench did a good job, as well.
It's always good to get that first one when you get to this point in the
season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Bronson, 15-point lead you had in the second half, they started to
make the run. What is the focus like at that point? What are you concerned
about most?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I would say we were just trying to keep our poise, not give
them anything else easy, not turn the ball over, and just get good shots every
time down the floor. So if we take bad shots, then it leads to, you know,
threes, transition points.  
  
We were just trying to take care of the ball, take the best shots possible.  
  
Q. Ethan, one of your teammates said he thought when you guys drew the
Indiana matchup, because you played well against them before, you got a little
bit excited. You had a good year against them in all three games. What's your
explanation for that?  
ETHAN HAPP: You mean personally or as a team?  
  
Q. Personally.  
ETHAN HAPP: Personally, the last two games started in doubles. I didn't think
I did as well offensively as I could have, even though the numbers don't show
it.  
  
I think the biggest thing is that we just come ready to play. We know they're
an up-tempo team. We want to control the pace. Not that we want to control the
pace, but we controlled the pace in all three matchups. We were able to do it
that way.  
  
Q. Bronson, Coach Crean was in there, couldn't say enough about you,
going against you. Said it was an honor to coach against you. I saw he said
something to you after the game. Would you be able to speak on that? What does
it mean to hear that from another coach?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I'm very appreciative of whatever he had to say about me. I
don't know what he had said. Whatever he said, thank you, Tom Crean.  
  
Q. Bronson, I think when Greg was talking about Trice earlier this year,
he said you'd been looking for a point guard to mentor. How do you think he's
played, especially down the stretch now, including tonight?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I'm extremely proud of him. I just got a question asked in the
locker room about, have I said anything to him about March. I pretty much just
said, I don't even really need to say anything about March because of his
background, where he comes from. I just need to give him all the confidence
out on the court.  
  
I thought he did a great job tonight controlling the pace, being a
facilitator, knocking down open shots.  
  
Q. You had a rough Big Ten tournament last March. Any difference between
a year ago versus now?  
ETHAN HAPP: I think we sputter towards the end of the year. Really picked up a
sense of urgency. Not that we didn't play urgent last year against Nebraska. I
think we just feel like there's more on the line.  
  
We came out more hungry than I think we did against Nebraska. I think we
played a little complacent. I think that was the difference between the two
games.  
  
Q. After that six-game stretch, now these last three, is there a sense
that everything is starting to come together for this team?  
D'MITRIK TRICE: Yeah, definitely. After the Minnesota game, we definitely felt
good about how we played, whether that was defense or making shots. I believe
we're finally clicking on all cylinders as of right now. We're finally back to
how we should be playing.  
  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah, I think we kind of picked up where we left off during
the Minnesota game. We all kind of, I don't know, are playing more together,
playing as a unit. We're having fun again. Making the extra pass, knocking
them down. Everyone on the court to everyone on the bench is electric, having
fun.  
  
It's a good feeling.  
  
ETHAN HAPP: I think for a while there, our offense kind of sputtered. Our
defense was keeping us together. Once we got the offense going, our defense
was kind of lacking. Now we're focusing on both. We've been doing a good job
of maintaining both, not letting one lapse.  
  
Q. D'Mitrik, you played a lot of minutes tonight, facilitated the
offense. At what point do you think you grew to the point where you could play
a game like this?  
D'MITRIK TRICE: I'd have to go back to the trust factor that Coach Gard puts
in me, allowing me to play these type of minutes, him trusting me with the
ball. Definitely having a couple of starts under my belt really helped.  
  
But just the preparation that I have to take each game to play these type of
minutes has really helped me.  
  
Q. Bronson, I think you were asked about maintaining the lead. You said,
Get good shots, maintain our poise. Against Iowa not too long ago, you did not
hold the lead. Did that help you in any way tonight, any lessons you took from
that game?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah, I think so. I think handling the press and handling
their pressure in general, I think we learned a lot from that Iowa game,
myself included, to go demand the ball, go get the ball.  
  
I thought we did a pretty good job of knocking down free throws down the
stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You may return to the locker room.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Gard.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a lot of experience, both as an assistant and head
coach, of winning games in March and going far. Is there something you've been
able to tell through the years that you can figure out if your team is good
versus very good versus great? Is it defense, camaraderie, senior
leadership?  
COACH GARD: It's probably all of the above. I mean, the terrific teams we've
had over the years typically have all three. Obviously senior leadership
helps. You have to be able to defend, you know, or you're not going to go very
far this time of year.  
  
I think having a looseness about us, too, helps. I don't try to pump any more
into the moment than what is, already what comes from the outside sources.  
  
I just tell them, Hey, play. March is for players. Go play. This is your time
of the year.  
  
I told them before the game, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here. There's
probably nothing I'm going to say in this pregame speech that you haven't
heard for the last four or five months. Here are a few keys, go play and have
some fun with it.  
  
They did that. I think the energy and toughness we played with defensively, as
I mentioned before, to be able to keep Indiana under wrap, so to speak,
offensively, from their offensive standpoint, I thought was a sign of our
synergy. Obviously getting shots to go down, our back court is pretty good
with the three or four guys I'm rotating through there.  
  
Everybody is contributing in a way that they can. That helps as you continue
to move through the month.  
  
Q. Momentum can be elusive. Do you feel the victory against Minnesota?
How much pressure did it relieve from these guys? I don't know if it
reestablished some confidence or got them back on track.  
COACH GARD: I think maybe more so than relieving pressure was we got back to
our identity. We got back to who we are as a program.  
  
Ohio State obviously was not us. It's credit to Ohio State. They made shots.
Once we tried to start to guard them, they were warmed up, everything went
their way.  
  
Defensively we got refocused on what was important. I think it was that
identity coming back, specifically from the defensive end. The energy, how
hard we played, those type of things. We fed off of that. That helped us on
the other end of the floor, too.  
  
When you can get contributions from a lot of different players... I was told
in the locker room we haven't had five guys in double figures maybe since
Prairie View A&M. That was a long time ago.  
  
If we can continue to get balanced, have a lot of guys contribute, it helps us
as we go forward.  
  
Q. Offensively I think you mentioned it earlier, the ball movement was
really outstanding. Have you done something different offensively to promote
that? Are the players just kind of catching it here at the end?  
COACH GARD: I think we've gotten better at understanding how important it is.
We have tweaked a few things and moved some people around a little bit. I
think the one thing that's helped is D'Mitrik in the lineup helps us move the
ball more, too. It gives us another ball handler on the floor.  
  
I probably played three guards more here in the last couple weeks. Just as
he's matured, I've watched him in that position. It's helped to take maybe
some of the pressure off the guys that have to do the ball-handling
responsibilities.  
  
It's a combination. I think we're maturing. Teams mature in different areas at
different times of the year.  
  
But they're playing very unselfish, which is good to see.  
  
Q. What are the breakdowns early that led to so many offensive rebounds
and the second-chance points?  
COACH GARD: We didn't block out. I mean, at one point in time when I called a
timeout, we had three guys outside the three-point line. We were in a scramble
situation, too. They had to rush to shooters.  
  
Basically we weren't getting bodies on bodies. Once we started to do that,
even rebound from the top down, too, that helped. Some guards got in and got
their face in the action, too.  
  
We just started to play a little more physical in the paint.  
  
Q. You were speaking about the senior leadership. Bronson made a big
basket at the end. How much of an impact does it make to have him back in good
health?  
COACH GARD: He's obviously played a lot of minutes in his career, from the
time he set foot on campus pretty much.  
  
These guys don't get too consumed in the moment. When the score gets a little
tighter, they continue to play on. They've been in these type of situations,
tight games before. They continue to play the next possession. Can't push the
panic button.  
  
When you have some experience specifically in the backcourt, that helps as
much as anywhere. Our two starting guards played as much as they have in their
career. That helps kind of calm the masses. When they see those two guys for
the most part playing under control, doing the right thing, it helps settle
everybody else down as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH GARD: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Juwan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30014)

### [James Blackmon, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27872)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Wisconsin - 70, Indiana - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Crean to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH CREAN: Disappointed with our loss obviously because they made some
really tough plays. There were times we didn't defend a shot as well as we
needed to. We didn't get down and double inside of the post a couple times as
quickly as we needed to.  
  
In all honesty, we missed a lot of shots that we've been making, especially
around the bucket. I know we got into the paint quite a bit. We just didn't
get as much out of there.  
  
But our guys didn't flinch in the sense of coming back. We kept coming.
Unfortunately, that last play Koenig made at the rim, that was an absolute
dagger. He is a tremendous player. As I said to him, it's been an honor to
coach against him. He has gotten nothing but better. He is going to be a long-
time pro. I don't know much, but he is going to be a long-time pro.  
  
They made timely shots, but he led the way. As good as Happ is, Ethan is very
good, Koenig is capable of so much. Unfortunately tonight that happened to us
a little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Question of James and Juwan.  
  
Q. You're one of the best scoring teams in the Big Ten, 81 points a
game. This is your third game against Wisconsin where you haven't scored 70.
Is it just that they have one of the best defenses you've seen against anyone
this year?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: I wouldn't say. Not really, it's on defense. I think it's
just the pace they play at. They slow it down on us a little bit. Sometimes
when our shots aren't going like tonight, it hurt us.  
  
Q. They have a very experienced team. They moved the ball well. How
tough is it to defend a team that always seems to find the open man?  
JUWAN MORGAN: It's very hard just because the ball moves faster than anybody
can physically run. I think once they got us in rotation, them finding the
open man, once we close out on him, there's another open man. Seems like we're
always in rotation. They were just finding people for the open shots.  
  
Q. Juwan, you've been playing well offensively as of late. What has been
going on for you? What was going on tonight with that?  
JUWAN MORGAN: It starts on the defensive end. Sitting down with all the
coaches, all the different players coming and telling me, that's the way it
always started for me last year. I had to get back to the roots of how well I
was doing last year. I started on the defensive end locking down, not giving
ground on any given possession.  
  
My teammates did a tremendous job of finding me in the open slots. My team was
moving the ball. Once we are really moving it, it opens everything up.  
  
Q. How tough is it when you're down 15 in that second half to expend
that much energy coming back, get close, then not have it come through for
you?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: Yeah, it was really tough 'cause we want to play at a
certain pace. We got them moving a little bit towards the end of the game,
speed 'em up. Like you said, the last play was kind of a dagger. Just a couple
stops we needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you. You may return to the locker room.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Crean, please.  
  
Q. The interior defense was really good last night. Tonight not so much.
Was that a product of Happ and Hayes being really good?  
COACH CREAN: No, I wouldn't say that. They got the ball deep. Two things; we
didn't have enough good ball pressure at times, and we didn't get down there
to go after the ball enough.  
  
They do a really good job of keeping the dribble going in the post. Our
guards, we left the bigs hanging out to dry a little bit at times tonight.  
  
It's hard because they can really pass and play. You have to come
aggressively. You can't come halfway or late. You have to come aggressively
and be in rotation a little bit against them. They put guys out there that can
shoot the ball.  
  
On the other end, I'd love to credit the defense, but we missed a lot of close
shots. De'Ron, Thomas, those guys missed close shots around the bucket that if
we make those, it's a different story. They made theirs.  
  
We were not nearly as effective getting down and causing the congestion on
their shot as we needed to.  
  
Q. I was sitting right behind the Badgers' best, heard Koenig said thank
you a couple times.  
COACH CREAN: I just shared that time with him. I pretty much said what I said.
Thank you.  
  
Q. Tom, they went through a rough stretch like many teams in the Big
Ten. What do you see them doing now?  
COACH CREAN: I don't know. I'm not good at that. I'm not good at dissecting
them. They got really good players. They got the most experienced team in the
country. They play inside, outside basketball very well.  
  
At the end of the day, they've got Koenig. He makes a huge difference. Just as
we went through the stretches where some of our guys weren't as healthy
affected us, probably affected them when he wasn't as healthy. He is a big-
time player. It's easier to say it now because we're not competing against
them. I'm not sure he's ever gotten the credit in this league he deserves.  
  
He doesn't play a game that promotes himself. He plays a game that wins. He
can shoot it. He's quick. He can get to the rim, pass the ball. I've been a
big fan for a long time. Now it's easier to speak it.  
  
They've got toughness. Showalter knows exactly what he's doing. They score
inside. The played faster in the first half when Hayes was in foul trouble.
They're a faster team when he's not in, in my opinion.  
  
Koenig, it's ridiculous how much he affects winning. I say that in a good way.  
  
Q. What do you think led to Thomas and De'Ron struggling around the rim
tonight?  
COACH CREAN: I don't know. They missed shots they usually make. It's one of
those things. I can't say.  
  
You have to play through the contact, okay? When you're going to play against
a Wisconsin team, whether it was when Bo first came into the league or whether
it's now, they're going to put their chest into you. That's what it is.  
  
I gave up complaining about that years ago, right? They're going to put their
chest in you. You have to play through the contact.  
  
But we didn't make those shots. It's not the only time we've gone against
contact. We didn't make the shots. But we were right there. We were getting it
in the paint. We also missed some jumpers we would make.  
  
I think we got a little frustrated because we didn't make the close shots. It
is what it is.  
  
Q. You were down 15, came back, made it a four-point game. What do you
like about your team being resilient?  
COACH CREAN: They weren't going to stop. Our guys have been through so much. I
mean, they deal with more than I could even possibly tell you.  
  
They weren't going to go away, our guys weren't. Like I said, we were right
there. We were gaining confidence. You just hold your breath sometimes when
Koenig has the ball. We didn't guard him well enough. We didn't guard the shot
well enough.  
  
The one thing about Koenig, if your hands are anywhere near the middle of your
body, he's going to go up and get it off quickly. We were a little late in our
rotations because we didn't go quick enough to the post, all right, which
spread them out.  
  
As far as the aggressiveness that we played with at the end, it was good. I
think we played aggressive throughout the game. Again, our hands weren't where
they needed to be on challenging shots. I think we'll be a little disappointed
with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

### [Scottie Lindsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32974)

### [Gavin Skelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32975)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Northwestern - 72, Maryland - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Collins to make an opening statement, then go
to questions for the students.  
  
COACH COLLINS: I just thought tonight was a high-level game. It's exactly what
we expected coming in here, playing a really good team, in front of all their
home fans.  
  
It was a game that we viewed as a great opportunity for us and our program.  
  
Obviously for us, it gave us the opportunity, again, to do something that has
never been done, which is too advance in Saturday in this tournament. It's
something we talked about. We talked about taking advantage of those
opportunities.  
  
You never know. You can never take for granted when you're going to get
opportunities to do something. Tonight we had an opportunity.  
  
Was really proud of our team. We had a lot of toughness. Withstood a big run
to start the game, then at the end of the first half, early second half.  
  
I thought McIntosh's three in front of our bench, when we were down 10, was
maybe the biggest shot of the game. Gavin drove in there. I guess I'll call
that a no-look pass. Bryant hit the shot. It kind of settled us, got us to
seven. I think it was our first basket of the second half. It kind of got us
back into the flow.  
  
I thought our defense in the second half carried us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Scottie, what was different defensively? What did you take from the
film session? What did you take from the guys who had defended Melo earlier in
the year?  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: In the previous game, Melo got a lot of points off curls,
ball screens. Our help line, it really wasn't in the right position.  
  
We adjusted how we were guarding him. I think with everyone in the right
positions, we did a better job.  
  
Q. Gavin and Scottie, you guys have had some moments in Welsh-Ryan. Most
of your good moments come on the road and in moments like this.  
GAVIN SKELLY: Yeah, you know, it's interesting going into different arenas and
playing. I think the great thing about our team, the weird thing about our
team, is we play harder at away games, I feel like. We unify, come together,
buckle down, get things done the way we need to, and win games.  
  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: Yeah, we definitely feel that when we're on the road, in
enemy territory, we definitely come together as a team. We want to come
together, going in there in the harsh environment, get a win.  
  
Q. Scottie, as coach said, there's a lot of firsts for this program this
year. What does that feel for you guys going through this right now, the
excitement about it?  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: Obviously we're super excited right now to be on the stage
where we've never been before.  
  
I don't really think that we realize what we're doing right now. I think, you
know, after the season, a couple years down the road, we'll realize what we've
done, what we've accomplished.  
  
But, you know, just being in the moment, it's awesome. Being able to be a team
that gotten wins in the Big Ten, broke our single-season wins record, made it
to the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament.  
  
It's an awesome feeling. It really shows how hard we've worked over the years.  
  
Q. You have the 18-round boxing match mentality. How does that shift
when you go into tournament play?  
GAVIN SKELLY: Yeah, you know, you carry those things over. A great thing about
what other coach does is he keeps us fighting, keeps us in the game. In those
18 rounds, we're pretty beat up and tired. Coach doesn't let us let up. He
doesn't overwork us, keep our bodies fresh. Every day we have to have a new
mindset and fresh mindset of winning games.  
  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: When coach talks about 18 rounds, if we lose one, it's not
the end of the world. We just want to make sure we win more rounds than we
lose.  
  
When we win one or lose one, we have to move on to the next one. Coach keeps
that fresh in our minds.  
  
Q. Hate to throw a Wisconsin question at you so quickly. You know
they're going to be incredibly fired up after what you did to them in Madison.
How do you think that victory might influence tomorrow?  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: Wisconsin is obviously a great team. We beat them on their
home court. We know on this stage, they want to win a championship, too.
They're going to play hard. We have their number. I think that's going to make
them play even harder.  
  
GAVIN SKELLY: I agree. I think also that, you know, we have the same taste
when we played, Maryland today. I think they will have the same taste when we
play them tomorrow. We have to kick it up a notch defensively and offensively
to beat them. Like Scottie said, they're a good team, but they're definitely
beatable.  
  
We have to come with a fresh, new mindset and a whole new round, hopefully
take a couple more.  
  
Q. Was getting Damonte Dodd in foul trouble a big point of emphasis?  
GAVIN SKELLY: Yes and no. It's obviously great to have a starter to get two
fouls early (laughter). I think that helped us out a lot. A huge thing we need
to do is stop Melo. I think we were successful tonight in doing that.  
  
But having Dodd pick up the two early fouls definitely helped us in our game,
for sure.  
  
Q. Scottie, I know this off-season was really important for you,
especially on the defensive end. Tonight you were asked to guard a lot of
guys, especially Melo. How important was this off-season for you to become a
different player on that end? How were you able to play three, four different
guys on the defensive end, do it with equal efficiency?  
SCOTTIE LINDSEY: This off-season was about picking up my work ethic, being
more disciplined, being a better player and teammate.  
  
With that, I think I was getting better every day, every workout, every game I
played.  
  
You know, playing different positions, I know that's what coach asked me to
do. I got to do what he asked me to do. I feel that I am a versatile player. I
can guard multiple positions.  
  
It was more about not being tired, trying to push through. You can't be tired
in these type of situations. That's not an excuse.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You can return to the locker room. Good
luck tomorrow.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Collins.  
  
Q. Vic has talked all year about how this team wants to be a different
team. You haven't reached the ultimate goal yet, but they have been different.
How have you felt watching them do that?  
COACH COLLINS: It's just been an honor coaching this group, really has. To
have all these guys believe in what we were trying to do from day one, when we
really didn't have much to believe in, but a dream and a vision. To see them
work for these things, that's what makes it fun for me, is just thinking back
of all the times I saw them in the gym. I saw them coming in at night, getting
together, talking about the game, how we could be better, that bad taste in
their mouths when we would have tough defeats, come up a little bit short.  
  
To see them come into this year and become the tough-minded group, we had to
win tonight with toughness. This was a difficult game. We played last night.
They were fresh. You're playing basically in their home gym, in a great
environment. They got a lot of energy behind them.  
  
We got done 10. I thought we were a little bit tired. I really challenged
those guys about 16 minutes to go. Do you guys just want to go home or do you
want to try to win this game?  
  
They got a little bit fired up. They got a little bit angry. They said, We're
here to win. They believe it. That's what's cool. They not only say it, I feel
they believe not only that they should be playing on this stage, but they
should win on this stage. That just doesn't happen overnight. It happens with
a process through time and ups and downs.  
  
For me to watch these guys grow the way they have, be a leader for them, it's
been an incredible year to coach these guys so far this season.  
  
Q. From the time you got hired to now, what have you learned most about
yourself?  
COACH COLLINS: Well, I feel like I've improved a lot. I felt like I was
prepared to come in, but there's a lot of stuff I didn't know.  
  
We're a developmental program in every way, shape and form. Just like I ask my
players to get better, I hold myself to that same standard.  
  
I feel like I've improved handling different situations, coaching, all the
things it takes in running a program.  
  
It's been fun for me to grow with the guys. We're one. Hopefully you guys see
it. We're a together group. It's not just the players. It's the staff. It's
the staff with the players. This is a really together group. There's no
outside agendas in this group, other than everybody just wants to win.  
  
You don't get a chance to coach teams like that very often. I've been lucky to
coach a few, not many. You can probably count them on one hand.  
  
This is one of those teams. It's just exciting to be playing these kind of
games that matter and to see our guys come through on this stage. It's been
really fun.  
  
Q. Going back to all your time at Duke, from what you learned from that,
how can having a deep run in a conference tournament help you next week and
beyond?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah. I think some of my experience, just being in post-season,
maybe more so just how to manage the guys in between games, you know, they
need rest. They need to be fresh, how much preparation versus those things.  
  
I mean, I've been very fortunate to have gone deep in a lot of conference
tournaments, to be in NCAA tournaments, kind of witness Coach K, how he's
handled those situations. Certainly I've learned a lot from him with those
things.  
  
I think some of my experience there may help. At the end of the day, too, when
you're going through it as a head coach for the first time, it's different.
You can be on that one seat over, but it's a whole lot different being in the
head seat. I'm learning as I'm going, too.  
  
I appreciate my guys just hanging with me. I tell them all the time, We all
make mistakes. I'm going to make some mistakes. They're going to. At the end
of the day, we have to be tough, try to figure it out.  
  
I think that's what this team does. That's why we've been successful this
season.  
  
Q. There have been some times this year where your defense carried you
through some offensive struggles. Beginning of the second half, you were a
little disjointed. The defense spurred that big run. How would you rank that
second half of defense? Having Scottie, how important was that against Melo?  
COACH COLLINS: It was huge. Vic got two really quick fouls. It put us in a
bind. I think he had two fouls in the first three minutes. All of a sudden,
I'm trying to manage the whole first half with his foul trouble. He was going
to be our primary guy on Melo.  
  
Now it put different guys on Melo. It put Scottie on him a bunch, B. Mac, a
little bit of Isiah. Those guys had to step up and handle the deal.  
  
At the end of the day, we did not stop Melo. He got 20 points and 4 assists.
We made him take more shots. We didn't let him run wild the way he was able to
do it against us last month in Evanston.  
  
Just really proud of how our guys stepped up defensively. Their pressure
bothered us. They turned us over.  
  
Again, I thought the one shot that McIntosh hit right in front of our bench
when we were down 10, I felt we really settled in and really locked in after
that point and put together the rest of the game a pretty good stretch of
basketball.  
  
Q. When you started to make that comeback, did you change something
defensively?  
COACH COLLINS: We didn't adjust too much. Our main focus against them was just
trying to protect our paint. I know they hit some threes. They're going to.
They hit six threes. They're at their best when they're attacking downhill and
getting at your basket.  
  
Make them play on the perimeter, make them shoot a lot of jump shots. They
might make a few. Cowan made a few. Huerter made a few.  
  
Overall, I think we did a good job of protecting the layups, not giving up the
free throws. They're really good. Melo puts so much pressure, puts you in the
bonus. Those were the two things, keeping them from the free-throw line,
eliminating their layups.  
  
Q. What has McIntosh meant the past three seasons?  
COACH COLLINS: He's been an extension of me. It's something we talked about in
the recruiting process. He and I bonded right away. He grew up a huge Duke
fan. When I called him for the first time, there was an immediate connection.  
  
We just clicked. I started talking to him about my vision, what I wanted for
this program, how I needed guys. I needed a guard. I needed one guy that was
going to have the ball, that could be my extension, that could be my leader,
that I could coach throughout on the floor.  
  
That's what he's been from day one. Gave him the ball from the first day he
got here. He's grown to be an incredible player.  
  
I know I'm biased because I'm his coach. But to me, I thought he was a first-
team, all-league guy this year with what he means to our team.  
  
We rely on him to lead us in every fashion, to score, to assist, to be a vocal
leader.  
  
The thing now that we're whole, when we get production offensively from our
wings, that's when we become dangerous. It takes a little bit of pressure off
him.  
  
To get back to your point, it's meant everything to have him here for these
three years. I love our relationship, our bond. I love the command that he has
of our team out on the floor.  
  
Q. Everybody is asking about the defense because that obviously has been
a great recipe for your success this year. You're 10th in the conference in
field goal percentage, shot 60% last night, 55% don't. What's going on?  
COACH COLLINS: Again, I thought early in the conference season we were pretty
potent offensively. When we were 7-2, we won six in a row. We were healthy. We
were really clicking on all cylinders. I felt like our offense was in a really
good spot.  
  
Then Scottie went down. If you eliminate a key cog like that, no matter what,
it's going to disrupt your team. It enabled teams to really load up on
McIntosh and Law, which made them take tougher shots, more contested shots.
Their percentages went down.  
  
With Scottie out there, as well, it opens up things for our big guys because
we can stretch the floor. I think it's just been a function of him finally
getting back to 100%.  
  
He was out three weeks, but then it's taken him three weeks. He did nothing
for three weeks. If you do nothing for three weeks, it takes you three weeks
to get back.  
  
I think we're finally seeing him get his rhythm and his legs back underneath
him, which has been huge for our offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH COLLINS: Thank you. See you tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [D.J. Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32939)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 74, Purdue - 70, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask coach to make an opening statement, then go to
questions.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: We feel very fortunate about that win because I have so much
respect for the Purdue program, how good they are, how good they've been all
year.  
  
To be able to beat them today, especially in overtime, in a great basketball
game really, just a great basketball game. We're thrilled by it.  
  
Our kids early in the year, there was a lot of speculation about their
defense. There should have been. We were not a good defensive team.  
  
The growth, our success over this last month and a half, is in direct
correlation to how our defense has improved.  
  
That was a great display today against a team that has a lot of options. They
got some easy points in the paint. They made a few threes. All their threes
were well-earned.  
  
Really thrilled for these kids because they came on a mission to win this
championship. We talk about it every day. We're one day closer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Zak, you guys had difficulty getting here. You played a game. When
the game got deep, it seems like you in particular who had enough energy and
pop to get to the basket. Did you see some sort of fatigue on Purdue's part
that led you to believe you could get to the basket time and time again?  
ZAK IRVIN: Just a warrior mentality. Going into the game, not today, we didn't
want to go home. We wanted to be able to out last Purdue's toughness, how
physical they are.  
  
We knew it wasn't going to be easy, especially the game going into overtime.
We stayed resilient, were able to get the win.  
  
Q. I don't know if you're superstitious, when they're making halfcourt
shots before halftime, are you worried, switch back to the other jerseys? Are
either of you close to Spike, but did he reach out to you?  
D.J. WILSON: Regarding the first question, no. Once we got underway, we got
the ball tipped, we were fine. We didn't really think too much about the
halfcourt shot. It would have been nice going into the second half up four,
but it's basketball. It happens.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: With D.J., we decided to stick with the blue jerseys. I don't think
the practice ones were an option anymore.  
  
Spike reached out to me today. Speaks to his character. It was nice to see him
today.  
  
Q. Zak, with what you have done the last few times you played Purdue,
knowing how good a team Purdue is, what kind of confidence does that give you
in any game, regardless of who you're playing?  
ZAK IRVIN: A lot of confidence. I just think the way we were on it, how much
momentum we have with our team, we feel like we can do everything. Everything
is possible for us. Especially getting stops on the defensive end. When we're
able to do that, it makes us a very dangerous team.  
  
Q. D.J., last game was Mo, this game it was you. Anything that you saw
in the film that allowed you to be more explosive, get better looks this
game?  
D.J. WILSON: Yeah, we talked about it a lot coming into the game, how they
play two bigs. So we're mobile. We're agile. Taking them off the dribble is a
real good option for us. We did so today. It resulted in a win.  
  
Q. Zak, elaborate on the momentum. Have you felt this way at any other
point in the season?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think so. I think the backstretch of the Big Ten, we finally
changed our mentality on the defensive end. It just changed our whole season.  
  
We're playing real connected right now. We just got to do that going forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question I asked D.J. Last game it was Mo, this
game D.J. How have you been able to get those guys good looks, to take
advantage of their size, use it against them?  
COACH BEILEIN: Last year, D.J., we thought the best way for him to get out on
the court was to play center. He knows both positions.  
  
With Mo getting in foul trouble today, Marcus is certainly a suitable backup.
At 6'9", 225, they're just so big and talented. Haas is. I was actually
surprised that D.J. just moved his feet and used his length, not his strength,
used his length and his quickness to guard defensively.  
  
But offensively, if you had a shooting contest between D.J., and Mo, I don't
know who would win.  
  
The big man in most offenses, it's the easiest place to get a three-point
shot. Most teams have been switching screens. That's all we've been seeing. We
learned better ways to counter it. Our kids are getting some volume in their
shooting, in games, so they feel more comfortable.  
  
Q. Early in the game, it seemed like Purdue was able to get a lot of
deep touches in the lane. That kind of went away. Did you make an adjustment
so they could not make the pass into the lane, or you took it away somehow?  
COACH BEILEIN: We took it away. I think any time that you have big post men,
the only way you can counter it is to pressure the ball more, make sure that
they do not get looks inside.  
  
So we came in there with that philosophy going into the game, but we didn't
execute it. We just didn't do it.  
  
They have to throw it in there a couple times for them to realize that's not
the pressure you need today. That would be a pressure off most teams. You got
to step it up and really make them dribblers in those situations.  
  
Q. How much of a believer are you in tournament time? As you come up to
a tournament, are you a believer of getting hot at the right time as a
coach?  
COACH BEILEIN: I believe a lot in it. It's happened to us. It's happened to us
at Michigan. It's happened prior in my coaching career. It's just this time of
the year, you're trying to keep everybody fresh. I think it bodes well for a
team that really has no agenda, really loves each other, because other teams
have very little time to prepare for you. You have very little time to prepare
for them.  
  
If you have a high IQ team that is passionate about Michigan, passionate about
their teammates, it's much easier to coach them. It can be a lot of fun.  
  
We've been selling the fun of a run is really -- it's irreplaceable in their
lives really. You throw in what happened on Wednesday, now they got a lot of
memories. We don't want it to stop.  
  
Q. Yesterday we were talking about the travel, the quick turnaround from
the plane to the court. Was that a talking point at all today?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think I only mentioned it once today because it continues --
I continue to think about what could have happened.  
  
I think they all appreciate. I don't think they want to lose sight of that as
they go forward in their lives, of how different that could have turned out.  
  
I mentioned it once, how great it was to be here playing right now, right?
Carpe diem, seize the day today, because you're never promised another one.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BEILEIN: In the beginning of the pregame speech, just in the
introductory type, it wasn't fire and brimstone. It was just at the beginning.
It gets their attention a little bit, too.  
  
Q. You had some ups and downs this year. Today you played Zak all 45.
How important has he been as a leader off the court and today on the court?  
COACH BEILEIN: Zak and I and Derrick, we have a special bond. We've been
together here four years. I think we started recruiting them when they were
sophomores. I've just seen more than the common eye would see of what he can
do.  
  
But if he had any type of, again, agendas, if he had any type of bad
attitudes, poor body language in games, it would be much different. It's never
happened.  
  
He has handled this perceived slump that he's had by just becoming a better
defender. He cares about his team. It's like, yeah, he's going to miss a few
shots, but what he gives us in intangibles, the shot is not as important as
what he does.  
  
Dakota, again, he did a great job of not letting Dakota get shots or get the
high number of assists he gets many times.  
  
Q. Postgame I saw you waving to some Michigan fans. Your thoughts on the
buzz in the building?  
COACH BEILEIN: Wherever we go, I mean, there's a lot of Michigan people. We
love 'em. We love the way they're so passionate about their university and
their athletic program.  
  
So between them there, but my family was all in the front row. I got three
grandkids now that made the trip, made it through a 12:00 game. It was good to
see them.  
  
I think they're really happy to be another day in Washington. My son, Andy,
lives here in town. It was just great to see that.  
  
All the beige and blue behind them was great. I hope we can continue to do
that. Hopefully we can be selected for the March NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Corey Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32917)

### [Nigel Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32828)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Northwestern - 83, Rutgers - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Pikiell to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: Thank you for staying around. Not the way I wanted to end it.
Certainly wasn't the defensive team that we've been most of the year. Got to
give Northwestern a ton of credit. They played at an elite level today, I
thought. I thought they made our defense look bad, at times even when it was
good. Coach Collins has done a great job. They've got great players. You can
see why they're an NCAA tournament team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. What was the main difference during that long run Northwestern had?
What were they doing?  
NIGEL JOHNSON: I mean, I feel like we came out with good energy. After a
couple minutes, our energy kind of let down. They took advantage. They was
hitting shots. Didn't miss for a while in the first half. They got the
momentum going. They just stayed hot.  
  
Dug a hole for ourselves. Had to try to fight our way out of it. I think
that's what happened.  
  
COREY SANDERS: I mean, basically same thing he said. We went on a drought. We
didn't score, I think it was 11 minutes. If you're not scoring, you're letting
people score at a high rate. That's what's going to happen.  
  
Q. What are some of the positive things you're going to look back on
this season?  
COREY SANDERS: You know, just how hard we worked, how far we came. I think we
did a lot of big things this year for Rutgers basketball. That was the goal.
We're going to keep striving for that goal, move on and just keep progressing
like I think we did this year. I know a lot of people seen that. That's the
goal, just to keep progressing.  
  
When I look back, I know we worked hard, played hard. That's the biggest thing
about it.  
  
NIGEL JOHNSON: As was just said in the locker room, we did a lot of things
this year that nobody expected us to do. We did a lot of first things that
happened at Rutgers. It feels good for us to be part of that team. We have
most of the people coming back except for the two seniors. We have a lot to
build off of. We have a lot of learning experiences we can grow and build
from.  
  
I feel like we can only get better from it. Keep making our team happy, keep
making our fans happy, keep everything behind us.  
  
Q. You were able to get a lot of offensive rebounds in the previous two
meetings against Northwestern. Tonight not quite as many. Did you see anything
different that you noticed?  
NIGEL JOHNSON: I wouldn't say it was anything that limited our opportunities.
I would say at some point during the game, we kind of got flat, wasn't really
stepping on the pedal. They took advantage of it, playing hard, like it was
their last game. We could have played harder from the get-go to make it a more
competitive game.  
  
I don't think it was anything they did to keep us off the offensive boards.  
  
COREY SANDERS: Same thing he said. I would say our effort, but I don't think
effort was really the problem. I felt like we was playing hard.  
  
Yesterday we played like we had a choice. I think today was just kind of - I
don't know - a lack of want for the game today. That's the only thing I can
think of.  
  
Q. The last time you played Northwestern, you held Scotti and Vic.  
NIGEL JOHNSON: I think they took advantage of how we was in the middle of the
first half. They got hot. When they got hot, felt like every shot they shot
was going in. They took advantage of our lack of energy, I guess you could
call it. They was just hitting big shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, fellas.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Pikiell.  
  
Q. When you step back and look at the two days you had here, what did
the program gain? What did they learn from this experience?  
COACH PIKIELL: We've overcome a lot. 11 months when I took over the job, I
watched them work out for the first time, we've come a long way.  
  
We accomplished a lot of things. We got some respect back to Rutgers
basketball. I'm very excited to be the head coach. I love the university. It's
a great place. Building a new practice facility, great athletic director, a
lot of real positive things going on.  
  
Today we got blitzed by Northwestern. They're a good team. I thought we played
hard. We didn't make shots. We didn't make free throws, those kind of things.  
  
This has been a year we got a great staff together, taught a team that wasn't
great defensively to defend and rebound. Got them to compete every night in a
league that's excellent. Played the hardest schedule, our second hardest,
whatever you want to call it, in the league. Able to do a lot of firsts; first
road win, first tournament win, getting off to the great start in the non-
conference.  
  
Better days ahead for Rutgers basketball.  
  
Q. What was your message to the team in the locker room?  
COACH PIKIELL: It's always a sad day. I love basketball. I hate when we hang
up the uniforms. But to the two seniors, they've been great. They've brought a
lot to the program. Proud of them.  
  
I think this team was the start of making Rutgers basketball a special
basketball program. They've done it off the court and on the court,
academically.  
  
We're going to compete, be in games, play teams. We're not going to back down.
I was just proud. They've done that all year long. No matter what the score
was, they fought.  
  
Again, tonight, we played an elite team that was playing at an elite level. We
kind of got blitzed. Again, you saw some of our weaknesses. We're not a great
shooting team, not great from the foul line. We turned the ball over a lot in
the first half. A lot of things that caught us up all year came together in
this game.  
  
Q. What will you look for out of your players during this off-season?  
COACH PIKIELL: I mean, it's a building process. We just started, so... I mean,
we got to get better in every area. We'll do that. We'll start. We'll give
them some time off. Then we have to improve.  
  
You saw our weaknesses. But I'm proud where we're headed. Again, have a great
staff. Work for a great athletic director. Building a new facilities. There's
a lot of great things going on at Rutgers. I'm excited to be the head coach.
We have a lot of work to do. I'll be on the road tomorrow. We'll keep working.
Again, we'll be back.  
  
Q. Based on where the program was when you took over last April to where
they are today, did they meet or exceed your expectations of where you are
right now?  
COACH PIKIELL: If you were at my first workout when I met with my staff
afterwards, I was very nervous about every game.  
  
Yeah, we overachieved. I'm excited about that. We need to do that moving
forward, overachieve.  
  
Q. I know you have spoken about the improvement with the team. Is there
something particular in the off-season that you're going to look for that you
feel you need to bring to the program in order to compete better inside the
Big Ten; better rebounding, better shooters?  
COACH PIKIELL: All of those things. I was the fifth coach in 11 years. We have
to improve in every area. We know that.  
  
It's a great league. These teams are going to keep getting better. Great
coaches, great rosters. We got to improve. We got to sit down, assess all of
our situations, all of our pieces, weight room, conditioning, get them in the
gym. The new practice facility is going to be awesome.  
  
We got to look at everything. We got to improve in every area. We'll do that.  
  
Q. You mentioned you have only two seniors graduating, most of your team
coming back. How much does that help in improving in year two?  
COACH PIKIELL: I mean, we'll see next year. We'll start in two weeks,
improving, working on the weaknesses. We'll get everybody in a room, let them
know what they need to focus on. We'll see where their heads are, too, in a
couple weeks.  
  
But it's a journey. I've been a part of these builds. I've been very confident
we're going to build this thing, the right way. It takes time. We got to make
a lot of improvements.  
  
You saw the improvements we made. Moving forward here, we got to continue to
do that playing in this league.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Peter Jok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26810)

### [Jordan Bohannon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32904)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Indiana - 95, Iowa - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go straight to questions for Jordan and Peter.  
  
Q. Jordan, what went wrong from your perspective in the second half?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: They made a run, and weren't able to capitalize and execute
what we wanted to on offense. I thought we were pretty locked in when they
made their first run the first half. We responded pretty well. Ended the half
the way we wanted to.  
  
They made that run in the second half. We weren't able to execute our stuff.
They shot the ball really well. We have to give credit to them.  
  
Q. Peter, your first points not coming till the 13-minute mark, what on
defense attributed to the slow start?  
PETER JOK: They were really keyed in the whole game. I wasn't trying to force
anything. I was just letting the game come to me. I was trying to find other
ways to get involved on offense other than just shooting.  
  
They was always there when I caught the ball.  
  
Q. How disappointing is it to have that happen in the second half, given
how the season ended, the improvements you made defensively?  
PETER JOK: I mean, we've been playing really well. Obviously today we didn't
play that well. But credit to them. They were really locked in. They played
really well. Like Jordan said earlier, they made a couple runs in the first
half. We came back to it. In the second half, they made a run, and we weren't
able to come back from that run.  
  
Overall, I'm still proud of the young guys from where they started to where
they at right now. We just got to keep going and playing, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You may return to the locker room.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach McCaffery.  
  
Q. 12 for 20 from three-point range, six for eight in the second half
for Indiana. Was it them just really hitting it or did your defense not --  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think it was a little bit of both. They made a really good
point. They had a 12-2 run in the first half, a 10-2 run in the first half.
They really kept our composure.  
  
In the second half, we did not. We started quick-shooting the ball. Some of
those threes were in transition. Some of those three, we weren't in their
space. Some of those threes, they got a lead. They were comfortable shooting.
It's a lot easier to shoot when you're up 13, 15, than if it's a one-
possession game.  
  
I thought they were playing really relaxed. A lot of different people were
making threes. You got to give them credit. They were moving the ball. They
played in and out. They shared it.  
  
They shot 68%. The first thing you got to do is give Indiana credit. They
executed. They moved the ball. They took good shots. But obviously from our
perspective, our defense was not nearly what it needed to be to compete with a
team that has that many weapons.  
  
Q. Fran, a couple guys, Nicholas, Peter had slow games today. What was
causing them some problems?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Nicholas had a very uncharacteristic game for him. I don't
remember him having a game like this in two years. He's always really locked
in. If he's not making threes, he's usually very effective. He was a little
bit sideways tonight for some reason.  
  
Pete, you know they're going to guard him a certain way. He had a couple looks
that normally would go in. They didn't go in. We were going to him.  
  
It's just unfortunate. He's had such a great year, such a great game on Senior
Day. It's just unfortunate.  
  
Q. I believe this was the first double-double of Jordan's career,
amazing for a freshman point guard in conference tourney play. Is he just
another great young guard or will we see him rewriting the record book?  
COACH McCAFFERY: He's already done a little bit of that at the University of
Iowa. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't continue. I think he's just going
to get better with experience.  
  
That's what's been most impressive. A lot of times when you have freshmen that
play well, one of two things happen; they either continue to get better
through experience, or teams figure them out and they're not as good.  
  
Well, your teams have tried various things with him, and he's still effective.
He's smart. He's tough. He's a tremendous shooter, but he's also a great
passer. He has great feel for how to play. His defense is improving. He's just
going to keep getting better as he gets stronger.  
  
Q. Fran, was it a bit of a snowball effect at all the second half
defensively?  
COACH McCAFFERY: You see this typically on the road. Team makes a run, and you
start quick-shooting the ball. They get some transition baskets. They get some
and-ones. This wasn't a road game, but it sort of had that feel.  
  
We let it get away from us because of our poor-shot selection. We were not
connected defensively the way you need to be to play Indiana.  
  
Tom runs a lot of good stuff. They go side to side. They have driving action.
They have post-up action. They have screening action. It requires you to
really be locked in and understand personnel.  
  
Other things happen. Jones comes in and hits two threes. That's a big bonus
for them. Davis was terrific, seven for seven. He does what he does, hangs
around the rim. He's a power pack there.  
  
We're trying to push some different buttons, get an offensive unit out there.
They go bigger, that creates problems. When it's all said and done, what you
have to do is just give credit to your opponent.  
  
Q. You shortened your rotation the second half, it felt like. What was
the reason behind that?  
COACH McCAFFERY: We gave Kriener a shot. Cordell obviously was good. Christian
wasn't feeling great with his back. He had a funny look on his face. He was
not right. He wasn't right when I put him in in the first half. I didn't go
back to him. He's out.  
  
I didn't go back to Brady because Isaiah was playing so well. I wanted to give
him some more minutes. Everybody else played who normally plays.  
  
I always feel bad I didn't give Dom more minutes. Again, when you get behind,
you're trying to get more offense on the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
COACH McCAFFERY: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Joshua Langford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32884)

### [Miles Bridges](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32885)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan State - 78, Penn State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Izzo to make an opening statement, then
questions for Miles and Joshua.  
  
COACH IZZO: I felt like we played one of our better games, if you looked at it
in all aspects. I thought defensively we were very good. Offensively I thought
we executed well. We shot well the first half. I thought we took a few bad
shots the second.  
  
Only complaints I had, I thought we got a little complacent the second half,
which you sometimes do. I thought the first half we defended well, but we
fouled too much. We let them go 10 for 11 or 9 for 10 from the line.  
  
I also think it was a tough game for Penn State yesterday. I've been really
impressed with the job that Pat has done. When I look at Rutgers, Penn State,
Nebraska, I think these teams are going to be really, really good next year.  
  
I feel fortunate to win. I thought these two guys played pretty well. Josh got
us going early. Miles got us going later. We're ecstatic to have a chance to
play Minnesota tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Coach Chambers talked about what he's seen from Miles and Nick, how
they've been vocal. Miles, what you have seen from Penn State, how have they
changed? How has this team changed since the last time you played them?  
MILES BRIDGES: Lamar Stevens, he has really improved a lot. Tony Carr, he's
gotten better, too.  
  
They're going to be great. They talk a lot. They communicate on defense, too.
They're going to be a really good team.  
  
Q. Josh, one of the things Mike Garland just said is these are one of
the games you played, it wasn't just grit, athleticism, it was intelligence,
too. Does it feel like you're a smarter basketball team on the court today?  
JOSHUA LANGFORD: Yes, I feel like we were a whole lot better. I feel like we
executed well. I feel like we've grown a lot since the last time we played
Penn State as a whole.  
  
Really, the freshmen, we aren't freshmen anymore. We're really sophomores.
Everybody has been stepping it up, giving 120%.  
  
Q. Miles, the game against Minnesota, was it important for you, the one
in January? Seemed like it got you going this season.  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, that was my third game back, I think. I struggled against
Penn State the game before. That game really got me going.  
  
I was at home. My teammates were behind me, too. I give all the credit to my
teammates for that.  
  
Q. Miles, both games against Minnesota were during the holiday break.
Compare the team's mentality to now in the heat of March.  
MILES BRIDGES: They really improved. They're one of the hottest teams. They
have two great guards in Mason and Briere. That's one of our main goals, is to
have the same defensive mentality that we had today, rebound the ball really
well against them.  
  
Q. Up next, a team like Minnesota. Having beaten them twice already,
does playing them a third time kind of make you a little wary? Things can kind
of change.  
MILES BRIDGES: Yeah, I mean, it does. We want to have the same defensive
mindset we had the second time we played them. Like I said before, we want to
rebound the ball and execute.  
  
JOSHUA LANGFORD: I think the biggest thing for us is to make sure we don't get
nonchalant about it because we beat them twice already. We have to come in
with the same focus we had in today's game, make sure we follow the scouting
report. Minnesota is a good team. We have to make sure we play like we did
tonight, play as a team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. What did you say to Pat Chambers there? Seems like a guy you like as
a coach. And was this one of the more intelligent games your team played?  
COACH IZZO: As far as Pat goes, you feel bad at the end of the game. I don't
know what was said. Officials are pretty good. They're not guys that go off
for no reason. I don't know if somebody said the wrong word. I've done that
once or twice in my career. I guess I can appreciate it.  
  
You hate to see a game end that way when a team is already down. I told him
that.  
  
You know what, I like his team a lot. When I watched these games yesterday,
watched them and Nebraska, I watched all the young guys. Then when I watched
some other teams that I think are going to be really, really good next year.  
  
I told him he just has to keep that team together. Watkins was getting better.
We did a pretty good job on him. As Miles said, Stevens and Carr are really
good players. They can play on any team in this league.  
  
I just told him, you know, I thought we played our best game. He didn't play
as well. Maybe the fatigue from yesterday, who knows.  
  
But I love his team. I think he's lost some games that came right down to
wire. Today the roof fell in. I've been there. That's what I told him.  
  
As far as the intelligence of our team, I thought the execution of plays was
the best it's been. At the break Tum had nine assists and zero turnovers. The
reason is we broke well, we defended well, rebounded well. The first time they
out-rebounded us by 10. We out-rebounded them by 15.  
  
I think that's the energy level. The ghosts of Palestra really helped them.
Great playing there. Love the venue. I didn't love the outcome. I think we've
gotten better and smarter.  
  
I said in the last 10 games our team is much, much better. Didn't always show
up with four of those losses. I stuck to what I said. We're not great yet. We
still have our moments when we do some things, but we're making some progress.  
  
Q. Miles is playing in his first post-season. Where have you seen the
most growth with him?  
COACH IZZO: He's just such a good kid. I don't know. You can get on him and he
doesn't waver. A couple times he didn't rebound well enough. A couple times he
wasn't ready to shoot.  
  
You don't have to say, Miles, will you please do this? Pamper him like a
superstar. You can coach him, talk to him, tell him.  
  
He was jacked before the game started. This means a lot to Miles, as it does
our other guys. Everybody else is growing in their game. He's growing with his
leadership, too. I told him it's going to be very important for his present,
his future, his long-time future.  
  
You know, I felt good how he played. Nick is playing better. Josh played
really well. But Miles is a special guy. You interview him, you'll love him.  
  
Q. Tom, every year you guys have a struggle during the regular season,
and when it turns March, you turn the calendar, become some different team.
What do you do to get to March? Look like a totally different squad.  
COACH IZZO: Are you an alum or what? Are you from Lansing or what? Last year,
we won a zillion games. We didn't just turn it on at the end.  
  
This year, I mean, we're a work in progress today. We're still working on the
progress. We still went over two hours for every practice this week, which is
a joke. But we did remove the diapers when the regular season ended, now we're
trying to move forward from there. We're still looking at fundamental things.  
  
This year, I'd say we've had some success in March. I mean, what basketball
coach doesn't like March? Everybody loves March.  
  
It was, like, Matt Costello and Denzel Valentine texted me at 2:00 in the
morning, which I chewed them out for why they were up that late. It was,
Coach, it's our time of year.  
  
I think there's that mentality at our place. We won 27 games for five straight
years up until this year. We weren't bad in those other ones.  
  
Your degree will be in the mail.  
  
Q. You talked so much about guys getting that one-and-done mentality.
This is the first post-season game for so many of your guys. How encouraging
was it to see them take that kind of mentality?  
COACH IZZO: It was very encouraging. We hammered on that in practice. Every
missed ball, every screw-up. Every player in America says, My bad. You say 'my
bad' in this tournament, you're usually going home.  
  
We just hammered on that for days. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, that was
constant hammering. I just don't think freshmen do understand it. I wanted to
have my seniors tell them. I looked around them, and Alvin was the only guy
around. I wanted to tell my juniors to tell them and Tum was the only guy
around. I had Eron Harris, Gavin Schilling.  
  
Like I always do, I called some former players to make sure they are texting
or calling my guys to inform them of the difference of the regular season and
one-and-done time.  
  
Q. You've been talking all year about getting maybe McQuaid going,
Langford. You get both them. You get stuff from Kenny today. How difficult was
it getting those role players to buy into their roles?  
COACH IZZO: I said if our wings could just shoot it like they shoot it in
practice, McQuaid especially. But Josh Langford was a lot more aggressive
today. Had five rebounds. You can just kind of look at his stats and figure
out how hard he's playing.  
  
I thought Alvin Ellis did a great job on Carr. We changed that matchup early.
He didn't shoot it as well. He forced a couple shots. I think my guys think,
If I guard better defensively, that gives me a license to take bad shots
offensively. I had to straighten that out in a couple huddles.  
  
I really thought all three of them did a good job in what they needed to do.
With Nick and Miles, Kenny played better, better defense. Give my staff
credit. I thought they worked hard on the scouting report. Give us credit, but
understand, too, we had three days. You take a chance when you do this. But we
looked at how Nebraska finished, and we guessed that Penn State, so we
probably put 75/25 into that. It almost changed.  
  
We had a leg up on what they could do, too. Understand that it was a little
easier for us than it was for them.  
  
Q. A couple games in a row the defensive effort has been better than
we've seen. Has this been something you've sensed has been coming?  
COACH IZZO: I did. Other than that first half when we fouled a little bit too
much, those drives. Not having Eron Harris, who is a guy that's athletic
enough to stay in front of people. We're mismatching a lot of things to try to
cheat those coverages.  
  
But I thought it was one of our best defenses. I'm sure, at the same time,
they had some shots they felt were good enough, and they just didn't go in. I
can't reiterate enough, that is going to be a really, really, really good
team. Kind of sad to see Ohio State, Nebraska.  
  
We have ADs coming out because of my favorite sport, Twitter, that everybody
is tweeting about this and that. We got to give guys the green light.  
  
Hell, I'm nervous. My AD hasn't called me, tweeted nothing. I'm nervous right
now.  
  
I think some of those teams are going to be really good. There's a lot of
young teams in our league. The veteran teams, like a Minnesota, like a
Michigan, are really playing well. Michigan played extremely well today, too.
Unbelievable what they went through. My hat off to John and his team, to
handle that adversity, and come back.  
  
Of course, Purdue is just solid as a rock. Wisconsin I think is bouncing back.
Our league is better. Got to get my pitch in for our league. Our league is a
lot better.  
  
I don't know if they're talking heads. I don't know what they are out there.
But it still bothers me that the perception of our league isn't what it needs
to be.  
  
I'm telling you, there's some good teams in the league. I've been in it 30
years. There's some very good teams.  
  
Q. This is the first conference tournament outside of Chicago or
Indianapolis in a century. Describe what changes to your preparation you had
this year compared to years past.  
COACH IZZO: I like it, but being a guy that's from the UP where you can go
from one side of the UP to another in about an hour. Getting to practice is a
little more difficult because the traffic out here. I mean, God bless you
people, I don't know how you do it.  
  
That planning was different. Is it going to be 20 minutes? We talk in miles.
You guys talk in minutes or hours, I should say, to get somewhere. You'll
agree with that? God bless you.  
  
That's probably the biggest adjustment, trying to figure out when to leave,
when to be places. The venue was awesome. It's different.  
  
I wish I had more time. I did do something. I got my players in the African
American Museum. That was only two hours. That was like the most awesome thing
you could do. I wish we had more time to go do some of those things. Two hours
was like you got in the front door. But it was still good. It was good for
them.  
  
I think there's some great, great things to do here. I know my wife's happy. I
might not be with the travel, but she is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much.  
  
COACH IZZO: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

### [Tracy Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25044)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 75, Illinois - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Groce to make an opening statement, then take
questions.  
  
COACH GROCE: Obviously I thought they played really, really well, shot it
well. I thought a big difference in the game was the turnover differential. We
had the majority of ours in the first half, had nine, five in the second half.
The points off turnovers was 12 to 5. Give them credit. They've been playing
well, especially offensively. I thought defensively they were good today also.  
  
Made shots, spread us out. They had guys make plays.  
  
We had our chances. Obviously we get down 20, then you fight back. A big part
of that was the guy sitting here to my right. His disposition, his fight in
huddles, the fight he gives our team. All of a sudden, we cut it down to
seven. We have a three-point shot in the left corner that was a good look that
could have taken it from seven to four. Instead we miss. They get a jailbreak
opportunity, or a runout, and now it's nine.  
  
I thought even at halftime going in, we had weathered a storm. Thought we
played with a little bit of toughness and grit. Come out the second half, cut
it to eight a couple times. They responded with a layup. A couple times we
didn't absorb a couple screens. They get a couple layups. They make a couple
threes.  
  
I thought that Walton was terrific. Certainly the other guys play well. But
he's certainly used the phrase 'head of the snake.' He has been playing well
for them the last 10 games. Gives them a great disposition at both ends of the
floor.  
  
I was proud of our fight to come back, especially when we got off to such a
slow start. Obviously really proud of this guy. I thought he really kept our
team connected and kept fighting through some adversity there throughout the
first half and the second half.  
  
Questions for Trace.  
  
Q. Tracy, you've had a long career at Illinois. I am sure this isn't the
way you wanted to go out. Share your emotions going off the court.  
TRACY ABRAMS: I just wanted to leave -- personally, I didn't have any personal
agenda, nothing like that. I just wanted to do what I can do to make sure guys
is ready. I was just trying to lead a lot, whether that's making guys better,
talking, whatever that covers. I just wanted to leave it all out there.  
  
Q. Tracy, you've been through a lot here. What have these last couple
months been like as the team tried to battle back?  
TRACY ABRAMS: It's been great, honestly. We've been through a lot, obviously,
ups and downs. I thought our guys, we was great the last month, the last
couple weeks or so. Our whole disposition, our will to fight. We didn't back
down, no matter what nobody said.  
  
We was in practice, helping each other out, doing the little things that
matter. That's what it's all about. Fighting back when your back is against
the wall. I can honestly say we got a group of guys that was real selfless and
bought into what we need to do to be the best team we can be.  
  
Q. What do you think about the future of this program as it goes
forward? What do you think you left behind?  
TRACY ABRAMS: The future's always bright for the Illini. Great program. Going
to continue to be a great program. Obviously I made a connection with the
younger guys. I gave those guys everything I got in terms of experience. They
watched me go through adversity and things allow that, watched my response.  
  
The sky's the limit for our program. It's going to continue to be the limit.
We never going to settle, regardless of what it is.  
  
Q. What did you feel like was the reason you weren't able to compete at
the start of the game?  
TRACY ABRAMS: Our guys was ready to compete. Like coach said, I think that's
the No. 1 team offensively in the Big Ten. When you play guys like that,
little things matter. Every play, every possession matters.  
  
Obviously, we could have been better. As guys and players, we definitely take
full responsibility for the start. But, you know, they made some nice plays at
the end of the day. Give them credit.  
  
Q. You were talking in the huddles. What were you saying while you were
trying to fight back?  
TRACY ABRAMS: It's not a quitting program. It's never been that way throughout
my six years here. For me as a leader, that's all I'm going to preach.  
  
I don't care the score. I feel like the score take care of itself. At the end
of the day, I want guys to continue to compete no matter how the last play
went for anybody. You got to keep moving forward. That's what makes good
teams. That's all I was trying to do, is keep guys motivated, give their all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Tracy.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Groce.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Malcolm struggled or what they did to keep
him?  
COACH GROCE: I thought they defended him well. Zak Irvin was the primary
defender on him. I thought he did a great job of making him work for
everything. It really required him to be very detailed in everything he did,
setting up cuts, screening well, coming off of screens tight, working hard to
get open. They just made him really work.  
  
Give Michigan credit.  
  
Q. He appeared to be limping in that game. What was he battling?  
COACH GROCE: I don't think that was a factor.  
  
Q. Obviously you had that run toward the end of the regular season.
Overall, look at the whole season. Why do you think it didn't come together
more?  
COACH GROCE: Well, I thought it did at the end. Obviously today we got beat by
a really good Michigan team that played really well.  
  
I agree with Tracy. I think our guys learned what it meant to fight. I thought
we have had and have a very connected team that cares about one another. I
thought our practices improved. I thought defensively we got better. I thought
offensively we got better.  
  
I think the biggest thing is what Trace said, that transference from him and
the other seniors, but he did a great job of transferring to those, guys what
it means to defend, how hard you have to play, how we prepare for practice.  
  
Those guys have learned a lot. I think it's a big reason why we certainly
played our best over the last month. I give our seniors a lot of credit, in
particular Tracy.  
  
Q. You mentioned Tracy. The game he had today, how does it wrap-up the
commitment he's made to this program?  
COACH GROCE: He's been unbelievably committed. He's been through a lot. It
took him a lot over the last month to six weeks to get back to what I thought
he was starting to play like he had even prior to that stuff.  
  
That's a lot, what he went through. He and I have had a lot of conversations.
He's a special kid. I mean, he really is. Today I thought you saw him with a
lot of fight and a lot of care for his teammates, a lot of leadership today. I
was really proud of him.  
  
Q. A lot of fans are frustrated with where this program is at. What is
your sell to them about the future, where this thing's going?  
COACH GROCE: As I said the other day, what's interesting last week we beat
Michigan State at home. I got one or two questions after the game how
everything has changed. I told you not to get too far ahead of yourself.  
  
At the same time, I'm not going to let a missed layup and a 25-foot three by a
guy that's made 5-All years, four, five days later, make me feel any
different. That's not how I'm wired.  
  
I feel the same way that I did. Tracy echoed it as a player. That's more
important to me than what anyone else thinks. In terms of what they have
learned, who is returning, how they've been practicing, how they've been
playing, what we have coming in with our class, we're excited.  
  
I told numerous people about what we've done culturally over the last month,
six weeks, how we have kind of turned that corner than any time I've been at
Illinois.  
  
Also, we realize at this point we still have to take information in. By no
means am I saying this particular season's completely over yet either. I don't
know that at this juncture. We owe it to those guys to continue to not
necessarily think all the time about future, future, future. We owe it to them
to try to finish this thing the right way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much.  
  
COACH GROCE: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [De'Ron Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32227)

### [Juwan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30014)

### [James Blackmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32903)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Indiana - 95, Iowa - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Crean to make an opening statement, then take
questions for the three students.  
  
COACH CREAN: We've had a really good week of preparing. Our guys are getting
healthier. I think that's one of the biggest things for us. We have a lot of
energy. They've got just a tremendous spirit and tenacity. We can see it in
practice, in the games.  
  
I think we're a product of going through so many different things this season,
that when you get into a situation like this in a tournament, because of the
way the season started with a game like Kansas, or the really great wins that
we've had, some of the tough losses that we've had, it just forges something.  
  
That's I think what they've done. They just keep getting better. We obviously
had a great second half. We were right where we needed to be in the first
half. But we came out, I want to give Rod Judson credit for the idea to go to
the press early, get us really moving in the second half. That really helped
us sustain our energy, build it, take it to another place.  
  
We were completely ready to play because of our great respect for Iowa,
especially in the fact that we just played them. They played very well. We had
some great moments in that game, but we also had some very poor moments in
that game. We wanted to overcome that.  
  
Proud of obviously these guys, their teammates. Guys like Curtis Jones that
came in, Devonte Green, Freddie McSwain in the second half, our young guys are
getting better -- I don't have many older guys. As far as our juniors and
sophomores, they're improving, so are our freshmen.  
  
Great win. Excited to play tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Juwan, you held the first team Big Ten player to no points in the
first 13 minutes. What was your strategy, locking down Peter?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Like Coach Crean said, we have to give all the credit it to
Coach Judson, all the film he showed us, all the tendencies. We just had to
execute the game plan that he gave to us.  
  
We went out, and we were all connected. When he got away from me, a teammate
was there to step up. I remember specifically Devonte switched onto him. He
held his own with him. All five of us were guarding all five of them.  
  
Q. James, a heck of a performance today. You play Wisconsin tomorrow.
Your games against them were very close. Obviously you don't have a lot of
time. What can you do or do you have to do to prepare for tomorrow?  
JAMES BLACKMON: We know they're a great team, one of the top teams in our
conference. We just got to carry out what we see in the film room, what our
coaching staff gives to us, just like we did tonight really. Take it one game
at a time.  
  
DE'RON DAVIS: Like James said, just make sure we're well-rested, get off our
feet. We all been pretty healthy, so just continue to grow as a team, get
ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. De'Ron, you didn't miss a shot tonight. What was really working for
you?  
DE'RON DAVIS: Just being aggressive, playing low. Me and Coach Crean had
countless talks about me being low. That obviously works for me. Just being
active on the defensive end. Defense really works for us. Being active on the
defensive end leads to easy buckets on the offensive end.  
  
Q. James, when you're in a zone like that, does anything go through your
head besides catch and shoot? You were very intense out there. Is there a
thought process?  
JAMES BLACKMON: Really it was just locking in on the defensive end. That's
what I think got me going. Then, like you said, once I get in a zone, try to
take good shots, whatever is open, be aggressive with it.  
  
Q. James, what coach said a couple minutes ago about the experience,
you're forging something. From a player perspective, can you feel that? Is
something different now that you can sense?  
JAMES BLACKMON: Definitely, definitely. Like De'Ron said, we're all getting
more healthy. I feel like this is the healthiest we've been. We know we can be
a dangerous team when we're clicking like that, we're all playing together.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. You talked this season about what your team would look like when
those shots went down. These last two games, it seems like shots have started
to fall. Maybe there's a team-wide confidence forming.  
COACH CREAN: Absolutely. But I think it starts on the defensive end. We're
making shots that we have at times missed this year. But it was never a
question that we were not a good shooting team. It's a matter of making sure
that the ball is moving. Whether it's sets, concepts, free-flowing, whatever
it is, the break, the shot clock, everything in between. As long as the ball
is moving, we're ready to shoot, we're playing through the paint or the post,
those are when good things happen.  
  
Again, it all starts on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you have to do for Wisconsin and what can you take
from the two previous contests, both close?  
COACH CREAN: They're the most experienced team in the country. That's not by
accident that they're so good. They play well together. They can shoot. They
can post. They can rebound. They do a tremendous job of making it hard for you
to find those gaps in their defense.  
  
So we'll go back to the film. I know the coaches are already prepared. Our
coaches did such a great job. We mentioned Coach Judson. But the work that
Chuck Martin has done. It's constant, but especially this week, with the focus
on the guards, what Tim Buckley did, Thomas Bryant and De'Ron Davis, it's just
fantastic.  
  
We have such a great group of people that are coaching these guys. It's not
only an honor to work with them, it's an inspiration. I say that because we'll
get prepared for this game, and our coaches will have a lot of insights.  
  
We've already discussed it as a group. We'll get back and start discussing it
as a team tonight.  
  
Q. This is your first conference tournament outside of Chicago or
Indianapolis.  
COACH CREAN: It's my first one at Indiana, yeah.  
  
Q. What adjustments in preparation did you make?  
COACH CREAN: Nothing, no. It's been in the arena before, at Indiana, been in
the arena before when I was at Marquette. I think the bottom line is when you
make the lights brighter than what they really are, that's when you run into
problems.  
  
Our guys have played under some bright lights all year, going back to the
beginning of the season in Honolulu against Kansas. The biggest thing is to
play the way that you play, and not try to create or reinvent things, not try
to get out of the mode of what helps you win.  
  
I think our guys have been down enough roads this year to learn what helps us
win and what causes us to lose. The bottom line is to play to our strengths
the best that we can, keep it as simple as we possibly can. I think our guys
have done that.  
  
Q. Curtis gave you guys a boost off the bench tonight. What was the
motivation for going to him?  
COACH CREAN: He's earned it. I didn't play him the other day, and I felt bad
about that, because he earned it, too. We got hot hands in other areas.  
  
Part of it was Josh with the fouls. We played time and score, risk versus
reward, as long as we could with Josh in the first half. I'm not a steadfast
believer in sitting a guy with two fouls. If you don't need to put him in, you
know you have a long game, you have to balance that.  
  
I thought Curtis went in and did a very good job. I'm not surprised. He's
worked extremely hard. Again, he's a great example of our program, what
happens year after year. The young guys continue to get better and better.
He's part of that, as is Devonte, De'Ron, Freddie. Our guys, at times, they
cannot guard him in practice with the way he makes shots.  
  
I'm proud of the way they're all working. It's just an honor to coach him and
a joy to work with him every day.  
  
Q. It seemed like your biggest fist pump the night, about five minutes
left. You're up 25. You're diving for loose balls. If you're going to make 60%
of your shots, talent is going to win out. What is your secret for hustle?
Something you coach, something internal you bring out of the player?  
COACH CREAN: Toughness is a talent, just like hustle is. I've always believed
that. It comes from being ready. It comes from being alert. We knew we were
playing a very tough team.  
  
I think that's the bottom line. But I was proud of their effort. They had a
contagious energy on the defensive end with one another that led to even
better offense for us.  
  
I'm fairly subdued most times. Tonight that was one area that I was excited
about.  
  
Q. James had 23, only nine shots. Didn't have a big first half. Seems
like that's a sign of maturity for him, be patient, let the game come to
him.  
COACH CREAN: Absolutely. I thought his defense even got better in the second
half. That was key. He was aggressive. He was down and active.  
  
Again, when the ball is moving, I thought what James did better in the second
half even than the first was he cut. He was getting from one side to the
other. When he does that, whether it's off a screen, which is a little more
set, but when it's just moving without the ball, getting into the open gaps,
then separating off the dribble a little bit, he could have done an even
better job of that. We'll be able to show him some of that on the film.  
  
Again, he's a byproduct of what they all are. The defense was there. Our
rebounding was there. We weren't putting them at the foul line. The bottom
line is we were able to carry that to the offensive end and really move well
without the ball, and the ball moved accordingly.  
  
Q. Tom, talk about the two players from the state of Virginia you
recruited.  
COACH CREAN: Rob, I think he's got every member of his family here tonight,
which is fantastic. It's great to see those guys come back and play. We love
this area. We love recruiting this area. Troy would have been here. He just
got signed by Houston. Curtis, being back in that area. Obviously Victor
opened up a lot of doors there when we recruited him.  
  
It's fantastic. That's one of the beauties of the Big Ten now. I think it was
a great move for them to decide to come out here. I mean, it's a national
conference.  
  
It's a wonderful building. I mean, it's first class all the way. It's a great
city. We're right downtown, right in the heart of it. It's fantastic.  
  
It's fun for the players to be able to come back into this environment. It's
fun for the players that maybe aren't from here to be in this environment. For
us, it's fun to win in this building. Last time we were here, we had a tough
one with Syracuse.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

### [Bryant McIntosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28555)

### [Vic Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32318)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Northwestern - 83, Rutgers - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Collins to make an opening statement, then go
to questions.  
  
COACH COLLINS: Just really proud of my team tonight. We knew Rutgers was a hot
team coming in. They won two in a row. They were playing with a lot of
confidence, very physical team, very tough-minded, defensive team. I thought
our energy to start the game was really good. We were connected on both ends.
We obviously had that big run that kind of gave us the separation we needed.  
  
Thought we got contributions from a lot of guys, which is when we're at our
best. Balanced scoring, a lot of assists. When we do that, we're a pretty good
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Vic, last game against Rutgers, you struggled. What was different in
this game?  
VIC LAW: I think I was driving the ball a lot more, getting to the free-throw
line. I think when I was going through the slump, I settled for a lot of jump
shots, been off balance a little bit.  
  
Tonight I got off to a good start, attacking the rim the first ball.  
  
Q. Bryant, you've been in some tough battles with Maryland over the past
few years. How excited are you to get another opportunity to go at them again
tomorrow?  
BRYANT McINTOSH: Yeah, it's a great opportunity. First off, you're basically
playing them in their home gym. To get another shot at them, I feel like we
played tired the last time we played them at home. It's just a great
opportunity when you get to play for a chance to go to the Final Four, the Big
Ten tournament. It's just a wonderful opportunity. I think all of us are
excited for it.  
  
Q. You went on a 31-0 run in the first half. What is it like when you're
going on a run like that?  
VIC LAW: I think it's an awesome feeling. It felt like we were clicking on all
cylinders tonight. We've been in some tough games the last two games against
Michigan and Purdue. Purdue, we couldn't make plays down the stretch.  
  
To come out tonight, to be as efficient and effective as we were offensively,
on the defensive end, to match Rutgers' physicality on the glass, it was a fun
night to play. Everything seemed to be working. Glad everybody was able to
contribute.  
  
BRYANT McINTOSH: I was just really happy with how we defended in that segment.
Coming out in the game, we weren't exactly happy with our energy defensively.
We didn't feel we were executing the game plan. We finally spoke it, spoke
about it. Coach got on us a little bit. We responded, finally executed the
game plan.  
  
Got things going in transition. Our wings really excel in that.  
  
Q. Vic, you were asked about your personal breaking out of that slump a
little bit. Team-wide, how contagious is it when everybody starts hitting
shots?  
VIC LAW: I mean, I just think tonight everybody was ready to play. I don't
think it was as much about me not being able to shoot the ball good or bad. I
just think everybody was prepared to play. We were really executing on
offense. We got a lot of good shots. Really driving the ball.  
  
I'm happy with me tonight. I think this is a team where anybody can shoot the
ball well.  
  
Q. Can either of you describe the reaction when Nate made the three at
the end instead of kicking the ball to Charlie in the corner? There was
celebration, awkward faces on the bench.  
BRYANT McINTOSH: Yeah, I think we were a little upset just because Charlie is
a guy that comes in every day, does his job. It's a role that is hard to
accept. You're not really a big part. You don't get to enjoy the fun things
that we do as far as playing in games.  
  
When we get him in, we'd like to see if we can get him a shot, get him
involved in the game. I think some of us were a little upset with Tap. We're
glad he hit the shot, but we would have liked to get the ball to Charlie.  
  
Q. Vic, after a game like Purdue where you struggled, do you do anything
differently leading up to the next game?  
VIC LAW: After the Purdue game, like I said earlier, when I watched the film
with some coaches, I thought I took a lot of off-balance shots, a lot of
contested shots, played into their hands defensively.  
  
Coming into this game, be a lot more aggressive, attacking the rim, try to
shoot free throws. I don't think it takes away my confidence at all when you
have a game like that. I think you just have to be just as aggressive, be
another key factor for your team, help your team win in whatever way possible.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, fellas.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Collins.  
  
Q. In years past, even this year, you haven't necessarily had the
firepower. Tonight we saw a lot of offensive firepower. I'm guessing it's
something you have known you were capable of.  
COACH COLLINS: You guys know earlier in the year when we were clicking on all
cylinders, our two wings was averaging about 30 a game. Scotti was averaging
16. Vic was averaging 14. That was when we were at our best. When we didn't
have to put everything on Bryant to be a scorer, we could just play and use
each other.  
  
If you look at our balance tonight, that's what I love seeing. The two wings
both getting 16, Pardon getting 13, McIntosh 13, Lumpkin getting 9, Skelly and
Taphorn and Brown giving us production off the bench.  
  
When we move the ball, get assists, that's when we're at our best. I think you
saw that tonight.  
  
Q. A lot of the key players in the locker room said when you were
recruiting them, you sold them on being the first to make history. How does it
feel to finally be in position to follow through on that?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, it feels great. We got an opportunity tomorrow playing in
a game against Maryland, have the opportunity to go to the Final Four, the
semifinals. I don't think we've ever done that as a program in the conference
tournament. It's going to be a great opportunity.  
  
We're not even talking about what happens after this tournament. We came here
to try to compete for a championship. I love the development of our program. I
love the steps we've taken year in and year out, the development of our
players.  
  
You're seeing a lot of guys out there that played a lot as young players, took
some lumps, won some games, lost a lot of games, got in the gym, got better,
got tougher, got together. Now, they believe.  
  
That's what's really cool for me as a coach. We come in believing we're
supposed to play with these teams, believing we're going to win these games.
That was a big step for us this year that I've really seen.  
  
Q. Dererk Pardon limped off. How is he feeling now?  
COACH COLLINS: He said he just twisted his ankle slightly. He was okay. Not a
knee or anything. Said he rolled over on his ankle. I don't anticipate that
being a problem for tomorrow. We'll get him some treatment. Should be ready to
go tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Obviously your dad has been watching. What has your communication
been like?  
COACH COLLINS: He wasn't able to be here this weekend. He's been working. They
got him doing some games this week.  
  
I talked to him before the game. He's a dad. We don't really talk too much
strategy. We don't really talk X's and O's. He loves our players. He's around
a lot.  
  
He loves their relationship that he has as a mentor. At the end of the day,
he's my dad, so he's boosting me up as my dad. He's wishing me luck, pumping
me up, giving me well wishes. It's been great. It's been great. Unfortunately
he's not here, but a lot of my family is, which makes it fun.  
  
Q. When you signed this year's class of juniors back in 2013, you talked
about how they could be a big factor. What do they mean for the team?  
COACH COLLINS: I think they mean everything. Those were the first guys. Sanjay
and Taphorn were freshmen. They're seniors now. They're my guys. They believed
since day one.  
  
The group of four juniors, they were the first group of guys that believed in
me and believed in us before there was a me and there was an us. I was never a
head coach. I was a rookie coach trying to sell them on a dream, sell them on
a vision, what this could mean for them if we could do something like this,
how excited people would be about it.  
  
To see that come to fruition for them makes me proud because those are things
we talked about when they were in high school. All they've done is come into
our program and worked hard, figured it out, led others, brought others with
them that are younger than them.  
  
I'm just so happy that that core of juniors and seniors are going to be the
guys to do this and to make the history and do a lot of firsts we did in this
program this year.  
  
Q. Last two games you played Maryland in College Park, down to the wire.
You're still in the general region. Something that brings out the best in you
guys, the best in them?  
COACH COLLINS: I just respect their program so much. For me, I've had an
opportunity to compete against Maryland for a long time, long before I even
came to Northwestern.  
  
The battles that I've been a part of in playing Maryland throughout the years
with Coach Williams, now Coach Turgeon, who has become a very good friend of
mine, someone I look up to. He's an outstanding coach. The way he runs his
program, the way his kids play, I have an amazing amount of respect for how
they do things.  
  
We've had some good games against them here the last couple years. At our
place, they've kind of kicked our butts. They did that last month. We need to
get rested, study up on those guys, watch the tape. We know there's going to
be a lot of red in here. It's going to be a pro Maryland crowd.  
  
I love seeing the purple. I love seeing the contingent. Our people are going
to be cheering loud. For all intents and purposes, it's going to be like a
road game, against an NCAA tournament team, has as good a player in Melo
Trimble as there is. I think it's a great opportunity for our team and our
program.  
  
Q. You talk a lot about staying in the moment, focusing on the task at
hand. How often do you think about the beginning of when you got here?  
COACH COLLINS: There were moments this year that I thought about it, when I
came out into the crowd in Welsh-Ryan, it was packed. I thought a lot about it
at the Purdue game last Sunday, when I came out and saw that crowd, I saw that
energy.  
  
I just thought back to when we first started, what it looked like, how we had
to work, grind, go through tough times, get our brains beat in, learn how to
figure it out and just fight, just fight.  
  
There have been reflective moments for me this year certainly. I like to do
that because we have worked incredibly hard. That being said, this isn't an
end game. To me it's just a beginning. I want to strive for greater heights
with this program. I want to be in the mix for conference championships in the
regular season, in the tournament. To do that we have to continue to get
better in a lot of ways. That's what we're going to keep striving for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH COLLINS: Thank you. See you tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Tony Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32878)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan State - 78, Penn State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Chambers to make an opening statement, then
questions for Tony.  
  
Coach.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: I thought Michigan State played with great energy. We had
opportunities early. I knew those first eight to 12 minutes were going to be
critical for us, our energy. To see the ball go in the basket, we didn't see
the ball go in the basket the first half. I think we shot 24%, 18 from three.  
  
Give them credit. They played hard, great defense. I still thought we had some
good looks. Just didn't go down for us.  
  
This is a process, an absolute process, for this team. You can't speed up the
process. We had a great day yesterday, celebratory day. This is the mental
toughness part of it, the inexperience part of it, that we have to go through.  
  
But we're going to learn from all these experiences. We're going to have great
leadership, and we're going to be able to fight through days like today and
understand that we got to get stops and rebounds.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tony.  
  
Q. What was the game plan going up against Nick Ward, some of the big
guys up in the post?  
TONY CARR: We just wanted to make it difficult for him, try to front him as
much as we could. Just kind of pressure the ball so the post entries would be
tough. We just wanted to make everything difficult for him. At the end of the
day, we had uncontested shots.  
  
Q. Tony, what's the fatigue like after an overtime game?  
TONY CARR: I don't want to say fatigue played a major part in the game. We
just kind of got out-worked. They played harder than us. They sprinted the
floor both ends extremely hard. They just out-played us at the end of the day.  
  
Q. What was the frustration like? Whenever you would get some offense
going, they would get a three-pointer?  
TONY CARR: You always want to end a game with a W. We was fighting back,
fighting back. They were going on a 10-0 run. We would fight back. They would
go on a run.  
  
Our frustration definitely built up towards the end of the game. I would say
I'm proud of my guys for keep fighting till the end. We're going to come back
stronger next season.  
  
Q. What do you take away from this season and experience being in the
Big Ten?  
TONY CARR: I just take away great memories, great experiences, playing on the
road in some hostile environments. Learning so much from coach. I'm just an
upperclassman on my team. I'm looking forward to working hard this off-season
and getting better and coming back even stronger next season for my team.  
  
Q. How was this Michigan State team different from when you played them
back in January?  
TONY CARR: I didn't see much change. They kind of played the same style, push
it up the court fast, load up on defense, make things tough for you.  
  
I wouldn't say I saw much change in them. The outcome of the game just
changed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Tony.  
  
We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What do you take away from this week for next year? Big win
yesterday, now a deflating defeat.  
COACH CHAMBERS: We got a good group, good group of guys, that are very
talented. We're going to work extremely hard. Again, it's a process. We got to
learn how to compete consistently, I think.  
  
I think we're going to do that. I think we're going to learn from all these
experiences, these close losses, throughout the Big Ten season, the non-
conference, how difficult it was. To be able to come here and get one. We
played at Madison Square Garden a few times, this group has. I think that's
going to bode well next year headed into the Big Ten tournament. I firmly
believe we're going to be in a better situation.  
  
I think these guys know it takes 40 minutes every time you step on the floor.  
  
Q. Ward and Bridges seemed like they owned the paint. What difficulties
do those guys present?  
COACH CHAMBERS: What I would say is they played much harder than the first
time around. They've grown up a lot. Coach Izzo definitely has his mark on
those two, for sure. They're competitive. They were talking way more than they
did the first time. Give them credit. They have really good leaders in Tum Tum
and Ellis. You can hear those guys talking out there, motivating the freshmen
to keep competing.  
  
That was the big difference, I felt like.  
  
Q. It seemed like Carr and Stevens didn't let off at all throughout the
entire game. Taking control of the offense, what does that mean for next
season?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I think Penn State fans should be really excited that those
two kids wanted to stay in the game, wanted to compete. They kept pushing our
team. We got a lot of options. Yesterday we had great balance. Today we didn't
have a great balance. A team like Michigan State, you need balance. The first
time we had balance. That's why we came out on top.  
  
Today we didn't. The fact that they want to stay in the game, compete, not be
subbed out, says a lot about their character.  
  
Q. With those two Ts at the end of the game on Carr and Stevens, how
similar was the frustration, especially going back on Sunday when Carr got it
then?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, I'm not happy about them getting a T. I discussed it
with them. However, I always see a silver lining, that they want to compete,
they want to continue to fight. They're winners. They're competitors.  
  
I mean, I don't want them getting Ts. They got to control their emotions. We
got to get stops, rebounds, all that good stuff. But the fact that they want
to keep competing, show some fight... We'll just learn from these experiences.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

### [Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30705)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Michigan - 75, Illinois - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Beilein to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: It's been an incredible 24 hours. At this time 24 hours ago, we
were board aborting a takeoff at a couple hundred miles an hour. What these
guys have been through the last 24 hours has been incredible. It's been
bonding. It's been emotional for many of them.  
  
It's made them so resilient. They played connected today like they were
connected yesterday when we got a hundred-some people off an airplane it
seemed like in two minutes.  
  
We just feel really blessed today to be in this situation, not only play, but
win against a good Illinois team. Illinois has been playing as good of
basketball as anybody in the country.  
  
For us to come out like that, they made their run, continue to hammer away,
was a great response by all of our teams.  
  
These three were absolutely sensational today. D.J., and Mo and our bench,
Mark, X, Duncan, a tremendous performance by these guys. I couldn't be more
proud.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the three students.  
  
Q. Derrick, was it a relief once you finally got on the court? Take us
through the emotion of everything.  
DERRICK WALTON: To be completely honest, it was just a relief once we got from
the airplane to the bus. For me, after that, I kind of let my shoulders hang
back. Kind of focused on what we had to do today.  
  
Like I said before, once we got on the court, we just back to doing what we do
every day. We just wanted to give it all, have fun with it.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Like Derrick said, I think the hardest part for all of us was
getting back on the plane. Once we landed, everybody was fine. We were excited
to get back on the court, get everything back to normal.  
  
Q. Zak, you're waiting for the couch, shouting 210. Talk about what
coach means to you.  
ZAK IRVIN: We all waited for Coach B to get back in the locker room. Had a
later water, threw it on him. It was fun.  
  
He's done so much for this program. He's developed players from the time
they've been here. You can use me as an example.  
  
But he's a great guy, definitely with the X's and O's. He's taken our team to
the next level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you guys go back to the locker room.  
  
Questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. Coach, Wagner had a lot of energy out there on the court. He plays
with a lot of emotion. What does that do for you guys as a team?  
COACH BEILEIN: We have a team here of really great kids. You don't see their
personality when they play. You see Mo's personality when he plays. He brings
us an energy to it. Kids just don't show it. Their body language is a little
bit different.  
  
Mo wants to win. He's very young. He's 19 years old. His parents came from
Germany to watch him today. He is just a pleasure to coach.  
  
I don't know if I've seen a more beloved teammate over the time. We've had a
lot of great players that are all beloved. He's as good as any of them as far
as the way his teammates feel about him.  
  
Q. I know there's been a tremendous amount of logistical challenges over
the past 24 hours. Couldn't help but notice is your team played well in the
practice jerseys. Are you planning to wear them again tomorrow or...  
COACH BEILEIN: I don't know if we have a choice. All the baggage is in the
baggage area of the plane. The plane is damaged. They're doing the
investigation.  
  
I don't know whether we'll be able to get them here logistically. We have
washers and dryers here in D.C. Our equipment manager, Bob Bland, through this
whole thing, was incredible. If it was a one-game series, we would have had
other uniforms to wear. But we got all three sets on that plane.  
  
Some other things you're not going to see, any more suits by me. I got one of
my suits here. The rest of them are under that plane. You couldn't repack. I
might have to make a visit to the drugstore, get some toothpaste, the whole
thing. We're here, bare bones.  
  
Q. Coach, unchartered territory the last 24 hours. Were you surprised
with the energy, how they came out? You had no idea what to expect.  
COACH BEILEIN: Last night, we got a hotel in Ann Arbor. We did our pregame
walk-through and film. I walked in there, said, We aren't doing this. We have
to let time take care of this a little bit.  
  
We had a couple of counselors at school come visit them. We're not talking
basketball till tomorrow. Even in the locker room today, until they came in, I
think after the anthem, they came back in, I could tell we were going to be
ready.  
  
But it was very quiet everywhere. I wasn't going to shout at them, What's
wrong with you guys? It's a big game. It wasn't a big game anymore. It was an
important game, but being safe...  
  
They're out there hugging their families hopefully pretty soon. It's going to
be good.  
  
Q. You talked about all the emotion with the players. At the height of
what was going on yesterday, how scary was that for you and them?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think I've been trying to put it back together. Kathleen was
reminding me who chose not to fly with us today, by the way.  
  
When I thought about that today, it was like a game. You know, when I watch
other people coach, my son included, great friends, I get so nervous. I want
them to win.  
  
When I'm in the game, you're at work. I felt we were at work yesterday. It
wasn't about it being emotional. What's happening? It's going to be, How can
we get everybody off this plane?  
  
The engine is still running. There's gas fumes coming in on everybody. When
the engine finally shut down, there was this big pop. I said, Oh, my goodness.  
  
But everybody was away from the plane. We were good.  
  
I don't think there was anything other than, All right, like a game situation,
what everybody does in their workday every day, they're in a crisis. They
don't cry, sob, get emotional. They try to find the answer, the solution to
this issue that we're involved in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Deshawn Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32827)

### [Nigel Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32828)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rutgers - 66, Ohio State - 57  
  
MODERATOR: We'll ask coach to make an opening statement, then we'll go to
questions.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: I lost my voice, so I apologize.  
  
Just a good win for our program. It's an Ohio State team and a program that I
have tremendous respect for. Coach Matta is a great coach. They got really
good players.  
  
I thought we played hard tonight. We've been in it every game. Really just
proud of our guys. They fought all season long. To out-rebound a team like
this by 16 rebounds just goes to show you, everyone chipped in today. Everyone
gave us something. Everyone that checked in the game helped us win.  
  
Just very, very thankful that these guys have jumped onboard and have worked
hard to make this a good season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Deshawn, Steve mentioned on the call a few days ago that you have
played so many close games, really hadn't until the Illinois game and now,
managed to win some of these games. What was the difference tonight in finding
a way to win this game?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: I felt like the guys pulled together more, you know, offense
and defense. Most definitely defense. We was able to fight and get a win.  
  
Q. Nigel, I know you grew up in the Virginia area. I was wondering if
you had a lot of family and friends here tonight? You set a career high by
setting eight free throws. Did you make a concerted effort to get to the
rim?  
NIGEL JOHNSON: Number one, I definitely had a lot of friends and family here.
I'm only 30 minutes away from home. I had a lot of people come out.  
  
For your second question, you said eight free throws? I wasn't really making
an effort to try to get to the line. I mean, I was just planning and taking up
the open opportunities. I had a chance to get to the rim a couple times. Ended
up getting fouled. I went to the free-throw line. That was one area we
struggled in all year. I tried to focus when I got on the line and make all
eight of them.  
  
Q. For either of you. The rebounding advantage, what was the key to
that?  
NIGEL JOHNSON: Rebounding, I mean, that's one area we've been focusing on all
year. Before we even pick up a basketball over the summer, Coach Pikiell was
drilling defense. As far as rebounding, one area we've been stressing all
year. To come out today when we're in the tournament, when it means the most,
to put a show like that on the boards, it definitely means a lot.  
  
I definitely give a lot of that credit to our bigs, C.J., Deshawn, Dika,
everybody. The guards to come out. Definitely shows a lot.  
  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: It's just toughness, like coach said.  
  
Q. For either player. The board in the locker room said 'new season'.
Simple message, but what did that mean to you?  
DESHAWN FREEMAN: I felt like when coach said 'new season', we 0-0. Win or go
home. I felt like it brung us together.  
  
NIGEL JOHNSON: To me, just like Deshawn said, everybody is 0-0. Nothing you
did in the regular season really matters to this point.  
  
Another thing is we've been talking about it. Since we've been in the Big Ten,
none of our teams ever won a Big Ten tournament game. That was one thing we
had on our mind before the game started. We wanted to be the first team to win
a Big Ten tournament game.  
  
Also 0-0 to me means, as we see every year in college basketball in March,
anybody can be beat. We always say, Why not us? I feel like we went out today
and made plays that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas. You may return to the locker room. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Pikiell.  
  
Q. When you look at the second-chance points, the offensive rebounding
numbers, what do they tell you?  
COACH PIKIELL: It was a huge, huge emphasis going into this game. They're big.
They're athletic. We talked about it a lot. Relentless rebounders was our
second key. I wanted guys to go for it. Again, they did a really good job.
They were active. We subbed a lot of fresh bodies in. I thought that helped
us, too.  
  
I like that number. That's the big reason why we're here today with a win.  
  
Q. For any program that's building towards something, there are certain
milepost games, rites-of-passage games. Did we just see one for Rutgers?  
COACH PIKIELL: You know, this team has really competed. We learned how to
compete this year. We couldn't close out some games. But it's a process when
you're building a program. It takes steps.  
  
I think this from top to bottom is the best league in the country. I know
everybody talks about other leagues. I look at Indiana, beat two best teams in
the country in Kansas and North Carolina. They're a 10 seed. This is a
terrific league. We got Rutgers going in the right direction. I'm very proud
to be the head coach. It's a great university with great people.  
  
Our team is trying to work hard to make this a real proud program. Just very
happy for our guys. It's about them. They worked. They had a great practice
yesterday. They came off that Illinois game, they lost six in a row, but they
kept fighting.  
  
Today, Nigel steps up and makes plays. Candido, who hasn't played a lot, steps
up and makes plays. They fight. I'm proud of the fact they continue to do
that. Hasn't always gone our way this year.  
  
Q. The way in which the team won down 10 points early, correcting at the
start of the second half, come out strong and take over the game, getting
contributions from so many guys from the bench.  
COACH PIKIELL: We're challenged offensively, so we do get behind in games, but
we kept fighting. I like the fact that we made free throws down the stretch,
too, in the game. We've been in that position before and haven't gotten big
rebounds. We did that.  
  
Again, we're playing a really good basketball team that's well-coached. You
got to fight for every inch. We don't have a huge margin of winning and
losing. It's not who we are right now.  
  
We're going to continue to fight. Like you said, I was proud, every guy that
stepped into the game helped us. That's what we need. We need 12 guys. '16
strong' is one of our sayings. We need everybody from the scout team to do a
great job. Anybody that checks in, Candido, Nigel, Candido stayed the course,
gave us great defensive minutes. We held a really good team to 57 points.
That's a great number for us. Keep them in the 50s. We talk about the speed
limit a lot, 55. To keep that team in that number is a good thing.  
  
Q. Your first thoughts on Northwestern? Play them for a third time.  
COACH PIKIELL: Terrific. I mean, Coach Collins has done an unbelievable job.
They have very good players. It's a really difficult game, especially on half-
a-day prep.  
  
But our guys will fight. Again, I like their team a lot. They're playing with
great chemistry. I watched them play a lot. They're on a little bit of a
mission. We're trying to be on a mission ourselves. Expect it to be a great
game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season when you played at Maryland, after that game
you spoke about lost opportunities due to free-throw shooting, how you want to
do everything to kind of turn that around. As your free-throw shooting has
improved, is it something as simple as repetition, or something you did in
particular?  
COACH PIKIELL: You know, I think the guys have been on their own. We've been
emphasizing it obviously. We've been putting them in situations in practice to
make them. We had the right guys on the line tonight. Free-throw shooting has
been an issue for us. I came in the locker room, said, Take care of the ball,
get the shot up.  
  
They responded the right way. We took care of the ball in the second half,
didn't give up opportunities. We don't have a huge margin for error. Every
free throw is big. Every turnover is big.  
  
We've been getting better the last seven, eight games in all those categories.
That's what you need to do. I'm happy for the improvement. The guys have done
that themselves.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: Appreciate your time. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Tai Webster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32802)

### [Evan Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32803)

### [Jordy Tshimanga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32804)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Penn State - 76, Nebraska - 67 - OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Miles to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH MILES: I'm obviously greatly disappointed that our season's come to an
end. We have a guy like Tai Webster who developed into an all-league guard,
have his career end. He's been a pleasure to coach.  
  
I have to credit Penn State doing the things, took away some of the things we
do well, and made enough shots to stretch it out in overtime and get the win.  
  
We'll take any, questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tai, talk about the overtime, what happened in the overtime? Did you
go ice cold during the overtime period?  
TAI WEBSTER: They just made a couple plays down the stretch. The ball seemed
like it wasn't dropping in for us. Had a couple good looks, but unfortunately
couldn't capitalize on those looks.  
  
Q. For any of the players. It seemed like the first time you played them
this season, Mike Watkins was held in check. He had a big game tonight. Did
you try to guard him differently tonight?  
EVAN TAYLOR: Honestly, I mean, the game plan was the same. Obviously he's a
good player. Good players are going to make plays.  
  
I feel like our bigs, they did a good job on him. Us as guards could have
helped more. I mean, there's not really much to say about it. Credit to him
having a good game when it mattered.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, you may return to the locker room. We'll go to
questions for Coach Miles.  
  
Q. Tony Carr has a lot of the final positions throughout the season.
Were you keying him towards the end with the final possessions?  
COACH MILES: Yeah, we thought that Tai was matchup on him. Tai is a strong
guard, Tony. He felt like he could go one-on-one with him. It got him in foul
trouble, though. I think that was a key part of the game. We talked on and off
about doubling. We went after one of his ball screens pretty hard the first
possession of overtime. We brought two to him. Then Isaiah Roby tagged. Threw
it back to Stevens for his second of the game. That was a big play, to get
overtime started.  
  
Then sure enough, we go down, I think a possession or two later, and Tai
misses a bonus and fouls out. Just kind of frustration. That kind of sums up
our year.  
  
Q. Along that line, how would you describe this season? You've had some
good wins, a tough finish, the rollercoaster nature of it.  
COACH MILES: As we went into the year, we knew we were going to be a little
bit short on outside shooting. At Christmas, we played probably the number one
non-conference schedule in the country, so we played Creighton when they were
ranked and healthy, at Kansas, played UCLA, we played Clemson at Clemson,
Virginia Tech, Dayton, a lot of quality teams.  
  
We were only 6-6 at Christmas, but we felt very good. We started out 3-0.
We're feeling it. Ed Morrow says, My foot hurts. That was kind of the
beginning of the end. He tried to play the next game. He didn't play for how
many? 1-6 in that stretch. Lost consecutive one-point games.  
  
I think at the end, there were some guys that were worn out, but I was proud
of them tonight coming out. Although we didn't have great rhythm, we fought
back, found a way to get it to Tai. Showed a lot of resolve that way. But
then, like I say, that play where Tai misses the bonus, Shep circles in and
out, hits the background, goes in. I don't know how you would have called that
one on a radio. That seems like it sums up our year. Simplest error, someone
makes a play on us, look up, you're dead in the water with two minutes left.  
  
Q. It seemed like you would go through long stretches where the offense
would hit a wall, then bounce back out of it. What do you attribute that to?  
COACH MILES: I think Watkins had a big deal to do with that. He had eight
blocks. More importantly, every timeout, we have it at the rim, twos and
threes. We have our numbers at 12 for 35 at the rim. You'd expect to shoot
55%, 60% at the rim, at least, even in a well-contested game.  
  
I thought they did a good job of protecting the rim, even in transition. We
had a few plays, one in overtime, where I thought we were at the rim and maybe
we had a chance to draw contact and get a foul. Penn State did a great job
defending. We just couldn't get anything going at the rim. That hurts us.  
  
Q. Tim, talk about your seniors, your two seniors. What have they meant
for you guys this year?  
COACH MILES: Well, Tai Webster is the one that plays, right? Tai has been a
kid that I'm proud of because he never quit. He came as a much-heralded
recruit, started on an NCAA tournament team, but wasn't very productive. I
think they called him the least productive Big Ten starter. That's not a great
reputation to start with, right?  
  
The next year he fell out of the rotation, then he fought back, had a pretty
good year last year, averaged over 10 points a game, even more than that in
the league. This year he's been really good for us all year.  
  
It's always the same thing with Tai. Guard their best player, score all our
points, right? I have a lot of respect for him not quitting, just staying with
it. A lot of times nowadays guys, if they're not getting exactly what they
want, they'll go. Tai would never do that. Had every opportunity to. He had
professional offers I believe at the end of almost every year. Back home, for
sure. He turned them down, turned down a lot of money to stay with his college
basketball career.  
  
Q. Coach, right after the game, your athletic director tweeted out,
Looking forward to next year with Coach Miles in charge.  
COACH MILES: I'm back (laughter).  
  
Q. What were you thoughts?  
COACH MILES: He and I talked over the last few weeks. There was no doubt that
he was with me and supporting me. I knew he would probably do something after
the season in his own way.  
  
He's a man that believes in us, supports us. Even when we were struggling, he
wouldn't waver. Although the media has a field day with it, I guess they're
just bored.  
  
He's been there and I'm going to come through for him. We're going to show him
his faith in us is justified.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH MILES: Thanks.

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

### [C.J. Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32829)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rutgers - 66, Ohio State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to go to questions for the two students.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JAE'SEAN TATE: Right now, I really can't answer that. I'm sorry, I just can't
answer that. There's just a lot of emotion. I can't really think about the
game. I was so just so in it, I don't even remember the last six minutes.  
  
Q. C.J., I believe four of your last seven games are four of your
highest-scoring games of your career. What kind of change do you think you
made from day one to now? How proud are you? I understand it was a loss.  
C.J. JACKSON: Personally, I'm not really concerned about how many points I
score or anything like that. We didn't do our job today as a team, and that
showed. That's kind of all I'm worried about right this second.  
  
Q. C.J., I know it's a tough time to reflect, but what do you make of
the season you had? A disappointing end. How do you sum up how things went for
you guys?  
C.J. JACKSON: Personally today, for the team, we didn't earn to win today. So
in saying that, we didn't win. We haven't had our best practices leading up.
We just haven't had the right mindset all year.  
  
When you face any team in the Big Ten, whether it's a No. 1 seed or the last
seed, you're not going to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You can return to the locker room.  
  
We'll take questions now for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. What did you see go wrong in the second half there?  
COACH MATTA: I think it started in the first half. We got off to a really good
start. We went a stretch there where we weren't scoring. The rebounding was
just something that we had no toughness to go get the basketball.  
  
It was a cumulative effect. Just the look on our guys' faces in timeouts, 15
for 28 from the free-throw line, five field goals in the second half. I'm not
sure our minds were where we needed to be to compete in this basketball game.  
  
Q. Why do you think that was, guys' heads maybe weren't there?  
COACH MATTA: I don't know. Don't know.  
  
Q. Your athletic director put out a release giving you a vote of
confidence. I wanted to see what your thoughts were on that, what he had to
say.  
COACH MATTA: I think it's ridiculous that we have to do stuff like that. Gene
and I met a couple weeks ago. It's amazing what people do nowadays. This is a
very fickle business that we're in. Unless you're intimately involved on a
day-to-day basis, people choose the negative side of things. It's what they
do.  
  
Obviously, gas is poured on the fire. It is what it is. You know, it's sad
that sports has come to where you got to do stuff like that.  
  
Just coach your team. If they like it, they bring you back. If they don't,
they don't. But it's amazing. Really is.  
  
Q. You've been around the game long enough to go through a lot of ups
and downs. Is this as perplexing and in some ways a tough season, tough a
stretch?  
COACH MATTA: I would say so, yeah. Just from the daily battles that we've had
just in terms of getting guys ready to play, that sort of thing.  
  
We've said it all along, when this team has played not just great basketball,
but consistent basketball, we've been a heck of a basketball team. We've
beaten some pretty good teams this year.  
  
You know, tonight we weren't ready to fight at the level we needed to fight,
for whatever reason. March Madness, all that stuff, I told the guys, This is
where players play. This is where players make money.  
  
I had a guy one year go through the NCAA tournament, go the himself drafted
31st, wasn't even on the radar before. But, yeah, rough one, no doubt.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH MATTA: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Mike Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32807)

### [Lamar Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32808)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Penn State - 76, Nebraska - 67 - OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Chambers to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Proud of my team. Down the stretch, end of February, March, we
had some difficult losses. I felt like we were still competing, playing hard,
getting better.  
  
The last couple days, I really think these guys just banded together like
brothers and said, We can't go out like this. We have to go defend, rebound,
keep teams under 70, find success. That was the way it was Monday, then
Tuesday in practice.  
  
We just had a really good approach and a good mindset. I felt like their
energy, their juice. They were ready to compete and take that next step.
Again, for us, nothing is easy. We go into overtime. You don't know how this
team is going to respond because we've been there before, Indiana and Purdue,
to name a couple. Man, did they punch back, and they punched back quick.  
  
That was a major breakthrough for this program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Mike, you played this team three weeks ago, eight points, three
rebounds, two blocks. Seemed like you tripled all of your numbers. What
changed in the past three weeks?  
MIKE WATKINS: We worked hard in practice, we defended and rebounded. Practice
was very good. I knew coming into this game, it was going to be very good for
me.  
  
Q. Lamar, talk about your next game against Michigan State. You played
them before. What did you learn from that?  
LAMAR STEVENS: They're a really good team, with a great coach, Tom Izzo. We
haven't focused on them yet, haven't talked about them yet. We're happy to get
this win.  
  
But we're going to prepare. I think we're going to be ready by tomorrow.  
  
Q. When Josh Reaves had that short injury, you put Nebraska into another
scoring drought. Did you say anything as a team to try to make up for the loss
of Josh?  
MIKE WATKINS: Like when one man go down, we pick him up, injured or not.  
  
LAMAR STEVENS: I really credit our leaders and our upperclassmen. They always
keep us composed, being such a young team. So I credit Shep, Payton, and them
for really keeping us fighting, keeping us levelheaded, and not really
worried.  
  
Q. Lamar, down the stretch of the season, you came out on the wrong end
of some of these overtime games. What was going on today where you were
finally able to break through and come out with a win?  
LAMAR STEVENS: I think our non-conference and our conference play really
prepared us for times like this, going through so many close games, coming out
on the short end of the stick. I think it really prepared us. We learned from
those mistakes. I feel like that's what enabled us to come out and get this
win today.  
  
Q. You didn't win a game in overtime heading into this game. Did that
cross your minds at all? Was there any doubt?  
MIKE WATKINS: Going into overtime, coach was just like, Keep fighting, keep
fighting. As a team, that's what we went out and did. Not looking in the past.  
  
LAMAR STEVENS: Like I said, I think our conference play in those really close
games really helped us be ready for those situations, taught us how to learn
in overtime. I think it showed today.  
  
Q. Mike, today's performance, you set the record for rebounds in a Big
Ten tournament game. How does this affect your confidence going forward for
tomorrow and possibly beyond?  
MIKE WATKINS: Well, me personally, if I bring the same energy, and my team
bring the same energy, we should come out good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, fellas. We'll take questions for Coach
Chambers.  
  
Q. Coach, Shep has had an up-and-down season all year, then he had to
come off the bench today due to an injury. What did it mean for him to make
that three in the middle of overtime?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I thought it was huge for Shep, for his confidence, for his
teammates. You could see it, especially before the game, you could see it at
halftime when they were shooting around. He looked good. He felt good. That
experience of playing in the Big Ten these last couple years really shined
through today. He gutted it out, for sure, because of his foot.  
  
Q. Coach, I talked to you on Media Day. You told me how excited you were
for your freshmen class. Through an entire season with them, what have you
seen from them and how important are they to the future of this program?  
COACH CHAMBERS: The growth and the maturity, again, it's not going to reflect
in our wins, but the growth and maturity of this group, you could really see
it, I can specifically see it, from all the Albany game all the way to today.  
  
I mean, they've gotten a lot better. Their habits are stronger. They're more
confident. They know exactly what we're doing.  
  
That's only going to continue because they're very coachable. They want to
find success. If we continue on this path, the future's bright for Penn State
basketball.  
  
Q. With this being an overtime game, you have a quick turnaround, how
does your staff prepare for playing again tomorrow? What do you tell the kids
on how to prepare beyond saying, Stay off your feet, get some rest?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I actually met with our trainer and our strength coach. We
formulated a plan of what we're going to do tonight, how we're going to help
them with I'll just say cold tubs, get them fresh legs, make sure they're
getting rest, hydrate. Again, off their feet. Feed them, as well.  
  
It's a plan, for sure. I just told them, We'll do our job by watching Michigan
State. You have to do your job. That's listen, get them in the pool for a
little bit, get their muscles moving, then get ready to work.  
  
Q. Talk about Mike Watkins, a double-double tonight. What does he bring
to the team, his energy?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Just in general about the growth of these freshmen. Over the
last few weeks, I've seen a change in Mike Watkins. Got a long way to go, but
I've seen a change. There's more consistent effort there. There's more
willingness there. He's really starting to create some new habits. He knows
he's the anchor of this defense. He knows when he rebounds the ball at a high
level, and he's a great shot-blocker, obviously, that we typically win, that
we find success.  
  
The stat is, when we hold opponents under 70, we win. We went into overtime,
and we still held them under 70, which is a great thing. Mike is a big reason
for that. He's very coachable, very coachable kid. He is still learning and
growing.  
  
I'm excited for Mike.  
  
Q. Back to playing again tomorrow. Did you learn anything from the Hall
of Fame tournament earlier this year?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I don't even want to think about that weekend, to be honest
with you. We're a different team now. We're just a different team. We prepare
differently. Our approach is different. Our mindset is different.  
  
I'm just going to focus on what we're doing right here and right now.  
  
Q. Talk about tomorrow. What do you have to do? What are you going to
fix tonight to get ready for the game against Michigan State tomorrow?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We got to play hard, defend, rebound, bring some energy.
Everybody is going to tell them, How you going to be ready? They're 18-22.
This is what they live for. They would rather not practice. They would rather
play 30 games in 30 days. Trust me (laughter).  
  
Hopefully these young legs are ready to play. It's the minds that we got to
work on, make sure they're fresh. We'll do that.  
  
Q. You called this game earlier today a big moment for your program.
What kind of moment was it earlier this season when you played Michigan State,
what kind of moment could it be tomorrow if you play a winning style?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, Penn State basketball is inching closer, for sure. I
mean, that was a huge win for us at the Palestra, so many levels. Today, to
learn from past experiences from the Big Ten, to be able to not think those
negative thoughts, come out and compete the way we did in that overtime, it
just shows you the character of this team.  
  
We don't have a senior on the team. That bodes very, very well for our future.
We'll go out tomorrow, we'll compete. We'll get ready tonight. We just got to
compete, have a great mindset, see what happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH CHAMBERS: Thank you.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 23, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNC - 86  
  
OSU - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: We feel very fortunate. I think in the first half shooting the
ball as well as we did was huge for us. It was like a 20-20 game and then we
make a bunch of threes and stretch it out and four or five things that really
helped us. Cam Johnson coming off the bench made some baskets, Jalek came off
the bench and made some baskets, Theo down the stretch making all the free
throws. I thought in the second half we took the ball to the basket a little
bit more than in the first half. We had four points in the paint, had 16 in
the second half and we usually score a lot more than that inside the lane.  
  
But a lot of guys came in and did some good things for us. Our bench did
supply a lot of points for us tonight. But I thought during one stretch early
in the second half that Joel sort of kept us in there, that three he made
right in front of our bench in the dead corner was really a difficult shot. He
made it look easy and went right through the heart.  
  
And then when they did start fouling us, as I said, Theo made every free throw
and that's still -- I've seen him shoot them better than that, but he knows
which game I'm talking about.  
  
But we feel good about it and Chris Holtmann and his club is a good club and
Chris has done a remarkable job. Didn't take that job until June and got all
the new players buying in. He should feel very good about himself, what he's
done with the club.  
  
Q. Theo, what was the difference in your focus tonight as opposed to a
few nights ago?  
THEO PINSON: I think any team should have a great amount of focus after you
take a loss. We came into the game, everybody was, I know personally I was
eager to get back out here because of my performance in the last game. And we
have been here before, I'm a senior and I can't have games like that. I was
just ready to come back out and step up for my teammates.  
  
Q. Joel, seven players made 3-pointers tonight. When those shots started
going down, is that somewhat contagious for the rest of the guys?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think so. Whenever the ball is going in from the three point
line, that's always a plus and good for us. But I think that in the second
half, like coach said, we did a better job of driving the ball, and I think
it's because we were knocking down shots from the outside and we were able to
open up the lanes for us to get inside, guys started moving better on the
offensive end and making harder cuts, which that's something that we have been
emphasizing in practice and been working on. And I think we did a good job of
that in the second half and not settling for threes. But when they're going
in, that's always good for us.  
  
Q. Joel, their point guard C.J. Jackson, did you learn anything at all
and what it was like matching up? You guys had some pretty good back and
forth.  
JOEL BERRY II: I didn't know too much about him. We watched film on him and I
knew he was a good three-point shooter. I was a little frustrated in the first
half because I gave him a couple of open ones. But he's a pretty good player,
he can shoot the ball from the outside. But in the second half I just tried to
make it a little bit more difficult for him and just tried to get a hand up on
his shot, and I think one time I went out there and he shot an air ball. So
just being a little bit more active on the ball and trying to disrupt him. But
he's a pretty good player though.  
  
Q. For both players, how was practice the last couple days?  
THEO PINSON: After the game -- after the game on Wednesday? Yeah, Wednesday.
We came in the next day and we just watched the whole game from Wofford. And
the team, with a young team like this, I think I can speak for coach here,
it's important that we watch film and learn from our mistakes. When we see the
mistakes on film, like coach said, the eye in the sky don't lie. So when we
see the stuff on film, we know we need to improve on it. And we took a day off
and then tomorrow -- we actually had, I mean the next day we actually had a
pretty good practice. Guys was active, energy level was -- you wouldn't think
that we lost, but at the same time we got some veteran guys who know that we
can't sulk on it, we need to move on to the next game, and but at the same
time keep make sure that we keep that loss in our mind.  
  
Q. How good a job do you think he's done fitting in with the group and
jelling with y'all out there.  
JOEL BERRY II: Cam's a great player and he's a great shooter and you leave him
open, more than likely he's going to knock down the shot. And, like I said, he
comes in and he helps us because it spreads out the floor where we can get the
ball inside, which is what we want to do. We don't want to settle for three,
but having a three-point threat like Cam out there on the court is something
great for us. And I mean I know we all talk about him shooting and him being
able to score the ball, but if you look at what he did on the defensive end by
getting on the floor and getting us extra possessions and him just being out
there being active, that's what we want to do and that's what makes him a good
player. Not only because he can shoot the ball, but he's just out there being
active on the defensive end and that's what we want to pride ourselves on is
being a team that can stop somebody from scoring. And as you can see, he did
that tonight by diving on the floor and getting us those extra possessions.  
  
THEO PINSON: I want to talk to coach about letting me shoot the technical free
throws instead of Joel.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Hey, your percentage may be higher now.  
  
Q. What did you think of your team being able to respond and what did
you think of your team after a tough, tough set back earlier?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it was not a good loss for us. We were very disappointed,
Wofford did a nice job. They deserved to win the game because they played
harder, smarter, and better than we did. But you get disappointed with your
performance and I think as Theo said, the next day we didn't even put the
shoes on. We went in and watched the tape, the entire game, they listened to
coaches grade it while they were sitting there for almost two and a half
hours. Hopefully they learned something and came back on Friday and had a
good-spirited workout. And I think today, early in the game I thought we were
really focused, perhaps the ball going in the basket as I've always said makes
everything look better, even our defense. So I have to watch it on the film to
make sure, on the tape to make sure, but I've never believed you have to lose
to learn something. I like to win close and still learn something, learn the
same thing, I guess. But you have to congratulate Wofford. They made the plays
and we didn't.  
  
Q. Is there any concern with the inside outside balance?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, there was today, the first half for sure. We have had
really good balance. I think you can probably go back, and Steve might even
know this, I think you can go back and look at all our games. We have really
had great balance of scoring points inside the lane. And it's not just
throwing it to our big guys, I mean Garrison was 2-4, Sterling was 0-2, but we
had drives to the basket, Theo drove to the basket, Joel drove to the basket,
Luke got it inside, so it's not just those big guys. But I've always wanted
balance. I would take 13 threes every game, but also want more shots and more
baskets in the paint, too.  
  
Q. Jalek coming off a couple rough games, he goes out and has a turnover
that leads to a basket (inaudible) was that sort of a seamless approach for
you?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I hope so. He's -- defensively he's just got to get
better. He guards like I do and I'm 67. When I was his age I guarded a heck of
a lot better than he does. But he's got to do that. But today the turnover
that he made, as you said, you look back he had three turnovers and all three
of them were careless, just careless turnovers. A hundred years ago Coach
Smith said every turnover's either selfishness by trying to make a great play
or carelessness. And I think that two of his were careless and one of them he
was trying to force it through there and the guy wasn't open.  
  
But three turnovers, five assists, but yet a 4-5 from three-point line, that's
pretty doggone good. And as I said in the opening comments, I think that was
huge for us. But he's got to keep maturing and he's hurting a little bit
today. He dove on the floor yesterday in practice for a loose ball for the
first time in his life, he's 18 years old, first time he's ever dove on the
floor and he's hurting. But he sucked it up and played today.  
  
Q. Things aren't going to get easier as you run into ACC play. From this
past week and this game, what did you learn about your team and what kind of
improvements would you like to see going forward?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I still think we got to get better defending. Still think
we got to get better cutting down on the turnovers. 17 turnovers is way too
many. I don't mind 11, 12, something like that, because you are going to make
some turnovers when you run it up and down the court trying to go at a fast
pace. But so we got to do both of those, got to get better defensively, got to
stop turning it over, and I want us to get as we talked about with Greg, more
balance inside and outside. But really before today we have had pretty good
balance.  
  
Q. What do you make of Ohio State as you watched them on film? What was
your conversation like with Chris also?  
ROY WILLIAMS: First of all, I really like Chris and have a lot of respect for
the job he does. I watched his club and I am -- no one realizes how difficult
that is -- he came in in June and I might have missed this and so if I do just
change it, I think he's got seven new players, so if it's six or five, just
change it, but he's got a lot of new players. And every one of them is new to
him. They're defending, they're sharing the ball, they're trying to play hard,
their best players are getting most of the shots; that's what coaching's all
about. I watched him against Wisconsin, Michigan and Appalachian State and
they were impressive in many different ways in all three of those games.  
  
Q. You guys have done great the last couple years and so I'm just
wondering what your thoughts are on the one and done rule. You have had guys
who have come back and you've had success, as great a success as any, but what
are your thoughts on that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Do you play golf?  
  
Q. Yes.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Okay. Do you hit a fade or a draw?  
  
Q. A fade.  
ROY WILLIAMS: A fade? So somebody else hits a draw. Both of you are trying to
hit it to the middle of the fairway, right? So there's more than one way to do
it and for us what has happened has been enjoyable to me. But I don't mind
Antonio Bradley leaving, he was a first round draft pick. I don't mind Marvin
Williams leaving after one season, he was the second pick in the draft.
Brandon Wright was either 7th or 8th, something like that. I tried to recruit
all those guys too, I just don't want all of them. I just want one or two of
them every year, because I still think talent wins. But for us will are
different way, like in golf, there are different ways to do things and I think
for us the success we have had is the kids that have come and you know what
they like North Carolina, they like going to school there. So I think that, if
I'm sure, if I'm guaranteed they're going to be a No. 1 pick, I tell them to
leave. I told Tyler Hansbrough to leave for three years, but he loved being in
school, loved college basketball, wanted to win a National Championship. But
I'm not going to look down at those guys that recruit all those guys because I
recruit them too. But if I were to get one or two of them I would probably
stop and live and love coaching guys like Luke Maye too.

## December 23, 2017

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Keita Bates-Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29996)

### [C.J. Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32829)

  
_New Orleans, La._  
  
UNC - 86  
  
OSU - 72  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Give North Carolina credit, what I thought they really made
shots in the middle part of the first half. We had some defensive lapses, but
give them credit for making those plays, particularly in the, in that stretch
in the first half when they got loose for a couple. Obviously Felton hit four
on the game, hit a couple in that stretch, so that broke it open a little bit
and we could never get back within striking distance. So give them credit,
we'll learn from this and move on, just pleased with how our guys continued to
battle and compete.  
  
Q. C.J., you were running the point and carrying the offense. What did
you see early on? Was that something that you were taking advantage of or was
that the game plan?  
C.J. JACKSON: No, not at all. My teammates just found me in the right spots
pretty much, just kind of taking what the defense gave me the in beginning.  
  
Q. Keita, after two fouls in the first or in the first few minutes, kind
of what was your kind of mindset change, especially going to the bench early
on?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Just to stay focused and stay engaged, talk to the guys that
are out there, still be involved in the game. Just because I have two fouls,
I'm on the bench, doesn't mean I can't impact the game in some way.  
  
Q. You guys talked we saw you earlier about trying to take advantage of
the stage and the opportunity and you guys played hard, but it obviously
didn't click for you guys today. Why do you think you weren't able to pull
this out?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Like coach said, it was a span in the first half where they
kind of took control and they took a larger lead on us. I think we tied them
in the second half. So it was that moment or those moments in the first half
where we got to play for a full 40 minutes against a team like that or else
they will take advantage of like they did, so credit to them.  
  
Q. C.J., in the first few minutes of this game it seemed like you were
kind of the offensive kind of person or the guy making the majority of the
shots. Was that just guys finding you with open looks or did you just kind of,
were you feeling it early on or what was kind of going through your head,
especially early on when you were the only one scoring?  
C.J. JACKSON: Like I said earlier, kind of just what the defense was taking, I
was just kind of out there being aggressive, kind of just giving what the
defense gave me. I was open for a couple of shots and I knew Keita went down a
little early, so I had to be a little bit more aggressive than usual.  
  
Q. How does this loss feel different than those two earlier losses?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I feel we competed a little bit harder, for a more
consistent period of time. In those other games you could tell when you watch
the film that we weren't doing what we should have done. For most of the game
we did what we should have done and like I said it was just that first half,
that six, seven minutes, where they got on a run, got on a roll and we
couldn't recover.  
  
Q. For both of the players. You guys had three offensive rebounds. Was
it a matter of them shooting a lot of outside shots and just unpredictable
rebounds or was there just something going on where you guys weren't able to
clamp down on those? On the offensive rebounds.  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: They're a good defensive rebounding team. All five crash and
are willing to grab boards, but a part of our thing is to get back on
transition, so we find some one and two back.  
  
Q. C.J., being from Charlotte, did this game mean anything extra to you?
Was this a program that you were watching and cheering for all your life and
what's your relationship like with Carolina?  
C.J. JACKSON: I just treat this like any other game I would, it wasn't like
any hard feelings towards them or nothing, I just wanted to come out and get
the win for my team and do whatever it took to win and we kind of fell short
today.  
  
Q. Is Carolina a team you cared about as a kid?  
C.J. JACKSON: No, not really.  
  
Q. How much did the early foul trouble for Keita affect the game?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, yeah, he's pretty important to us, as you know. I didn't
get a good read on his first foul, his second one was probably a hand check,
so that hasn't happened obviously much this year, it hasn't happened really in
any critical game, but when you're losing a guy as important to us as Keita
is, you're going to feel it and we felt it. I put him back in there for a
stretch, in the first half, but he certainly wasn't able to play his normal
minutes there in the first half and I'm sure that was a factor in them
stretching the lead.  
  
Q. How important was he especially in the second half when in keeping up
with North Carolina especially tying it up 45-45 in the second half, how
important was it him getting minutes?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well he was good. We're different when we can play him and
J.T. their typical minutes, which we were able to do in the second half versus
the first half. I think everybody understands that there they're our two most
critical players and he's really, really important to us as we all know. So
yeah, it was good, we just cut it to 10 and they got a couple offensive
rebounds in that one possession, we just couldn't ever get it to real striking
distance, unfortunately.  
  
Q. Even though kind of the first half run, at the end of the first half
they kind of made a run that was very difficult to come back from, but
especially in the second half how meaningful is kind of tying a team like
North Carolina, especially offensively, how important is it for the team to
put up 45 points against North Carolina?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, I thought we did some good things and executed at times
well against their pressure, which was good to see. And I think we had nine
turnovers, I believe, in the first half and had five in the second half, so we
took better care of the ball had higher quality possessions. We just, your
margin for error is really, really thin when you're, when you got a 14-point
deficit and again, we just couldn't ever break to get it to like a two
possession game. But I was pleased with how we completed the game, including
the last five or six minutes, I was pleased with that. But we have got a lot
to take from that segment in the first half and we have got a lot to learn.  
  
Q. Micah played eight minutes in the game before half, was he still
feeling the effects of the injury, was he limited, was it just not the flow
not going there and Kyle Young left the court and went back to the locker room
and immediately reappeared what's his status as well?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, Kyle got poked in the eye. Micah is fine. Kyle got poked
in the eye and lost vision for a little bit. So we had to get him out. I
wasn't sure, but he had really trouble seeing. So he was able to go, I think
it just shook him up because he really couldn't see out of one eye for a
little bit.  
  
Q. You talk about that stretch in the first half, the way they hit those
threes, was that something that they are doing, is that something you weren't
doing, they hit some threes, but they're not really a predominantly three-
point shooting team.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: They're not. I think the kid who hit them was 7-20 on the
year. But he came in and gave them a big lift, Felton did, and they, in there.
A lot of it came out of their motion and their typical screening actions one
time in that as well, so -- and then obviously one we had a transition
breakdown on another one. So when your margin for error is really, really
razor thin, you just have to be able to eliminate those kind of stretches.  
  
Q. The way that C.J. came out and played early for you, talk about what
he did and how he was able to help bridge the gap with the early foul
trouble.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Well, he's been able to play really effectively for us for
most of the year, I think in scoring the ball. His assists, he had two
assists, three turnovers. He turned it over, had a couple there in that
stretch in the first half that really hurt us. But I was pleased with his
ability to defend his position and to make open shots. We desperately need
that and he steadied us a little bit when we had, when we were down a couple
guys. So that was good to see.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 23, 2017

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Wenyen Gabriel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34479)

  
_New Orleans, La_  
  
UCLA - 83  
  
Kentucky - 75  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: We got beat and every 50/50 ball. That's why you lose a game
like this. You settle for jumpers when you have opportunities to drive the
ball, which are harder, it's just harder to play that way. That where's the
winning spirit, where's the will to win, where's the tough plays when it's
time to do something. Then I'm trying to out trick another coach who can
coach, so I'm going zone and I'm switching this, you know my teams have never
done that, we just grind it out and play. Today we, I'm trying to do
everything to keep us in a game and I don't like coaching that way. We're
better than this and let's rack it up to two things: I tried a different type
of pick and roll defense, which obviously was really good today -- that didn't
work. And I think the other thing is, maybe it was Christmas, but they didn't
have that issue and they flew from across the country. And hats off to them,
they played well, they made shots they had to make, they made free throws they
had to make, Steve did a great job with his team.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOHN CALIPARI: We left some guys. We didn't go with hands up, there were
things that we did and again this is a team that past teams shot like that for
him, but this isn't that team, they're more of a 2-point shooting team. Part
of the reason we tried to do a little different in the pick and roll defense,
but that also opened up threes. Today they made a bunch. I don't know how many
they made, but they made every one down the stretch that they needed to make
and we missed that one and that two that we had a chance, okay, let's make
those, but that's not us, that's, you know.  
  
Q. Wenyen, how much do you think you gave the team a lift today?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: Today I think I was just playing my game defensively, I just
had open shots, my teammates found me and I had the confidence to knock them
down. Defensively we were trying to run our defense, trying to keep playing
with energy, and I just felt like I was bringing my energy to the game.  
  
Q. You did sort of seem to be a stabilizing force there when things were
really going bad for you guys to get you guys back into it. Can you see on the
young guys' faces in moments like that, they haven't been through this before
and maybe you can be a guy that steadies them a little bit?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: I don't really look at it like that, I just try to up lift my
team any moment that I can. Trying to make sure we stay focused, stick with
the game plan. We got to drive, we got to listen to what coach is saying. The
young guys are coming along, we're getting better every day and I think that
with this team through practice and big games like this we just continue to
get better. So games like this it's either you win or learn and I think that
we learned today and we're going to keep getting better.  
  
Q. Their guards made a lot of big shots down the stretch. How tough was
their back court to deal with today?  
WENYEN GABRIEL: They shot the ball really well today and hats off to them for
that. Obviously we got to learn from this and get out to shooters when they're
shooting threes and obviously moving on from now we got to limit them threes.  
  
Q. Was this an example of the growing pains that you said were
inevitable for this team?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, I think sometimes they, as much as you hate to say it,
you got to get knocked in the mouth and lose and it's got to hurt every player
and then they start figuring out, okay, not going to be able to play the way I
want to play. I mean, again, we tried to make the hardest plays when we were
in the guts of the game. The pass over the top for no reason, that was a big
play. I mean, and again, freshmen make those kind of plays. Have a chance for
a layup, I'm going to pull up and shoot this. Why would you do that? That's,
the chances of you making that versus that layup is a 40 percent swing. Why
would you do that? Well I thought I had it. No, because it's harder to drive.
I mean, this is all things they have to learn. Making the easiest play they
can make, yeah, but I don't get an ooh and an aww when I make an easy play, I
like to make this look away throw over my shoulder pass. That's what we're
dealing with right now. You know what, they're getting better. They're so much
better than they were a month ago. Today we played a team that wanted the game
worse than we wanted it. This is usually what happens. One team wants it more
than the other, one team's willing to fight, one team has a spirit about them,
they're bouncier, they're diving for balls, they're playing with more emotion,
you are losing that game. So we deserved to lose it.  
  
Q. You talked about the guys getting punched in the mouth and hurting a
little. Is it better now to go on a break and you can let it fester a little
or would you rather have them back in a game tomorrow?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, I'm not looking forward to seeing them tomorrow, so that's
fine. But they're probably not looking forward to seeing me either. This thing
that we're doing, this is really hard with young kids and no real veteran
leadership. I mean, UCLA had three guys that played in that Sweet 16 game and
played a lot of minutes. They had three guys in that Sweet 16 game against us.
So now their freshmen helped them today. Their freshmen did what they were
supposed to do. But their veterans were the guys that really hurt us. So we
can use that as an excuse, we never have before, or we can step up and perform
better. Probably played some guys too many minutes, Quade just seemed out of
sync and I don't know why, both on offense and defense. So it wasn't his
night. We needed him to make some baskets. We really did. But that's okay.
They're not machines, they're not computers, they don't play great every night
out and as a coach all I'm thinking about in a game like this is how do I keep
this thing close, see if we'll have a will to win if we got it close. And we
did and we didn't have it. That's what I'm disappointed in, that we had a
chance to just grab the game. They were kind of teetering. We went to the
zone, we did, they were teetering. We had a chance to grab it and we didn't.
But that -- they're freshmen. They don't know yet.  
  
Q. Do you seem a little bit surprised by the performance today, I know
in some ways?  
JOHN CALIPARI: A little bit surprised by what?  
  
Q. The performance today. Did you feel like you were trending in a
better direction?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We had a great shoot around today, but it shows you, you just
don't know. They're young. Who knows what they're thinking. Oh, we made it,
we're a Top-10 team. What? We're good. I'm going to get mine. I'm, watch me
today on CBS I'm going to -- you don't know what a 17 or 18 year old is
thinking. I have no idea. Obviously, we need guys with more of a mentality of
a will to win and blocking out everything else. Hopefully we bounce back from
this, but again we got, I told them the next four games we play, we can lose
every one. You don't play with the will to win, you don't come up with balls,
and even if you do, you could still get beat by the teams we got to play
coming up to play.  
  
Q. You mentioned their veterans, Aaron Holiday was one of them. How much
of a difference did he make down the stretch in your opinion?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Big, it wasn't even down the stretch, the whole game he kind of
controlled what they were doing. We just kept -- we screwed up on the pick and
roll assignments like 10 times and he either got a layup or threw the ball for
a three. We were trying some different things and the lesson for me as a coach
is when you got really young players, like do one or two things, that's it.
Don't try to invent stuff that should work, because they just -- they're not
ready for that. They could play it one way or two ways and if it doesn't work,
then stop, you ain't winning the game, move on. But they, he was really good
today.  
  
Q. How was the experience at the World War II museum?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I don't know what it was for them, but I did it because I
wanted to go and I said you're coming with me. So I tried to explain some
things to them the Normandy, D-Day landing. I tried to explain the Battle Of
The Bulge. I said you probably would hear this at some point, I tried to
explain Bastogne and how that was and there were things that I asked them, you
know, I asked them what things would they know. They knew about the airmen. So
it's just, you just want them to be, to acknowledge that we had a chance of
losing that war and all of our lives changing and these men, what they did --
and that museum being it's very vivid the videos, where you could see. Some of
it where they're in snow and they're trying to fight and it's -- I wish I had
five hours, I would have enjoyed five hours. We were there about an hour. But
I think it was good for them.  
  
Q. Quade had a real good game against Virginia Tech. Today not so much.
What happened there and how much did Wenyen look like Derek Willis for you
today?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He's getting better. Wenyen is getting better. I don't have an
answer for Quade. I feel bad for him. But, you know, one game they play well,
the next game they may not. Then it's like, you know, their responsibility is
to come with a fight and an energy and a fire to play, not, "I want to play
well," no, just come to fight and play and battle. Your shots aren't always
going to go, but when you're not making shots and you're getting beat on
defense, you can't be in the game, it doesn't work. So it was not just that he
didn't make shots, he was struggling to guard.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 23, 2017

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Aaron Holiday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32311)

  
_New Orleans, La_  
  
UCLA - 83  
  
Kentucky - 75  
  
STEVE ALFORD: Really super proud of our guys. They've obviously have been
through a lot with travel. Nobody in the country's traveled more than we have.
Nobody's had the distractions we have had. And yet these guys have just really
stayed close together and they have just continued to grow. And that's really
what November and December is about is trying to grow.  
  
We had Michigan, on the road, in our first true road game and we let that one
go, but we played well. We have been playing better. I thought today we really
put it together. We had a lot thrown at us. A lot of different man defenses
thrown at us and coverages thrown at us and then some zone. And I thought our
offense really handled that well. And then I was really pleased with our
defense. I thought we did a great job on the backboard, we limited second
opportunities and that was critical. We did the same thing at Michigan. These
teams that really pride themselves on board play, we have done a really good
job on the backboards. And that's pretty important moving forward.  
  
So great time for a couple-day break, hopefully our guys can travel safe. And
the guy to my right was awfully big down the stretch and proved just kind of
the quality of player that he is. So very happy about this performance.  
  
Q. Aaron, can you talk about the poise you guys showed down the stretch
and maybe the Michigan game helped you guys in a way to close this one out?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Yeah, we showed great poise. I think at the end of the game it
was like maybe two minutes left and all I kept saying was we got 30 seconds,
so we just got to take care of the ball and run the shot clock all the way
down and we'll be in good shape, so that's what we did. Obviously, the
Michigan game didn't end how we wanted it to. I'm the main reason because I
turned the ball over so many times. I had seven tonight, too, but I'm just
glad we got the win.  
  
Q. How special is this for you to be in this building. I know you
watched your brother play in this game, but how special was it for you?  
AARON HOLIDAY: It's always special. When you can play where your brother's
played. Obviously he's doing really well right now, so that's good. But just
to get the win out here, it's just awesome to say.  
  
Q. Aaron, what does this win mean for you guys just given everything you
guys have been through this season?  
AARON HOLIDAY: It means a lot. First off, it shows that we can win even though
we're young. Second off, it shows that we're actually good. I'm tired of
people saying that we're not good just because we have mishaps at the end or
whatever it is. So it just shows our team chemistry and how good we are right
now at a young age.  
  
Q. Aaron, what was the key, as coach said, to handle the travel, to
handle the distractions? What got you guys through it?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Man, I couldn't tell you that, man. We just stayed focused
throughout our entire games, all the games we played, we just said focus.
Coach did a great job of letting us know what we were going to do beforehand
and just keeping us ready at every game and every moment.  
  
Q. Aaron, was this one that you circled on the calendar given that Jrue
played here in town before the season? Do you look forward to being able to
play in the same city as your brother?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Yeah, I would rather him be at the game, but, obviously, he's
playing right now so he couldn't do that. But it's a game. I come out and play
hard every night, that's really all I can do.  
  
Q. You guys made some defensive adjustments to the zone late in the
first half, kind of helped pack it in on them. How does that help you guys?  
AARON HOLIDAY: We just, again, coach drew up a good game plan and we just
stuck to it. Obviously, we had our game plan coming in and we executed it very
well on the defensive end and that's how we got the win.  
  
Q. As things got tight down the stretch and the crowd got loud, what was
your mentality as you guys started trying to make plays down the stretch?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Just to calm down. Obviously, we got rushed up a little bit
toward the end. I had some weird turnovers, just giving them the ball. But
just to calm down and stay poised. Coach kept preaching to us, all our
teammates kept preaching it to us, so that's really what we had to do.  
  
Q. What do you think the key was for your guys handling the travel,
handling all the distractions?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, just growing as a basketball team and we were always
preaching control what you can control, whether that's noise on the outside
like Aaron is talking about, the noise if we're not very good. They have just
controlled that on the inside. They haven't believed that one second, they
have just continued to work to get better. Then you have the distraction of,
what's happened to the teammates and what's going on here, and he mentioned
it. Don't forget you got, it's UCLA and academics at UCLA is top of the food
chain. So it's not -- it's the most applied university in the world. So it's
for a reason. We're at a high, high level academically. So when we're going
through finals and we're going through the midterms, even midterms, that was
in China, so we're taking midterms in China. So we got a lot going on and yet
through all that travel, we practiced for five weeks, thinking we were going
to have 11 guys in that rotation. And overnight it goes to eight. Those guys
really handled it. And the China thing too, I think sometimes it gets
overlooked is what it does to the rest of your schedule. The rest of the
schedule was already put in place, so it really crunches what you do. We
haven't had that time that a lot of teams here during the break have had a
week or 10 days to really practice and work on things. We haven't had that
window because China took the entire first week of the opening of college
basketball. So our schedule got crunched together. We even lost a game due to
the fires in Los Angeles.  
  
So we have had a lot going, a lot to be thrown at these guys, and five of the
eight didn't play last year, and yet we just are seeing great growth. And as a
coach that's just what you want to see. We're a better basketball team now
than we were in the first of November. And that's what you want to see. I like
where we're at at break, I like where we're at going into league play. It
doesn't mean wins, but I like the demeanor of this team and now we got to be
able to handle success moving forward, beating very good basketball team, how
we handle that success now opening things up against Washington State's going
to be a key.  
  
Q. Aaron has an obviously very strong belief in this team, but do you
think it's important for the freshmen to see that you can beat a team of the
caliber of Kentucky?  
STEVE ALFORD: Absolutely. And we have been showing them clips, man, a lot
about last year, especially offensively. When our ball has been stagnant and
we have held it, we tried to show them clips of this year versus last year's
team of how that ball moved. This is an elite shot blocking team. We wanted to
drive and kick, not drive and try to finish. I don't know how many blocks they
ended up with, they had one at half. I thought we did a really good job of not
challenging the shot blockers. We enticed it and then we wanted to kick out
and guys made open looks. So it's things like that that we have been showing
them on tape of last year's team. Now it's good for them to see that, that you
know what, we can win a game like this too. So not just the freshmen, man, I
think also Alex and Prince who have been a part of our teams, but they haven't
played. And so now those guys that haven't been a part of it, there's a sense
of it now that they can grab onto that we got a chance that if we keep growing
we could be pretty good.  
  
Q. How valuable is a guy like Aaron, especially down the stretch when
it's crunch time?  
STEVE ALFORD: He's unbelievable. I've said all along he's like that pit bull,
he just will come at you. I loved coaching him, these have been three great
years. You are looking at a freshman, we had one team as a freshman, we missed
the tournament, and he started every game. The next game or next year,
sophomore year, we have a great recruiting class. He doesn't start, comes off
the bench and in my mind, there wasn't a better player off the bench last year
than Aaron Holiday. His numbers all went up and now boom here in year three
now he's thrust into, hey, you've got five new guys that you got to lead. And
the guys from last year are gone and he's just handling it tremendous. It
doesn't matter what you throw at him he just gives you everything he's got.
And that's the thing I appreciate about Aaron. And he, actually, for the first
time in his career, asked me to give him a blow. And to me that's maturity
too. Because he's always been on that stubborn side, which I've always liked,
but tonight he actually asked for a blow and we got him out for about a
crucial minute 45, two minutes there in the second half. And he came back in
and just he finished the game the way he's capable of finishing.  
  
Q. Talk about the significance of New Orleans winning a National
Championship here. You're back here --  
STEVE ALFORD: I like this city. I like this city a lot. But it's been good.
It's been good to me anyway. It was great. I had no idea that this arena was
right next to the dome, the Superdome. So when we came here on Friday for
practice, I took a nice shot of the Superdome and then sent it out to a lot of
my '87 teammates. And so great memories. We stayed at the Hilton on the river,
I remember that. It was cold. I remember winning the National Championship in
'87 and trying to get to Bourbon Street for the celebration. It was freezing
here at that time. So the weather's a little bit better this time. But we have
been fortunate that when we have come to this city some good things have
happened. So it's a place I like playing basketball in.  
  
Q. Kris had more points at halftime than he'd had in the previous five
games. In the whole game, he seemed very excited all game. What do you think
allowed him to get that?  
STEVE ALFORD: I think he's maturing too. And a lot of it is realizing how good
you are. Sometimes you get knocked down a little bit and then you start
questioning yourself. And that's something we have always been battling with
GG. I think GG's really good. I think he's our -- arguably our best defender,
he's a great position, he made a huge steal on a baseline drive where they're
trying to run a baseline drive with a baseline drift, he gets a huge steal for
us, he's always in the right place at the right time. And with him it's just
about believing how good you are. Sometimes when you're young and you have
gone through a tough stretch, you start questioning yourself. I thought over
the break here -- and I thought Kris started to do some things in the South
Dakota game. He's a really good cutter, and I think he got into a habit early
in the season where all of his points were in transition. And now after
there's a lot of tapes out, people take away your transition, you've got to be
able to perform at half court. And I thought he was really good tonight. He's
a special player.  
  
I thought Jaylen Hands was really good tonight. I thought that's the most
controlled and best decision making that I've seen Jaylen Hands make. And
Prince responded -- after a tough first half, Prince responded with a big
second half.  
  
Q. It seemed like the momentum went back and forth in the game like a
tennis match. Was that youth do you think on both sides?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well you got a lot of young players playing, that's for sure. I
loved our start to the game. I loved our start to the second half. Those are
always crucial things for us. In fact I like the finish too. I like the last
five minutes the first five of each half and the last five of each half I
like. Because we started well, and then they took a lead, they got back and
took ahead and then last five we were able to get it back and get to a tie.
And then we started the second half really well, got up nine, 10 points and
then they made a run. And then we made another run. Then we were able to
finish. It's not an easy team to finish because they are long and athletic and
things can seep back in. The South Dakota came game was just a few days ago
where we gave up 24 in four minutes, so those things can get back in if you're
not tough. I was very happy to see our guys respond in the tough way. We made
free throws down the stretch, we did what we needed to do, we didn't turn the
ball over, and I thought we got a key stop there twice, two out of three times
we got two key stops.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: BUTLER VS
PURDUE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+BUTLER+VS+PURDUE)

  

## December 16, 2017

  

### [LaVall Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34451)

### [Paul Jorgensen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34452)

### [Kelan Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32315)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 82, Butler - 67  
  
LaVALL JORDAN: I think opening statement is Purdue is a really good basketball
team. There's a reason that they are having the season that they're having,
trending the way that they're trending. Matt's a really good coach, and
they've had a good program for a long time now.  
  
I thought the second half there was a lot to be proud of, the way we fought
back and played with a little more energy, a little more grit. We didn't have
that in the first half, and that's where we've got to be better as coaches.
That one's on me to just make sure we start games with the same mentality,
with the same aggressiveness, and try to get the same quality on both ends of
the floor that we did late.  
  
So I think it's a big lesson to learn. We didn't handle the pressure well.
Obviously, 17 turnovers is not a formula for us to beat anyone let alone a
really good team like this one.  
  
Big week ahead of us. We've got two more games, but we've got a lot of time to
go back and get better because there's certainly some things we need to
address and work on and improve.  
  
Q. Coach, aside from the obvious, what did you need to do better to have
more offensive success?  
LaVALL JORDAN: Like I said, I think their pressure really affected us,
especially early. We didn't execute. They ran us off some cuts, ran us off
some screens and the ball screens, and we dribbled it off our foot a few
times. So we just didn't handle that well. We had nine turnovers at halftime,
and a lot of it was just we played sped up due to them pressuring us. We
didn't respond like we have before when we've gotten some pressure like that.  
  
So we've got to do a better job with that. We've got to simulate it in
practice and improve in that area. That was a big area.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask Kelan. As you address where you are this season,
you've had some good wins, some tough losses, but where do you find the most
room for growth with this team right now given what might have surfaced today
or stuff you've seen the past few weeks?  
KELAN MARTIN: Just bringing energy out in the beginning of the game. We came
out kind of sluggish. They upped the tempo. Like my coach said, they pressured
us, and we turned the ball over a little bit.  
  
The same energy we had in the second half, that's what we need to have start
of the games, and I think we'll be pretty good with that.  
  
Q. Coach, playing a team like Purdue, what does that do for you guys
down the stretch when you get into Big East play, playing teams like Villanova
and Xavier?  
LaVALL JORDAN: It gives us a test to see where you are. Obviously, you get
exposed to some things you need to work on and see guys respond. The goal is
to win and learn. So we didn't do that, but you still have to learn
regardless. I think there's a lot to draw from positively from this one, and
then definitely some areas that, like I said, we need to improve on.  
  
Q. Coach, Joey was somewhat effective in the first half in his limited
time. I don't know if he even got in the game the second half. If he did, it
was briefly. What was the rationale in not using Joey as much in the second
half?  
LaVALL JORDAN: Joe brings great energy. That's something that he brings to
this team. He got to the glass, I think got an offensive rebound. He's a big
body. So it was just a coach's decision with matchups.  
  
I thought Cat was really helping us on the offensive glass. We weren't
shooting the ball great, but he was giving us second opportunities. Obviously,
we tried to get Nate some shots. He can make those shots. He didn't make them
today. So it was a matchup thing as anything.  
  
Q. Coach, this is just your 11th game with this program, but in this
short amount of time, what have you learned that's not just going to make this
team better long term but that's going to make you a better coach long term?  
LaVALL JORDAN: Well, I think just how to get us be more prepared coming out of
the gates. Like I said, the energy in the second half, if you look up, when we
went up by one, we got more active, we picked it up and started to press. But
to be a little more demanding so that we start games better. When you're
playing good opponents, you can't afford to take a possession off. I thought
we got lost defensively on some screens, and we hadn't had that happen. They
played at a rate maybe we haven't seen before in terms of pace and cutting and
movement.  
  
So just got to require more, kind of see the areas that both sides, and I have
to grow, and our staff has to grow. And each, I think, that's the commitment
all these guys have is to improve individually.  
  
Q. For the players. You guys mentioned the pressure Purdue was putting
out there. Just what specifically about them defensively was disruptive today?
What were they doing?  
KELAN MARTIN: They played a lot in the passing lanes. They like to deny a lot.
We just had to use backdoor cuts and just get open. We couldn't just stand
around.  
  
I thought we did a better job second half with that, just moving the ball
around. We had open shots, but they didn't fall, but that happens.  
  
PAUL JORGENSEN: Yeah, and I think our pace in the first half was a little slow
with cuts and all that stuff. So I think in the second half, once we started
moving faster and playing with some confidence, you know, obviously, we were
much better. So we've just got to work on that from the gate, and I think
we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. LaVall, did you sense at all that Kamar was pressing today at all, or
was it just kind of one of those days for him? He had a couple of late
baskets, but before that, he was shooting about 10 percent, I think.  
LaVALL JORDAN: I don't know if he was -- Kamar Baldwin is a really good
basketball player, and he's a big part of what we've been doing here, last
year, this year, and he's got to be a big part of it. Everybody has a night or
a day, and I thought -- I didn't think he took bad shots. Maybe a little bit
rushed.  
  
Defensively, I thought he tried -- he impacted the game, like he always does.
So it was just we all have to get better.  
  
Now, I think, as a whole, I thought early we let the offensive end affect us
on the defensive end, and that's a mental toughness thing that we have to
improve on, where it's going to be nice when the shots aren't falling. We've
had those nights already this season in 11 games. We can't let dictate our
effort and execution on defense.

### [P.J. Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28626)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 82, Butler - 67  
  
Q. Really for anyone who wants to take it. Let's talk about the
defensive tone. What was the approach? Why did you think you were able to so
effectively build that lead in that first half?  
P.J. THOMPSON: I thought we executed our game plan. We knew they had really
good guard play. Jorgensen can really shoot the ball. He didn't get going
until late. I thought we did a good job on him until late. He was 5 for 19. I
thought we pressured him and made things difficult.  
  
Same with Kelan Martin. I thought we really stuck to our game plan and really
executed.  
  
Q. You guys had all five starters in double figures. That's not the
first time this year that you guys have done that. What do you think about the
way you guys are sharing the basketball and kind of using a multi-facetted
scoring approach?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: It makes the game easier when guys are attacking and the shot
is falling. It's contagious. When the shot is falling, the next person gets
going. It comes from sharing the ball. We've been playing with each other for
a while now. Coming with chemistry, and we just got to keep going.  
  
Q. Carsen, with the way you guys have played for the majority of the
season, you guys have looked pretty consistently solid. You had the two losses
in the Bahamas. As we reach this point near the end of the nonconference
schedule, I wanted to ask you how your team has adjusted and thrived after
losing a player the caliber of Caleb?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: It's hard to replace a guy like Caleb. We just come into every
game just working hard, just listen to our coaches and the scouting reports
and things like that. We practice hard every day. We just come together and
just play, play hard, and try to come out with the win.  
  
Q. Just for whoever wants it, you guys were the highest scoring team in
the Big Ten last year, obviously, got a lot of notoriety for your three-point
shooting and stuff like that. Just how did you get to the point here where
you're winning games so decisively with defense?  
P.J. THOMPSON: I think we learned from our mistakes. We know we can score the
ball with anybody in the country. We can really score at a high level. But
what's going to separate us and allow us to be really successful throughout
the rest of the season and in the postseason is defense.  
  
I think we assured that up from when we were in the Bahamas because we knew we
could outscore those teams. We didn't come ready to play defensively, and it
kind of bit us.  
  
We really -- I mean, we've really toned it up defensively. I think we've
gotten a lot better, as you guys can tell, throughout the season, and I think
there's still room to improve.  
  
Q. Aside from the defense, was there anything else in particular that
you guys didn't do well in the Bahama tournament that you've done well since?
I mean, you've beaten these guys, Arizona, Louisville, et cetera.  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I would just say, like you said, in the Bahamas, we just
didn't do what we did today. Following our scouting report and playing with a
sense of urgency, our preparation for each game has been better and better as
time goes on.  
  
As you can tell, we've been coming out read. I think that's good on our part.
Our coaches really challenged us, as time went on, after those two losses in
the Bahamas. So we responded well, and we've been ready.  
  
Q. A few of you guys last year and Matt last year talked about maybe the
emphasis shifting a little bit more toward containment. I don't want to say
being a little more passive, but being a little more containment-oriented. Is
it different this year in terms of what you guys are trying to do from a
pressure perspective that you can have a game like this where you pressure the
way you did in the first half?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: When you've got guys like this sitting next to me, P.J. and
Carsen, they really get up and pressure the ball. Dakota is a good defender.
And you've got guys that can protect the rim like Matt and Isaac. It makes it
easier for the perimeter players to be up and pressure a little bit. Even when
Matt comes in, to have a shot blocker like Matt, it makes you a little more
comfortable when you're out there pressuring. I think that's what kind of
changed the dynamic a little bit.  
  
Other than that, it's just been us working and practicing and pushing each
other and making each other better every day. That's what's made us better
this year too.  
  
Q. Carsen, do you feel like you're defending better as the season goes
along, and how does that help you use your speed as you were using it as a
weapon today?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I mean, I hope my defense is getting better. I'm going to keep
working and following the scouting report and things like that. I hope, if I'm
able to play good defense and things like that, hopefully, it will turn into
offense and get in transition, but also pressure the ball and get deflections
and things like that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like there was anything about your style of play down the
stretch that helped Butler get into that -- make that start of that comeback
that they never finished?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Basketball is a game of runs. We just got comfortable a
little bit and didn't keep that fight that we had early on. So that was on us
to grow and mature as a team. Every game you know it's coming. Someone's going
to make a run, but can you withstand that run and hold on to the league and
take care of the ball when it's crunch time?  
  
Adversity hit us a little bit, and I think we showed that we can be mature and
take it and still be able to execute down the stretch.  
  
Q. Just for everyone to answer, actually, Carsen, since you made one of
them, just how important was it to make those two early threes in the second
half? Obviously, after you got some momentum going into halftime, you wanted
to start well. To be able to make those two shots early seemed really
significant.  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I mean, it's always good to see a three ball fall, to be
able to hit one of those and kind of stretch the defense a little more. And
then we can go inside and let guys like Vince and Isaac get in the paint and
things like that. So it's good to see those fall. But always when a three
falls, you're able to stretch the defense out more, so we can get into the
lane and things like that, get to the basket, fouls, free throws, things like
that.  
  
Q. Vincent, P.J., Butler's kind of had your number. It's been a long
time since you guys have beaten them. Is it a little extra meaning getting
this one, especially here?  
P.J. THOMPSON: Yeah, definitely. I'll definitely have my last collegiate game
in Indy in front of fans and family and the Purdue family was awesome. We
think we're the best team in Indiana. So protecting our state.  
  
And our record in the Crossroads, Purdue is 1-5. Vincent and I finished out
.500, 2-2. Lost to Notre Dame and Butler early on. I think we have Purdue on
the right track, so next year Carsen can lead those guys to the win.  
  
No, I think we came out, did our job. It was really cool for me winning on
home court in Indy.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Yeah, just to piggy-back off what he's saying, I told him in
the locker room today, I said, we finished .500. Of course we lost to a really
good Notre Dame team freshman year and they went to the Elite Eight. So they
were really good.  
  
Then sophomore year, we ended up losing to Butler, letting one slip. We didn't
execute down the stretch like we did today. To be able to get two rematches
and be able to win both those games. Last year we won and a good comeback.
This year we were able to stay out and stay ahead and finish the game. So I
think it's kind of a good feeling and to break that curse of not beating them.
So it was really good.  
  
Q. Matt, there are a few teams that are as efficient and quick on
offense and grinding other teams on defense late into the shot clock the way
you guys have proven to be this season. With that as backdrop, did Butler come
at a really good time with the way you've been playing and the way you were
able to execute against a team that runs the way they run?  
MATT PAINTER: I thought we did a good job of just sticking with certain guys.
It wasn't a good game for Baldwin because he's a guy that can go make plays.
So I thought he never really got it going, and that was important for us
because now we didn't have to over-help, and we could stick with those
shooters.  
  
At the end there, we just -- you know, you let Jorgensen get the one three,
and you let Kelan Martin hit those other two threes. We were just staying with
them. Why we left them and let them shoot them, I don't know. But I thought
our defense in the first half was great, and I thought our guys were ready to
play.  
  
I thought we had some shots early that normally go down for us that didn't in
that first half, but we stayed with it. We grinded it out. Cline hits a huge
three to close the half. I thought that was a good momentum boost for our
team.  
  
Q. What sort of development are you seeing from Carsen in a season
that's allowing him to use his speed more, especially on the defensive end?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, just him being accountable and guarding certain guys, I
think that's -- we're going to have a Mathias guard the other team's best
player, if we can. Sometimes quickness really bothers him.  
  
From a physical standpoint, Carsen can guard a lot of different people right
there, but it's just kind of sticking with it and staying with it. He just
goes under Jorgensen there at the end and allows him to have one when you've
got to just stay with him. He's much better at following scouting reports and
doing things of that nature, but sometimes he'll let something on one end of
the court affect the other end of the court. Just trying to keep that focus
and understand.  
  
He's a very talented guy, but he's got to be able to pick his spots. A couple
times a night on drives, he's driving through three or four people. But he
also went one-on-five early in the game and scored it.  
  
So as a coach sometimes it's difficult, when he gets going, to kind of put the
reins on him and pull him back. Sometimes you've got a little bit of a give
and take.  
  
He's done a much better job in terms of those things, kind of the intangibles.  
  
Q. What's the biggest difference between this Purdue team now and the
one who walked off the court in Western Kentucky?  
MATT PAINTER: I would say that just shot selection is a little bit better. I
thought we've done a much better job of not trying to shoot the ball so quick.
I thought we were shooting the ball entirely too quick.  
  
The other team, we weren't making them work for things and really just trying
to harp on our guys to push the basketball, take open rhythm threes, get to
the rim, get a quick post-up. If not, execute. We went to a lot more sets
because of it, so we kind of forced them. Tried to put up a lot of stop signs
just to make them run sets and to make them be efficient on the offensive end.  
  
When you have somebody like Isaac, and he only played 16 minutes, they have to
worry about him. If you're constantly taking perimeter shots, they have to
worry about him. Allow him to touch the ball. He doesn't have to shoot it, but
allow him to touch the ball when he's in there. Get their bigs in foul
trouble, get to the free-throw line. He shoots a high percentage. Get him in
rotation so now you can get more rhythm, inside-outside type threes.  
  
When we have a better balance like we've had since there, it really helps us,
and it also allows us to set our defense. So a lot of times in our sport, the
two ends are connected. So the better you are on offense, the more you're
going to be efficient on the defensive end. If you go look at our turnovers
and look how we play and go look at Butler's turnovers, if Butler doesn't turn
the basketball over, where are they? You don't know. They turn the ball over.
If we don't turn the ball over at the end, they don't make a comeback.  
  
If you take care of the basketball, you give yourselves a chance. But you also
set your defense. There's not a lot of teams out there that are going to score
versus set defense all the time. They're just not.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of success this year with the offense for defense
late in games with Haas and Haarms, especially with Haas having the four
fouls. How important has it been for Haarms to develop so quickly, especially
on the defense?  
MATT PAINTER: Matt, he's got a high basketball IQ and we can switch late in
the clock with him if we need to, but he changes a lot of shots. He's around
the basketball, and he has energy, and it's really helped us.  
  
From an offensive standpoint, he's a good player. He's not like he's a
liability. He's not the low post player that Isaac is.  
  
The one thing about people pressuring and getting after you and extending
their defense, if you throw it inside, they've got a long run double,
especially if you want to leave ball side. We try to go inside as much as we
can late in the game. We just couldn't pass and catch there for a while, and
so that really hurt things.  
  
But Matt's been great for us.  
  
Q. It looked like you called a couple of time-outs after lapses when you
were up 20, looking like you're trying to get out in front of trouble.  
MATT PAINTER: Exactly.  
  
Q. And then the trouble came later. What do they have to do to play with
bigger leads more effectively than they did there for a while?  
MATT PAINTER: I just thought Butler picked up their intensity and pressure.
You just have to cut harder, just be stronger with the basketball. Like I said
earlier, I know it sounds simple, but just pass it and catch it. We had two or
three post feeds that somehow we don't complete. We can't enter a pass a
couple times offensively. We're trying to throw bounce passes to start
offense. So just some basic fundamental things we didn't do a good job of.  
  
I think it's a by-product of having a big league. One team always picks it up,
and the other team relaxes. I think you see that a lot in basketball, but as a
coach, you obviously try to prevent it.  
  
Q. Coach, Isaac only played 16 minutes, but you got 15 points out of
him. Is that efficiency offensively with him, an evolution of his game this
season?  
MATT PAINTER: No, he's always been efficient, I just haven't always played him
as much as some people would like. But A.J. Hammons was pretty good, and Caleb
Swanigan was pretty good too. He's been in a stack.  
  
What upsets me is the first foul he has. You know what I mean? You just stay
big, and he hits down. There's just no -- you're not going to get anything
from that play. Just play big, make him score over you, make Tyler make that
jump hook. If he makes it, good for him. You stay in the game. That two points
really doesn't matter.  
  
And he has those moments still, and that's what we've got to get away from him
because I didn't think they had an answer for him. And then we really prefer
somebody to double, to be frank with you. It makes us have better balance and
lets everybody touch the basketball. I think it's better that way anyways.  
  
Q. You started to touch on the defense, especially in the first half.
Just how would you evaluate the way that your team has developed defensively
since the beginning of the season?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think we matched up with them. I thought Mathias matched
up with Kelan Martin, even though he scored the basketball, and that helps us.
You make improvements, but also in the matchups, kind of go your way. And then
we were able to back up off Thompson even though he made some plays and try to
clog some things up. So we were constantly trying to clog things up.  
  
Then we found out McDermott was going to play, and that concerned us just
because they can put another skill guy out on the court, but obviously he's
not 100 percent. No, we've definitely made improvements with little things.  
  
Sometimes when you get on a winning streak, you can take some steps backwards
too, like I thought we had some breakdowns there in the second half where our
ball screen defense, we weren't as tight. We didn't show our hands. We didn't
stay connected. We like to get our big guys as high as we can get them without
hedging. So then just to try to not let those guys get in those little creases
and break us down.  
  
Q. Coach, how valuable is it to play in an event like today this close
to conference play starting up again?  
MATT PAINTER: Oh, it's great. Any time you can play on a neutral site.
Obviously, I know conference play is coming, but this is more for an NCAA
Tournament type thing. A lot of people don't realize you can get in the NCAA
Tournament and just have an absolute sellout and be unbelievable. But
sometimes you'll get, half of the gym is a little bit empty and half the gym's
not. It's kind of sporadic at times. That was kind of the way it was at the
start, and then as the next game's coming, it started to fill up a little bit
more, and you have more people.  
  
I like it from an NCAA Tournament standpoint. I think it helps all four teams.
I think it's great for the state of Indiana and the fans and everybody here.
We're just happy we finally actually beat butter.  
  
Q. Just when you kind of take a step back from this one and you look at
the big picture, it seemed like after Butler missed their last ten shots of
the half, and Cline makes that three to put you up 16, making those two early
threes to start the second half really important in terms of keeping them at
arm's length. Was that kind of where the game -- was that the biggest moment
of the game maybe?  
MATT PAINTER: We talked about our game from last year and how we were down. We
now how it feels in that other locker room. We didn't want them to be able to
bring that energy. We should have talked about doing it for 20 minutes. I
thought our guys were ready to play. Sometimes it's fool's gold. The ball goes
in for you a couple times, and we just feel better about it. We did get a
couple of good shots and knocked them down. We had the lead up to 26.  
  
I thought our guys were ready to play at the beginning of the first half and
the beginning of the second half, and those were pretty important times.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: NOTRE DAME VS
INDIANA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+NOTRE+DAME+VS+INDIANA)

  

## December 16, 2017

  

### [Robert Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27877)

### [Zach McRoberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32520)

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Juwan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30014)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 80, Notre Dame - 77  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Our guys, we've been hanging tough here the last couple weeks
and just haven't had the ability to find a way to win. I thought today's
effort was outstanding. A lot of guys stepped up and made some tremendous
plays on both ends of the floor. It was a team win against a really good team.  
  
Without saying, we're very excited and have seen our improvement week by week
and continue to get confidence that our guys are starting to understand a
little bit more, playing through mistakes, continuing to play hard. Whether
you're up or down is a good sign right now that we're able to hang in there
and claw our way back. We have a quick turnaround to get to Monday.  
  
Sort of excited to get out of here and get back home and get a little rest.  
  
Q. Zach McRoberts, you talked about him yesterday, but 9 rebounds, 7
offensive rebounds today.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Winner. Tremendous effort all game long. Playing really, really
hard. He's an important piece to what we're doing right now. Like I said, you
don't have to score a lot of points to be a terrific teammate, to impact the
game. He plays really hard. He's giving us a bigger defender on the floor at
times against bigger teams, and I think just happy with him staying with it.  
  
Early in the season he wasn't really playing much, but he was the same guy.
It's a credit to his work ethic, but very, very proud of Zach. He's really
stepped up for us.  
  
Q. Does he have a knack for getting his hands on the ball?  
ARCHIE MILLER: He's got a great motor. If you watch him in games and practice,
it's the same. He pursues balls. He'll come from all over the place, whether
he can get a hand on it or not. Today he went up and got a couple, above the
rim even. The last one on the free-throw line was an incredible rebound in
traffic. But he pursues the ball. He's got a great motor. It's an instinct
that a lot of guys don't have.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) turned the ball over, shots weren't falling. Second half,
shots were falling. 16 turnovers for the game. Did you ever imagine you could
beat Notre Dame with twice as many turnovers as they had?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, I think the first half, I think we had seven in the first
half, probably had nine second half turnovers. Without watching the film, I
can't really -- I didn't think turnovers were playing a big -- I thought being
able to continue to score was important. That was important.  
  
First half -- the first half deficit should have been more, to be honest with
you. We were able to get a couple threes to go down late in the first half to
make it workable.  
  
And in the second half, when we got down by double figures, we found a way to
make shots. Rob stepped up and made a couple. It was nice to see.  
  
If you look at the field goal percentages in the second half, 57%, 50 from
three, shot 17 free throws, probably pretty efficient. Definitely taking care
of the ball is something we have to do a better job of; you know, 16 turnovers
is too many. We were able to outrebound them by nine, so maybe we got a little
difference in the possessions.  
  
Q. Arch, you've been in close games on the road in Louisville. Did those
eventually pay off being competitive with those teams?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Without question. We've been in the pressure cooker for about
four weeks. You're going against Duke. I think four, five games ago, whatever
it may be, you're right there and disappointed you weren't able to get it
done. Struggled on the road against Michigan. Battled back and had a good win
against Iowa. At Louisville, I thought we were prepared to play. Guys competed
and played really hard. We just weren't sharp enough, being able to finish it
off.  
  
I thought in this game we were sharp enough to finish it off, and we also did
it on both ends. We had key plays, being able to get key stops, and continuing
to score when we were down.  
  
Juwan had a lot to do that. I thought late in the game, us being able to ride
him for most of the second half offensively was a great sign he continues to
get better.  
  
Q. Archie, about Juwan, what discernible skill does he have that allows
him to score the way he did tonight? And then really the way he's been scoring
lately. Like not shooting threes, not above the rim dunking everybody. What's
he doing?  
ARCHIE MILLER: He's got good footwork in and around the basket. He has good
footwork. And I think the thing that he has right now is he has great
toughness around the basket. He's not falling away, he's not getting knocked
to the ground, there's no flailing. He's playing through the other guys, and
he's got good contact. He's got good footwork around the basket as well.  
  
I think what he's figuring out is the more he can get down there and get to
the foul line and the more he's offensive rebounding, the better he plays.
Even today, I wish he would have taken one three. I thought he had a good
look. He didn't even think about it. To me he's playing exactly how he
practices. When you have guys that come in every day, you watch the practice
film and look at the statistics and watch the guy in the game do the same
thing. He should have good confidence with his approach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're focused on today, but in 48 hours you play Fort
Wayne, who beat Indiana last year, and about five or six years ago, you had a
great game with them at Dayton. I was wondering what your thoughts were on
Fort Wayne?  
ARCHIE MILLER: We have to be ready to play against Fort Wayne. I think
everybody is probably going to remind everyone about last year's game, which
is fine. I'll remind our guys. We didn't start the season off very well
against Indiana State as well. As soon as we get out of here, we're on the bus
back, but we're moving on to Fort Wayne. That's a very, very big game for us
and our team.  
  
As it stands right now, it feels good, but we have to get back to work. It's
an important game, very important.  
  
Q. Coming off that Louisville game last week, did you sense that Rob was
maybe taking that a little personal, just want to go get back?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Without question. He's a prideful kid. He's worked extremely
hard in the off-season to put himself in a situation as a senior. He's led
great. He's playing tremendous defense for us. He's giving everything he has.
And to watch him sort of try really hard to make a shot -- every player goes
through it where you want it to go in so bad it just won't.  
  
He was almost going three-a-days this week. Finals with no classes, you see
him every morning shooting, then practice, then you see him after practice
shooting.  
  
He definitely had a chip on his shoulder about last week's game. And he
delivered today. He made some big shots. They weren't easy ones. He definitely
made some big ones for us. The guy plays 43 minutes, he guards Matt Farrell
the whole thing, you expect him to play. He plays hard. It was a nice breath
of fresh air for him to knock a few in.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the pressure cooker running (inaudible) a
little bit. What would please you in terms of progress during that period of
time?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Individual improvement. I think it's the time of year, if it's
a college player, that you really enjoy Christmas break. Your coaches, they
spend 15, 20 minutes a day with you on your individual game and see if you
can't raise the confidence level of your group individually, that collectively
will help you.  
  
So I think have a chance to take a step back, look at some of our guys and
what we can improve on individually. Go to work as a staff in terms of
individual instruction. And then continuing to carve our identity out. We're
not anywhere near where we have to be, but I do think, as we've watched
ourselves improve, we have some things we can hang our hat on right now. We're
playing a lot harder for a lot longer stretches and understand what we're
doing a lot better.  
  
So this holiday, as we get ready to head into January in conference play, can
we take another step up? I think the answer to that is yes because we do still
have a lot of inexperience playing with one another. As I said to the other
guys, there's going to be days where other guys need to be in there. The
individual improvement is a big thing, and also keep developing our team and
our niche.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up to that. What do you need to be next? You talk about
guys gaining confidence. What kind of comes next after a performance like
this?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I think the great thing is to get back to work in the practice
gym tomorrow and figure out how we can recover, number one; and then, B, come
off the clouds. This say team that won its first truly ranked game, a big game
on TV that had a great environment. So the one thing is get back off the
clouds and get back to work. We have some guys that aren't playing
particularly well that, if they do start to play a little bit better, then our
team gets better.  
  
There's got to be a focus right now on improvement. There's got to be a focus
as a group that we can become cleaner in our stuff. But I thought we had a lot
of winning plays. We had good execution today ahead of time-outs. I think for
the most part, to be able to win that game the way we did, it gives you a
little shot of confidence that what we do works. We just have to continue to
get better at it.  
  
Q. How amazing is it for your team to play in an event like today,
especially with conference play starting up soon?  
ARCHIE MILLER: It's a great event. Indianapolis is a tremendous city for our
fans and our program. The environment in there today was just like a
tournament feel game, and to be able to play the quality of opponent we
played, it was great.  
  
We've played a lot of good teams this season. Notre Dame is right up there at
the top. It's always an unbelievable opportunity when you have these types of
battles to come out with a win. It gives you a lot of confidence that you can
play.  
  
Q. Juwan, it seemed like the second half, you guys went to a smaller
lineup. (Inaudible). Is that what was going on?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Yeah, a little bit. We found out that lineup was really working
for us, both defensively and offensively. As we kept getting stops, they just
kept feeding me the ball, putting me in great positions to score. That was the
result.  
  
Q. Zach, talk about the offensive rebound in overtime, but also the pass
that you made to Juwan.  
ZACH McROBERTS: Yeah, just a good bounce off the rim. I was able to get it and
just looking for somebody. J. Mo made a good cut and was able to finish that.
So that was a good play for him.  
  
Q. What did you see and just how valuable was what Zach gave you?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Just first off, the minutes that Zach gave were incredible. His
defense on ball, off ball, I think he got two or three times where he was just
in the right spot for helping guys, got a few turnovers for them. Just when he
came off, I was like dang, I just missed it. Then I saw Zach got it, and I
just ran off. I was just hoping he saw me, and he did.  
  
Q. Juwan, are you a little bit sick?  
JUWAN MORGAN: No. My voice is just really deep (laughter).  
  
Q. Well, aren't I the idiot? So the real question is it looks like this
team needed somebody to become what you became today. So why have you -- have
you kind of consciously made that effort to sort of become the guy?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I wouldn't say I've just been consciously trying to make the
effort, but just every day in practice bringing it as hard as I can and just
showing everybody like this is how we have to play in order to get these wins.
And then just everybody on the team just follows suit.  
  
As we just keep going down, I think you just saw that we put together a full
game, and as we keep building off of one another, I think good things will
happen.  
  
Q. Coach said you were doing three-a-days this week. Obviously, you
knocked down five threes and played 45 minutes, a lot of that guarding
Farrell. Did you feel like maybe after Louisville you got to where you wanted
tonight?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: First, I want to thank God for the game. I think I try to go
back to the drawing board and see where I was making some mistakes and not
being as aggressive as I needed to to help us. I think today was a step in the
right direction.  
  
Q. Robert, you obviously have seen Juwan ever since he's been at
Indiana. What has he done that's gotten him to the point where he can have a
performance like he did today -- 30-plus points, double digit rebounds --
against a top 20 team?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I think he's really playing within himself. Once he saw that
he could do that and get results, I think he just got better and better, and
that gave him a lot of confidence. We're behind him 100 percent. I know he'll
continue to get better.  
  
Q. Rob, you shot two at 80 percent (inaudible). Did you make any
adjustments at halftime to start shooting better?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I just wanted to stay aggressive. I was getting good looks in
the first half, and that was one of the things that we discussed, just trying
to get good shots. If you get those, you'll eventually knock them down.  
  
Q. Juwan, a lot of guys bounce the ball forward or into a jump shot. Can
you explain how you learned to bounce the ball in the post and go into a post
move?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I really don't -- I don't know. Just working on it as a kid,
just because -- growing up, I was a bigger guard, so I always shot the post
over the little guards.  
  
As I got bigger, I guess I just kept that skill. We work on it every day, just
perimeter post driving in and turn our backs so we can get the good post-up.
It's just something I keep working on.  
  
Q. Juwan, I know it wasn't one-on-one (no microphone). Did you take that
as a challenge?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Definitely. Just from the time I knew we were going to play
Notre Dame, I just knew that he was going to come in and going to put up a
great fight, and then just all the coaches were telling me this week while we
were going through film and things like that. It's like that's going to be
your job. You got to take the challenge, and you got to do something with it.  
  
Q. What is your most obvious skill? I mean, you scored 30 whatever you
scored. How did you do that?  
JUWAN MORGAN: I guess just being in the right spot at the right time. I think
today was the first time I actually got a play to just drive it, but other
than that, I was just getting on the offensive glass and just posting up in
the middle of the floor in random possessions. When you do that just randomly,
people usually aren't ready for it. And then my teammates found me.  
  
Q. This is for Rob or Juwan. Fort Wayne comes up in 48 hours. What do
you guys remember about that last year? I mean, how important of a game does
that become now?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: Last year, obviously, it wasn't a good feeling. You never
really forget what it feels like to feel like that. So we'll definitely be
prepared.  
  
Q. You guys came close against Duke, came close against Louisville. This
game you're down 14. You never could get the lead in the second half until
overtime. What's the biggest area of growth in this team? Why were you able to
win this game?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I just think we never went away. Once we made mistakes, I
don't think we consecutively made the same ones. It still wasn't a clean game.
You always can get better, but I think the encouraging thing was we never went
away as far as our defense. Down the stretch, we started to execute better.  
  
Q. A lot of people mentioned Juwan, kind of your own growth. Was there
anything you can trace back to (no microphone)? Anything you can trace, things
you picked up or were able to learn through that experience that you can apply
this year?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Yeah, just seeing how different -- that was a camp with the best
players in college basketball. Just seeing a lot of them, how they played, I
just was watching -- whenever my team wasn't on, I was just watching and
seeing how they operated and kind of picked up a few moves from each of them
and just put it in the arsenal.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: NOTRE DAME VS
INDIANA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+NOTRE+DAME+VS+INDIANA)

  

## December 16, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 80, Notre Dame - 77  
  
Q. What didn't happen for this team as far as making plays and making
decisions?  
MIKE BREY: We're up three. We're up three, and that's when we go green and
switch everything, and we don't want to give up a three. We talk about when a
guy drives, just let him have a layup. Let him cut it to one, and we'll get it
back in and get fouled. We rotate it over to take a charge, and then it became
a three-point play. That was -- as much as we work on our green defense, I
thought we broke down a little bit there.  
  
Q. What's the situation as far as rebounding? What can you do to kind of
close that gap a little?  
MIKE BREY: Tonight wasn't as bad. It was just such key times where we gave up
second shots, just key times. And in a tough loss, I thought our bench did
some good stuff. Nik gave us good minutes, and D.J. gave us good minutes, and
Mooney gave us good minutes, as we're still trying to figure out who comes off
the bench for us.  
  
Q. Coach, Austin hadn't played until 21 seconds left in the game. What
was the rationale in putting him in?  
MIKE BREY: Well, he is so good defensively, and he just really moves his feet.
I just love him in there. We put him in there in game situations defensively.
Back on the other end, he could get fouled like he did.  
  
We have faith in him. I mean, he's a defender, and he's a veteran guy who I
thought would be good getting out on Hartman. He's quick that way. The problem
is it comes at the other end of the floor, and he's in there offensively. But
I still like him in game situations because he's so active defensively. Maybe
we should have come back to him a little bit more. He would have helped us
rebound some key rebounds down the stretch.  
  
Q. In the second half, they seemed to go smaller and stuff the ball in
more.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, he beat us up. I mean, he -- you're worried about giving up a
three eventually. Like we weren't helping much because I thought maybe we'd be
-- it was ringing true for most of the game. I thought maybe, if we didn't
give up threes, they wouldn't score enough. His jump hooks count too, and we
could keep a little bit of a cushion. But, God, did he beat us up, and he was
fabulous.  
  
Q. Mike, what's your take on Juwan Morgan, not only how he played today,
but the improvement he's made?  
MIKE BREY: He's made great strides. Archie's done an unbelievable job with
him. He's just a really confident young man. They're just a tough group, man.
They keep coming at your paint. They keep coming at your paint. The guards are
driving. The big guys are banging around. I like them.  
  
We were -- you know, we were holding them off for most of the game, but, God,
you've got to get a couple more defensive rebounds and good block-outs to get
out of there.  
  
But he's a confident young man right now. He was fabulous today.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2017

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Sacar Anim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34365)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Marquette - 94, LSU - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Marquette to the media room. Coach Wojciechowski and
Sacar Anim. Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We beat a really well coached and hungry and aggressive
team, with an incredible freshman guard. I've been in college basketball over
20 years, and I was a freshman guard once, and in my wildest dreams I wish I
could have played like that kid, because he's something special. I thought our
guys did a good job in the second half. We tried to mix up some different
coverages to slow him down. I'm not sure we slowed him down, but we did a
better job in the second half against him. So I was really proud of our guys
with their fight over the 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Waters as well? How tough is that guy, man?  
SACAR ANIM: He's an incredible player, like Coach said. He's definitely one of
the best players offensively that I've played. He was tough, he's really
quick, and now he's really smart. He was really tough, I had a tough job all
night. But my other teammates did a great job of helping me, so...  
  
Q. But I noticed one time down on our end of the basket when he scooted
around and you stayed with him, intercepted the ball and went down and you
guys scored. That was a hell of a turnaround play. Well done.  
SACAR ANIM: Appreciate it, thank you.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I'll answer that question. Sacar was a huge reason we won
the game. Obviously as Waters got off, we put Sacar on him, and Sacar did as
well a job as you could do on a player of that caliber. In addition to his
defense, there was a lot of game pressure on us, both at the end of half and
at the start of second half. Sacar had some incredible drives that really gave
our team life and confidence. I mean, they were really strong drives. Thank
God for the soft Maui rims. I told my team before we got here, I said, If your
old coach who couldn't throw the ball in the ocean could make a few threes
here, just put it up on the rim soft. There's a good chance that rim's going
to swallow it up.  
  
Q. Sacar, could you talk about how big a difference going home 2-1 from
here, versus today 1-2, how important was today's win?  
SACAR ANIM: It was really important. It's great to build on what we did
yesterday. Although we lost, we wanted to bounce back and have confidence
going into our next game.  
  
This was a terrific tournament, and there are a lot of great teams. It give is
us a lot of confidence knowing we're 2-1. Although we fell short, third place
is pretty good. We beat an incredible team in LSU. So I'm glad we got the win.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Our young group has gotten better early in the season,
and it's a result of the schedule that we've played -- Mount St. Mary's,
Purdue, you go down the line, VCU, Wichita State, LSU. Our kids have to play
well to beat all of those teams, and we've learned a lot about ourselves here
in Maui. It's something that we need to build on.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak about how important today's win was to get to
2-1 versus 1-2 here?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, obviously every win's important, but for us to
bounce back after a difficult and very hard-fought game against Wichita State,
for our kids to show the toughness they did. We started the game off like
gangbusters. LSU made an adjustment. There was a lot of game pressure, and our
kids responded to game pressure. So for that, I'm proud. And to go home 3-2,
you know, quite simply, it's a lot better than going home 2-3. So that's
probably as simple as I could put it.  
  
It's an honor to be at this tournament. Coach Odom does a great job, and the
organizers here. This is my fifth time at Maui, and there is no other
tournament in the United States in the preconference that's like this
tournament. First-class people, well-run, great programs, and it was an honor
for our basketball program to be a part of it.

## November 22, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Tremont Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34356)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Marquette - 94, LSU - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome LSU to the media room. Coach Wade and Tremont
Waters, thank you for joining us. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
  
WILL WADE: Well, we just let them get off to a good start, let them get in
rhythm. Didn't do a very good job on 10, and that ended up, really, really,
really hurting us. So, you know, disappointing. I thought it was a game we had
an opportunity to win. We were down 2 with 10 minutes left, and couldn't find
a way to make it happen.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your game, 39 points, 5 steals, 4 assists?
How good did you feel out there?  
TREMONT WATERS: I'm going to have to say that today my shots were just
falling. Overall I'm pleased the way I played, but I'm mad that we lost. So
I'll just leave it at that.  
  
Q. What do you guys take out of this trip? I know 2-1 would have been a
lot better than 1-2, but what do you guys go home with?  
WILL WADE: We confirmed that we can't guard anybody. That's the number one
thing we did. We thought that going in, but we certainly confirmed that out
here. All three teams shot over 50% against us.  
  
It was a great experience, but you've got to take advantage of the
opportunities that you have, and I don't think we took advantage enough of
them.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2017

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Mike'l Simms](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34362)

### [Khris Lane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34364)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan - 68, VCU - 60  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Hard fought game by both teams. Thought we had put ourselves in
a position to find a way to pull it out, and we just beat ourselves late in
the game there. A couple mishaps on offense, just didn't get good shots, and
they made a couple plays. They executed down the stretch, we didn't. I love
the fight we had to get back in it, take the lead. It's in your grasp. But
we're going to learn the hard way through this one today that you've got to
finish it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Guys, I know it wasn't the result you wanted, but what do you think
you learned about yourself in a performance like this against a team like
Michigan?  
KHRIS LANE: I think we learned we can play with anybody in the country, but
it's just about execution, playing hard, and playing solid defense for 40
minutes. When we do that, we can win, like we did yesterday. When we don't do
it the whole game, we lose close games like we did just now.  
  
Q. Mike'l, how do you feel you maybe have come on and progressed?  
MIKE'L SIMMS: I just try to bring a lot of energy off the bench, especially
since Isaac went down in this tournament. So I just want to bring a lot of
energy, whether it's defense or offense.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your message to the team in the locker room after a
game like this?  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, number one, we've got to learn to finish out games. The
biggest thing to me is you can't beat yourself against a team like Michigan.
We had them on the ropes there, and we had them throwing the ball around a
little bit. We sped it up, especially late in the second half to our
advantage.  
  
But you get that lead, you've got to be solid on defense and take care of the
ball and get good shots on offense, and we didn't do that. A lot of it's on
me. I've got to teach these guys. I've got to make them better to understand
late-game situations and to get good ones and execute.  
  
On the other end, we've got to make sure we get stops late in the game. There
was a stretch there where we were really guarding well, the best all year
long, especially that offense, but we didn't finish the game, and I thought we
beat ourselves at the end there, and that's what happens.  
  
Against a team like Michigan that was so well schooled, you've got to make
sure you take care of those little things, free-throw blockouts, I think two
or three times, we gave those up. Coming out of the timeout, executing a play.
We've just got to get better. Sometimes you learn the hard way, like we are
right now. We're going to use this to get better and better. Hopefully late in
games, we can close them out.  
  
Q. You mentioned that stretch you guys had. You had an 11-0 run there
and forced some turnovers. What do you think was working well for you guys
during that stretch?  
MIKE RHOADES: We changed up the press from man-to-man to a zone press. I
thought we caught them off guard a couple times. Got it caught in the air a
couple times. Then we just sat down and guarded, and I thought we did a really
good job of defensive rebounding and limiting them to one shot. They are
pretty big and hang at the top of the rim.  
  
So I thought we did a good job to scrap out some rebounds and go with it. I
thought we got downhill and shared the ball in that run. We had some really
good possessions where they were on their heels and we were attacking.  
  
So we've got to learn from it. I hate to keep saying that, but this is what
happens when you play a great schedule and you play really good teams.
Sometimes you learn the hard way, and that's what's occurring right now.  
  
Q. Kind of positives and negatives, what do you think will be the
biggest takeaways you'll take back home from this tournament?  
MIKE RHOADES: I definitely think that we're really improving, but we've got to
continue to improve at this rate. Then we've got to learn to win games. We're
playing with people, but we have to learn to win games and put them away. Our
returning players are playing different roles. We've got a lot of new faces
that didn't even know where Hawaii was, and now they're playing three games
against three really good teams.  
  
The thing about it, there are no excuses at VCU, and I'm not one to ever make
one. We've got to find ways to win. But we're improving, and I don't think a
lot of teams want to play us either. But we've got to find ways to get wins
like we could have in our two losses here on this trip.  
  
Q. What is the status of Vann? Do you expect him to be ready to go next
week?  
MIKE RHOADES: I hope so. We'll see. It's a high-ankle sprain, but there wasn't
a lot of swelling. The doctors felt pretty good about where he's progressing.
So hopefully Isaac -- we definitely need him for sure. Really proud of the
guys stepping up, Mike'l and Tyler Maye and Marcus Santos Silva. The guys are
stepping up, and that's what you do when a guy goes down.  
  
Q. Jon Teske is a guy that hasn't played very much for Michigan. I
wonder where he was on your scouting report and how he changes.  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, he was on there for sure. When you have a guy that size,
and we don't have a guy that big so we wanted to make sure we kept him off the
glass. Got a couple on rolls where we didn't have the right coverage or ball
screen coverage. Sometimes that's just how it goes, being in the right place
at the right time. I thought he helped them on the defensive end protecting
the rim.  
  
A couple times we drove in there and he's just standing there, roots in the
ground, 7'1", 255, you're not moving him. He did his job. It's almost like a
turnover. To me, that's just a bad shot. That happened three or four times
especially in the second half.  
  
He did the job. We were aware of him. But he definitely helped his team win
today.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2017

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Zach Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33119)

### [Conner Frankamp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26894)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 67, Wichita State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now have Wichita State, Coach Marshall, Conner Frankamp, and
Zach Brown. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's tough game?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought it was a great college basketball game. Obviously, I
wish it had ended three seconds sooner. I thought our guys battled against a
very, very good team with great players and a wonderful coach. I have
tremendous respect for Notre Dame, but I love the guys in my locker room. I
love those guys in my locker room, and we're going to win our share of these.
Unfortunately, you know, this one, just one play. We just needed one more
play, one more stop, one more basket, and we could point to a lot of different
things. But it came down to just that one play and three seconds.  
  
I thought it was a tremendous game, and I really am proud of the guys in my
locker room.  
  
Q. How much can you guys grow from this experience all week, especially
this last game?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: I think we can grow a lot from it. We played pretty well the
better half of that game, and we'll get back and watch video on it and just
learn from our mistakes and get better.  
  
Q. Conner, you had 12 points first half, none in the second, was it
their zone that was the problem? What do you think happened there regarding
your scoring in the second half?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: I just missed some open shots. I had some open shots and good
looks. They just didn't fall down for me, but that's how it goes sometimes.
I'll get back and get right back in the gym.  
  
Q. Conner, that switch in the zone, it just seemed like the offense was
kind of bogged down since the second half. What was the difference, do you
feel like?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: I'm not really sure. I don't think we attacked the middle of
the zone the best we could. That's something we'll work on, I imagine, when we
get back.  
  
Q. Zach, the three-point shot was falling today. Coming in, you kind of
struggled the first four games. What did you feel like kind of got you going
tonight to hit four?  
ZACH BROWN: Keeping my head up, really. Always staying confident shooting the
ball. To go 1 for 30 and shoot the next one with major confidence. That's all
it really is. Some people could go in the gym and put up a thousand shots, but
if they don't have confidence, they're not going to make the shot. But at the
end of the day, I feel like that's just about it.  
  
Q. For both of you, to be leading that game for 38 of the 40 minutes,
what's the emotion like following a game like that? Where you guys pretty much
had the lead the whole game, and you get it ripped out from under you at the
end?  
ZACH BROWN: Big emotions in the locker room, you know, but at the end of the
day, we're going to hold our heads high. We played a hell of a game, and I'm
proud of everybody in that locker room. Like you said, just a couple more
seconds, just one more play. Just certain individual things that we've got to
continue to work on. We're going to come back way stronger than this.  
  
Q. The second half, what seems to bog down the offense? Why do you feel
like the offense kind of took a dip the second half?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought we had some good looks. They get credit. They're out
there defending, and they did a good job of limiting us to one shot. We tried
a lot of different things, and we still shot 41%, 46% for the game, which is
pretty good for us. We made 8 out of 23 threes, 17 assists, 10 turnovers. Just
needed one more play. We needed a free throw or not turn it over against the
press, or not get slipped to the basket on the last play. There's a lot of
plays that you could point to, but every single play in that game mattered. We
need to come up with the rebound at the end without the tie-up. I'm proud of
our guys. That was a great team that we played. Well-coached, and they're
trying to win too. So it was a high, high level college basketball game.  
  
Q. You seemed to muddle things up for them offensively in the first
half. What did it change? Because I think they hit 14 of 24 shots in the
second half.  
GREGG MARSHALL: They've got good players and they ran some good stuff. They
got us on the back-cut once. Bonzie Colson is a first-team All-American. He
got to the line quite a bit. They ran some good action, and we held them to
67% -- 67 points. I don't know how many times they'll be held to 67 points on
the season. It's a 40-minute game.  
  
Q. Coach, how much does a game like this, an intense game in this
environment help you guys for where you go from here?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I think it certainly helps us. It doesn't hurt us. I don't
think losing to that caliber of a basketball team is going to hurt us. It's
the first close game we've been in, so hopefully we can learn from this. Now,
the coach adage that every single play matters, every defensive trip, every
special situation, now it will ring a little more true when we're telling them
that in the video room and in practice. So I think we've got probably arguably
one of the toughest non-conference schedules in the country. We're going to
play a lot of games like this over the next couple of weeks. Hopefully we can
win more than our share.  
  
Q. After that jump ball with 3.3 seconds left on the clock, what did you
say to your guys about what they might do? How maybe you guys should try to
defend?  
GREGG MARSHALL: One of the last things I said to him was don't help. Guard
your man. We take away certain things and we belly-up. We show our hands and
we fight screens. Somebody helped, and they were smart and looked for them.
They were able to get it to their big guy, the last guy you expect them to
throw it to. But we've seen that play on video. They run it well. He slips to
the basket very well. But he's a 50% free-throw shooter. He knocks them both
down. You can point to a lot of plays. You can point to a play 7 or 8 -- I
don't know when it was. I don't have a box score here that has the play-by-
play. But we went zone one possession with five or six, seven minutes in the
game. But Gibbs almost broke the backboard with the three-pointer and it goes
in the basket. It's been my experience when that happens -- it's been my
experience when people bank in three-pointers, they generally win. I guess the
luck of the Irish was with them tonight. That was a good shot.  
  
Q. The first free throw just seemed to hang on the rim forever. What was
going through your mind?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought it would come out. I really did. Again, he knocked
them in. To his credit. Austin Reaves, a young kid, goes to the line and he's
probably an 80% free-throw shooter on his career. Knocked down free throws
routinely and doesn't make this one. So he's crushed. There are a lot of guys
in that locker room that are crushed, but that's what I love about them
because they're winners. They're champions. They didn't win this championship,
but they're champions and they'll be champions at some point.

THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Jones. Coach, give us your thoughts on this
morning's game?  
  
WYKING JONES: For me, in all the years that I've been coaching, I've never
been so embarrassed in my life from the lack of effort from our guys. So, for
me, it's about going back to the drawing board, myself and my staff, and
figuring out what changes we need to make because there definitely needs to be
some changes. So we just have to go back to the drawing board and figure that
out, what changes we need to make. But there will definitely be some changes.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 67, Wichita State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome your 2017 Maui Jim Maui Invitational champion,
Notre Dame. Coach Mike Brey, Bonzie Colson, and Matt Farrell. Congratulations.
Your thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
MIKE BREY: What a great college game for November. I thought two really good
teams. They are really good. We couldn't guard them man-to-man. Thank God our
zone got us back into things. But I'm really proud of our group. You could
tell we have some guys that have played in big games and have won together.
For us to make a bunch of plays in the last 20 seconds to steal a win, you
know, I can't say I'm surprised, because it's a group that's won a lot
together. We said we wanted to have our name up on this wall. We felt our
program was one of those programs now that deserved to be on the wall on the
Maui wall here. I'm thrilled that it will be there, and we'll be back in four
years, Dave, to check it out when it's up on the wall. Maybe there will be a
picture of me with a T-shirt on up there.  
  
Q. So many plays that were big. What is the one that stands out for you
guys? A ton of them, but which one stands out the most for you guys?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think those free throws by Marti. Marti's been grinding
throughout this whole year. It's great to see him come down and show his heart
and pride and make those two free throws for our program. That was huge for
us. We battled throughout the whole game. We knew it was going to come down to
game situations. There have been a lot of those throughout the year. Our first
practice we welcomed game situations. Came down to our principles, and it was
a great win for us.  
  
MATT FARRELL: We've got guys that are fearless. Confident guys. I don't know
if you can say it was one play. Whoever was in the game was playing hard. Just
trying to make the right play. Marti was battling all game, rebounding. Rex
was down there rebounding. Everybody just played really hard, and we played
for each other. There is something special about this group. We have a lot of
fun with each other. It's just a great vibe.  
  
Q. Matt, on that inbounds play at the end, why is that play so
effective? They have to guard you off that double screen and then the second
guy comes. Why is that play so good for you guys?  
MATT FARRELL: If I'm making shots, you've got to chase me off those daggers.
That was a great play. Coach drew it up right away and we executed. Rex waited
for it, but we've got veteran guys. Bonzie just said we've been in game
situations before. We were confident when it got down to the last 20 seconds.
It's just about making winning plays and trusting in each other. But Rex made
a great read and we just played Notre Dame basketball.  
  
Q. They led for nearly 38 minutes. You guys led for 22 seconds. What
does that say about this team?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, we fight. We fight, and we give it all every game. We
give a lot of credit to Wichita State. They came out hitting shots, but we
stayed composed. Our talk in the locker room was phenomenal. Everybody coming
together saying, hey, we've got to pick things up. We did that. We just came
out fighting. It was going to come down to game situations. We stuck to our
principles on both sides of the floor, and we were hungry for this. We wanted
another trophy in our locker room, and it's great for our program.  
  
Q. Matt and Bonzie, you played with so much confidence. During that
entire time, 30 minutes, where you didn't have the lead, most of us never saw
any doubt that you infused so much confidence in your teammates. What is it
about your up bringing or what is it in your playing experience that's
prepared you for a day like this?  
MATT FARRELL: I think it helps that both our dads were coaches. We've been
around. We know we're not going to get these games back. You've got to give it
a hundred percent when you're on the floor every game, every play. That's what
we're going to try to do. That's what we're doing as leaders all year. That's
what we want the guys to do, to play hard every play and just keep
communicating. That's just how we play. You've got to play that way.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, just go out there and try to have fun. Try to lead by
example, being captains. Coach puts us in great situations so we can be
successful on both sides of the floor. We just fight. We fight and play with
everything we've got. We play like every game's our last. We just have
confidence within our group.  
  
Q. Matt, did you expect Shamat to get that last -- after the free throws
were made with two seconds to go, did you expect Shamat to get that ball? And
what was going through your mind defensively?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, that's something we work on in practice almost every day.
Whether it's three seconds or five seconds, we wanted to make sure they called
it going the other way so they didn't have any momentum, but we needed to
communicate. I think it came across, and me and C.J. communicated the switch.
We were up there, and whoever was going to get it, we just had to make sure we
catch them the other way, and we made a winning play. That's all it takes.  
  
Q. Speaking of a winning play, 14 seconds left to come up with that
giant steal. Can you just talk about what was going through your head? Right
before that, when the crowd is going crazy, thinking the Wichita State side,
thinking they might have snuck out with one?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I just spoke with Coach Brey about that, we had a
flashback to Wisconsin where Demitrius had that steal, same thing, we were
diamond press, he got a steal and laid it in and helped us win that game. And
just to never give up. I saw him cutting and I just read it, tried to come
from the back side and just tip it. Bonzie was right there, and it just worked
out. You just never give up and you've got to play hard until the horn sounds.  
  
Q. Matt, MVP, man. How does that come over you? I know it's a team
thing, but only one guy can be MVP?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I know for a fact that I wouldn't have been able to do it
without my team. Obviously, Coach Brey has been putting me in really good
positions since I've been here. It's really easy for me when I'm playing with
guys like Bonzie and other guys on the floor. This guy makes me so much
better. It's surreal. It's a lot of fun having family here and some friends,
and watching this growing up and coming out here ask winning it, it's a lot of
fun. We're going to enjoy it.  
  
Q. Bonzie, what do you think about Matt winning MVP?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, man, it's my brother, man. He deserves it. He played his
heart out. It's great for him. He works hard every day, and he came out
strong, just doing his thing. We need him to continue to do that, and he will.
With our offense and how we play, it's easy for him when he can do his thing
and create for others.  
  
Q. Coach, how much does this victory, this title, this championship
carry you guys forward? What can it do for you guys in these next few months
as you get to March?  
MIKE BREY: I think it's a big confidence builder when you can win an in-season
tournament. We won the Legends Classic last year. But this is the premier
tournament. To win the Maui Classic, this is the tournament. Everybody watches
this one. And I bet a lot of people were watching with cocktails in their
hands back east tonight. So it's a great confidence builder. When you have two
guys like that, they make me a better coach. You talked about them being calm.
They're flat out assassins, and you saw it tonight. They're killers. They're
amazingly competitive. They've got that edge. I call it that I-95 edge. Guys
that grow up on that I-95 corridor, a Jersey guy or Boston guy, there's
something about those guys that have a little edge to them.  
  
Q. Take me through that inbounds set. Three seconds left, and you knew
they're expecting it to go to Farrell or Bonzie.  
MIKE BREY: Yes. We never ran that look out of it. We never have run that. When
you have smart guys and high basketball IQ guys, which this group is, Matty
came off it first. He takes a lot of traffic. Then Bonzie came off it. The
great thing I kept telling them, even though they were fired up was like don't
rush to it. Let it develop. Marti did a great job diving hard. Rex is great
taking the ball out of bounds, and you know what? I would have been shocked if
Marti missed. He's playing too well. He's had a little bit of an up and down
career. Of course, he won the gold medal with his country in August, in the
world university games. He played so well for us, that he deserved a moment
like that.  
  
But we executed it, and Rex did a good job finding it and being patient. How
about Rex tying the guy up. Having the presence of mind getting back in there
and we've got the arrow? Between the steal, the tie up and the execution in
what was that, a 20-second window. That's a lot going on right there. You've
got to have smart guys, and we've got high basketball IQ guys.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
MIKE BREY: Divine intervention a little bit. Maybe the Lady on the Dome helped
us with that one. I'll say this. When we took a left to come up the road
before you come in the back, I saw a darn rainbow. I'm thinking that could be
a little bit of the Luck of the Irish. You look for anything on game day,
right, Coach Odom? You look for any sign possibility that maybe it's going to
be a good day.  
  
Q. Speaking of signs, you referenced the shirt and shorts and seeing how
well it worked out for you here. Is there any chance you'd rock that going
forward?  
MIKE BREY: I tell you what, we play a lot south of the Mason-Dixon Line. I'm
wondering if I should rock this on Tobacco Road.  
  
No, I think I'll keep this look for Maui. I'm wondering if next year Maui will
put in a dress code for coaches, or if more coaches will go with the practice
look. I'm very interested to see. I also want to know how many of these shirts
we sold in our book store the last three days, because they got a lot of pub,
I hear.  
  
Q. What is it about the zone that that Wichita State had problems with
the first two days too? What was it that makes it bog down for them?  
MIKE BREY: They run their stuff. Their man stuff is so downhill at you. It's
coming down on you hard. And obviously the first 20 minutes and early in the
second half, we couldn't deal with it, and we're a pretty good defensive team,
I think. We just couldn't deal with it. They've got some men, old guys,
physical guys, and we haven't played a lot of two-three zone this season.  
  
So I said we've got to change their rhythm. A lot of times a team changes
their rhythm when they're running their zone offense. Maybe they get a little
bashful when they're shooting the jumpshot. We did a great job of rebounding
out of it. But it was a key that we played pretty much our starters the whole
second half. They know how to play together, and they really played that well
off of each other and covered. It saved us, because we could not guard them
man-to-man.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2017

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Dantley Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29903)

### [Austin Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34353)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Chaminade - 96, Cal - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Chaminade to the media room, Coach Bovaird, Dantley
Walker, and Austin Pope. Coach, your thoughts on this morning's game.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: How about those Silverswords, huh? Incredible performance. We
got our butts kicked the past two days. Notre Dame just beat us. Notre Dame
just beat us. And for these guys to bounce back, get up at 6:00 in the
morning, get a little bit of breakfast, watch film of a Cal team that we've
never seen live before, and to follow the game plan and to execute what we
were trying to do, I give these guys all the credit. I didn't make a basket.
These two guys right here were pretty special today, and I'm really proud of
them.  
  
Q. Dantley, I saw you guys down maybe the last six, eight, ten minutes
just smiling every time down the court. You too, Austin. When did you guys
start to believe that we had this, we've got this?  
DANTLEY WALKER: I'm kind of the type of person that never thinks the game is
over, even if you're up big in the last couple minutes. I always think there's
something that can happen. But I think about two minutes left and I think
Austin scored one of his many late buckets, and I thought, man, we really did
it. I've been coming here for three years, and this is the most special moment
I've had, so it's pretty awesome.  
  
Q. Same question to you, Austin?  
AUSTIN POPE: Oh, man, I mean, going into that second half I knew that they
were going to buckle, but we had to come out and play solid. Our guys stuck
together through their runs. They came out on us tough early. Couple guys put
up a couple bad shots. I missed some free throws, as you could see. But we
pulled it together. Like Dantley said, about two minutes to go, I had a lay-
in, and I just knew it. The coaching staff, everybody was just down, and I
felt like we could get it done.  
  
Q. Could both of you guys speak to maybe envisioning something like this
kind of moment when you guys came to Chaminade? Austin, in your case, a couple
years ago. Dantley, three, four years ago. What is this moment like after that
amount of time?  
DANTLEY WALKER: When Coach first started recruiting me, and I decided to
transfer from UNLV, this is what I envisioned happening -- winning a game at
Maui, and having this feeling. It took a couple years to get it, but I tell
you what, it was well worth it. It was well worth the last three years. It's
awesome.  
  
AUSTIN POPE: Yeah, same thing along the same lines. I unfortunately --
fortunately, actually, I ended up at Chaminade. Coach Bovaird told me about
the Maui Invitational, and I watched it year in and year out. Last year we
played some pretty good teams, just like this year. I knew going in if we
played against Cal Berkeley and we played hard, I knew we could beat them, and
we got it done tonight. We didn't have much time to prepare, but we got it
done.  
  
Q. You guys are both seniors. That was your last game here. But next
year this team is not going to be here. How much -- is there a statement that
was made here today? Any kind of anything like that?  
AUSTIN POPE: I mean, you could say that. But at the end of the day we're
trying to enjoy it. We're not really worried about the next year or the
following years. Of course we're always going to be Silverswords for life. But
we're going to enjoy this moment. We've got Thanksgiving and our family and
friends are here supporting us. So that's where we're at right now.  
  
DANTLEY WALKER: You said it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defense? That was something else. You guys
shot it great, but you played really well. Held them to 42% shooting, and
worse than that, from three-point line. How about the defense today?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, we were not pleased at all with the past two days of
defense. We had several days to prepare for Notre Dame. We knew exactly what
was going to come at us. We gave up a high percentage both way days.  
  
This morning, we had a heart-to-heart talk. Like, look, we're tired of getting
these side ball screens coming off and scoring on us, like they've done the
past two days. That's a big part of Cal's offense. We made a few adjustments,
and the guys really bought in, which is a huge deal.  
  
Because after getting your butt kicked for two days, obviously, everybody's
questioning everything. So for these guys to buy in and execute the game plan
while we were sitting with no breakfast at 7:00 o'clock in the morning, it's a
pretty special group of guys.  
  
Q. When did you start to believe? When did you believe, hey, maybe this
is going to happen?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, I had the same feeling that I had against Texas. You know,
the last three, four minutes of the game seemed to go forever. You keep
looking to the clock, looking to the clock. You think are they starting the
clock on time because it doesn't appear like it's moving fast enough.  
  
But we believe from 7:00 o'clock this morning that we could do it. Was it
going to be tough? Yeah. I talked to the guys about, look, we shoot the three.
We had two horrible days of shooting. I have the confidence in you guys if you
have an open look, take it. I know them having the confidence from their coach
is a part of the reason why they shot the ball well.  
  
But the unselfish play that we had, I thought it was spectacular. Cal was
known for their press. We were getting the ball into the center and attacking
the sides and getting a lot of good stuff. So, you know, they did a great job.  
  
Q. Obvious question, but what does this do for your program when you win
a game like this?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Oh, it's huge. I'm going to have 1,000 text messages and 1,000
emails. Everybody wants to come to Chaminade now. We might have to -- we're
going to increase enrollment by a couple thousand too. But it means a lot. It
means a lot. It puts us on the map. If you leave this tournament and you get
beaten three times by 40 points, they're thinking, well, who wants to go there
and get beat? But whenever you beat a Pac-12 team or a Big 12 team like we did
years ago, it means a lot to the guys that are trying to -- most of the guys
we recruit are getting recruited by Division I schools. They look at us and
think: Hey, I've got a chance to play in a tournament like this? I have a
chance to do something special. And they believe that they can come here and
win.  
  
Q. I think this year's team is your largest team. And just overall team
makeup, team identity is a little different than the type of team you've had
here in Maui in the past. You did shoot the heck out of the three today. But
that size, that different makeup of the team, how did that help you today and
how did you succeed with that today?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, we've had -- even though, again, Notre Dame and Michigan
beat us, we were pretty even on the boards rebounding-wise, the past two days.
Today was huge. Going after loose balls and having that extra couple inches of
height makes a big difference. We wanted to change our strategy as far as how
to figure out a way to get PacWest championships. And some of the power teams
in our conferences, the Cal Baptists, and Dixie States and stuff, we're going
to have to make some adjustments. So we really hit the recruiting trail as far
as trying to get the 6'8" plus guys, but I like the 6'8" plus guys that have
skills. Luckily some just fell into our lap this year. They were supposed to
go to Division I schools, something happens, and I get a call from a
connection that I have and they want to come to Chaminade. So, yeah, height
definitely makes a difference, especially if height can play. We've got a good
group of 6'8", 6'7 plus guys that can play. So definitely helps.  
  
Q. You're now done with the D-I portion of the season. Just talk about
the next portion, you started off well in Alaska, and now the goal is to get
as deep as you can in the Division II tournament and make it there. This year
we'll have another competitive PacWest. Talk about that aspect?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Number one, this tournament has always done a great job of
preparing us to get into conference play. We have one out-of-conference game
before we start getting into conference play. But these teams we play against,
they have the ability to expose weaknesses. I can tell you the first two teams
really did. It's great for us as coaches to see what those weaknesses are
before you get into conference play. So I like to play a tough schedule. We
have probably the toughest Division II schedule in the country. So it's going
to help us going into conference play without a doubt. I'm still going to go
back and watch the first two games and really analyze what we need to continue
to grow on. But today I'm going to enjoy this win.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

### [Jon Teske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34361)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan - 68, VCU - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Michigan players, Duncan Robinson, Jon Teske,
and Moritz Wagner. Congratulations. Let's take questions from the group.  
  
Q. Moritz, if you could talk about that last stretch where you made the
three-point play, and you come back with backing out for that three-pointer,
that gets yourself from going to a tie to a three-point lead. That had to feel
pretty good?  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, obviously, winning the game was pretty good, especially
coming out like that at halftime. We were able to finish two plays and yeah,
now we won.  
  
Q. For all you guys, how important was it to go home from here 2-1,
especially after the opening-day loss, and today's game you're either 1-2 or
2-1? How important was that mindset today?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: After that first one on Monday night, we were very
disappointed, but we kind of huddled together and agreed to head back on the
plane 2-1 would be a big accomplishment. So that was kind of our focus after
Monday night's result. We just kind of tried to band together and hopefully
that could set the tone for us to move forward.  
  
JON TESKE: We just want to take it one game at a time. The loss against LSU,
we knew we had to bounce back and just battle back and go 2-1 on this trip.
That's good for us, and we know what we can take away.  
  
Q. Duncan, the back-to-back takes that you had, obviously one was in
transition, but the other one, I think was in the half court, how much of that
was you wanting to do that because the shots weren't falling versus what the
defense was giving you?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: A little bit of both. The one in transition, I was able to
get out and make a good pass. Then the other one, just trying to continue to
be aggressive without shooting from the outside. So I was able to get shots
that could get to the rim. So just doing whatever it takes to make something
happen late in the game.  
  
Q. In that ten-minute stretch where it didn't seem like anything was
going right, what was happening on the sidelines amongst yourselves? In terms
of trying to figure out something?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I think we're a very young team, and that shouldn't be an
excuse, but I think we have a long way to go in terms of how to play to win
and in a mature way. I'm very happy that we could win this because now we can
enjoy and watch some film, and there's a lot of opportunity to get better.
Yeah, very grateful to be in that position.  
  
Q. Now that the basketball portion is done and you can reflect on your
time in Hawaii, outside of this gym, what has been something that's been
memorable for you being here on the sidelines?  
JON TESKE: It's just been a great trip overall, just bonding with the guys off
the court. Hawaii's a great place to be. Just taking a dip in the pool or the
ocean, and really just bonding with the guys and getting to know the guys
better off the court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement on this morning's game?  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: We're thrilled to get 2-1 out of this tournament. Somebody's
going to go home 0-3, and somebody's going to go out of here 3-0. And it's
just those two. It could be on the other side of a 2-1 or 1-2 is really big.
VCU played so hard, and they've got a lot of talent and a great coach. So I
really feel blessed. I think they'll have a really good year. This win will be
a good one for us going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did this team show you and maybe show itself after
the disappointing opening loss?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, I think when you see the score today, the Chaminade-Cal
score, you see things like that. That Chaminade game was a tough game for us.
We were up in the LSU game pretty good, and just things didn't bounce our way.
We didn't make them bounce our way. We had a really tough loss. So bounced
back, and then today have another lead, lose it, and then come back. Just huge
for us to just understand what winning basketball looks like. Because there
was a five-minute span in the second half where we did the opposite. We showed
what losing basketball looked like. Missing foul shots. We made one turnover
in the first half, then nine in the second half was a killer.  
  
Q. What was kind of the key for you guys to regroup after that stretch
you had, that 11-0 run to put yourself in position to take the lead late?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We just needed to take one shot. They just needed to run what we
were trying to run, right? When people are playing you like that, they're
trying to speed you up and get you out of your comfort area. We just bought
right into it. All of a sudden, we got uncomfortable, and we're just like
playing so careless for a little bit. Thank goodness we ended up just short of
getting ourselves set and doing some of the action that they know they can do
really well, and it paid off.  
  
Q. Today (indiscernible) Zavier in the second half? A team with three
teams in three different situations with the point guard. Where's that
stand?  
JOHN BEILEIN: First of all, it has a lot to do with Williams, No. 10. Eli, we
like what he can possibly bring for us in the future. But there's one guy, if
I want one guy to guard Williams at the end, it was going to be Zavier. So he
did a great job. I thought we were in real trouble. When they were in the
double-bonus late, and they were going to drive it, and drive it. And as you
know, Zavier's been a guy that guards really hard and fouls a lot. He didn't
foul, and alas did a great job on No. 10, I think that was a big difference in
the game.  
  
Q. That one moment with three minutes left in the game. Eli, I couldn't
tell if he missed the switch or didn't know where his man was. I think when
they made the three with three minutes to go.  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yep. My bad. I tried to switch them to get him back on the guard
and get Duncan over on the shooter. He saw what to do, but Duncan didn't see
it. So it was my bad. I shouldn't have done it, because it was too far to go
and they left the shooter open. So I really felt bad after that one. But I
thought we could do it quick enough, and we didn't.  
  
Q. From that moment, it seemed like that could have been a moment for a
younger team that changed the day, changed the game. What did they show you in
that response those last two minutes?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They really executed down the stretch. Just Muhammad's three is
huge. Well, you guys have watched him evolve as a player, and look, he hit
four or five assists again. So he's like 23 assists and one turnover. That's
as many assists as he might have his whole freshman year. You could check
that, probably. So just watching different guys understand their roles.  
  
Charles, four from the foul line, hurt. Muhammad steps up. And they called the
one driving play for Muhammad, or for Mo, they called it. I didn't call it. We
had practiced it in practice, and they said let's run that, boom. Three-point
play. Then Mo just finally getting an open look and putting it in. Big plays
we get those nine points like that.  
  
Q. VCU only turned you over one time in the first half. What were some
of the different looks you were seeing in the second?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, they went to a zone diamond and one trap. That was a
little bit of it. We didn't turn it over there. We turned it over, they sped
us up. Then in the half court we got Mo posted up with a little guy at him. We
throw a bounce pass to him, right? Got stolen. We threw the ball ahead some
time, threw it over somebody's head when they weren't looking. Just like
careless turnovers. That with the foul shooting, that's not winning
basketball. You cannot do that. I don't mind a turnover. They trap you and
they deflect. That's a different deal. When you're just giving them the ball,
that's not good.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wichita State - 80, Marquette - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Marquette to the media room. Coach Wojciechowski
and Markus Howard.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We have tremendous respect for Wichita State. They're a
team that's going to have an outstanding season and is capable of winning a
National Championship with their talent and their experience and their
coaching.  
  
We knew it would be a very difficult game for us. I thought our kids played
hard and competed. We need to add to those elements, a greater attention to
detail, and a little bit higher basketball IQ.  
  
Q. Markus, the last two games you and Rowsey have been the leading
scorers. You guys are obviously the major part of your team. What do you have
to do to get your big boys involved?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I think we have to look for them more in the post, and feeding
off that. You have to play inside out rather than outside in. I think more so,
just getting involved in lots of ball screens and looking to pick and pop with
them. Also, initiating offense with the post feed. So just little things like
that gets the offense moving and changes it up.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, and one of our big boys was in horrendous foul
trouble in Sam Hauser. He's a big boy, too, and for him to play three minutes
in the first half, that's a hard thing for our team. Because like Markus and
Andrew, he's an outstanding college player.  
  
The foul trouble, I thought we withstood it. Unfortunately, for Sam, I thought
he never caught his rhythm. For you guys who haven't seen him play, Sam's one
of the better players in the United States, and that foul trouble really hurt
us.  
  
Q. Other than Howard and Rowsey, no one had more than five points. What
do you think was going on there? Was it shots weren't falling or something
else?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, our offense is centered around our two most dynamic
scorers, which are Andrew and Markus, so those guys are going to shoot a lot.
The third piece of that puzzle, Sam Hauser. Like I just mentioned, he wasn't
in the game very much. When he was, he didn't have great rhythm. I thought we
got good shots from the other guys. We didn't make them. I mean, I think when
we watch the tape, I think we probably had ten wide-open shots that didn't
drop, and sometimes that happens. I believe in my guys. When they're open, I
want them taking those shots. And I think more times than not, they'll knock
them down. But of those ten open threes we missed, we would normally make four
of them because we have a good shooting team. Tonight we didn't. So that's why
you see the box score looking like it did.  
  
Our interior guys are young. Matt's -- I love Matt Heldt. I wouldn't trade him
for anyone. He's everything I want in a Marquette basketball player. Interior
scoring, back-to-the-basket scoring is not his strongest suit. And Theo John
is a puppy. He's trying to figure it out. He's playing on a super highway, and
his whole life, he's been used to riding on dirt country roads.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of let off speaking about Wichita State's
championship potential, and looking at their scoring distribution today, is
that a lot of what goes into making them a tough opponent?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: They have outstanding coaching. They have tremendous
experience. They have terrific offensive balance. They have a pro point guard.
They have a strong identity in roles and definition, and they've got a
terrific bench.  
  
Other than that, they're not very good (laughing).

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 92, LSU - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Will Wade of LSU in the media room. An opening statement?  
  
WILL WADE: Obviously, it's a tough night for us. They're a phenomenal team. We
were outclassed in every way. But we've got to respond the right way and get
ready to go tomorrow. We've got a game at 3:00 tomorrow, and you get to wipe
the taste out of your mouth and get going. So we need to, you know, get back
and get some rest tonight and get ready to go tomorrow and move forward.  
  
Disappointing result, and we obviously didn't play very well. I was
disappointed in our effort. But a quick turnaround, so we've got to get going.  
  
Q. Losing Brandon so early, where did that hurt you the most?  
WILL WADE: Well, it deflated us. I thought that first possession was pretty
much indicative of the game. We got two or three offensive rebounds and could
point get the ball in the basket. He goes down. He's one of our better
players, so it hurt us defensively. He gave us some length. We're going to use
him on Farrell a little bit to give us some length, and it didn't work out.  
  
But we've got other guys. They've got to step up. Some of these other guys
have wanted opportunities, and they -- we've got to step up. We've got to get
some of these guys ready to go tomorrow and really step up. But he hurt.  
  
I mean, listen, Notre Dame is a phenomenal team. They're a Final Four-caliber
team. They shoot it, and they've got great poise. They play with unbelievable
pace. It would have taken a very good effort from us to win tonight with or
without Sampson.  
  
Q. How important now does tomorrow come, the difference between going
home 1-2 or 2-1 from here?  
WILL WADE: I mean, it's huge. It's huge. There is a huge difference in that,
1-2 and 2-1. So we've got to do everything we can to get back in the saddle
and get this win tomorrow over a very good Marquette team.  
  
Q. You guys had trouble getting shots to fall. Were you getting the
looks that you wanted?  
WILL WADE: I thought we rushed a little bit. When they started barraging us
from three, we came down and tried to answer with quick threes instead of just
working inside. We got a little bit discombobulated there. That hurt us. I did
a poor job preparing our team. We had too many ball screen coverages. We got
way too complicated on a short prep. Offensively, we didn't play with the pace
and the passing, and the movement that we needed to. So we were just way too
stagnant. That's on me. We've got to get that corrected and get better for
tomorrow.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Justin Tillman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30597)

### [De'Riante Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34358)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
VCU - 83, Cal - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome VCU to the media room. Coach Rhoades, De'Riante
Jenkins, and Justin Tillman.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Really proud of our guys' response from yesterday. Told these
guys last night, today the team that gets over yesterday's game will give
themselves a better chance, and I'm really proud of our guys. They did a good
job of focusing on what we had to do. I thought our defense was much better
today. I thought we rebounded. Our guards got really involved on the glass in
the game and set the tone. That really helped us. Really proud how we shared
the ball. Thought we did a good job of getting in the lane and sharing it and
making some plays. It was a good effort. Now we need to see if we can get one
more.  
  
Q. De'Riante, you had a big game, career highs in points and rebounds.
Doing those things, did it feel good in warm-ups and how did you feel out
there today?  
MIKE RHOADES: Because of his defense, he played great defense today, and it
carried over to offense.  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Just I was aggressive, and Xavi went down yesterday, and
he's a big part of the team, so I had to step up and help with scoring on the
defensive end and rebounding.  
  
Q. Justin, how do you feel you guys kind of filled in with Isaac out? He
was the second leading scorer coming in. But you put up season-high points at
the half and really scored really well today?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: We all know we had to pick it up. Coach was telling us before
the game, we have to put our first punch in. Shots were going in today, so it
was in our favor.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about how key the threes were today. You guys made
12. They made only 4. How key was long-range shooting today?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: We know they could see the ball, and it was an emphasis
since Marquette and Virginia. This was our best game guarding the three-point
line. We need to feed off of this, and that's pretty much what we need to do
all season.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: We work on that a lot, every day in practice. We do two or
three drills, and I guess it paid off today.  
  
Q. You talked about and mentioned yesterday about carrying over that
defensive execution from practice to the game. How do you feel they put
everything together today on the defensive end?  
MIKE RHOADES: Much more, much better. It's tough to have less than a day's
scout of a team. We knew they were really going to work the ball inside with
those two big guys, and they also have some guards that can shoot it in
Coleman and Sueing.  
  
So we knew we had to protect the three for sure, but we had to make sure we
did a good job on the glass and defending that basket. Right off the bat, I
thought our guys really locked in a game plan on the defensive end.  
  
Our biggest thing is we're so young, we're inexperienced. The more we play,
the better we're going to get. These guys really want to win, but there is a
process to it all. We have to have that carryover. We had it today. It's from
yesterday, from the scouting report, and we did a good job defending the
three. But I thought we did a good job rotating and rebounding better.  
  
Q. Do you feel this was maybe the best cohesion they had on defense,
particularly in the half court?  
MIKE RHOADES: Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt. I thought we did a really good
job of guarding the ball. I thought we did a good job of rotating where we
needed to be. We didn't give up a lot of easy ones, let's put it that way. 4
for 15 from the three, that's how we got to defend with our length all year
long.  
  
Q. With Isaac being out, you had to use your bench more. How do you feel
about the production from some of the young guys?  
MIKE RHOADES: We talk about we have an army of guys. With our style of play,
we can bring these guys in in waves. Mike'l Simms has had two really good
games for us with great energy. He's a tough, hard-nosed kid from Richmond. He
really helps us. I thought Xavier Jackson gave us some really good minutes.
Our freshman point guard, Ty Maye, we're throwing them, and this kid's 17, and
we're throwing him in the Maui Invitational against a really good player. He's
trying to survive. I thought he gave us great minutes today.  
  
It will get better and better as we throw these guys in the fire. But if we
can use that bench more and more, then Johnny Williams doesn't have to play 34
minutes a game. We don't want him to, but at times we've got to keep him in
there because the way the game is going. So the more these guys off the bench
come in, the four freshmen, they can all help us. They just need game
experience, and really proud of their effort today.  
  
We're going to play like this tomorrow because these guys deserve that time.  
  
Q. Coach, the opportunity to go 2-1 here presents itself tomorrow. How
big would that be?  
MIKE RHOADES: Oh, it would be huge. It would be awesome. The one thing is
everybody thinks we're supposed to win every game at VCU. Our fans think that,
everybody thinks that. I understand. That's why it's an awesome place to be
the basketball coach. But winning games is really hard. It's really hard
wherever you're at. So we want to celebrate any type of success we always
have, no matter who it's against, whatever tournament we're in, whatever. But
to be 2-1, and get another one tomorrow and head back home, that would be
awesome.  
  
These guys, you know, but everybody deserves it. So we've got to go get it.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Rashard Kelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32698)

### [Austin Reaves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34357)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wichita State - 80, Marquette - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Wichita State to the media room. Coach Marshall,
Rashard Kelly, and Austin Reaves. We'll start by having Coach give us an
opening statement, and then we'll take questions for players. Coach, your
thoughts on this morning's game?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought we played much better, more like Wichita basketball
that I'm used to seeing. We outrebounded them by 17, and we won points in the
paint 44 to 22. So if we could just stop fouling them on the three-point
shots, I think we'd be even better. But they battled. They battled. They were
a tough team. But in the end, I think our size and strength wore them down.  
  
Q. You guys were pretty even on rebounds with them in the first half,
and then in the second half you guys ended up with almost 20 more than them.
What do you do to increase the advantage on the floor in the second half?  
RASHARD KELLY: We just kept crashing our offense and continuing to check out
on defense. That's just really our motto. We really didn't think about the
numbers during the game, but just the performance at the end of the game kind
of showed our motto.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: I think also we had a chance to get a couple of defensive
rebounds because they didn't make every shot.  
  
Q. Rashard, after a great game yesterday, getting the start today, how
-- did that energize you at all with the way you played today? Did you feel
there was any difference for you starting?  
RASHARD KELLY: No, there's no difference. We just had to play and keep
bringing the same mindset every day. It continued to be that glue guy. We have
great scorers on our team. We have great guys that can shoot the ball. I've
just got to find a different way to contribute.  
  
Q. Austin, there towards the end of the game, you made some pretty
incredible moves. Obviously, you've got no shoulder problems left, huh?  
AUSTIN REAVES: No, sir.  
  
Q. You played really well. Tell me what happened the last three, four
minutes of the game that just made you go totally unbelievable on your play?  
AUSTIN REAVES: It's just the way we play. We play with a lot of energy. If
you're not sprinting the floor or crashing on offensive rebounds or
rebounding, you get taken out of the game. Doing that stuff puts you in a
really good position to succeed and do good things.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, what would a Maui Invitational title mean for
you guys if it comes tomorrow?  
RASHARD KELLY: Coach, you had a championship here yet?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: I've never had a championship here, Rashard.  
  
RASHARD KELLY: All right. It would mean the world to us.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: There you go (laughing).  
  
Q. Rashard, when you look at your final stat line, only six points, you
talk about the rebounds, the charges, the blocks. For someone like you, just
how happy does that make you to see numbers as high as they were today?  
RASHARD KELLY: I'm glad I contributed. I'm glad we won. The numbers, they
don't really matter to me how high they go. We have a plus-minus system, and
the more pluses I have, that's the more satisfaction I'll get.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought his two blocks on the breakaway lay-up where he ran
the guy down, blocked it, no one else sprinted. The guy gets the offensive
rebound, he blocked it again. That's my favorite play of the year thus far.
That was a tremendous play, and it epitomizes Rashard Kelly and hopefully our
program.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
RASHARD KELLY: You got to come to one of our film sessions one day then
(laughing). No, seriously, we've got to create a mindset, play angry. That's
been our motto around Wichita State. Somebody's just got to fall in love with
doing the dirty work. I don't want to be the superstar, the highlight-type
player. I just want to get the job done. So if I'm the robber of the team,
I'll take it. I'll give the Draymond, the bad guy.  
  
Q. Austin, if you could explain Rashard's importance to this team? Only
six points, but probably the Most Valuable Player. What makes him so valuable
to you guys?  
AUSTIN REAVES: He's an everyday guy. He never takes days off. He comes to work
every day, practice. I mean, it's hard to practice five times a week, and as
hard as we do. So he's an everyday guy. He does the little things. He's not
worried about his points. He rebounds, takes charge and does the little
things, like Coach says all the time. Those little things matter.  
  
Q. You guys come in ranked No. 6 and one of the favorites to win the
tournament. How have you been handling the pressure and having your team focus
on playing the game?  
GREGG MARSHALL: We didn't handle it very well at all yesterday, I thought, for
25 minutes. I talked about that. I was not happy with our poise that we
exhibited nor the purpose or passion. I mean, we didn't play as hard as we
needed to play, and Cal to the a huge lead. It took a monumental effort by our
guys to come back in the game.  
  
Today we had a totally different mindset. We stopped fouling the shooter. Did
a better job on those ball screens, which we did in the second half. Made some
great adjustments. My staff had tremendous suggestions.  
  
It's just -- it's basketball. Don't put too much into it. We just need to
continue to -- whoever we're playing, listen to the coaching staff, listen to
the scouting report, and execute. We've got plenty of guys over there that can
help us have more points in our column than the other team at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, on playing a team that you know is going to shoot a lot of
three-pointers, over half their shots, their threes, made a ton early. What do
you tell your guys? Evened out over the course of the game, but what do you
feel was key to kind of keep that percentage down?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we held Marquette to 66 points, and they were averaging,
I thought, over 80. I could be wrong, but they were averaging over 80. So when
you can do that, you have a great chance of winning. We got some really good
-- we executed down the stretch too. Our defense was much better, especially
in the second half. Howard was unbelievable. They don't miss wide-open shots,
so you can't give them wide-open shots. You've got to have great communication
if you're going to do any type switching on the ball screens. All those runner
-- we call them runner when they come off the double screen, the triple screen
along the baseline.  
  
But I thought Zach Brown didn't do his normal job early in the game, but I
thought Austin Reaves was very good defensively. I thought Rashard Kelly was
very good defensively. The thing that's amazing about our team is who we bring
up here each time.  
  
Yesterday, these guys were nowhere to be found. It was Shaq and Landry, I
think. So today it's Austin Reaves and Rashard Kelly. You just never know who
it's going to be.  
  
Q. Outside shots still not falling down for you guys. I think you shot
almost 70% on twos. How impressive is it that this team is still finding a way
to manufacture a really good offensive performance without the threes?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we shot 54%. We had 18 assists to 12 turnovers as a
team, and we had ten offensive rebounds. So when you can score 80 points, I
don't think we lose very often when we score 80 points. Obviously, LSU or
Notre Dame could do that. They could score 81 or more. But our goal is to
score 80. When we do that, we have a phenomenal record.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
GREGG MARSHALL: We didn't shoot it well yesterday either. That's been our MO.
We try to crash the glass, we try to get the ball inside, try to get to the
foul line. We didn't make our free throws today either. I don't know what it
is. Maybe we're due for some outside shots to go in.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, our big guys are in there checking out and did a good
job of that. Rashard Kelly, and Austin Reaves, he's so slight a build. He's
very gritty, very tough. He gets nine, and Landry gets seven. Those guys are
6'5 now, and Landry's very athletic. So everybody has to contribute.  
  
The ideal situation is force a tough, contested shot. Everybody check out, and
that ball can hit the floor, and the guards can swoop in and get it.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Lot of skin on the ground for both teams. Both teams played
very hard. That's what you have to do to win these type games.

### [Wyking Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34213)

### [Marcus Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26973)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
VCU - 83, Cal - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Cal to the media room, Coach Jones and Marcus Lee.
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
WYKING JONES: Well, it starts with how we come out of the gate. Today we came
out of the gate very slow. We had good looks in the post. We traveled it,
turned it over. You know, we don't have the kind of experience or depth where
we can start off slow and make a run late. That kind of was our demise today
in that we started off so slow. And after that, once we dug ourselves a hole,
then we started playing. We weren't playing Cal basketball at that point. We
were trying to play catch-up at that point.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned you guys came out a little slow. What were some of
the things that VCU was doing that you had that gave you guys some trouble
coming out of the gate?  
MARCUS LEE: As a team, we came out slow, lackadaisical, and we just wanted to
play all our men, all our leaders. We had to get our team ready to play and
focus all the way through.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is a chance to learn what you can be and what
you need to do down the road?  
MARCUS LEE: We came here to Maui to be tested and see where we were at. We've
seen where we can be absolutely great at times, and we see where we let off
the gas. We know we need to be A-1 every step of the way, because we know if
we do everything right, we have a chance at winning. But if we don't do that
we're going to lose.  
  
Q. How much of a challenge tomorrow when you start 0-2 here?  
WYKING JONES: Tomorrow's a must-win for us. You don't come to a tournament
like this and go home 0-3. I'm expecting our guys to come out with a fight.
Expecting them to come out ready to play tomorrow, no matter who we have to
play. Hopefully that happens. Can't go home 0-3.  
  
Q. What was it like facing a player like De'Riante Jenkins out there?  
WYKING JONES: Too many open looks. He got into a comfort zone, and we knew his
potential to shoot the ball like that. We just gave him too many looks. Like
yesterday against Frankamp and Shamat, there was more a sense of urgency to
get out to those guys, because we knew that they could really shoot it, and we
didn't have the same urgency to get out with those guys as we did yesterday.
So our guys should have done a better job with it.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [T.J. Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34360)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 92, LSU - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Notre Dame to the media room, Coach Brey and
T.J. Gibbs. Coach, give us your opening thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
MIKE BREY: I wish I could bottle that up the rest of the season. Thought we
really played well on both ends of the floor. Our experience, I think, showed.
I'm just thrilled with our defense. They score 90, and they shoot 58 percent
last night. We hold them to 36 percent. They had 17 turnovers. Again, I think
the difference with our group is how we're playing defense.  
  
Q. T.J., you guys jumped on them early. What was going so well for you
guys offensively?  
T.J. GIBBS: I think we just really slowed down, and we were playing within
ourselves. We were leaning on each other early. We were just seeing the open
man and making the extra pass, which was really big for us. We just did what
we usually do.  
  
Q. When did you start feeling like, hey, I'm pretty hot tonight? Did
that start early for you? When did you say, hey, tonight could be my night?  
T.J. GIBBS: I don't think it was really that type of feeling. I think it was
more so trusting my teammates. They were doing all the work. I just happened
to hit the easy shots that they were giving me. That's not something that I
can really say.  
  
Q. How much would a Maui Invitational title mean tomorrow?  
T.J. GIBBS: Oh, it would mean a lot. It really would be a momentum push for us
leading into the rest of the season and ACC play, and another two tournaments
that we're looking to win. I think it would mean a lot to us.  
  
Q. Getting more into the defense, why were you so effective? What were
you doing so well?  
MIKE BREY: I think it's the makeup of this group. In our first practices this
summer, this group was better defensively, especially with a Pflueger and a
Gibbs on the floor, with what we have out there. And they, you know, want to
be a defensive unit. I don't have to sell it or put a whip on them to do it.
They talk about defending, so there is an identity. But we do have some quick
hands and we get a lot of deflections, and that gets us some easy buckets in
transition.  
  
Q. You were in the title game here in 2008. What's going to be the
difference tomorrow night?  
MIKE BREY: I told our guys when we practiced in here on Saturday, with what
our program has done and what it's thought of nationally, we should have our
name up on that wall. We've talked about that. And I think Mattie and Bonzie
have really talked about that. We play a heck of a team in Wichita State. I
think it's a great match-up. They're really good. We're excited that we get to
play for a trophy.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Wichita State?  
MIKE BREY: There's a toughness about them. I think, like us, there is a unit
of guys that belong together and expect to win and play with great edge and
intensity. I think you've got two really hard-playing, competing, older groups
that know who they are. I think it's a fabulous match-up early in the season.
And it's the one Dave Odom wanted.

## November 21, 2017

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Dantley Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29903)

### [Braden Koelliker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34359)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan - 102, Chaminade - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Chaminade to the media room. Coach Bovaird,
Dantley Walker, and Braden Koelliker. Coach, an opening statement on tonight's
game.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Obviously, the first half was kind of rough for us. Shooting the
ball 2 for 11 from the three-point line. We count on making threes as a big
portion of our game and coming off screen and rolls, and making the right
reads. When you're not knocking down three-point shots, it's kind of rough.
We've had two games where we've shot the ball well below what I expect us to
shoot.  
  
So I thought in the second half we had a really good stretch there. I think it
was probably about 12 minutes where we played even with them, even though we
were down 20, but it stayed at 20 for a good, I think, 10-, 12-minute stretch.  
  
Hopefully we'll take some things away from that and try to build on that
stretch, the things we did successful. Then the other stretches, we've got a
lot of improvement.  
  
Q. Dantley, how tough is Matthews? He shot 8 for 8 today, and 10
rebounds as well and forced it?  
DANTLEY WALKER: Yeah, he didn't miss a shot. I don't know, you know. He just
got good looks and he was knocking them down and it really killed us.  
  
Q. Dantley or Braden, what is your guys' mentality going into this game
against Cal tomorrow, and just how you guys might be able to bounce back and
look for a win in this tournament?  
BRADEN KOELLIKER: We came out strong yesterday against Notre Dame, and kind of
let off the gas a little bit. Today that followed into today. So tomorrow
we're looking to come out strong and put a full 40 minutes together and show
Cal that we can compete.  
  
Q. Coach, after this year, Chaminade starts attending every other year,
the tournament. What are you telling your players going into the last game of
the tournament for you guys to get that break?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, we won't talk about that. Obviously, overnight of our full
preparation will be trying to figure out a way to beat Cal. I'm sure that
question will come up later after the tournament's over.  
  
But, hey, it is what it is. We do have exciting opportunities next year that
we're looking forward to, going to Arizona, going to San Diego State. I've
never been to those places, but I see them on TV and they have lots of fans
there. So should be interesting along those lines.  
  
But this is a great tournament. For a Division II team to have a chance to
play against these teams, three games on ESPN is something we absolutely
cherish and we love. We'll look forward to doing it every other year.

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Charles Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34355)

### [Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30705)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan - 102, Chaminade - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Michigan to the media room, Coach Beilein, Charles
Matthews, and Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman. Let's start with an opening
statement from Coach.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: After last night's tough loss, the only thing we could focus on
is how do we come out of this trip? How do we have Thanksgiving dinner and
come out of this thing 2-1? There's only going to be one team that comes out
of here 3-0, and obviously it wasn't going to be us. So in order to do it, we
need to take one day at a time.  
  
I really liked it under the circumstances. I wanted to go through my whole
career if I could never playing Chaminade. And today, there it was in front of
us, and we ended up getting the win. And we'll take it. We grew today, just
like we did last night.  
  
Q. Charles, you had a heck of a game. 8-for-8 shooting, 2-for-2 from
three-point range, and you missed a free throw. Ten rebounds. How did it feel
out there today to bounce back for you guys as players?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: I'm just happy we came back and won this game. We lost a
close one yesterday, but (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Could each of you speak to how you thought Eli handled being moved to
the starting lineup?  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: I think he handled it well. He had a good game
yesterday, we thought. It didn't go his way some plays, but we just came out
and bounced back today. We're just happy how he played.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Yeah, I mean, Eli's a great talent, but we have three great
point guards, so they have no choice but to get back tomorrow and compete
against each other each and every day. So any game could be any one of them.
But Eli did a great job handling that.  
  
Q. Coach, I look at this box score, and I see 22 assists on 37 baskets.
Unbelievable shooting. 65 percent from the field. A ton of good stuff. What
pleased you the most today?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think the way we came out, we came out with almost some spite
to us after last night's loss. We watched 25 clips this morning that probably
were pretty painful for us to watch. They know how fragile a win and a loss
could be, how closely it could change. I just like the way we came out and
played really hard, knowing certainly Chaminade's the underdog. But to come
out and play, not take it for granted, go out and play the way we did today.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We met as a staff about it, and we really wanted to make sure we
were all on board and the staff all agreed that this was something we wanted
to look at, just so we get different people. Might make more changes in the
future. I think we have a great flow with him. Now, he didn't shoot the ball
as well. But he really -- the ball moves really well with him right now, and
that's really what we were just trying to get movement so -- we've got enough
guys trying to learn what we're doing. He really picked up our stuff quicker
than others.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you think that Charles Matthews performed today in just
about perfect shooting?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, he's really worked hard. One of the things coming in was
people questioned whether he could shoot the ball. He's worked so hard on it
over the last year. He can get to the rim. He can get to places that's hard to
get to because of his quickness, his length, and his athleticism.  
  
So just really proud of him. But I'm just as proud of the way he came down the
court, and he also ended up with four assists. That's new territory for him to
be passing the ball right now. So I'm just proud of that and the rebounds.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Marquette - 94, VCU - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Marquette to the press room. We have Markus Howard
and Andrew Rowsey. Let's start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. You guys are kind of known for your three-point shooting. But in what
ways specifically were you looking to exploit and have some success on the
perimeter?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: Well, the main thing for us, we knew VCU, they like to pressure
you, and pressure you full court. So for us, handling the pressure and finding
the best shot once we get out. We knew once we broke the press we could get 3
on 2s going, and stuff like that so we could get our open shots, so that was
key.  
  
MARKUS HOWARD: I think just playing off each other's strength. That is a big
point of emphasis that Coach Wojo emphasized to us when we played. So just
playing to our strengths and shooting. We were finding open shots and we were
able to execute that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Markus.  
  
Q. Markus, you had four points in the first half and 18 in the second.
What changed for you in the second?  
MARKUS HOWARD: I think just not really getting discouraged and letting the
game come to me. I mean, I missed a couple shots and I can't really even think
about it. I have to move on to the next play. My coaches really helped me in
that aspect, learning and drawing from that. Just knowing there are a lot of
games to be played, so not really getting caught up on it. Knowing in the
second half it's like a start-over, hit your restart button. So I was looking
at it that way.  
  
Q. Coach Wojo has guys that had a lot of success in this tournament and
playing career and coaching career in the past. What do you say to your guys
about this tournament, this setting and how to be successful here?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: Well, he told me he hasn't lost a game here before, so don't
let it happen this time. But, no, seriously, you know, Coach Wojo is the
ultimate competitor. He brings that to our team. When we come here, we don't
want to let him down. Yeah, I'll say this when he comes in here. But we fight
for one another. We fight for Coach. The way we compete, we want to bring it
every game, so that's what we set out to do.  
  
Q. With the way you guys shoot it, you were able to get some long
rebounds and capitalize on second-chance points. Is that something you worked
on?  
MARKUS HOWARD: Definitely. Great credit to our bigs -- Theo, Sam, Matt, Jamal,
and Sacar, really working hard down there and getting rebounds, and Greg as
well. Just working the offense today, we've been working on that a lot in
practice. It happens a lot down in the post. So that's definitely something
we've been working on, and today we really put it to work, great.  
  
Q. You guys, they were close to you pretty much all game. What was the
key to pulling away from them?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: Well, for us, it was just to remain poised. We know they like
to pressure us for 40 minutes of the game. It was just handling it, and doing
your best shots, finding the open shot, finding the open guy and getting shots
where we needed them. I feel like we executed that as well as we could today
and that let us come out with the win.  
  
Q. Where'd you get the leis?  
ANDREW ROWSEY: I got them at the hotel that we're staying at. I've been
wearing it the whole time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, why don't you start with an opening statement about this
morning's win.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We beat an outstanding basketball team. They put
incredible pressure on you for 40 minutes. I thought early in the game their
full-court press really knocked us back. Obviously, we were able to force some
turnovers. When you give them turnovers, it sets their defense, and that hurt
us.  
  
But, you know, one of the things that happens with a team like that when you
don't turn it over, they can speed you up. I thought we took some really
quick, ill-advised shots in the first half. The second half, I thought we had
much greater poise on the offensive end. I think Markus and Sam's play and the
poise that those two kids showed on the offensive end was huge. I thought we
got a great lift from our bench. Four kids who came off the bench when it was
tied 51-all, gave us some separation with their energy and effort, and just
making plays. That says a lot for those young kids, and I'm proud of them for
that.  
  
One of the silent stories of the game for us was our offensive rebounding. We
won the game because of our offensive rebound, and that's something that we've
tried to emphasize with this group. When we do offensive rebounds, a lot of
times just because we don't have great size inside, it's not necessarily going
to be a putback, but we want to try to get threes when we get offensive
boards, and we were able to do that today.  
  
We beat a hell of a basketball team. A really high-level game this early in
the season, and we have utmost respect for VCU, and Mike obviously will
continue the tradition at a very high level there.  
  
Q. In the first half you had Andrew Rowsey with 15 points and in the
second half it was Markus with 18. What can you say about your back court and
how they were playing off each other?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, both those kids are very dynamic scorers. Obviously
they're recognized for their ability to shoot. But in my mind they're much
more than shooters. At any point they can go on a one-man run. What we need
them to do is understand that sometimes it's better to let the game come to
you. But those kids put a lot of pressure on the defense. We want them to be
attacking. We want them to create offense, obviously for themselves, but
they're going to create a lot of offense for other guys as well. I love my
back court, and they're going to be a big part of the type of success we hope
to have this year.  
  
Q. Coach, in what ways do you think your size and length helped you when
it came to those second-chance points and rebounds?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: You know, we're really not much bigger than VCU. A lot of
rebounding is just a relentless pursuit, and I thought our guys showed great
pursuit on the offensive end of trying to get those second shots. Like I said
earlier, without that part of the game swinging in our favor, we don't win the
game. We have every player on the team for us had an offensive rebound, and
those offensive rebounds produced, I think, over 20 second-chance points.  
  
Q. You guys had some early turnovers early on and 17 total. What do you
have to do to cut down on those?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I mean, credit is due to VCU. That's what they do. They
have great quickness, and they're relentless in their pressure. You know, it's
one thing to practice press versus scout team or your, quote/unquote, second
team. It's a completely different thing to execute versus a team that does it
every day, like VCU. So once we settled in, I thought we did fine after we got
a few of those careless turnovers. We had five turnovers before the first
media time out. So if you look at 12 turnovers for the rest of the 36 minutes,
that's not too bad.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it like for you being back in this gym given the
success you've had here in the past? What did you share with your team about
playing here?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, I have a really special feeling in my heart for
Maui. Obviously this is my fifth time here, one as a player, three as an
assistant coach. This is the first time I'm honored to bring the team here as
a head coach. But even before that, when I was a young kid and this tournament
used to come on TV, I can remember thinking college basketball is finally
back. This was always, for me, the tournament that signified that college
basketball, which was something I loved from a very early age, was back. To be
here and to be a part of it is just a huge honor.  
  
I want our guys to honor that honor with how hard they play, how together they
play and with the way we compete.  
  
Q. Not too look too much into the future, but the next game you play the
winner, possibly Wichita State. They're pretty good on fundamentals. What's it
going to take to beat a team like that?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, again, anything can happen in the tournament. So
we'll evaluate and watch this game. There's a lot of outstanding teams. I can
only speak on Wichita State because our focus was totally on VCU. But Greg has
built an elite level program, I think at this time of the season, because of
their experience, they're as good as any team in the United States. So if it
happens that we are to play them, it will be an incredible test for our young
team. But that's why you come to tournaments like this, to be able to
challenge yourself against the best. They're very experienced, and we have one
senior and nine freshmen and sophomores. So if it does come to pass, then as a
competitor, that's what you want. I mean, that's what you want. So I would
hope that's the mindset our young men.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2017

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Tremont Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34356)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
LSU - 77, Michigan - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome LSU to the media room, Coach Wade and Tremont
Waters. We'll start with Coach and take questions for Tremont.  
  
WILL WADE: Just obviously you could tell by the way we reacted, that was a
huge win for us, huge. I'm so proud of our players. We turned the page on our
program tonight. We got down in the second half. I think they led by 8 or 9.
We got down in the second half. And in the past we'd let that thing swell up
and we'd have lost by 20, but we came back and gritted it out and found a way
to win. So helps having a point guard like him. We did a better job taking
care of the ball in the second half, only turned it over three times. Turned
it over 11 times in the first half.  
  
But I'm just so proud of our players. They've worked extremely hard. They,
more than anybody, deserved for this to happen. They've earned this, and you
could probably tell by the way we reacted how big of a win this is for us.
We're going to pick it up, and get ready to go again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Tremont, can you speak to the same kind of thing that Coach just
talked about? How big is this for you guys as a team? How big is it for your
confidence?  
TREMONT WATERS: I'm going to have to say starting off, thanks to my teammates
and coaches, and Father God, first of all, for letting all this happen. But
overall we work hard in practice. Everything starts in practice. Our
conditioning, our strength and conditioning overall with Coach Goldin, that
sets our tone for our practice and going to practice and working on all our
little things that we need to work on. Like that last defensive play. Skylar
didn't foul him. He put his hands straight up, and that led to a contested
three at the end of the game and pretty much closed it out.  
  
Q. That last sequence there, what was going through your mind as Rahkman
came down, Abdur-Rahkman came down, put that ball in the air and then Wagner
got that rebound? What was going through your mind through all of that?  
TREMONT WATERS: Obviously you don't want the ball to go to the rim. I felt
like Skylar played good enough D that Rahkman wasn't going to hit the shot.
Also, Duop did a great job just shielding at the rim when Wagner got the ball.
So I feel like I just pretty much had faith in my teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, you had that last block, I couldn't really tell. Who had the
last block when Wagner got the rebound right at the end?  
WILL WADE: I think it was 21, Epps.  
  
Q. I kind of thought it was him too.  
WILL WADE: I was so excited. I don't know if I saw it. But our guys did a
great job with the game plan. We didn't want 22, Robinson, to beat us. He only
got off four shots, and that's all we worked on all week was making sure he
didn't beat us and seeing if those other guys could beat us. They almost did.
Wagner played tremendous, and that's why he's an NBA draft prospect. We didn't
really guard Matthews, but we guarded him there at the end when we needed to.
Rachal got a big block on 12, and we guarded him when we needed to. Says a
lot. We had No. 2, a freshman, out there making big, defensive plays at the
end of the game. So I can't even tell you how big this was for us. This was
just tremendous.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you want to enjoy this one, but how big is the
opportunity?  
WILL WADE: I mean, it's a great opportunity for us to play Notre Dame. It's a
great opportunity, and we're going to go back. We're going to rest our guys,
and we're going to get ready to go into battle again tomorrow. But this was
just huge for us, absolutely huge for us.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2017

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Jonathan Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33087)

### [Malik Crowfield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34348)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Marquette - 94, VCU - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead, Coach.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: A great fight. They were tough today, they did a great job of
getting more opportunities that I think it really cost us. Put ourselves in a
tough position, giving really good shooters extra shots over and over again.
Not only did they shoot 36 threes, 36 of them, but making 13, and some of them
were second and third shots, and that really cost us.  
  
We've got to have better carryover, and we've got to do it quick in 24 hours.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Malik, what was going well for you guys in those early minutes that
allowed you guys to take the lead?  
MALIK CROWFIELD: Was being aggressive, and the defense caused a little bit of
turnovers and they started getting hot. We had to call a timeout early, so we
had to keep going after that.  
  
Q. Malik, you had some of your own success shooting the ball from deep.
What was the key to getting open shots there?  
MALIK CROWFIELD: I just had to find the open window, and Jonny was going to
find me. So I just had to find myself an open spot and knock down some threes
for the team.  
  
Q. What adjustments do you feel you need to make for the next game?  
JONATHAN WILLIAMS: I would say locking out the defensive rebounds, you know.
They got a lot of second-chance opportunities. They capitalized off that. It
kind of like broke the spirit, I guess, for lack of a better term. I think if
we do that with [indiscernible].  
  
Q. Jonathan, you had three rebounds midway through that first half. You
kind of rebounded from that in the second half?  
JONATHAN WILLIAMS: I still wanted to stay aggressive, but I also had to stay
smart. It was definitely my fault on all three fouls. I made stupid mistakes,
so I apologize to the team for that. That was my fault.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Making those second-chance points Marquette had, what was the biggest
thing to getting those offensive rebounds?  
MIKE RHOADES: Long shots, long rebounds. You have to hold yours to block out.
You can't just think your teammate's going to get them. You have to go get
them. You have to do your job. You have a saying, if you can't get the
rebound, the guy you're boxing out can sure get it. And that didn't happen.
You look at the 15 offensive rebounds, and of course, Hauser had a bunch,
their big guy, No. 12, did, but everybody else on their team had one. So that
means the ball's flying around. So couple times we're just leaking out, a
couple times we were just standing there thinking our teammate's going to get
them, we've got to go eat, we've got to get that ball. A couple times we just
sort of cut our own throats, so we were in a position to make it a one-
possession game. We were pretty close getting one three, and the offensive
rebound, and they hit a third one. You just can't do that.  
  
We did a really good job of rebounding against UVA on Friday. It was an
impetus, long shots, long rebounds, and we've got to have better carryover.  
  
Q. What have you learned about your team in the first game of this
tournament and the early-season games so far?  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, we have a lot of fight. You guys see, we have a lot of
fight, and we can score the ball. We're leaving a lot of points here since we
got together. But we've got to guard. I think for the guys that want to go
play and ball out, as I like to say, but you've got to get tough on the
defensive end. If you want to beat teams like Marquette, you have to get stops
and consecutive stops.  
  
I love the fight of my team. I love how much they love playing with each
other, they care about each other, they celebrate each other's successes. Now
it starts with me. We've just got to get better and better on the defensive
end. If we could have some carry over on the defensive end, we're going to be
a good team. But you get exposed in tournaments like this and games like this,
the deal gets soft against teams that are well-coached and teams that are
offensive rebounding.  
  
Q. What went so well against Howard in the first half? What were you
guys doing and then kind of what happened in the second half that he got
free?  
MIKE RHOADES: He just got loose in the second half. I thought a couple times
in the first half, we were there on the catch. We put it down. I thought we
helped a little better on the first half, especially on the end. In the second
half we let them get loose a little bit. We let them catch it. He's so quick
and so low to the ground, he can guard by you or if you give him a little bit
of space, he can put that three in your eye, and he did that.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think is the key to starting out with that burner
defense? What do you think are the biggest things?  
MIKE RHOADES: Carryover. I told the guys there is nobody I'd rather coach than
these guys. They're coachable, they're so into it, but we don't have
consistent carryover from practice to practice and practice to games. If we
would have played defense like we did the other day against UVA, it would have
been different. But we didn't. And that's what we needed. It comes with an
experienced team. It comes with a team that you're searching and fighting late
in the game. But we've got to have better carryover, without a doubt. So we've
got to have carryover.  
  
Q. What progress are you seeing in the practice? You kind of caused some
trouble early in the game. And of course, 24 points off turnovers.  
MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, we pressed I thought better today than we did against UVA.
We prepped. We wanted to prep today. I thought it really helped us in the
second half even though we didn't get turnovers. They missed a lot of early
threes. They missed some tough twos. That is the wear and tear of the press,
and you can wear them down. But we did get rebounds out of it. Three or four
times they took a tough three at the end of the prep. It's almost like a
turnover. You go collect the rebound, and we didn't do that. I thought our
bench was really good today with great energy. Some guys are going to get more
minutes because of the way they came off the bench today, and we need that
playing our style of play.

## November 20, 2017

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Shaq Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34350)

### [Landry Shamat](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34351)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wichita State - 92, Cal - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, give us your thoughts on today's game.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, obviously, I was disappointed in the way we played in
the first half. Give Cal credit. Their zone was interesting and made it hard
for us. We kind of looked like the Bad News Bears for the most part. But,
things that made this program pretty good over the years has been our grit and
determination, and we certainly showed that in the second half. But we've got
to play better. Give Cal credit for the first 20 minutes, and then it looked
more like my team in the second 20 minutes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, Landry Shamat and Shaq Morris.  
  
Q. Landry and Shaq, can you talk about what you tried to do to slow down
Coleman after his big first half?  
LANDRY SHAMAT: Man, he's a good scorer, he's a good player. He's really
aggressive getting downhill, and we knew that he was going to do whatever it
took to try to get to the rim. Had some problems with him and we made a few
tweaks here and there and tried to deny him the ball at certain times. I don't
think we did the best of job at that. But we nevertheless tried to implement
some of those schemes and stuff. But hat's off to him, he's a good player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Landry. Shaq, anything to add to that?  
  
SHAQ MORRIS: No, what he said.  
  
Q. Describe the last 16 minutes of this game where you guys switched to
that full court press. How crazy was that to end the game?  
SHAQ MORRIS: We got back to us. We take pride on defense, and in the first
half tonight that wasn't us. We didn't recognize ourselves. But we rallied up
at halftime, and just had to, you know, come back and do what we do, play
sharper basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Shaq.  
  
Q. Shaq, can you talk about the two resounding followed dunks? Do you
feel like that kind of thing kind of gets your teammates going a little bit?  
SHAQ MORRIS: Of course. At that point when we were down we could take any
momentum that we could get, but Coach Marshall in the huddle wanted us to the
glass every time because we needed possessions to get us back in the game. So,
you know, just being fresh and attacking the glass is a huge key for the
night.  
  
Q. Landry, what kind of changed there for you guys? At what point did it
seem like, okay, we have some momentum, we're back in this?  
LANDRY SHAMAT: Well, I don't know if there was -- I mean, I think when we got
into the press and started speeding them up a little bit. Obviously our energy
kind of just changed, and that's something we can't have happen. We've got to
keep that energy from the jump. That's kind of the same thing Coach is talking
about in the locker room at the end of the game. But just that press.
Obviously, you're flying around. It's easy to get energy going. So I'd say
just when we started doing that.  
  
Q. Landry, I guess it was obvious they weren't going to slow down. Did
you have that in your mind there were going to be plenty of possessions and
plenty of opportunities to keep coming back?  
LANDRY SHAMAT: Yeah, I mean, in film we knew that they kind of liked to play
fast and get out and run. They are a younger team than we are, and we try to
just utilize that to the best of our ability there down the stretch.  
  
Q. Shaq, can you describe the momentum swing? I think you're the one
that gave the team the first lead in the opening minutes, and then you guys
get a turnover, and add to it. You guys go down 18 of 8. What was that
momentum wave like for you guys?  
SHAQ MORRIS: The momentum started with Rashard Kelly on defense. We hopped
into the press and started to get stops and doing everything, deflections, and
getting them sped up is what we wanted to do. I wouldn't say that momentum
started with me. I was just executing Coach Marshall's program, and he was
making plays for me to get the ball inside. We had an advantage. We fouled out
their two big men, and we executed down the stretch offensively when we needed
to, and defense did its part.  
  
Q. Obviously, you guys are in the winner's bracket, but an early call
tomorrow. Any challenge for you guys as players for that?  
SHAQ MORRIS: No, I'm still waking up at like 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. just from
traveling over here. So I'm on Kansas time. I feel like this game is like at
5:00 in the evening game. So I feel fine. I don't think it should be an issue.  
  
Q. Landry, you look at the stats in the second half, and you guys shoot
42 percent, only make one three. How crazy is that to look at those stats? How
would you explain how you guys were able to erase an 18-point lead?  
LANDRY SHAMAT: It wasn't us shooting, it was them shooting, I think, what was
it, like 70 percent from three and 55 from the two. So that's just us not
guarding, and we knew that. I mean, offense comes and goes, and you can't have
that be what you hang your hat on, and we just try to get back to defense is
all it was.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Landry. We'll open up the floor for questions for
Coach.  
  
Q. When you have four guys coming off the bench and going for 20, how
can you sustain that pressure that you used in that second half?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, yeah, I was looking for bodies at one point. And Landry,
we had to manage his foul trouble. But I thought the key to me was the play of
Rashard Kelly and Rauno Nurger, they weren't up here. Obviously, those guys
scored a lot of points. But I thought they gave us tremendous energy,
offensive rebounding, stick-backs.  
  
We shot the ball very poorly the whole game. And we're normally a very good
shooting team. I can't really explain it other than it was somewhat like an
outer-body experience in the first half. They would shoot the ball, and we
didn't play great defense now. I don't want to say that. We did not play great
defense. But they would hit the rim, and it would be bouncing out. Then all of
a sudden, it would suck back in, just the basket would suck it in. And on the
other end we had wide-open shots for really good shooters and then come close.  
  
At the half, we had 11 baskets or 12 baskets and 11 turnovers. We turned that
around with 18 baskets and two turnovers in the second half. More efficient.
We got great offensive rebounding. 24 offensive rebounds and finally looked
like a basketball team that we were expecting.  
  
But, again, it's my fault. This is obviously the best team that we've played.
I think Charleston's going to be really good but they were without one of
their better players. This is the best team we've played. I needed something
to get us ready for this, and I didn't do a very good job of scheduling early.  
  
Now that we've seen a taste of what big-boy basketball is like, we'll see what
we can do against Marquette tomorrow.  
  
Q. For you, how tough is that 8:30 a.m. local time call tomorrow
morning?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, I don't care. You want to play in three hours? I don't
care. It doesn't affect me. I've taken enough aspirin during these last two
hours that I'm pretty good, I'm pain free, I'm ready to go. So whenever you
want to tip it up, I'm good.  
  
Q. Your intensity stayed up strong through the rest of the game. Last
five minutes it look like they got worn out. You really ran them to death. But
the two guards were on their knees most of the last five, six minutes. That's
got to be a tribute to the bench play?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, we got good -- again, to me, Kelly and Rauno Nurger, I
thought Austin Reaves played well, other than not shooting it well. He and
Conner Frankamp, you don't want to play those guys in a horse game, but today
they couldn't buy one.  
  
Samajae coming off the bench really played well too. So it was our depth. And
we are deep, but we needed that depth, and we needed that depth. Brown's
exhausted. He played 32 minutes and 1 for 7. But his defense, and then he got
four steals and he just competed. That's what we've been about. We kind of
lost sight of that. And we can't do that. We're not that talented, we're not
that well-coached. We've got to have our identity of being gritty, tough, and
defensive minded like in the second half more than the first.  
  
Q. Marquette put up 94 points against their opponent. They're going to
be tough tomorrow. How are you going to keep that intensity going tomorrow
against them?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, it should be a great game. I know they're going to play
hard. They've got some really good sharpshooters. I watched most of the first
half before we came over and watched some of the second half. Whoever wins has
a chance to play for a championship. So I'm anticipating a really good game.  
  
Q. If you could describe how tough it is to pull off and pretty much
outscore a team by 28 and only doing it with one three-pointer in the second
half?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, we didn't shoot the ball well. I kept thinking and I'm
encouraging Conner and the next one's going to go in, and I really believe
that. But it didn't. You couldn't get one to fall. I thought he was going to
make a big one that was going to give us the lead or give us a five-point lead
or seven-point lead and really put us over the top, but it just never fell for
him. I still want him shooting the ball. I'm going to ride with Conner
Frankamp's jumper, Landry Shamat's jumper, Austin Reaves' jumper, Shaq Morris,
Rauno Nurger, Darral Willis, they all shoot the ball very well in practice.
I've been doing this for 33 years, and this is a very good shooting team. But
we couldn't make a three-pointer tonight. 6 for 25, not very good. And Landry
had four of those. Not much time to work on mechanics. You can go to church
tomorrow or whatever before the game, but you've just got to go with the guys
you've got, and hopefully they can make the shots.  
  
Q. Did you guys do anything specific at halftime adjusting to Coleman
and the first half that he had?  
GREGG MARSHALL: We tried to limit his touches a little bit. We didn't do a
great job of that. I knew he had a great half. I didn't realize he had 26 at
the half. But he's a tremendous scorer.  
  
The thing that we did was extend the pressure. We just needed -- the way the
game was going and the way we were playing, we just needed it to be as long a
second half as possible. We needed to get as many possessions as possible.
That's why we amped up the pressure even after made baskets.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2017

  

### [Wyking Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34213)

### [Don Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34352)

### [Justice Sueing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34349)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wichita State - 92, Cal - 82  
  
WYKING JONES: Well, our guys, they left it all out on the court today. They
fought. They played with a lot of heart and toughness. Ultimately experience
won out today. But the guys definitely gave us everything they had. At the end
of the day, what I've been preaching the whole time is that hopefully we get
better game in and game out. So I felt like we got better today.  
  
Q. Justice, did you grow up watching the Maui Invitational, and how do
you feel about playing in this tournament, being back home in Hawaii?  
JUSTICE SUEING: Yes, I did. I used to sit on the couch with my pops, and he'd
go over how I would want to get on that stage at some point in my career.
Being here with Cal, I think we took a big step in moving forward and showing
the world and all the teams what we're capable of doing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how hot you felt in the first half, and could you
tell that they made adjustments at halftime to change things up on you?  
DON COLEMAN: Yeah, well, I felt kind of hot. I felt like I was going to have a
good game. Once I hit a couple threes in a row, I knew I had my rhythm going.
In the second half, they made a couple adjustments, but we decided to get the
ball to Marcus and King more. It wasn't just me trying to come off the screen
and score, it was more playing through the bigs. I really think that's what it
was.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about Justice and how much he kind of
helps you guys get 20 today? And he's back home, man, this is his place.  
DON COLEMAN: Oh, yeah, Justice was big for us. After he got that and one, I
thought we had the game. I thought we had the game after that and one three,
that was a big shot. But he plays good. We're going to need that in every
game.  
  
Q. [Indiscernible]?  
DON COLEMAN: Oh, yeah, of course. We've got a lot of young guys, so they look
up to me on and off the court. I just try to set the right example.  
  
Q. Second half your three-point shooting percentage dropped in half. Was
that due to the press, tiredness, better defense by Wichita State? What
happened?  
DON COLEMAN: Yeah, I think we were kind of tired. They picked it up on us.
They got a really good press. I was surprised. I'm not going to lie. But I
would say fatigue. Yeah, fatigue.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. [Indiscernible]?  
WYKING JONES: Grant earned a lot of my trust today. Marcus and King getting
into foul trouble against such a veteran front line at Wichita State. He
competed. He competed. Did he win the battle, no? He didn't win the battle.
Shaq Morris won the battle. But he earned some stripes today, and for a
freshman, that's what it's all about. Just coming in and earning some stripes
and getting a chance to play against a guy like that, hopefully learning and
gaining some confidence for tomorrow and the day after.  
  
Q. How encouraging was the first half? For a young team, a new head
coach, how encouraging is that as you guys go forward?  
WYKING JONES: Very encouraging. For me, like I said, it's just about us
getting better game in and game out. So to see them compete, it was a big
stage against a very good team, that's all I could ask of them. So it's very
encouraging moving forward. Hopefully we continue to get better.  
  
Q. When it came to that pressure that Wichita put out there, how much of
that were you able to game plan for, and how much are you just trying to draw
up as you go along?  
WYKING JONES: Well, it was more draw up, but I'm going to watch the film. I
told my film guy, Mitch, I said, Put together an edit of all of their presses
and the times that we turned it over. I don't know if it was fatigue, but it
just seemed like no one was coming to the ball. So as many times as I drew it
up, no one was really coming to the ball. They were more or less just kind of
had us on our heels. That was the difference in the game as well as giving up
24 offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. How difficult is it for those guys that when you do break it, you're
almost tempted to go attack it?  
WYKING JONES: Well, you know, it's a fine line. You want to be aggressive
because at that point you have a numbered break. It's two against one at that
point. So it just takes some savvy. When to look to score, when to pull it
out. I think a couple times in the second half we would have been better
served to pull it out because we had the comfortable lead. We stayed
aggressive, and I can't fault our guys for being aggressive. But moving
forward, we can learn from that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to what Justice has provided for your team
through these first two games of the season, and the trust he's earned from
you?  
WYKING JONES: So far, Justice has been a nice surprise. I don't know if you
guys know it or not, but he was out for six weeks with a stress fracture. It's
almost like he was out for so long. You're talking about a month and a half.
He was out for so long my staff and I kind of forgot what he really did for us
or what he provided for us. So we're all kind of seeing it like you all are
seeing it, what he was able to bring to the table, night in and night out. He
plays with a lot of poise and lot of confidence. I could play him at the four,
could play at the three. He's very versatile. Very versatile. He could post up
a little bit, so he's doing a great job for us.  
  
Q. What are your early impressions of VCU, and what do you expect in
that game tomorrow?  
WYKING JONES: I'm going to be honest with you, I have not watched VCU until I
got here to the arena because I focus on who we have to play. I put 100% into
who we have to play. I don't look past any opponent. I'll start to watch film
on VCU as soon as I leave here and get back to the hotel and get briefed on
what it is that makes them tick when I get back to the hotel and meet with my
staff. But just watching them, they play similar to how we play as far as
picking up full court. But just the nuances of them, I don't know just yet.  
  
Q. [Indiscernible]?  
WYKING JONES: It makes me feel encouraged, very encouraged that moving forward
hopefully these guys get better and better and we can rely on them more and
more. Ultimately that the future is bright.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 83, Chaminade - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Notre Dame to the media room.  
  
MIKE BREY: I'm thrilled with our start. I thought our defense was excellent.
This team has wanted to have a defensive identity, and tonight we moved our
feet and defended well. We've talked about trying to defend and get to the
championship game. I think early in the season your offense can look up and
down, left and right a little bit, but can we rely on our defense? I was
pleased with our start against I think a very good team in Chaminade. They're
going to be very good in their league. They've got great size.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about how it was shooting out there the first
couple games today, the shooting percentages were not great, but you guys
shoot 54%?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, we wanted to come out and shoot with confidence. In
shootarounds, we concentrated on our shots and getting into a good rhythm.
When we're in good rhythm, we're getting stops defensively. We feel like we
can move with rhythm defensively. It's great to get stops and kills and shoot
with confidence.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we have a lot of confidence in each other. We tell guys if
you've got an open shot, you take it. Knock it down. If you miss it, you run
back on the next play and get a stop. So we enjoy playing with each other. We
have fun playing with each other. We did shoot it well tonight, so hopefully
we can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how aware were you guys that this was kind of a big team
size-wise, and how did you attack that?  
BONZIE COLSON: Stick with our principles defensively, make sure we grind and
talk on the defensive end. And make sure when we talk on that end and continue
to trust each other defensively, it gets us rolling offensively. But continue
to play, and stay in character on both sides of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was it to not let those guys have hope and stay
on top of them and not let them build up maybe that hope and that momentum?  
MIKE BREY: Well, there's no question that's when they've had their upsets and
they got off to a great start. Thank God we were shooting it well too. Both
teams were really scoring early. We absorb that running three at halftime,
then a deep three to start the second half. I'm starting to think this could
be an interesting night. But, again, I thought we settled in and really
defended.  
  
Matty and Bonzie set the tone for us. They're our veteran guys. While some
other guys were a little excited in this atmosphere and it was kind of new to
them, I thought those two guys really settled. I was very impressed with D.J.
Harvey. He continues to give us great stuff off the bench, and only getting
more confident.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 20, 2017

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Austin Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34353)

### [Erik Scheive](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34354)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Notre Dame - 83, Chaminade - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Chaminade to the media room.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: I thought we -- through stretches of the game, I thought we
played really well. Then we had, of course, some bad stretches. Transition
defense was not very good tonight. They got a lot of run outs for easy baskets
that really hurt us. But overall, we competed through stretches. There were a
few three or four shots that if they went down I think we could have made a
run, at least, and made it an interesting game through very important
stretches, and we ended up missing them. Lot of times they got run outs for
good baskets. But they're a very good team, and I think there's a reason why
they're top 10 in the country.  
  
Q. Austin, can you talk about what was going through your mind when you
made that early three in the second half to pull within six?  
AUSTIN POPE: Oh, man, I had a couple bunnies that missed out in the first half
that I usually make. I just wanted to get us going. We needed to stay on them.
We had a good first 20 minutes, and I felt like we needed to jump on them
early.  
  
Q. Follow-up with Erik, what was the hope like at that point? You're
down 6 with 19 and a half minutes to go?  
ERIK SCHEIVE: Like any basketball player, you want to just keep it going. I
felt like our guys were going and we had a good momentum. We had a couple,
like Coach said, some shots that didn't fall for us that we usually make. But
we'll go back, look at the film and we'll get back into it.  
  
Q. Austin or Erik, what was it like going into the locker room at
halftime after Brett, I think, hit that one-footed three to give you guys
something going in?  
AUSTIN POPE: We could both say something about that. First, I'll say, it was a
great shot. He's an energy guy. I think Coach said it in one of his newspaper
things that he just wants to win. So he makes winning plays, so that was
great.  
  
ERIK SCHEIVE: At that time it's still a closer game. We were definitely
competing at that point within the game. Had a chance to make a run and take
the lead. When you have a shot like that that goes in before the half, like he
said, it's a huge energy play. Boosted all of us and got us more hyped to come
out in the in the second half.  
  
Q. What was it like trying to contain Farrell and Colson knowing what
kind of players they were maybe coming in?  
ERIK SCHEIVE: I mean, we prepared for them all week. There is a reason they're
on all the preseason lists and everything like that. We just tried to make it
as tough as possible. I think in the atmosphere sometimes our concepts, we
forgot it. But tip your hat to them, they're good players. They're really
good.  
  
Q. Coach, you have experience with this. How do you bounce back? You
guys are a good team. Maybe the final score doesn't reflect it tonight. But
how do you guys do that bounce-back thing for tomorrow?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: We just talked about it in the locker room. You have less than
24 hours to prepare. I don't know a lot about Michigan and LSU. I do know
Michigan because John Beilein back when he was at West Virginia and I was at
West Virginia and I worked his basketball camp. So I know his system pretty
well. But if we happen to play LSU, I don't know anything about them. But
we're going to know in the next 24 hours. So they're going to have to
understand different contests. We've been preparing for Notre Dame for a week.
Everybody knows what they're going to do. They're going to send No. 5 and No.
35 at you, and you've got to stop them. But they're going to bounce back.
They're going to be ready. I'm glad that we don't play the early morning game.
So I thank KemperLesnik for not putting us back at 9:30 in the morning after a
loss like that. So at least we have the 3 o'clock game where we'll have time
to prepare and talk about it.  
  
Q. I think in the coaches press conference on Sunday you talked about
maybe having to play your best game here on Maui to hang with these guys or
beat these guys. So as the early moments of the game played out and you guys
were in it at that first media timeout, are you thinking, maybe we are playing
perhaps our best game?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, you think that at the time period. Momentum's going,
you're knocking down threes and everything's going the way you had game
planned for. All of a sudden, you get some things go wrong. All the good teams
that I've played against, whether it's North Carolina or Kansas, these teams
have the ability to expose weaknesses. When they pick up on a weakness, they
jump on it. One of them was ball screen coverage tonight for us. No. 5 coming,
flying off a ball screen and making plays. We knew it was coming, but it's
tough to simulate in practice when you don't have anybody as fast and as quick
and as good at making reads as him. I think I answered your question.

### [Charles Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34355)

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
LSU - 77, Michigan - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Michigan to the media room. Coach Beilein, Charles
Matthews, and Moritz Wagner. We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Really great basketball game. Anybody who was watching it on TV
or at the arena saw that it was a great game by everybody. Really proud of the
way our guys fought back. We couldn't get some things done on offense and
defense most of the game, and then played really well. Last four or five
minutes, I think we really played well, except in the last minute really we
got done what we needed to get done. Tremont Waters just made some incredible
plays, and their bigs shot it in. We really wanted to limit their three game,
how many threes that they made. I think they had four at that point, and then
they had three in a row, and an old-fashioned three-point play. So the
12-point swing, we couldn't get the other side of.  
  
Q. Moritz, can you tell me, when you got that rebound at the last second
there, did you think you had a chance to get that in?  
MORITZ WAGNER: I didn't know, honestly, I was just trying my best. You never
know how much time is on the clock. Yeah, maybe it could have been.  
  
Q. Charles, how tough was No. 4 for them?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: He's a great player, great team. Felt like we had great
defensive execution, so I give credit to them, but I feel like we did a good
job.  
  
Q. Can you guys both talk about, can you learn from a game like this?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: For sure, I think the errors we made are definitely
correctable, and I think we're going to learn growing forward.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: A game like this, you learn from every single mistake you had
in that game. So all of us are going to think about it, and we're going to see
it on film, for sure, and we're going to learn from it.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
DAVE ODOM: Good morning. My name is Dave Odom, and I am the chairman of the
Maui Jim Maui Invitational. We welcome everyone here to what really is the
beginning of our big week with great basketball, lot of great universities are
here, and we're just excited about the event. We always are. Amazing things
will happen in the next three days, I can tell you that. Nobody can script
that. We can script today, but we can't script the games, that's for sure.  
  
It is time now and a big honor for me to introduce to you our moderator of the
morning. I call him the hardest working and most well-traveled sportscaster in
the business. I mean, he comes to us all the way from Toronto, Canada. I give
you Dan Shulman.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thank you, Coach. Very, very, especially being from Canada, very
excited to be here in 80 degree weather or 27 celsius if there happen to be
any other Canadians here today. Very excited to be back at the Maui Jim Maui
Invitational. Somewhere out there, Jay Bilas, my broadcast partner is here.
And he's excited to be here as well, and hoping to be back here for many
years. Before we hear from the coaches, we just want to introduce someone new
to the tournament family this year. Dr. Lynn Babington is here this year, the
new President of Chaminade University, who took over on August 1st.  
  
Coach Beilein, she received her undergrad degree from the University of
Michigan. So there you go, her loyalties may be a little bit divided this
week.  
  
These eight programs have combined for over 200 NCAA tournament appearances,
and every coach who is up here today has been to a Final Four as either a head
coach or an assistant coach. We've got a team that's ranked in the top 10
right out of the chute this year. We've got a couple of All-Americans we're
going to see in this tournament. Three programs have been to the Final Four in
the last seven years, and as is always the case, we're going to see great
basketball over the next three days.  
  
We want you to hear briefly from each coach. So we'll start from my far right,
Wyking Jones is in his first year as head coach at the University of
California, was an assistant there for a couple of years. Coach Jones, if you
could tell us a little bit about the Bears going in?  
  
WYKING JONES: First of all, very excited to be part of such a prestigious
tournament. Every year you watch the Maui Invitational and it's the premier
tournament this time of year. So we're very excited to be here.  
  
My team, I feel like we've gotten better each game that we've played. We know
we're going to get tested this week, and at the end of the day hopefully we
get better. That's the main thing for us.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And you're one of a number of coaches up here who likes to play
fast. Tell us about the style of play you bring to your program?  
  
WYKING JONES: We pick up 94 feet. We like to use our defense to help us with
our offense. High-pressure basketball, and we like to push it in transition as
well.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Big picture heading into the Pac-12 this year. What do you think
about the league, and what are your expectations?  
  
WYKING JONES: Got some really talented teams in the league. Arizona is one of
the premier teams in the country, as well as USC and UCLA, I think they're all
ranked in the top 25. So this tournament is a great test for us leading into
conference play. So hopefully we can benefit from being challenged here this
week.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck this week.  
  
Coach Bovaird, well known to everybody here. The head coach of the Chaminade
Silverswords and a mainstay in this tournament, and, again, from what we
understand, the odds-on-favorite in the free throw contest that we're going to
see in a little bit. We asked you the same question last year, but it bears
repeating. What does this tournament mean to your program and what do you get
out of this?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: It means so much. From the recruiting aspect to everything for
Chaminade University, it's something that we cherish and look forward to every
year. It puts Chaminade on the map in the basketball world, and our guys are
so anxious and ready to see how they match up against this great competition.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And Chaminade has won a number of games over the years. Was Texas
the last win?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Texas was the last win.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: 2012 if I'm not mistaken. So you have a tough challenge on day
one with Coach Brey and the Irish. What kind of challenge does that present to
you guys?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: An incredible challenge. We've played Kansas, North Carolina the
past couple years, and I've watched their three games that they've played
recently. I put them in that category. They look like an incredible team, it's
going to be a challenge for us. Looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach Wade of LSU, I guess when he decided to take the job at
LSU, he wanted to make sure he went to a place that was coming out to Maui
because he was at VCU so he was going to wind up in Maui one way or another.
What are you expecting out of your team over the next three days?  
  
WILL WADE: Yeah, I was bound and determined to get here one way or another,
but we'll see. We're a major work in progress. We've made some progress in the
preseason. Offensively, I think I know what we've got, but we're a major work
in progress with our defense. We're a team that's coming together and
hopefully this week will help us continue to gel and get better.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: When you look at the possibility of playing three top-notch games
in three days, what do your players get out of this tournament this early in
the season?  
  
WILL WADE: It will be good for us to see where we stand and give us about six
weeks before we get into SEC play to see where we stand and what we need to
correct and get better on, and where we need to move forward. So we're anxious
about the opportunity, and looking forward to getting it kicked off tomorrow.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: I think a lot of people are looking at the SEC as a league that's
going to be very strong, very deep this year. I don't want to give you any
more anxiety than you may already have.  
  
WILL WADE: Thanks, anything else (laughing)?  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us what the SEC looks like?  
  
WILL WADE: The SEC, we've got three or four teams in the top 25 right now,
couple teams in the top 10. It's going to be a bear of a league. It will be
our first time through it, but we're certainly looking forward to the
opportunity, and looking forward to the challenge. I think this week will
really prepare us as we get ready for SEC play.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Best of luck this week.  
  
Coach Wojciechowski was here with Duke as a player and an assistant, I
believe. And was the most valuable or most outstanding player here with the
Maui Invitational in 1997. What do you remember about that?  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It was a great, great memory. That was my first time here
out to Maui. Then, like now, there was an outstanding field. We were fortunate
enough to beat defending National Champions Arizona in the championship game.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Is this your normal voice, or is this the time in the season for
the hoarse voice?  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: This is our first day of practice to last game of the
year voice.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us about your program. We know you guys love to shoot the
three. You can put the ball in the basket. Tell us a little bit about the
Golden Eagles?  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We have a young team. Nine of our players are freshman
and sophomores. We have one senior in Andrew Rowsey who really is our team
leader. We're a team that's capable of being a very good shooting team. But
still very much trying to find our identity as a whole. Certainly this
tournament, with the quality of competition, will be a springboard for us,
hopefully for growth and improvement.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: I think one of the great things that this sport offers that maybe
not all sports do, you see different styles of play with everybody you play.
Not giving away any secrets here from Coach Rhoades, you're going to see some
pressure tomorrow. Tell us a little bit about facing a team that plays the way
VCU does?  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: They play extremely hard and they put a great deal of
pressure on you because of their activity and intensity. Obviously, anytime
you play a team like VCU who presses and turns defense into offense, you
really have to take care of the ball. But oftentimes, that's a lot easier said
than done.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach Beilein, of the Michigan Wolverines, I was in town a couple
weeks ago, and you were nice enough to let me come watch practice. And I know
you've got some talented players coming back from last year. Tell us about the
outlook for you guys this season?  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we're in a transition right now where we lost so much
from last year, but we have some good young players. But now they're going to
get these great opportunities to do it on the big stage, and there is no stage
bigger, really, except maybe the NCAA tournament and this tip off tournament.
So we'll see what they do when the lights come on, and if they can't get it
done right, we will, eventually do it. But this is a great test further.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: One of the things I saw at your practice, and I don't know why
you did this, I don't know if the players did something right, but you dropped
down and gave 20 push-ups. Your push-up game was pretty strong.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: We always make them do push-ups or run sprints if they do
something that is not winning basketball. But if they do something that's
really good, all right, then let the coach do some push-ups. That means
they're -- I'm just rewarding them. They love to see the coaches in some pain.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Well, you did very well. I think you have one of the most
interesting players around in Mo Wagner, a guy who flirted with the idea of
going to the NBA. Tell us about him?  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, Mo is one of the finest young men I've ever coached ever,
and that's in 40 years. He's just a great personality on our team. He wants to
win. He loves basketball. Very young still, a 20-year-old junior. But he
really has such a huge upside, and pleasure to see every single day whether
it's on the court or offer the court.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: It should be a great first round match-up as Michigan has LSU in
the first round game.  
  
Coach Brey of Notre Dame has kind of turned Tobacco Road a little upside down
the last few years. Won an ACC tournament championship, into the Elite Eight
two of the last three years. You've lost some good players, but you've got a
lot of talent and experience coming back. Tell us about your team?  
  
MIKE BREY: We do. We have some older guys, and I think when you start with
Matt Farrell and Bonzie Colson, two seniors that have won a lot together, it's
a great place to start. We're working in some new faces like T.J. Gibbs and
Rex Pflueger, but I'm happy with their progress so far.  
  
Fully aware of the challenge we have with Chaminade. We know how great they've
played and the job that Eric has done. I guess that's the Catholic
Championship of the State of Hawaii right off the bat. But we're very aware it
could be a road atmosphere for us in there tomorrow.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Is there anybody you've ever coached who reminds you of Bonzie
Colson? He's such an unusual player.  
  
MIKE BREY: He's such a unique guy. No, Dan. I don't know what position he is,
he's 6'5", the wing span 7'2", he doesn't have a neck. He doesn't have calves,
but he just gets it done. He's a beautiful basketball player to watch, and
when the lights are brightest, he's played his best.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Can you talk a little bit about how this will prepare you for ACC
play later?  
  
MIKE BREY: There is no question our league, the ACC, now has become like that
Big East we left not that long ago with amazing depth. But when you play in
this event, everyone watches this event next week. Even coaches that aren't in
the Maui Invitational, that's the one I'm always watching when I'm not in it.
So it's a great stage, and hopefully we can get tougher and figure ourselves
out a little more before we head into ACC play.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Best of luck this week. Coach Rhoades has taken over for the
first year as head coach at VCU. He was an assistant there before. Including
the Final Four run under Shaka Smart, went to Rice, has now come back as an
assistant. Before we talk about this week, what does it mean to you to take
over the program that you were at before as an assistant?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Great honor, dream come true. That area has been home for me and
my family for a long time. So now to go back there as the head coach of VCU is
a special thing.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: The style of play, will we see a similar style to what we've been
used to seeing in recent years?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Absolutely. We're going to try to play fast and aggressive, and
it's a fun way to play. Everybody at VCU loves that, and we're going to
continue to try to push that forward.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us a little bit about your match-up with Marquette and what
you're going to see this week?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: We've got our hands full for sure. Steve has done a super job
with that team. They have some great guards that can make plays and guys that
can really shoot it. We've got to make sure we defend them at a higher level
than we've been, but we're excited for the opportunity, for sure.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We wish you the best of luck. Thank you for the time.  
  
Last but certainly not least, Coach Gregg Marshall from Wichita State, a
consensus top 10 team. Heading into the season, a consensus All-American in
Landry Shamet, they're missing one of their key players in Markis McDuffie,
but they bring back every other player who was really in the rotation last
year.  
  
Coach Marshall, can you tell us a little about your club?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, we have six seniors, so we have a lot of depth, talent,
experience, they're mature players. They've been through the fire. We've been
a little banged up, as you mentioned, Dan. But Landry Shamet is back, though
probably not 100%, and it will be a while for Markis. But we expect the guys
that are healthy to be ready to go. This is a great opportunity for us against
a wonderful field.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You're moving to a new conference this year, too, the American
Conference. How does that change things for you?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: It's very rare you get a better job, and you don't have to
change the zip code. We're excited about joining the American Conference.
There are a lot of wonderful teams, programs, players and coaches, Final
Fours, National Championship programs, so we think that that's going to add to
our opportunity for quality games and hopefully some quality wins come
tournament time.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: People are, because of everything you bring back, people are
talking about your team in the same breath as the traditional powers, the blue
bloods. From your players, how high are the expectations about what you guys
may be able to accomplish this year?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: You know, we really don't talk about it. I just try to take a
day at a time and improve some way individually or collectively in each
practice. They obviously hear it in social media today. So they know there are
some very lofty expectations. But we just have to take it one day at a time.
Right now we're concerned about Cal.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, thank you. Best of luck this week.  
  
We want to thank all the coaches for coming out this morning and wish them the
best of luck in what should be a great tournament. We will see. On behalf of
Jay and everybody else who is lucky enough to be here for ESPN, we want to
thank everybody for bringing us out here again to Maui, and we look forward to
a few great days of basketball. Now back over to Coach Odom.  
  
COACH ODOM: Thanks, Dan, and thanks coaches. That was a great job. Big hand
for them. Dan mentioned his travel partner Jay Bilas.  
  
Jay, just step out and stick your hand up here.  
  
Between Jay and Dan, they are the face of Maui Jim Maui Invitational out here.
Give Dan and Jay together a big hand.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
DAVE ODOM: Good morning. My name is Dave Odom, and I am the chairman of the
Maui Jim Maui Invitational. We welcome everyone here to what really is the
beginning of our big week with great basketball, lot of great universities are
here, and we're just excited about the event. We always are. Amazing things
will happen in the next three days, I can tell you that. Nobody can script
that. We can script today, but we can't script the games, that's for sure.  
  
It is time now and a big honor for me to introduce to you our moderator of the
morning. I call him the hardest and most well-traveled sportscaster in the
business. I mean, he comes to us all the way from Toronto, Canada. He's in and
out of the United States. Do you pay taxes?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Yes, sir, I do.  
  
DAVE ODOM: You pay taxes here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: No, I pay them at home.  
  
DAVE ODOM: You don't pay United States tax.  
  
THE MODERATOR: No.  
  
DAVE ODOM: He's the hardest working and most well-traveled sportscaster in the
business. I give you Dan Shulman.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thank you, Coach. Very, very, especially being from Canada, very
excited to be here in 80° weather or 27 celsius if there happen to be any
other Canadians here today. Very excited to be back at the Maui Jim Maui
Invitational. Somewhere out there, Jay Bilas, my broadcast partner is here.
And he's excited to be here as well, and hoping to be back here for many
years. Before we hear from the coaches, we just want to introduce someone new
to the tournament family this year. Dr. Lynn Babington is here this year, the
new President of Chaminade University, took over on August 1st.  
  
Coach Beilein, she received her undergrad degree from the University of
Michigan. So there you go, so her loyalties may be a little bit divided this
week.  
  
We have these eight programs have combined for over 200 NCAA tournament
appearances, and every coach who is up here today has been to a Final Four as
either a head coach or an assistant coach. We've got a team that's ranked in
the top 10 right out of the chute this year. We've got a couple of All-
Americans we're going to see in this tournament. Three programs have been to
the Final Four in the last seven years, and as is always the case, we're going
to see great basketball over the next three days.  
  
We want you to hear briefly from each coach. So we'll start from my far right,
Wyking Jones is in his first year as head coach at the University of
California, was an assistant there for a couple of years. Coach Jones, if you
could tell us a little bit about the Bears going in?  
  
WYKING JONES: First of all, very excited to be part of such a prestigious
tournament. Every year you watch the Maui Invitational and it's the premier
tournament this time of year. So we're very excited to be here.  
  
My team, I feel like we've gotten better each game that we've played. We know
we're going to get tested this week, and at the end of the day hopefully we
get better. That's the main thing for us.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And you're one of a number of coaches up here who likes to play
fast. Tell us about the style of play you bring to your program?  
  
WYKING JONES: We pick up 94 feet. We like to use our defense to help us with
our offense. High-pressure basketball, and we like to push it in transition as
well.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Big picture heading into the Pac-12 this year. What do you think
about the league, and what are your expectations?  
  
WYKING JONES: Got some really talented teams in the league. Arizona is one of
the premier teams in the country, as well as USC and UCLA, I think they're all
ranked in the top 25. So this tournament is a great test for us leading into
conference play. So hopefully we can benefit from being challenged here this
week.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck this week.  
  
Coach Bovaird, well known to everybody here. The head coach of the Chaminade
Silverswords and a mainstay in this tournament, and, again, from what we
understand, the odds-on-favorite in the free throw contest that we're going to
see in a little bit. We asked you the same question last year, but it bears
repeating. What does this tournament mean to your program and what do you get
out of this?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: It means so much. From the recruiting aspect to everything for
Chaminade University, it's something that we cherish and look forward to every
year. It puts Chaminade on the map in the basketball world, and our guys are
so anxious and ready to see how they match up against this great competition.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And Chaminade has won a number of games over the years. Was Texas
the last win?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Texas was the last win.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: 2012 if I'm not mistaken. So you have a tough challenge on day
one with Coach Brey and the Irish. What kind of challenge does that present to
you guys?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: An incredible challenge. We've played Kansas, North Carolina the
past couple years, and I've watched their three games that they've played
recently. I put them in that category. They look like an incredible team, it's
going to be a challenge for us. Looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach Wade of LSU, I guess when he decided to take the job at
LSU, wanted to make sure he went to a place that was coming out to Maui
because he was at VCU so he was going to wind up in Maui one way or another.
What are you expecting out of your team over the next three days?  
  
WILL WADE: Yeah, I was bound and determined to get here one way or another,
but we'll see. We're a major work in progress. We've made some progress in the
preseason. Offensively, I think I know what we've got, but we're a major work
in progress with our defense. We're a team that's coming together and
hopefully this week will help us continue to gel and get better.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: When you look at the possibility of playing three top-notch games
in three days, what do your players get out of this this early in the season?  
  
WILL WADE: It will be good for us to see where we stand and give us about six
weeks before we get into SEC play to see where we stand and what we need to
correct and get better on, and where we need to move forward. So we're anxious
about the opportunity, and looking forward to getting it kicked off tomorrow.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: I think a lot of people are looking at the SEC as a league that's
going to be very strong, very deep this year. I don't want to give you anymore
anxiety than you may already have.  
  
WILL WADE: Thanks, anything else (laughing)?  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us what the SEC looks like?  
  
WILL WADE: The SEC, we've got three or four teams in the top 25 right now,
couple teams in the top 10. It's going to be a bear of a league. It will be
our first time through it, but we're certainly looking forward to the
opportunity, and looking forward to the challenge. I think this week will
really prepare us as we get ready for SEC play.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Best of luck this week.  
  
Coach Wojciechowski was here with Duke as a player and an assistant, I
believe. And was the most valuable or most outstanding player here with the
Maui Invitational in 1997. What do you remember about that?  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It was a great, great memory. That was my first time here

DAN SHULMAN: Best of luck this week. Coach Rhoades has taken over for the
first year as head coach at VCU. He was an assistant there before. Including
the final four run under Shaka Smart, went to Rice, has now come back as an
assistant. Before we talk about this week, what does it mean to you to take
over the program that you were at before as an assistant?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Great honor, dream come true. That area has been home for me and
my family for a long time. So now to go back there as the head coach of VCU is
a special thing.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: The style of play, will we see a similar style to what we've been
used to seeing in recent years?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Absolutely. We're going to try to play fast and aggressive, and
it's a fun way to play. Everybody at VCU loves that, and we're going to
continue to try to push that forward.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us a little bit about your match-up with Marquette and what
you're going to see this week?  
  
MIKE RHOADES: We've got our hands full for sure. Steve has done a super job
with that team. They have some great guards that can make plays and guys that
can really shoot it. We've got to make sure we defend them at a higher level
than we've been, but we're excited for the opportunity, for sure.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We wish you the best of luck. Thank you for the time.  
  
Last but certainly not least, Coach Gregg Marshall from Wichita State, a
consensus top 10 team. Heading into the season, a consensus All-American in
Landry Shamet, they're missing one of their key players in Markis McDuffie,
but they bring back every other player who was really in the rotation last
year.  
  
Coach Marshall, can you tell us a little about your club?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, we have six senior, so we have a lot of depth, talent,
experience, they're mature players. They've been through the fire. We've been
a little banged up, as you mentioned, Dan. But Landry Shamet is back, though
probably not 100%, and it will be a while for Markis. But we expect the guys
that are healthy to be ready to go. This is a great opportunity for us against
a wonderful field.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You're moving to a new conference this year, too, the American
Conference. How does that change things for you?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: It's very rare you get a better job, and you don't have to
change the zip code. We're excited about joining the American Conference.
There are a lot of wonderful teams, programs, players and coaches, Final
Fours, National Championship programs, so we think that that's going to add to
our opportunity for quality games and hopefully some quality wins come
tournament time.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: People are, because of everything you bring back, people are
talking about your team in the same breath as the traditional powers, the blue
bloods. From your players, how high are the expectations about what you guys
may be able to accomplish this year?  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: You know, we really don't talk about it. I just try to take a
day at a time and improve some way individually or collectively in each
practice. They obviously hear it in social media today. So they know there are
some very lofty expectations. But we just have to take it one day at a time.
Right now we're concerned about Cal.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Coach, thank you. Best of luck this week.  
  
We want to thank all the coaches for coming out this morning and wish them all
the best of luck in what should be a great tournament. We will see on behalf
of Jay and everybody else who is lucky enough to be here for ESPN, we want to
thank everybody for bringing us out here again to Maui, and we look forward to
a few great days of basketball. Now back over to Coach Odom.  
  
COACH ODOM: Thanks, Dan, and thanks coaches. That was a great job. Big hand
for them. Dan mentioned his travel partner Jay Bilas.  
  
Jay, just step out and stick your hand up here.  
  
Between Jay and Dan, they are the face of Maui Jim Maui Invitational out here.
Give Dan and Jay together a big hand.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2017

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 79 Colorado State - 71  
  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: You know, have to give Colorado State a ton of credit.
Coach Eustachy is one of the best coaches in the country. And at halftime we
talked to the team and we all discussed -- we knew that they weren't going to
go away, that they would compete and make a run, which all of Coach Eustachy's
teams always do. They're tough-minded and can compete. I'm proud of the way we
defended and rebounded, especially when we struggled to score at times and
they went on their scoring run.  
  
Probably the biggest thing is just thanking these guys for believing in a
vision. Everybody but D.J. is guys that came when we were here, and we told
them what we thought we could do. And I told them in the locker room, thanks
for believing in us, and for D.J., thanks for sticking around and trusting us.  
  
Q. Obviously you had a big day offensively. But defensively, too. How
important was your work on Omogbo?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: He's a very talented player, so I put it upon me to keep him
off the glass and just limiting like the shots he could get.  
  
Q. A lot is always made about the rivalry between Nevada and UNLV. How
sweet is it for you guys to come down and win it in Las Vegas?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: It's a great feeling winning it anywhere, knowing we have an
automatic bid to go to the Dance.  
  
Q. D.J., you're the elder statesman on this team. How special is this?
After all you went through, coaching change, different teammates, ending your
career going to the Dance?  
D.J. FENNER: It's extremely special. First of all, I want to thank God for
this opportunity. And for Coach Muss to put us all in this situation has been
amazing. Last time I remember being here I was crying because we lost, and I
didn't know who my next coach was going to be. And now a couple of years later
I'm here and we won it. It's absolutely amazing. And I couldn't be more
thankful for my coaches and my brothers.  
  
Q. Winning the CBI last year, how much did that influence what you were
able to do this year?  
D.J. FENNER: It influenced us a lot. It definitely gave us postseason
experience. It definitely gave us confidence going into the Mountain West
Tournament this year. And even playing in the Mountain West Conference
Championship against Colorado State last week. I think it was great. It really
helped us. It really helped us grow. And we're exactly where we want to be.  
  
Q. You guys shot 34 free throws in the second half alone. What was the
strategy offensively in the second half?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: Coach Muss always tell me just to try to get to the line. And
that helped get me going. And I just try to stay in attack mode and I got
there.  
  
Q. What does it mean that you're going to the tournament?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: It means a lot. It's crazy to think about, because the first
time I ever talked to Coach Muss, that was all we talked about was making the
tournament. And he told me how he was going to change the program around. He
was a man of his word and I respect it.  
  
Q. Your guys' offense gets a lot of attention, but it seems like the
defense won this game. Can you talk about that aspect of the team and how it's
developed?  
D.J. FENNER: It's definitely developed a lot. We made it a point of emphasis
after we actually lost to Utah State and everybody bought in defensively after
that. And it really showed because even if we weren't going on offense, we
were able to pull each other together on defense, and that's really what ended
up creating our offense in many situations. Everybody bought in and we became
a much better defensive team the second half of the season.  
  
Q. Jordan, is that your ball?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Second time you've won an MVP award in Vegas this year. You said this
one is going to mom. Who does that go to?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: It goes to mom.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you could take the game to another level and be a
bigger part of the team?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I wanted to help my team any way I could to get to the
tournament, not just scoring, any way I could. And like defensively, I just
wanted to play hard defensively, take it upon me to guard people like Omogbo,
First Team players, that was really it.  
  
Q. You guys had a great offense in the first half and then what changed
in the second half? What changes did Colorado State make defensively that kind
of looked like it took you guys a little out of your offense?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought they did a really good job of double teaming
Marcus. And we had some costly turnovers. But the theme entering this
tournament, and even the last regular season game, was we just have to defend
and rebound. And so to say that a team would go 4 for 22 and figure out a way
to win, I mean again, Coach Eustachy's teams are always great defensive teams
and physical. And this game was won on the glass. One of the best rebounding
teams in the league.  
  
And we always have Sesame Street rules, and we told them Sesame Street rule
No. 1, and it will play out if you win the battle of the boards. We're going
to win this game.  
  
Q. You went to the tournament a few years ago at ASU. How has that
helped you prepare for next week?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I've been more than fortunate, two of my four years as a
student-athlete I got to go when I was at University of San Diego and
participate as a player. And I've only been in college basketball three years
as an assistant and two of those three years I was able to go to a tournament.
And now as a head coach.  
  
I just told the guys we're going to enjoy this. I want them to enjoy it with
their families tonight. We're going to get back to Reno tomorrow morning and
enjoy it then and enjoy Selection Sunday. And then Sunday night it will be
back to work.  
  
We're happy that we're going, but we're going there to compete and try to win.
And we're not just going there and saying, Hey, we're a mid-major and we're in
this tournament. We're going there to win.  
  
And it's interesting because our first team meeting to start our off season,
we have a code on a door, and on that code the code is 3-12-17, because that's
the day of Selection Sunday. And it's been that way for 11 months, basically,
where every time they walk in that locker room they had to put that code in.
And Cam just brought it up when we met as a group behind closed doors. And
this was our goal from day one.  
  
Q. A lot of the coaches in this conference say that they believe that
you guys are probably a level above everyone else in this conference.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't think all of them said it.  
  
Q. Some of them. Coach Eustachy just did. What seeding do you think you
guys deserve in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: This is just a great opportunity for our student-
athletes. Whatever number they want to attach next to us in the brackets,
we're cool with, just let us go play. So we're not going to have a frown on
our face if it's -- whatever -- and we're not going to be smiling jubilantly
if it's a lower number. We're ready to go play a game. So tell us where we're
going, let us book our tickets and let us get there and get down to business.  
  
Q. Watching Josh Hall progress this season has been exciting. I thought
he came up huge in this tournament. Talk about his contributions today. Very
important, I think.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Absolutely incredible. It started yesterday in the game.
From a defensive standpoint when Josh checks in that allows us to take Lindsey
Drew off the best offensive player. And Lindsey is a young player, sophomore,
and he's going to get stronger and build his body up and so is Josh.  
  
That's one of the things that we're so excited about is our young players that
have come into our program as freshmen. And Josh's development, incredible.
He's not a guy that we look to offensively, but the play of the game was his
left-handed layup and-one. And then right when we put him in the game he's in
the right corner and banks a three. I just thought his contributions were
absolutely incredible because we didn't run a play for him and he had 12
points.  
  
Q. What has Dave Rice meant to what you've been able to do this year?
How happy are you to see him have this moment today?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: It's great for all of our assistant coaches. They all
contribute. Our grad assistants, I can't say enough about them and all the
work they do. But it's got to be special for Dave in this building, coming
back to Las Vegas. And anytime someone has sat in that head coaching chair, I
think that when you look over and talk to somebody that's been there and is a
calming influence. His personality is not slightly, but drastically different
than mine. So it's a good combination.  
  
Q. Two years ago Nevada won nine games. Last year --  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: You know what? I know. Because my son was at the first
practice and he was rebounding. And he actually had to walk out of the gym
because he got tired of rebounding all of the bricks.  
  
Q. Last season a postseason championship, this year Mountain West
regular season, and now postseason championship. What was the key moment you
realized this was a special group that you could accomplish something so
quickly?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We had some growing pains for them to understand the
work ethic that we were going to have in the off seasons, not going home for
long stretches, but going to class for the two long sessions we have out of
our three summer sessions, for them to actually go to class and not go home
and come back once regular school started. I think the turning point was them
talking about in the locker room about them going to get shots and reps up
working on their ball handling when we're not around. Because the difficulty
of college basketball is that we have time constraints on how much we can be
with our players in the off season and then in the season. So we have to rely
on them to self-coach or buddy coach as we called it.  
  
They've done an incredible job where one guy goes into the gym at 9:00 at
night and he calls three of his teammates and drags them in. Once they
believed that through work ethic you could improve on your own that was a
turning point. And it probably happened last summer is when we really kick
started that.  
  
Q. It was just a few years ago that the Mountain West was a four-bid
league. You won 27 games, but the general feeling is if you don't win this
game, you're not going to the NCAA tournament. So we're back to a one-bid
league. What do you think it's going to take for this league to get respect?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: You know, again, I'm like the -- close to a rookie in
college basketball. And probably the guys that have more experience can speak
to that better than I can. I can tell you my feelings are don't schedule
Division II games because out of our 28 wins, 28 of them were against Division
I teams. And I think that's a start.  
  
I think a few years ago in the league, at least my first league meetings that
I partaked in, everyone talked about Division II games don't cost very much
money and Division II games don't hurt you. Which I understand that they don't
hurt you because they don't count in the committee's eyes, but they don't
help, either. And so I think that would be a great start.  
  
And we have to win, our conference has to win non-conference games, because
it's so difficult playing in our conference. I mean I've been a part of the
SEC and the PAC 12 and I can tell you they don't travel like we do. So to win
on the road in our league is really, really hard. And the buildings and the
venues that we play in -- Utah State is as hard as anywhere that you play at
in some of these other conferences.  
  
So hopefully we'll continue to talk about it in our league meetings. And I
know that league office and the coaches and the athletic directors and the
presidents, we all want multiple teams to make this tournament.  
  
Q. Do you plan on changing the security code that you gave out to
everyone?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: That's a great point. We might have to change it. Great
point. Thank you.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of speculation about you in the last couple of
days, and it heated up during the game. How do you plan to keep the players
away from reading things and speculating on things that are going on with
you?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: There's nothing going on with me. I'm happy and my wife
is happy. My sons are happy. President Johnson and Doug Knuth gave me an
opportunity when no one else would, and trusted in our vision.  
  
So our guys haven't said anything and we have more than an open policy where
our guys talk to me about everything. And I don't think it's affected us at
all. And it shouldn't. I'm happy I get to drive over and watch my son play
high school basketball. My other son can jump on a flight and see me in 45
minutes. And my wife is involved, and she does too much, actually, in the
community. So it's all good. And our guys are focused on the task at hand,
which is enjoying today and enjoying tomorrow and then getting ready for a
game on Thursday and Friday.  
  
Q. I know you had a vision when you came here about what this program
could be. Two years later all you've accomplished, you have Lawlor rocking
again, how rewarding has this been for you as the head coach?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: It's been very rewarding. If you look at my career and
being at the top level of the NBA and making a decision to be an assistant
coach in college, I don't know of an NBA former head coach and was an
assistant coach in college, to my knowledge I don't know of anybody. Maybe
there are, but I don't know of it. It was a humbling experience.  
  
But support of my wife and my sons. So I kind of reinvented myself in the
college game. And couldn't be happier. I don't even watch an NBA game on TV.
It's all college. And it's a totally different lifestyle.  
  
I feel like I've got -- these guys are all my kids, so to speak. So you can
have an influence on people for the rest of their lives. So I've loved it.
It's been a great change of career for me.

### [Larry Eustachy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23504)

### [Prentiss Nixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32912)

### [Gian Clavell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32913)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 79 Colorado State - 71  
  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, it was a great game. I'm so proud of these guys
right here to my left. Give Nevada a ton of credit. We lost by 8 and we
spotted them 9 early. I don't know if we were nervous or what it was. But
Nevada is a very, very good team. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't go
into this tournament and win some games.  
  
But I'm most proud of our guys. They battled. They battled. They never gave
up. They fought through a lot of adversity that was happening out on that
court. They were perfect, perfect professionals out there. I thought they
handled themselves extremely well. So I've had NCAA tournament teams that I
haven't had the joy or the respect I have for this group of guys and what
they've been through. And we still have some more basketball to play.  
  
But give Nevada credit. They grabbed some balls that made the difference in
the game. I thought our guys played through a lot of adversity that was going
on out there, missed shots, some turnovers, frustration, not grabbing the
ball. So this is a special group that I will always remember. I can't speak
for Gian or Emmanuel, but I don't think we want to stop playing. I think we
want to keep this group together as long as we can. I would assume we're in
the NIT, and we're anxious to see what happens there, and how far we can
advance. It's a special group.  
  
Q. What was it about this team that every time you guys got way down you
were able to fight back and keep in it, even right up the end, you and
Prentiss hitting 3's, and just kind of refusing to go away?  
GIAN CLAVELL: We just played with a lot of heart every game. We don't want to
lose. We want to do whatever it takes to win. Whatever it takes we're going to
do it. And just we're playing with heart?  
  
Q. A lot of guys kind of wrote you guys off as a team after the news
that you'd be without the other three guys. What has it meant to you guys just
to get to this point? I know you didn't finish, obviously, like you would have
liked to, but still an impressive run, winning 13 out of 15, closing the
season with only 7 scholarship players.  
PRENTISS NIXON: It means a lot to us and the coach and the community. We go
out every day and compete, no matter how many guys we have on the roster that
are active to play. This team had the most heart that I've ever seen, as a
team I've ever been on, the most heart. It won't stop. It won't quit ever.  
  
Q. There was a huge foul disparity between the two teams in the second
half. I think at one point Nevada had taken 30 free throw attempts and you
guys had only taken 3. Is it hard to keep your composure in moments like that
when you're constantly being called for fouls?  
GIAN CLAVELL: We don't worry about that. We worry about playing basketball and
playing the right way.  
  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I think our guys, I obviously got a technical. I called
a timeout -- legally you can step out on the court and talk to your team
during the timeout, and a guy from half court called me for a T. What you have
right now are officials trying to make the NCAA tournament. And we're noted
for a team for not fouling.  
  
So it was very frustrating for these guys and the coaches. But I thought all
of us did a great job of handling it and playing through the issues of the
discrepancy and still getting it into a basket. Most teams would have lost by
30 points. But these guys just played through.  
  
We kept constantly talking about it, in spite of all the things that are going
wrong, you're not getting this, you're not getting that, just stay with it and
that's what I'm talking about. With just two seniors and all these young guys,
they really handled it well.  
  
And it starts with me. And that's where I was disappointed with the technical,
because I wasn't -- you want to protect your players, obviously that's your
job. But I just -- I think I've had one technical in three years. So I was
walking out to get our team together to calm them down, and from right field I
got hit with a T. So I'm going to talk to Bobby about that after we're done
here. So I'm kind of confused on what the rule is there.  
  
Q. Did you get any type of explanation whatsoever on the technical?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: The guy that I went -- as I walked out and talked to the
players, he came up to me and said, I didn't call it. I don't know why it was
called. That was told to me by one official.  
  
Again, I think you've got guys -- not only teams are trying to get in the NCAA
tournament, so are officials. It shouldn't be about the coach or the
officials. It should be about these guys right here.  
  
And we really stress not fouling. And I think we probably made more free
throws than the others have attempted all year long. So it's kind of out of
character to have 30-3 you said. It's not the reason why we lost. We're not
blaming the officials by any means.  
  
But the technical is a little confusing. And I also thought that our guys
really handled some very physical play that didn't really go our way,
obviously with the 30 to 3 discrepancy. That's what makes me so proud of this
group. Gian said yesterday, we've been trying to be broken in many ways, but
we haven't been even bent.  
  
Q. A lot of people talked about how the Mountain West is a parity-filled
league, and anyone can win it. Having played Nevada now twice in eight days,
are they a cut above everyone else, would you say?  
PRENTISS NIXON: We played them tough twice. They lost four games in
conference, like everybody else. I wouldn't say they're above anybody. This
conference is wide open, every conference is wide open from the start to the
finish.  
  
Q. You guys go on this incredible run to end the regular season and you
went a couple of games here. How tough is it to come that close to
accomplishing something that is so meaningful?  
GIAN CLAVELL: It's always tough. You always want to win. You want to go to the
NCAA tournament, that's your goal all the time. Yeah, it's tough, but we've
got an opportunity to play with this team together and that's what I'm looking
forward to.  
  
Q. How glad are you that you came back and you guys had this run, just
playing with Coach one more year?  
GIAN CLAVELL: I'm extremely grateful for everything he's done for me. I
couldn't ask for a better coach, a better person. It's special. You guys don't
see it, because it's behind closed doors, but if he goes anywhere I'll go with
him. I've always said it. He's just a coach, a father figure. He's just there
when you need him. It's something special that you guys don't get to see, but
it is something special.  
  
Q. How much does the way you guys bond together, practice, how much does
it make you tough to be able to just handle some of these situations where
you're down by 13, like last night you come back and win? You're down by 17
late in the first half tonight and you come back and you actually tie the game
and have a chance to win it late.  
PRENTISS NIXON: I think that the bond that we have makes us fight for each
other, no matter what's going wrong, we're going to fight for each other, no
matter what. We got to fight to the end, no matter what is going on the court.
Off the court we even have each other's back.  
  
Q. How good is that Nevada front line?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: They're good.  
  
Q. That's obviously how they won the last two games against you was
Oliver and Caroline, just some of the things they're able to do.  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: They're good. Prentiss -- this is a tough time to talk
to young men right now, but I think they're a little cut above everybody in
this league. I also have to exclude us. But they are. They're very, very good.
And if they hadn't beaten us, they wouldn't have gone to the tournament, and
that's a joke. This is an NCAA team.  
  
So, I mean, you pick your poison with them. We go with Marshall and Oliver,
and then -- Drew, Nevada is relevant. And Eric Musselman, him and I had a
great talk today. He's a heck of a coach. This league is just, for some reason
you get a stigma that you're just kind of okay, and it's really not. That's a
really good team. They manhandled a very good Fresno team.  
  
So I think they are a level. No. 1 coach in the league, him and Coach Fisher.
I think Eric does a terrific job. And to blend guys from different schools
that have been in different places, I mean he's certainly -- he's my coach of
the year, that's for sure. So give Nevada a ton of credit.  
  
We had them, but we couldn't get by them. But there's no disgrace losing to
them.  
  
Q. You've been a National Coach of the Year, been to the Elite 8. With
all your accolades, does anything in your mind match what you did with this
team this year?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: No, it's a special group, and they'll always be a
special group because of all the events that have happened. You don't judge a
team off wins and losses. I think you judge them, have they reached their
potential. This team has probably overachieved more than any team I've ever
had. It's up there.  
  
The Elite 8 team doesn't conquer this team. Neither, or, take your pick. But
it's a good question. Like I just told them -- there were a lot of tears in
there. You guys will always be really special to my heart. We've had each
other's back. And I think we had some basketball left. Last year's team was
kind of burned out with Tiel and Joe had logged so many minutes for so long.
And Emmanuel was hurt.  
  
I think this team wants to play, so we'll see what happens. But it's a team
I'll always remember. You don't have a net to cut down or what have you, but
you have memories that you won't ever forget.  
  
Q. You just talked about Nevada clearly being a team that's worthy of
the NCAA tournament. Is your team worthy of it? We all know it probably won't
happen, but from an outside standpoint, is your team an NCAA quality team this
year?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I know we can beat teams that are going to go to the
tournament. I know that. And unfortunately, this is going in a different
direction. And we found that out my third year here when they're trying like
heck to find reasons to get the Georgia Techs in the tournament. It's all
about money. We all know it is. And they're trying to slip seven or eight out
of the Power 5's. And it's sad what's happening. They're trying to figure out
a way not to let Middle Tennessee in, when really, that's the true story of
the NCAA. It's the Hoosier story.  
  
Yeah, I think our team would -- I would guarantee if we got to play all 64
teams we would have a .500 record. I mean, we can play with most teams in the
country. Now, you have your elite of elite, but not really. The way this team
plays -- and Nevada is the same way, they can beat anybody on a given night.  
  
So, yes, but unfortunately, it's going the wrong way. You're eliminating those
great stories of Butler. Those things aren't -- they're just not happening.
What was the team that if they hadn't -- oh, Andy Enfield's team from Florida
Gulf Coast, what is it? They had to make two miraculous shot to win their
conference tournament and then become the dunk brothers or whatever they
called them. And they went to the Sweet 16. And they threw some shots in that
wouldn't have even qualified them if they hadn't done it and then won the
conference automatic bid.  
  
Maybe they should lengthen the tournament to 90-something, and you'd have some
real Cinderella stories. But it's going the other way. It's like football.
It's like everything else.  
  
But not Colorado State. Colorado State is relevant, very relevant. When you
beat San Diego State three straight times and you make it to the championship,
we have made our mark. We've won 110-something games in five years. I go in to
homes now and it is a completely different response to when I first went in
here and tried to recruit guys.  
  
We can get involved with four- or five-star guys. We can get involved with
most people in the country. So I really accomplished what I set out to do and
stormed the court the last two games. So we're on the rise, as is Reno, as is
a lot of teams. This league is going to be very good with a lot of the good
young players.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously the quick turnaround is difficult for any team to
deal with that. You've had the short bench. What does that say about your
team, that you're able to take it right down to the wire against a squad with
the caliber of Nevada?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: You've got to think, they watched our game until the
ten-minute mark. They had the same quick turnaround. They only play six guys.
It was two similar programs going against each other.  
  
But it's a great point. I was happy because I'm usually asleep -- it was so
late last night. But we really weren't that -- I'd rather have played at 3:00
than at 8:00 and waited all day again. So it says a lot for both teams.  
  
I thought it was a great game, very exciting. I thought both teams played
really hard. They both left it on the court. It shows you how much these guys
have in the tank because, really, 13, 14 guys play and probably ten of them
play for the majority of the minutes. So it shows you what these young men are
capable of.  
  
Q. What was that technical foul all about?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I don't know what it was about. I did take a timeout
because there was a discrepancy and I wanted to gather our team, because I saw
them getting frustrated. So I think you're allowed to walk out on the court
during a timeout or I'd have a technical every timeout because we seat out on
the court. As I was talking to one of the refs another guy not involved in the
conversation T'd me from half court.  
  
What I'm hearing is if the main man is watching things right now, the main man
that picks the guys that go to the tournament, they're really being
scrutinized right now, the officials, as they try to make their Final Four,
the officials. So there's motives behind some things. But they're a good crew.
Good guys. Just didn't work out.  
  
But I want to make it clear that I probably hold the record for the most
technicals of an active coach. But it's been inactive for a long time. I mean,
the last two technicals I've had have been under the same conditions. One I
call the $300,000 technical at Boise when I stepped out on the court, and it
cost us the league championship and an NCAA tournament bid. Joe Parker is
here, he knows well -- were you pulling for me, Joe, because you would have
owed me $200,000 -- I call it the $300,000 technical. I called a timeout, it
cost us the game, luckily this one didn't, and it cost us the league
championship and an NCAA tournament bid.  
  
Bobby is in there and we're going to talk to Bobby about it. I'm just glad it
didn't -- if anything, I think it helped our team. I said, Bail me out, guys,
they did once again, they tried real hard.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Paul Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28584)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 83 Fresno State - 72  
  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Well, I thought it was a hard-fought game from start to
finish. I thought that we got off to obviously a great start. Played a really
good first half. I thought in the second half we didn't play probably one of
our better halves of the year. A lot of things probably attributed to that in
terms of us not taking care of the basketball. Some self-inflicted things,
giving them an opportunity to get momentum. They're a feel-good team. And we
gave them the opportunity to feel good about things down the stretch. And you
can't do that this time of year.  
  
Q. When you look at the stat sheet, 62 points and nearly 80 percent
shooting, do you attribute that to them getting really hot or do you think
that your defense dropped or how do you think that went?  
PAUL WATSON: They made a run, just like any other team would, being down. But
you know, we really didn't bring the intensity that we did in the first half
to the second. We weren't able to sustain the run that they made. That
definitely hurt us, being able to not be there in the right spots at the right
time and just being intense the whole second half.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at the sudden turn of events there? You were kind
of dominating the first half. And the second half was completely different.  
PAUL WATSON: I wouldn't say surprised. It's basketball. Basketball is a game
of runs. It was going to happen. It was bound to happen eventually.
Unfortunately we just didn't deal with it the way that we were supposed to and
it ended up hurting us in the second half.  
  
Q. Rodney, what did you see there in the second half? Do you think it
was just making shots? They have the ability to make really difficult shots.
And when they got on a roll, that's what they did. Do you see it as them
getting hot or your defense slacking off?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: I thought we've done a really good job staying the course,
even when teams made runs we didn't flinch. We had some self-inflicted things
in terms of turnovers, but we gave them some momentum to have that type of
run.  
  
We've built that six-game winning streak on getting consecutive stops and
being able to execute at a high level. And just like everything, in the ebb
and flow of the game, they have a few shots, and the next thing it's a
different type of ballgame. And we weren't able to get some stops to stop
their run.  
  
Q. It looked like Deshon, was he cramping up in the second half?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Yeah, I think a little bit down the stretch he had that
issue there and was able to come out and finish the ballgame for us.  
  
Q. Were you searching for a source of offense for keep pace with Nevada?
Bryson, he started off hot, Deshon was on the bench.  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: We knew where we wanted to put the ball. 42 points in the
paint tonight, we had 18 at the half. We wanted the ball inside; they couldn't
deal with us inside. And so when we were executing and got the ball in there
we got exactly what we wanted. We weren't searching. We wanted to play inside
out and when we did that we were very effective against them.  
  
Q. What are you hoping for, now, an NIT berth?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: It's out of our control right now. You can control
obviously when you're playing, and where you stack up. We obviously feel like
we've earned an opportunity for postseason play. We've been in the CBI and
came up short of winning that championship in that area. It helped our young
players grow, it put us on the stage we're on last year, when we got the
chance to be in the NCAA tournament.  
  
We're going to have some type of postseason, we're excited about another
opportunity, because we have young players in our program that will be coming
back next year and continue to grow, and grow up tonight. They had to grow up
tonight on a main stage and they'll be better going forward. We're going to be
excited about an opportunity to continue playing.  
  
Q. They switched their defense on you in the second half?  
PAUL WATSON: I didn't really see any difference. They switched a little bit.
But that was the only change they may have made in the second half.  
  
Q. You got 12 points in the first half, but took you a little while to
get going in the second. Were you looking to get involved offensively in the
second half or letting the game flow?  
PAUL WATSON: Just trying to stay aggressive. I was a little hot going into the
second half. Just trying to find a rhythm. It took me a little while getting
going. But I was trying to take the right shot, trying not to force anything
and when an opportunity comes, be ready to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. The closing statement we got from Nevada's coach was they switched
their defense on pick and roll in the second half. Is that something that you
think contributed?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: I don't think they switched their defense. They were still
playing the hard heads the whole time. And again, our whole deal was to
attack, and pick up a foul on the big fellow. We still got the ball when we
wanted it to, inside out.  
  
So I don't think they really switched what they were trying to do. Early in
the game they tried to come out and mark it up a little bit in terms of making
us play a little faster, in terms of trying to get the ball out of our guys'
hands, we couldn't get in a set. They got out of that pretty early, because we
made shots behind it. I don't think there was that much of an adjustment in
the second half. I'll have to go back and look at the tape, but I don't think
so.  
  
Q. They came in with the three veteran seniors, and you've had a
freshman and sophomore emerge. How important do you think their contributions
have been, and what a postseason would do for them?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: We've got a young team coming back. We're going to be
really good again next year. I'm excited how we were able to finish out the
season with our older players, Paul Watson and Cullen Russo, Karachi got a
chance to do some things for us in terms of their leadership. Those guys have
played in a lot of big games and been in a lot of big stages, and helped move
our program in another direction.  
  
Our young guys have emerged as well. Having an opportunity to play in
postseason, where it's one and done, gives them more growth from what we had
tonight. Freshmen were out there doing big things. It's a grown man's game
this time of year. And Deshon was doing what he did over the latter part of
the season. And J.T. and Jaron, all those guys get a chance to grow up and be
hungry for a really big run next year.

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Cameron Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30556)

### [Marcus Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24800)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 83 Fresno State - 72  
  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, obviously it was a tale of two halves. And we
played our worst first half since we've been together. And we probably played
our best second half since we've been together.  
  
I thought the guys did a great job at halftime of keeping their composure,
because we were struggling. We were searching. But these guys wanted to play
Fresno. And we got on the bus last night from this game and they were happy
that they were getting another chance to play Fresno.  
  
So I give them a lot of credit for their approach when we couldn't make a
basket and we weren't playing some of our best defense.  
  
Q. You guys have been in some tough situations and come back and won,
obviously the New Mexico game. How much did those experiences help when you
guys were in such a sticky situation at halftime?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: I think it helped a lot. Obviously like Coach said we kind of
-- well, we did have a bad first half. But at halftime, like you said, we've
been in situations before, and Coach told us to buckle down on defense and
improve our shot selection. And obviously we know what was at stake and
obviously our ultimate goal at the beginning of the year was to be in this
situation, so we didn't want to lose an opportunity like this. We buckled down
on defense and took better shots and came out with the win.  
  
CAMERON OLIVER: I told them at halftime to have pride. We've been in this
situation before, so we had our heads down for this one. But we just kind of
-- just remind ourselves we've been in this before. It was another 20 minutes;
20 minutes is a very long time. We kept our heads up and eventually got the
win.  
  
Q. It was a tale of two halves, no more important for a guy like you.
Can you talk about your approach in the second half as far as taking the bull
by the horns offensively?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: I just wanted to come out and be aggressive and take the
shots. Credit the coaches for giving me confidence and teammates for finding
me in the right spots at the right time. The ball was dropping for me, and
from there, I mean, wasn't much to do. That's my role on the team is to be
aggressive and make the shots. I had to come through. Obviously we were down
by 11 and in this type of game and this type of environment I have to come
through for the team.  
  
Q. Basketball can be a funny game. How do you shoot 23 percent in the
first half and 80 in the second half?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I think you just said it, it's funny. We just played hard. We
just played hard. We just knew 20 minutes is a long time. It is incredible we
shot 79 percent, that's crazy. But at the same time it's something I know we
are still capable of. We can make shots. I know people can make shots, I know
Marcus can make shots, all of us can make shots on this team. It's just a
matter of them falling in the basket.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the Fresno State factor. Coming against Fresno State
based on the regular season matchups, how good does that feel to avenge the
only team that beat you twice?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: It feels great. I think everything is going according to how
we want it. Just having Utah State, a team that beat us earlier, and Fresno
who swept us during the regular season. These are the games that we wanted.
And obviously we came out in the first half and didn't play too well. But
Fresno is a team that we really wanted to beat. So I'm just glad we came on
the second half and picked it up and got the W.  
  
Q. Was there a rah-rah speech at halftime or something?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Please don't, Marcus.  
  
MARCUS MARSHALL: Coach, he always reads off the stats. He looked at the paper
and reads off the stats. He yells. He says what he says. I'm not going to say
it now. And Cam, you know, being the leader he is, he kind of got fired up and
told guys just take pride. Just take pride. This is what we really want. And I
think everybody took heed from the message.  
  
Q. When you were in the moment -- you've had some really big spurts of
scoring this year. What was it like to be in the middle of that and the shots
just kept falling and you put together that comeback?  
CAMERON OLIVER: It was fun. It was really fun. When we hit our shots and
seeing Coach Muss waving his arms. It's a fun thing.  
  
At the end of the day, basketball, you've got to have fun. It happens. With a
25 run, like I said, the balls go in the basket for us. We're capable of doing
a lot of great things on the team, and when we do that, it's fun.  
  
MARCUS MARSHALL: It was great, piggybacking on what Cam said. We have so many
guys putting the ball in the hole. Going into games it's not our worry who's
going to score. Coach always put a lot of emphasis on let's make sure we focus
on the defensive end. It helps us get easier buckets. And our offense mostly
every game is going to be there. But we've got to focus on not letting other
people score buckets. We'd rather get stops at the other end. That's how we
make our runs and get the big leads.  
  
Q. Coach, Fresno might find itself in the position you guys were in last
year in a CBI or CIT, how important is it for the guys who were around last
year to have gone through that and drawing upon that now and winning that
thing last year?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, I think the postseason experience was vital. When
we made the decision to do it it was because we had a lot of young players.
And I thought for Cameron and for Lindsey Drew, especially, it was really
important. And then even for juniors like D.J. Fenner, I thought it was
important.  
  
I thought the game against Colorado State, Coach Eustachy does such a good
job, and they're a tough team to play, and to have it come down to the last
day of the regular season, it's just the way the season played out. I thought
that situation helped us for a situation like we were in tonight at halftime.  
  
Q. You said that you came to Nevada for a chance to play for an NCAA
tournament, you are on the verge of that. One win away. How badly does this
locker room want a chance to go to the big dance?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: We wanted it very bad. The game against Colorado State, we
wanted it bad, too. We can't let that get in the way or lose focus. Sometimes
you can want something really bad and go out there and lose it a little bit.
So going into tomorrow we're going to approach it like any other game. We're
just going to try to play hard for 40 minutes and play as a team and play hard
on defense and just live with the results.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to be on the verge right now and know you're
one game away, and how badly does this team desire to get this?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I think in the beginning of the season we set our goals for
ourselves as a team, as a whole program. So like Marcus said, we're
approaching it like any other game. It's a big game, but at the same time
we've got to make sure we're mature and take care of business.  
  
Q. Feeding off what was just asked of the players, how important is
tomorrow for this program to take that next step?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, I think that we've had two great years. And Cam
said it best; we want our guys to really enjoy the experience. As a competitor
to -- for it to come down to a championship game in the regular season, which
we've already experienced to now in a conference tournament, it will be a
great atmosphere, regardless of who we play.  
  
But we feel like we've fast-tracked where we were going to go in year two. And
so I want the guys to watch this game right now and get off their legs and
we'll have a couple of meetings tomorrow and then I want them to go out and
have fun and play loose and play free.  
  
Q. They're playing 9:30 start, you played 7:00. Does that in any way
give you an advantage going into tomorrow?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Did it help last year in this tournament?  
  
Q. I wasn't here last year.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think Fresno played the first game; is that correct? I
don't know. I don't think it matters. It's two hours. Our guys are all going
to watch it. They're all going to go to bed about the same time.  
  
Q. Josh Hall has put back-to-back games and he seems to be getting
better every day.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought Josh was phenomenal. He hung around the
basket, because Fresno focused so much on Marcus. And his baskets were
critical at critical times. And to see the way that he's matured as a player
has been unbelievable and the trust that we've had in him, he's done a great
job of rebounding the ball from a small forward spot. We put him on the
opposing team's best offensive player when he goes in a game. And he allows
Lindsey Drew to get a blow or a rest, or Lindsey guards someone else for short
stretches. And I thought Josh did a great job helping us out on the press, as
well.  
  
Q. You have had a number of games where you were down at halftime, and
made comebacks. How does that help in the guys keeping composure, and knowing
they didn't have to press in the second half?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think it's a confident locker room. We don't want to
get down. But, man, we were really struggling to get in a rhythm. We weren't
moving the ball. It was one or two passes. And so when we talked about at
halftime was multiple touches, bodies moving, getting the ball to ricochet
around the floor a little bit more. And Marcus, I thought he was really
unselfish. He obviously had a great offensive night scoring the ball, but I
thought his 5 assists were crucial, as well.  
  
Q. That run when you haven't been able to score in spurts like this,
maybe not quite like this, put that 25-2 run in your perspective?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think with us offensively, everything starts
defensively. So we got stops. And so our defense kind of ignited our offense.
And obviously we shot the heck out of the ball from three in the second half
and it opened things up for the dribble drive. And because they focus so much
attention on Marcus that one of the biggest thing was Marcus getting the ball
out of his hands at times, and once we got in the bonus, we wanted to keep the
ball in his hands. And when they trapped or hard showed, we wanted Marcus to
really attack their bigs. And I thought he did a great job of that and that
helped him get FTAs, free throws attempts.  
  
Q. After what San Diego State went through last season, is that a
talking point with your team?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We just take it one game at a time. San Diego State,
what they did last year, 16 and 2, what an incredible season. How they didn't
make the tournament, I have no idea. I think it's not fair. I've said it
before, our local guys have heard me say it, when I was at Arizona State and
LSU when we made the tournament, I thought we had pretty good years. Not like
San Diego State had last year, at least in conference, and certainly not the
way I feel about our team right now. But that's the world we live in.  
  
And if you're a Power 5 school and you finish in 5th or 8th I guess they think
that's better than seasons like San Diego State had and a season like we've
had. And that's how it is. Again, I don't think it's fair because I've been on
the other side and I think that once March Madness hits and the NCAA
tournament's first game on Thursday, everybody wants to see the underdog, and
everybody is talking about when there's an upset. They're not talking about an
8th place team in the Big 10. I don't agree with the way they rule.  
  
When I was in the NBA all the years before I got to college, and you'd be
traveling the NBA, you turn a game on, you want to see an underdog play a
Power 5 school. You don't want to see the 8th place team in the Big 10 and an
6th place team in the ACC.  
  
Q. Along those lines, do you feel that there's anything the Mountain
West can do at a league level to foster more tournament caliber teams or make
the league more viable for multiple bids?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think the league office and the coaches and the
athletic directors, we're all searching to try to figure out -- I'm the wrong
guy to ask, because I've only been in the league two years and only in college
basketball four years. I'm a rookie. We've got a lot more experienced people.  
  
I can only say what I see playing Division II teams. As a coach I don't get up
for a Division II game. I think that would help, not playing those Division
II. But, again, some people say that Division II games don't hurt you.  
  
We have, I don't know, how many wins have we got, 27. We have 27 wins all
against Division I teams. So to me that's an incredibly great year so far.  
  
Q. The way you guys ended that first half, 20 percent, down 11, and then
to shoot almost 80 percent in the second half, what does that say about your
team's resolve to not give in and go away and hang in there?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We came into the game thinking we were going to win. And
even though we struggled, you know, to us it was about defending and
rebounding, and we felt like if we got some spots and defensive rebounds, and
normally we play defensive pick-and-roll coverages one way. We actually had
three different coverages, we did not shoot around today. We had a walk-
through in the ballroom. We walked through three different coverages, because
Hopkins has hurt us. We played the same exact way in the first half, in our
pick-and-roll coverages, then we went to two others, that we called plan B and
plan C, and I thought that really helped us in the second half.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Trey Kell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27926)

### [Malik Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28635)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 71 San Diego State - 63  
  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Always disappointing when it's over. It's always
disappointing when you don't have another game to look forward to. And that's
who we are right now. They beat us. We jumped out with that big early lead but
I didn't think that they would wave the white flag and surrender. They did
what everybody does, they competed and fought and made some big, big plays to
come back and earn the victory.  
  
Proud of our team. Disappointed that we're no longer playing.  
  
Q. This is the third time CSU has been able to come back from 13 to beat
you guys. Can you talk about what happened in the second half and what was
different?  
MALIK POPE: They're a good team. They made big shots. We played our defense,
contested the big shots. So give them credit where it's due.  
  
Q. How much of a factor was the injury in the second half? When you were
out of the game it was a tough stretch for you guys offensively. How much did
that come into play?  
MALIK POPE: It didn't affect me at all. Injuries happen. You've got to bounce
back, play for your teammates. We've got seniors back there. I just had to
give them all I had. It's not over until it's over. And the outcome is what it
is.  
  
Q. How do you compartmentalize this season? You guys played great in
stretches in this tournament; you didn't play so great in some stretches. How
do you sort of balance all that out?  
TREY KELL: It was a tough year regarding that. Just one of those things, our
main thing for us is trying to be more consistent. And we wavered with that
this year. If we had been more consistent we'd probably have a little more
victories under our belt. But at the end of the day we came to this tournament
and believed we could make it to Saturday and we fell a little bit short to a
good Colorado State team.  
  
Q. They said they thought you guys would tire because you were playing
three games in three days. And he kept telling his guys, They're going to get
tired, keep at it. Did you feel the effects of that in the second half?  
TREY KELL: To be honest, no. A game like that with what was on the line you
don't really focus on the fatigue. Just at the end of the day you're just
trying to make plays and help your team win. Obviously it doesn't help playing
three games in three days. But that's not an excuse. They just made some big
plays.  
  
Q. You just said that you don't have another game to look forward to. Do
you not intend to go to a tournament or on the slim chance you get an NIT
berth?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I haven't thought about that. We're not going to play in
anything other than the NIT, if we get an opportunity, and it probably won't
happen. But if it does, then definitely we will play in that.  
  
Q. You had a huge rebound advantage the first half and they had a lot of
turnovers, they talked about turning those two things around. Did you see that
as the key to what happened or did you see something else out there?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We struggled with consistency all season long. And we've
had stretches where we've done different things that have been hurtful to us.
And we turned the ball over too much. We had some good shots that we didn't
make and they had some hard shots that they did make, and I think that was a
huge factor to it, also. When it was a tie game at four or five minutes to go
I know they had three three's in that stretch, Clavell, Omogbo, and Paige that
were guarded, closely contested. And teams that win make plays like that.
Those were not layups. Those were not gimmes, those were not freebies, they
made those plays. They beat us up on the boards at their place. In the first
half we did a yeoman's work on the boards. For whatever reason we weren't able
to get as many in the second half. I think we only had three offensive
rebounds in the second half. But they beat us.  
  
The first two games we lost. When you lose the way you did, we say, could
have, would have, should have, but tonight they beat us. And I salute them and
wish them good luck as they play tomorrow.  
  
Q. In the second half you went with your starters for a while and you
had a flow going. And you got into 7, 8, 9 minutes into the half. Talk us
through the decision to go to the bench, keep those guys in there. Do you feel
like they were just getting too tired?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I think you make decisions -- we've got a lot of guys that
can play. And we've never played guys for a long, long, long stretch. We felt
like we could add energy and add something when we went to the bench. You play
guys -- you can't play guys for 40 minutes.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Gian Clavell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32913)

### [Larry Eustachy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23504)

### [Prentiss Nixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32912)

### [Emmanuel Omogbo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30498)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 71 San Diego State - 63  
  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, we have to quickly put this game behind us. We've
been here several times and it's worked out at times, hasn't worked out.
There's a big difference.  
  
We'll talk about today's game and give San Diego State all the credit in the
world. They came out and forced us to turn it over. We couldn't keep them off
the boards. They had the majority of their points in the first half off of our
turnovers that they converted or off of offensive rebounds.  
  
And then give our guys credit for responding and really doing what they said
they were going to do during a timeout about not turning the ball over,
keeping them off the boards and it was a terrific effort. And we thought that
San Diego would get tired because it was their third game in three days. And
these guys bought into what we were telling them and they just stuck with it.
It worked out perfect.  
  
But give San Diego State a ton of credit. I mean, we have as much respect for
them or more respect for them than anybody in the league. I think this is the
third time we've been down 13 and beat them three times. So it's just kind of
remarkable.  
  
But we'd like to talk about it for a while and then move on for something that
either team moving forward has never experienced. Fenner, it's a big game for
him. One time we beat them by 60 points, and I don't want to move on to the
next game. There's a lot at stake for both teams, and we know what we have
ahead of us. But there's really not a lot of time to enjoy this one.  
  
Q. With everything that this program has had to deal with the last
couple of years, what would it mean for you guys to come out tomorrow and win
the conference?  
GIAN CLAVELL: It would mean a lot because everything we've been through, it
didn't break us, it don't bend us, either. Yeah, it would be big time. It
would mean a lot to us, especially we want to do this, of course, for Coach
and for CSU.  
  
Q. You guys had 8 turnovers in the first 12 minutes, and then ended up
with 13 for the game. How did you guys cut back on that?  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: We went into halftime, Coach got on us for turning the ball
over. In the second half we only had three turnovers and that was the
difference in the game. And we had to rebound more and that changed the game
around, when we limit them to just one shot.  
  
Q. During that timeout early in the game when you got extremely
animated, what was the message there? Do you think maybe that was the turning
point in the game?  
GIAN CLAVELL: Just play harder. Just concentrate on the game plan and just
play, enjoy it, just have fun with it.  
  
Q. Coach referenced that this is the third time you guys have come back
from 13 to beat San Diego State. Were you telling yourself that you were still
in it? Did you feel that you could still come back and win this game?  
GIAN CLAVELL: Anytime we're down by any margin we feel like we can come back
and win, that's just any team. But, yeah, we always say, Stay with it, chip
away and just one basket at a time.  
  
Q. You didn't turn the ball over at all against Air Force. You came out
tonight and had a couple quick turnovers. Was that just nerves?  
GIAN CLAVELL: No. Dakarai Allen, he's the best defender I've ever played
against. I told him, when he fouled out, I got so much respect for him. You
have no idea. And just they were in the right place at the right time. It's
hard struggling so hard. So, yeah. The credit goes to their defense.  
  
Q. Talk about what you guys have been able to do with the guards,
perimeter-wise they shot almost 50 percent in the first half, but the second
half you locked down a little bit. And they only ended up getting one three-
pointer in the second half.  
PRENTISS NIXON: It came down to heart. In the back court we have some of the
most heart. And it just came down to all heart.  
  
Q. You've dedicated this whole season to your family. What's it mean to
keep winning, keep playing, and really keep the dream alive of what you might
still be able to accomplish?  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: It means a lot to me that the guys can do it for me and my
family. But at the same time it's for them. At the end of the day I have to
walk in my own shoes and my family always behind me, Coach Eustachy is always
behind me.  
  
I really just wanted to come out here and just play my hardest. Coach reminded
me that I only had two rebounds at halftime, so I just wanted to come out and
just play my heart out and just rebound, and that's what I did in the second
half.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is where it should be, these are the two best
teams in the Mountain West, and it should be down to you two guys?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I don't know about that. We were fortunate that we made
some incredible plays. We started screening Allen, because they switched their
guards, so that made somebody else guard Gian, that changed a little bit. But
there's so many good teams in the league. Nevada might be a level above
everybody. They're awfully good, they're well coached and talented. I go back
to yesterday about this league is strong. It may not have an UCLA, top ten
team in it or Oregon, but it's deep. And those two teams that played before us
are very special. And Boise State is really good.  
  
So did the seeding make our conference look exactly right? Yeah, it did, just
like I think the PAC 12 is similar. I'm not sure if Arizona is playing Oregon
or not. I just know we have our hands full tomorrow. I know what we're up
against, and we're up against it for sure, and that's why I want to get these
guys to put this one behind them and try and understand what we're playing
for, because there's a big difference between winning and losing that game.  
  
Q. Playing so late tonight, is that a big disadvantage going into
tomorrow?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: What time is the game tomorrow? 3:00. I don't understand
why there's a 9:30 game. I think Craig came out and said we're going to change
some things with the contract. But it's midnight these guys are going to bed.
It's supposed to be about the student-athlete.  
  
But we'll have no excuse. Both teams are tired, I'm sure. They played two
really hard games. But it is a quick turnaround. With the adrenaline and what
have you, it's hard to fall asleep, it really is.  
  
But the biggest problem we're going to have tomorrow is not the time of the
game or when this game is over with, it's going to be Nevada and who they have
on that team. Marshall is going to be the biggest problem and then Oliver. So
the time change or if we flew to China and played this tomorrow, that would be
fine if we weren't playing Nevada. So the biggest problem we have at 3:00
tomorrow is Nevada.  
  
Q. You've talked about all season how much respect you have for Coach
Steve Fisher and what it meant to you when he came on the bus after the win at
the Viejas. Can you talk about what it means to you after coming back against
a coach of that caliber?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, I don't think it's fair. There's no words to
describe Steve Fisher. He's faced adversity in his profession. Obviously it's
well documented what Mark is going through. You can't describe what he's
tasted or doing. So this is just the game of basketball to him, compared to
real life. We talk a lot. I understand him.  
  
I've met a lot of great coaches. I've met a lot of people. And he's the finest
person that I've met in athletics, forget about basketball coaches, forget
about whoever. He's the finest man I've ever met in this business and one of
the finest I've ever met in anything. If we had lost today I wouldn't have
felt bad, because that would have meant he won. There's a real friendship
there.  
  
Q. He said he hasn't decided whether he's going to come back next
season. Do you have a sense he might walk away or he's such a competitor he's
not going to leave after 9-9.  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, we might walk away together, just between you and
me. We've got a little beach house in Del Mar, him and I. So we may just be
playing checkers and sitting out there with Mark and Lana and everybody. So, I
don't know. I don't know.  
  
He's so competitive. I can't answer that. But whatever he does, he's made his
mark. I know he'll stay with San Diego State and be a part of their athletic
department. The only school I could get into was San Diego State, that was the
only one that accepted me at one time. I mean everybody else declined me
because of my GPA. Now you can't get in there. And I think San Diego State
basketball has had a lot to do with that. He has meant millions upon millions
of dollars to that university through exposure and revenue and what have you.
I hope he comes back, because he's good for the game of basketball.  
  
Q. Can you pinpoint what allowed you guys to overcome such a terrible
start? Did Gian have a role in that in that timeout?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, that was really big, you're exactly right.
Sometimes my words fall on deaf ears, but Gian was very, very explicit. The
ultimate competitor. The ultimate warrior at that moment. And that was the
turning point of the game.  
  
Then there was a point in the game when J.D. was out of the game and said a
few words and I knew it was time for him to go back in the game and he turned
it around, too. But that was the turning point. He wasn't going to let us lose
today or at least make us aware of how bad we were playing.  
  
Q. It seemed like there was a little looser feeling on the sideline even
when you were down than maybe a lot of teams see. Even when San Diego State
was off to that great start, Gian and you looked at each other and just kind
of smiled and you started rolling, got looser and got back in your rhythm
then. Did you have that sense, is that just because this team has been able to
come back so much?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: He took about a 58-footer and, you know, almost broke my
foot, because it missed the rim so bad. Any shot he takes is not bad, but I
just kind of looked at him and said, Really, dude? And he just kind of laughed
at me.  
  
It's just an enjoyable group. I don't think that's nearly talked about enough.
I've had a lot of enjoyable groups, but, yeah, we have quite a bond with him
and everybody else and there's not a lot of them, so it's a neat bond.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Deshon Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32891)

### [Jaron Hopkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32892)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 65 New Mexico - 60  
  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: First off I'd like to congratulate New Mexico for a good
year. Extremely well coached team. Very difficult team to play against. We've
had three really good games with them this year. A lot of respect for Tim
Williams and the career that he's had in the Mountain West conference, one of
the better scorers in Elijah Brown, who puts a lot of pressure on you.  
  
I give my guys a lot of credit for hanging tough and working the game for 40
minutes at a very high level.  
  
Q. You guys watching this run, what did you learn from that run for this
season?  
JARON HOPKINS: We took a lot from that crew last year, we knew they were a
poised group, calm and confident in situations like this. Just learning from
them and actually getting to watch Marvelle and Cezar and them guys. That was
great for us. We learned a lot from them.  
  
DESHON TAYLOR: I learned a lot from the seniors and the coaching staff, I
asked a lot of questions, stuff like that so I could do better as a player and
help this team. Those were great leaders last year, and helped us.  
  
Q. You are well aware they're a team that relies on free throws, and you
guys are a physical defense that sometimes fouls a lot. 15 free throw attempts
by them in the first half, all your bigs in foul trouble, one even fouls out.
And yet they only get 7 free throw attempts in that half. What did your guards
do, if anything, to help the bigs stay out of foul trouble down the stretch
and keep them off the line down the stretch?  
JARON HOPKINS: I would say just ball pressure on the perimeter. It helps our
big guys down low, especially when they have to guard Tim Williams or Aget
down low, at the perimeter it's hard to post, you don't have to worry about
fouling something like that.  
  
DESHON TAYLOR: I say our defense picked up, guarding ball screens. We let
their guards get to the paint a lot and that drew a lot of fouls. We have to
focus in on that aspect.  
  
Q. That late three that you hit that tied the game, was that a shot you
were going to take no matter what? Did you decide to shoot that before you
went through your ball handling there?  
DESHON TAYLOR: No, not really. I had to shoot it.  
  
Q. Were you confident that was going to go in?  
DESHON TAYLOR: Yeah.  
  
Q. What were you seeing on that final play when you passed to Cullen
there for the dunk, did you see him coming open or was that planned in
advance?  
JARON HOPKINS: No, I think I got a steal on that possession. I was trying to
get the ball past half court, so we could kill the clock a little bit. But I
seen a man open so I gave it to him and he finished the play, so that was good
for us.  
  
Q. The success you've had against Nevada this season, how valuable is
that going into tomorrow?  
JARON HOPKINS: Very valuable. We got out and made the right plays toward the
end of the game. Hopefully we can continue on and make those type of plays
down the stretch because we know it will be a hard-fought game.  
  
Q. Was this a typical Fresno State game lately that it was physical,
there were a lot of fouls, there were parts of it where you guys maybe weren't
scoring as much as you wanted to, but in the end you find enough plays to make
a win? Is that the recipe that you have been following lately?  
DESHON TAYLOR: Focusing on defense, that's what we've been harping on,
defensive rebounding, because they're a good offense rebounding team with Aget
and Tim Williams. So I felt our defense was really good today.  
  
Q. Obviously a very different team with Tim Williams there. You guys a
couple of weeks ago were able to really clamp down on Elijah. Tim Williams is
back, and you still had success on Elijah. First I want to ask about what you
did to keep Tim Williams in check, but how you were able with both of them to
keep Elijah in check?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: He's a great scorer, you're not going to stop him. You try
to do the job containing him. And the thing that we really tried to wall up
and not give him a second opportunity. If he missed the shot, we couldn't give
him a quick stick-back. It was going to be by committee. No one guy was going
to be in charge of doing that. And we tried to throw the kitchen sink at him.
Karachi hadn't played in three weeks. Had to dig deep.  
  
He's a very difficult matchup, and he has been the whole time he's been in
this league. We have a lot of respect for him and their program in terms of
how they play. And offensive rebounding is a big part of what they do, free
throw shooting is a lot of what they do as well, and I thought our guys
clamped down the latter part of the game.  
  
Q. How did it affect with him back, the defense on Elijah Brown who was
6 of 21?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Another player you're not going to stop. Again, you're
trying to contain. The last two ballgames we worked really hard at not trying
to foul him in the act of shooting. We were talking to our perimeter players
about walling up like we do with our big guys, and just holding your ground in
a vertical position, so we don't give him those extra opportunities at the
free throw line that he's so accustomed to getting.  
  
I thought our guys tried to stay to the game plan in doing that. We did a good
job in Fresno the last time out, and I thought we did a good job here.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, they had no free throws in the final 6:50 of the
game. And it's a team they need to get to the line to get a lot of their
offense. The last 6:50 with a guy fouled out, three other bigs with four
fouls. Did you change anything?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Actually, there was a lot of dialogue on the bench whether
or not they have a change-up defense, whether to go to the zone, protect some
guys, or try to stay who we are and finish this thing in terms of defensively,
man to man. We decided we're going to do a better ball on our ball screen
defense, we change our ball screen coverage. I thought we did a better job.
And the guys were trying to get their hands back and play without fouling.  
  
We're an aggressive, defensive team, but on the contrary, we led the league in
free throws attempts ourselves. We shot a lot of free throws, and we made the
third most. So I like the balance between the two of those in terms of us
being an aggressive defensive team. But we also found ways to put fouls on
other teams, as well. Tonight we did a really good job at the foul line, as
well.  
  
Q. What did you say to your team so they didn't get over-frustrated or
lose their head, when all the fouls were being called and you had almost half
the team with three or four fouls early?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: We have a veteran officiating crew out here, they've been
calling NCAA tournaments for a long time. Keep working the game, keep your
composure, keep playing, and don't worry about calls. You just play the game.
These guys, they'll do their job, they're high-level guys, and keep working
the game.  
  
And we've done that over the last month of the season, really. But we hadn't
let, whether the team was on the run, whether we had some empty possessions,
we haven't let that get to us to where we couldn't execute where we needed to
execute in terms of trying to get a stop or trying to execute offensively.  
  
Q. How did the run last season influence what you're doing this season
and what are the similarities there?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Well, we've predicated everything over the last month of
the season of working hard defensively. And you win games this time of year
with your defense. I thought our guys the last month of the season really
tried to make a really good effort to be a better defensive team.  
  
And Coach Wainwright and my staff, they've done a great job with preparation
all year. But I think our guys have really bought into it in terms of
executing our defensive plan, ball screen defense, we've got to keep guys off
the glass, and our guards got to help us rebound.  
  
But they bought into the defense, and that helps you advance this time of
year. And we haven't looked back from that point. We've done a pretty good job
of playing against some really good offensive teams and doing a good job of
holding the field goal percentages down and trying to play without fouling
them. They've done a good job of that down the stretch.  
  
Q. You guys obviously get Nevada next, and obviously they've been a
difficult team all season. You guys had some success against them. What brings
out the best in your team and how much confidence do you have going into it?  
COACH RODNEY TERRY: Very difficult matchup. I've got a lot of respect for
their program. A lot of respect for their coach and how hard they play and how
well they execute what they do. They've got five starters out there as good as
anybody in the country. And they put a lot of pressure on you defensively,
because they can score at every position. You talk about Caroline, the big
fellow inside, Marshall can score. They put a lot of pressure on your
defensively, they caused a lot of fits in this league this year, and
rightfully so, they won our league. A lot of respect for them.  
  
We've got to come out and play a game where we defend hard without fouling,
and again, trying to play for 40 minutes. And it's going to be a big task for
us, but we're excited about the opportunity to play our best team in our
league under these circumstances.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Leon Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23356)

### [Paris Austin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32927)

### [Nick Duncan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28538)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 87 Boise State - 68  
  
COACH LEON RICE: I thought San Diego State did a great job. They were terrific
on both ends of the floor and pounded us on the glass.  
  
Q. Obviously the matchup with San Diego State, they're probably not a
typical 6th seed. Coach Rice mentioned the glass. How big were some of the
second chances they were getting on the glass and how big was that in the
game?  
NICK DUNCAN: Yeah, it was pivotal for us to come into this game and block out
and get our defensive boards. And obviously they're a very athletic team. And
they just came in and played harder than us. Yeah, when they get 30 offensive
boards and 24 second-chance points, I mean you can't win those games like
that.  
  
Q. They came in shooting 31 percent for three, and go nine for 13. Was
your defense, were they just one of those nights for them or how do you look
at their outside shooting?  
NICK DUNCAN: They hit shots. That's all that matters.  
  
Q. In that last game against Air Force you had 23 assists, you were
getting a lot of really good looks. Tonight you did make I think it was nine
3's, but only 10 assists. What was different about the offense tonight?  
NICK DUNCAN: They're a good defensive team. They're a completely different
team to Air Force. I thought we could have done a better job of kicking the
ball out a little bit. And we got our shot blocked about ten times. And they
created momentum. A little different team. You can't compare the games at all.
We had our chances there, but they were the better team tonight.  
  
Q. How disappointing, the momentum you came in this game with, to
lose?  
PARIS AUSTIN: It was very disappointing. I think all of us take pride in
winning basketball games. And it always hurts to have a loss. But this one
hurt a lot.  
  
Q. At one point in time in the game you were up 39-29. And kind of
curious, what was the turning point in this game did you feel?  
NICK DUNCAN: I can't even remember. That run was pretty pivotal for them. We
didn't respond well then. Didn't really turn the corner after they made a run
and they kept going. We came out at halftime and we tried to come out, but
they just kept pressing. And that was it.  
  
Q. Obviously Malik didn't play in that first game with you guys. I think
he was averaging 11-ish points a game. Has a career high with 22 today.
Hoetzel's averaging 7 and he scores 21. How frustrating is it that this game
they have their nights?  
NICK DUNCAN: I mean, they're great players. Malik's probably one of the best
gifted athletes in the conference. He showed that and he came out and played
harder than us. 22 points, and Max hit threes. We left him open, that helped
them out a fair bit. But they're great players, and they turned up tonight and
did what they do, and Max is a three-point shooter and he made 24 out of 26,
and we couldn't -- that's what we do, and credit to them.  
  
Q. Nick, this is your guys last guaranteed game, obviously. Just kind of
curious, how hopeful are you that you get at least one more?  
NICK DUNCAN: It would be great to get one more. See the blue and orange. Love
the coaching staff and all the players I played with. Sad to go out like this.
I thought this was a pretty special group. We worked so hard, being such a
young group. And obviously picked 7th and 5th, and doubted all year. We've got
some special guys on the team that can change the Boise State program and
change the culture, and that's what we've done this year, and it's only the
beginning, I think. I firmly believe that this team will be back next year.
And these games are getting better.  
  
I love my school. I always will. Hopefully I can get one more, wherever that
is. But I just love everybody at the Boise State community.  
  
Q. I know sometimes it does come down to the players, if you guys want
to play in one of those tournaments. Do you think this is different in years
past, do you think there's a chance you would want to go out and play a couple
more together, and take a run at some sort of championship?  
NICK DUNCAN: No doubt. This is probably one of the closest teams I've ever
been on, in terms of cohesion, loving each other, always sacrificing for each
other. Yeah, I bet every single one of us would want to play an extra game
with each other. It's a sad way to go out and truly believe we could have done
it this year. It's possible someone is going to win, someone is going to lose.
I'm sure every single one of us would want to play one more game with each
other.  
  
COACH LEON RICE: I've got to say, he knows how I feel about these seniors. And
he knows I don't want to talk about it. And it was a tough way to go out. I'm
really proud of these guys. And then he just handles all the questions, and
does it all for us. Just shows you why this team won games.  
  
Don't mean to break down up here, but these guys are amazing. And no matter
what circumstances they face they're always amazing. They step up for me when
I don't want to be up here talking about it, because it was a tough way to end
the season. And just it's a group I'm really, really proud of that I coached.
And you can see why. Apologize for breaking down, but this is a special group
led by some pretty amazing guys, these seniors. So I just want to say thank
you to them and how much they mean to me and this program. So thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [Hayden Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28478)

### [Zach Kocur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28479)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 81 Air Force - 55  
  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: First of all, congratulations to Colorado State. What a
fine game they played. And a really, really good team. And I think all year
people have asked, and even sitting back there, you only have seven players.
If you have the right seven it's not bad. And I think they have the right 7.
They're talented, and athletic.  
  
Never more proud of our team having the opportunity to do what they did last
night and the energy and excitement they put through our program and to
represent the Academy and have the opportunity to play. Tonight they were a
little better than us, and hats off to them, and we're excited to move on.  
  
Q. The way yesterday's start went and tonight you passed into the
interior and it goes to the basket. Did you feel that maybe some of that
fortune was going to carry over the way things started?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: A little bit. We started off the game well, it's not like we
came out flat by any means. We had energy, enthusiasm. The ball was going in
the basket. The stops weren't as prominent as yesterday. We couldn't string
together as many stops. We were there, ready to go. And after halftime we kind
of opened up quite a bit. Could never recover from that.  
  
Q. When Clavell gets hot like that, some of the shots were contested or
leaning back, is there just really nothing you can do when a guy like that
gets hot?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: He's Player of the Year for a reason. The dude can score.
There's not a bad shot for him, really. He's done it to every team in the
conference, it's not like he just lit us up. He's a great player, and he finds
a way to get his, and he's an energetic guy, you can tell when you're playing
on the floor with him.  
  
Q. Zach, did you feel like this was a game where everything had to go
right, just given the matchup with CSU, is that kind of the mentality in this
game?  
ZACH KOCUR: I don't think so. I don't think -- I think we could have still
came out with a W with some mistakes in there. But definitely they're such a
good team that we got to take care of the ball. It was a big thing that we
didn't do as well as we should have early. But I think for some reason it just
wasn't there. Tip your hats off to them. They played great. I think if we
could have limited some of our mistakes, but I don't think we needed to play a
perfect game in order to beat them.  
  
Q. You wrap up a tough season. Any thoughts now you take with you into
the off season after your career is over?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: There's an extremely bright future for Air Force basketball.
There's some talent on this team that maybe hadn't been around Air Force
before. And you can see glimpses of it from certain people. And for Scottie,
he plays a lot, and he's going to have a great future here at Air Force. I'm
excited to follow it, see it. I'll be around the program next year, because
I'll be down at the prep school and still at the Academy. I got these guys to
get to points that haven't been reached before. Ask and everybody believes in
them.  
  
ZACH KOCUR: It's been a great four years. I know we are haven't won as much as
we would have liked, but we've been blessed with great coaches, Coach P, we've
been fortunate having them around, getting us better every day. The guys are
also close. Because of that I think they're going to have a bright future.  
  
Q. There was about seven minutes at the end of the first half that you
guys didn't score. Did you just run out of gas?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: You know, there was -- their defense caused that. I
think we were up 24-23 at one moment. And then they go on a 16-2 run, and they
were -- we had some open looks we didn't make. And they converted on the other
end, obviously. We didn't get second-opportunity chances. Their size and their
athleticism bothered us during that stretch. And that was obviously the factor
of the game.  
  
Q. Does it cause more tension when you're not getting second chances?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: Puts more pressure on the first looks. We did have some
good shots from good people. It didn't fall. And on the other end, we
contested a couple of Gian's shot. I think one he was in Reno and made. He
made some shots. He's talented. I told him when I walked in here, he was
walking out, 30 years of coaching basketball and being around, he's one of the
best competitors I've ever seen. Scouting and seeing all the games through the
year, Gian Clavell coaches that team. And he makes sure players are in the
right place. And his effort and competitiveness is unmatched. He's really on.  
  
Q. What kind of taste is it going to leave to have come here and won a
game?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: We talked briefly, because we'll address this next
week. Yesterday was fun. Yesterday was really good. Yesterday we did things
that I don't think people thought we could do, and beat a very good Wyoming
team. And the way we did it from the beginning to the end is really something.
That's what we'll remember, that's what we'll look upon when we look back at
the season.  
  
Tonight is for our returning players to see. We have to get better and more
evenly compared to the team on the other bench, as far as size and strength
and competitiveness, and we can do that. I like what we have coming back. We
have to ratchet it up a notch and now we see what we need to do and where we
need to go. And I think we'll be able to move forward with that.  
  
Q. Give those freshmen six minutes.  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: No question. They have a taste of Mountain West
Conference Tournament action in the quarterfinals. Now the next step is to
play in the semifinals.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Craig Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19479)

### [Tim Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30551)

### [Elijah Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30552)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 65 New Mexico - 60  
  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: Well, I thought you saw two really good teams play a hard-
fought game. We're up one, the last media timeout with 3:39, I think. And they
made three big 3's. And we kind of played the clock for one possession, and I
think it was 14 left on the clock and we missed a rebound.  
  
I'm proud of our kids. I've had a great time coaching them, fun time coaching
them. We've had some ups, we've had some downs. We had a lot of fun. We had
some adversity. But these two guys next to me had a heck of years, and our
team had a good year. I was proud of the way they competed today. We didn't
shoot free throws like we've been shooting all year. We missed ten. And that
includes three front ends, would have gave us three more.  
  
So it's just one of those things. I thought we did a nice job. We kept them
off the boards, which we wanted to do, but they got one big rebound that we
didn't need them to get. They had 17 points off of turnovers. We played pretty
good the first half without turning the ball over, we just couldn't get any
shots to go. We asked a lot from Elijah and Tim. And Tim coming back from an
injury for a month, it's very difficult. I went with my two guys, they played
hard and played well, and just came up short.  
  
Q. The flagrant foul that was called in the first half, can you give us
your explanation of what happened on that play and what did the officials tell
you?  
ELIJAH BROWN: He was running back, I was running back, and we just got caught
up. That's pretty much all it was to it. They told me the same they told you
guys.  
  
Q. The five of eight, not the worse free throw shooting night. But
looked like you were holding the hand. Was that affecting the free throws?  
TIM WILLIAMS: No, I'm not going to blame it on that. I made two after that. So
it wasn't a problem.  
  
Q. You're obviously a guy that just missed a month, I know you came back
Saturday, second game back. Were you rusty tonight, were you winded?  
TIM WILLIAMS: No, I think I was just rushing my shots a little bit and trying
to draw fouls instead of just trying to focus on making the shots.  
  
Q. I know you had mentioned you obviously want to end this with an NCAA
tournament appearance, five years in college, two with another school, two
here. That's not going to happen now. Do you still want this season to
continue in any tournament or are you looking at what just happened as the end
of a college career for you?  
TIM WILLIAMS: We'll figure that out later. But we're not going to the NCAA
tournament, so that's always a bummer.  
  
Q. When you aren't able to connect on the free throw shots, how much
does that hurt your overall offense and your ability to score?  
TIM WILLIAMS: I think we win the majority of our games shooting 75-plus from
the line and getting to the line 25 times a game. And we just didn't do that
tonight.  
  
Q. How much did it contribute to the offense and how tough it is when
you come up short in that category?  
ELIJAH BROWN: I mean sometimes the ball goes in, sometimes it doesn't. There
are things we could have done to win the game. There have been times we missed
free throws and still won the game, so I don't know.  
  
Q. The emotions here are probably still pretty fresh for you just coming
off the loss. Have you thought about next year if you're coming back?  
ELIJAH BROWN: It's a long way away. I haven't thought about that for one
second. Still trying to get over this.  
  
Q. When they're hitting some of those long-range 3's, is there anything
you can do to defend at that point?  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: They hit some tough shots. I think the biggest thing is they
have two guys that can shoot the ball really well. And when it's late clock,
the thing that we talked about, you've got to make them put it on the floor. I
think we let them shoot some shots because they were way far out. And I think
our guys didn't know if they could make them. They hit three big ones in that
three-minute span that gave them nine points and that hurt us.  
  
Q. You're a guy that's gone to the free throw line your entire career.
You got there plenty. The last couple weeks of the season you weren't getting
there as much. Tonight you didn't get there very much either. Did you change
something? Was something being called differently or the team is changing?
What was the difference the last couple of weeks that wasn't there the first
two years, almost two full seasons for you?  
ELIJAH BROWN: I've got to do a better job going strong to the rim. I've gotten
a little bit better, but I still have a long way to go looking for the foul on
my jump shot. And sometimes I just wasn't getting those calls. I don't know. I
just wasn't able to get to the free throw line. And I think I did a little bit
too much settling, when I'm not making shots I need to be able to get to the
rim.  
  
My percentage has been horrendous almost the whole year. So the fact that I
wasn't able to get to the free throw line, I would say I settled too much, I
didn't make adjustments.  
  
Q. This season you guys were sort of pointing toward this year as the
year to make a run, return to maybe Mountain West championship type form. It
didn't happen. I want to ask both of you what maybe went wrong this year and
what you are going to remember from this year?  
TIM WILLIAMS: I think definitely me getting hurt was a shot in the foot to our
team. I think we were still at the top of the Mountain West in the hunt before
I went down. And we let a few games slip away during that span, and even when
I was playing, we let some go, as well. If we want to be a championship team,
we have to win those type of games.  
  
ELIJAH BROWN: I think we could have done -- when Tim went down, that really
hurt us. But things like that happen. I don't think we did a great job of
stepping up and covering for him while he was down. Most of the games that we
lost we were in, we just let them go. It's just tough. But as far as what I
remember from this season, it was a great season with my brothers. I love
these guys for the rest of my life. And we still feel like we're a really good
team. It just didn't happen for us today.  
  
Q. You just alluded to your shooting percentage the last few games. Was
there ever frustration? Did you feel like you had to do maybe -- I don't know
if too much is the right way to say it, or was it a simply the shots didn't
fall the last few weeks?  
ELIJAH BROWN: I just wasn't mentally strong enough to shoot the same shot I
shoot in the gym every day when no one is guarding me. They weren't hard
shots, I just missed way too many. And I hurt my team going down the stretch,
I hurt my team today. I've got no excuses for that. I've got to get better.
It's not going to happen again.  
  
Q. Was there a particular point that you saw a momentum shift to kind of
get away from that, you led for more than a half hour of game time?  
TIM WILLIAMS: No, I wouldn't say the momentum shifted, even when they were up
three. It was a rebound I missed and they got it. And that was basically the
game right there.  
  
ELIJAH BROWN: I feel the same way. I don't really feel like -- I feel like, if
anything, we had the momentum. Our fans are great. And they were behind us the
whole game. We had a crazy amount of fans in there. If anything, we had the
momentum, we just weren't able to close it down and finish the game down the
stretch.  
  
Q. You had a technical foul in the first half, Elijah had a flagrant
foul, Sam had a double technical call. Are those signs of a team that was
pressing too much or flustered?  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: I think it's a sign of a team that wants to win, that's
competing. I just don't know -- I've watched a lot of games this year, and
I've got two very unusual technicals, and that was one of them. And I can
understand -- I didn't really see Elijah's play, because we didn't get to see
it on the monitor. I didn't see it, so I don't know what the play was. I just
know they say he tripped him. That's all I know.  
  
And Sam and Williams was jawing back and forth and they said they were going
to clean that up, and they did. So it's just one of those things that happens.  
  
And I think it's a competitive edge. I don't think any of those affected the
outcome of the game. We're up one with three minutes to go and we weren't able
to close it out.  
  
Q. This was a game that free throws, you get 15 attempts in the first
half, 7 in the second half, and not one in the final 6:50. Was that something
you guys failed down the stretch at doing something or did they --  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: You'd have to watch the tape on that. I'll just leave it at
that. I think there was several times that we could have went to the line but
we didn't. And that's just part of the game. And that's what happens.  
  
But when we shoot 50 percent from the foul line and we give up 17 points on
turnovers, we're going to struggle. But we couldn't get separated. We're up
three. We're up one. We're up three. We're up three, we have two possessions,
we go up five. We turn it over, take a bad shot. We just couldn't get away
from them. And then they made three huge shots in the last three minutes.  
  
And it was interesting because we made a nice play, Elijah hits a 3, we go
down, we decide we're going to wait. We're looking at a 14-15 second
difference. If we get that rebound we can push it and try to get another
three. It just didn't work out for us. I thought the kids played extremely
hard. I just think we had a hard time making some shots tonight. And you've
got to give them credit. They played well. It was a very competitive game.  
  
Q. Obviously they've been playing good going into this. And you're
feeling pretty good about your team going into this. But this is your third
straight year of one and done in this tournament. At a place like New Mexico
that you talk about a lot having a certain expectation of championships, three
years of being one and done is not what the fan base expects, and you're well
aware of that.  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: I'm not oblivious to it. I've been a part when we won three
in a row too. I thought our younger kids really competed. We appreciate all
the support. We're grateful for all the support, the fans that came out. I
think they were proud of the way our kids played and how hard they played. It
was difficult.  
  
But I like where the program is. I like the young players we have. I like who
we've signed. We've got some stuff we've got to figure out. We don't know
exactly what Elijah is going to do. But I like where we are. We could have
very easily won that game. But we didn't. It went down the stretch and they
made plays.  
  
I thought our guys handled adversity as good as we've done since I've been
here, with all the injuries. We haven't had near the injuries in the years
past, except for the year we went 15-17, with Cullen being hurt, Alex Kirk
going to the draft. Jordan Goodman being hurt. That was a unique year, but not
as many as this year. With our team to go 3 and 4 in February, with arguably
the best player in the league defensively rebounding and scoring, that was a
huge loss for us, especially when your team's set up for him to be one of the
main cogs in that team.  
  
Q. Elijah alluded to it, was he asked to do too much because there was
so much question of where you're getting points this year?  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: Well, I just think that's the competitive kid in him. He's
going to take the heat. He's not going to blame it on anything else. He's not
going to blame it on the shots he had to take, the pressure he had to take,
the expectations on him. He's just not going to do that. He doesn't have it in
him.  
  
So I thought he had a good year. I thought he had -- he's second in the league
in scoring. He's six rebounds a game, three assists a game. If you look at
that over the years, that's a pretty dang good year. And I don't know if he
didn't get the recognition he deserved. But he made Second Team Coaches and
Second Team Media. I think he did everything.  
  
But I'm going to protect him because I'm his coach. I honestly think that the
month off with his hamstring, I don't think he's ever been fully healthy.
That's just me. I don't know that. He's going to tell you that he's fine. But
I know him and watching him over the years for a really long time, that injury
had a big effect on him.  
  
Q. You're down three, they get the offensive rebound at about 44
seconds.  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: We waited -- we were going to extend the game, but then it
goes to five. And then it goes to five. So they got that offensive rebound and
I still thought we had 14 or 15 and we could get a play off. And we're pretty
good at getting plays off 3s. He got a wide-open 3. So I was pretty confident
he'd get another one.  
  
Did I think about it? Yeah. But you think about it and then you don't want to
foul because you go to five and you try to extend it and then you really run
out of time. You run out of time. I just thought we could get another
defensive stop. I think there was a time right before the three-minute or 3:39
media time. I think we had nine stops in a row. We were playing excellent
defense. The two things that I thought were going to hurt us, three-point
shooting and offensive rebounds kind of got us in the last few minutes.  
  
Q. Looking at the season, with the exception of late January where you
had the four-game winning streaks, there's a lot of wins followed by a lot of
losses. Not a lot of continuity. What is going to be your reflection when you
look back as far as the team overall?  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: I think the one thing that's unique about our team is we had
to adjust on the fly. I think when Xavier Adams went out the second game of
the season and an ACL tear, and then Tim Williams went out, then you throw
that out the window. And then you try to figure out how you're going to play
and how you're going to win. And we lost some in February -- we lost those
three in a row, and beat San Diego State at home.  
  
But the thing I'll take most, these kids never gave up. They went through some
serious adversity. Some people questioned them. I thought they really hung
together as a group. I'll take this year -- I had a lot of fun. I really had a
lot of fun. I wish we would have won more games, which we all do. But we had
some adversity that we weren't expecting. But I've got to give my kids the
credit, they played hard and stayed the course and gave everything they had.  
  
I think the biggest thing you can do as a coach is for your kids to play hard
and compete every night, that's a good sign. I just think -- they're hurting
right now. And I understand that because some had great careers. But it's
difficult. But I think -- I'll take away that my kids continued to play every
game and really competed at a high level.  
  
Q. Tim talked about coming up short in the NCAA tournament. Can you
speak to how much and how valuable he's been to the program since he's been
here?  
COACH CRAIG NEAL: I think the unique thing about Tim Williams is when we got
him as a transfer, he was -- we knew he was a really good player. We didn't
know what a great kid that we got in the transfer. He's an amazing kid. He's
an amazing teammate. He's a unique player.  
  
I think there are some things that Tim does on the floor that you can't teach.
He's got a great knack for scoring the ball. I think tonight like he rushed it
a little bit. And being out a month, we probably expected too much from him.
Not only me, his teammates, and I'm sure a lot of his supporters. I think we
expected him just to go in a phone booth and put on a cape and he was going to
be back to Tim Williams. And that's very difficult. That's very difficult.  
  
And to his credit he gave everything he had. He played at a high level coming
back after a month, not a lot of practices. But he's just a unique kid. He's
very talented. If he doesn't get hurt in February, he probably would be the
only kid we ever had with 2000 points in his career, that's ever played at our
place.  
  
So that says a lot about his rebounding. But he's going to be able to play
after this. And that's one thing that I wish we were going to play three more
games or even another game. But I enjoyed coaching him. He's a special kid. We
were very lucky to get him in a transfer deal. He had a great career for us.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

### [Cameron Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30556)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 83 Utah State - 69  
  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought our guys did a really good job to start the
game. The execution on our offensive script, you know, to get the lead or the
cushion that we got. And then obviously we have to give Utah State a lot of
credit for their run that they came right back at us.  
  
But I thought our bench gave us a huge lift when Jordan and D.J. got two
fouls. We stuck to our rule that we've had all year, two fouls and you sit in
the first half. And Leland and Josh Hall came in and gave us great energy and
effort off the bench. And the positive, really glad the game is over, they
were both in foul trouble, they got a little more resting. I probably wouldn't
have rested them like that, so thanks for the foul trouble, Jordan.  
  
Q. You got in some foul trouble in the first half. Did that make you
want to be more aggressive in the second half? Seemed like you dominated the
second half.  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Not necessarily. I just wanted to just help us win any way I
could. And I tried to give us a spark. Because I was on the bench, I wanted to
come out like Josh and Leland did for us, I didn't want us to fall off just
because I was back in, especially being out for so long.  
  
Q. In the postseason play, you've played nine postseason games, is this
the moment that you kind of crave all season and why does it bring the best
out in you?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I crave the first game every season. I think postseason, this
is crunch time. This is crunch time. Anything can happen in tournaments. The 8
seed, 1 seed. That's tough, anything can happen. I think coming out aggressive
and really keying in for everything is going to help us win.  
  
Q. It seems like the last three weeks you guys have really picked it up
another gear. Was it the San Diego State game that really was sort of the
turnaround, losing that one and that kicked you into gear?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We have such great respect for San Diego State, it's a
really difficult place to play, and they did a great job defending us. And we
think that we understood after that loss that we didn't have much room for
error. And just our practices and the commitment that the guys have shown,
whether it be in film sessions or them still getting reps up late at night on
their own. There's been a full, total commitment, a hundred percent. And we
haven't dropped off.  
  
If you were around our team you would think that it's the first week of the
season. That's how focused they've been. People have talked about would we be
able to sustain, because of scholarship guys, and our guys have done a
phenomenal job all season long. We feel just like last year we continue to get
stronger as the season goes on.  
  
Q. You guys have been playing just such great basketball the last few
weeks. Seemed to really be improving. But it looks like you're having a blast
doing it. How much fun are you having competing as players?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: You know, it's a great thing, especially playing with guys
like Cam, play with the same intensity you do. And he's also a star
defensively. He's always there to block shots. And he's a great presence to
have.  
  
CAMERON OLIVER: I just think we all know what we're capable of as a team, as a
brother. So when you see Jordan getting aggressive in rebounds, D.J. hitting
shots, everybody doing their thing, it's just fun. You've got to have fun
playing basketball. And seeing everybody do what we all know we're capable of,
it's just a fun feeling.  
  
Q. What do you think about the effort off the bench from Josh and Leland
tonight?  
CAMERON OLIVER: It was great. It was phenomenal. We needed it. Coach Muss
always talk about how we need bench productivity. And they brought it. And we
all know what Josh and Leland are capable of doing. It's about time for them
to get the shot to do it.  
  
Q. When you're going to the bench, head down, big game, to see these
guys come in and extend the lead, pretty good to see the bench playing like
that?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Yeah, like Cam said, we know what they can do. We've seen it
every day in practice, we know what they're capable of. That's really not a
surprise for me, I've seen Leland hit threes and Josh get guys open. I know
what they're capable of and I expect nothing less.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to the next game, what do you see as potential
matchups, pitfalls, looking ahead?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We're going to watch the game as a team and probably be
able to answer that better in two hours. Both teams are really, really good
teams. Both teams are well coached. Both teams have star power on their
roster. So, again, right now we'll go out as a team and we'll watch them and
we'll meet as a staff real quick, and then we'll get together with the guys
and do some film study and then practice tomorrow and get ready for whoever we
may play.  
  
Q. Just a quick comment on Jalen Moore from Utah State, I thought he was
the one of the most unique weapons in this league. Was he one of the tougher
guys you've gone up against this year?  
CAMERON OLIVER: He's a tough guy to play. Kind of hard to play against
somebody that matches the same athleticism as you. And he's capable of
shooting the ball. Kevin Durant would be a comparison. He actually dunked on
me, too. But it's all good. He's a good player. And we tried our best to keep
him out of his points, but he is just a talented player.  
  
Q. It seemed like the front court was the deciding factor in the two
regular season games. They were plus-14 on the glass in the game they won, you
guys were plus-16 on the glass in the game you won. Did you feel like whoever
won the front court battle in this game was going to win ultimately?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Yeah, that was one of our emphasis going into the game was to
win the rebound battle. We took it upon ourselves to go out and get the
rebounds and take care of business.  
  
Q. Jalen Moore, what's your take on him as a kid who obviously has
expressed interest in playing at the next level? What are your thoughts on
him?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think that Jalen is -- he's a hard cover. Obviously at
the collegiate level he plays the four and the three. And his position at the
next level, whether it be NBA, D-League or Europe, will be at the 3 spot. He
possesses unique skill set because he can post up, play with his back to the
basket. He can shoot the three ball. And he can take guys off the bounce. And
he's got great length. So he's probably a guy that's going to end up going to
some place like Portsmouth, and will have to prove himself.  
  
But he is a guy that at the collegiate level is a really, really, really tough
cover. And it's hard to play at the next level, but he certainly has the
ability if things fall into place for him, the right situation, right time and
all those type of things.  
  
Q. Cam and Jordan scored 12 of your first 14 points. To me they were the
decisive factor in the game.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought they did a great job. We wanted to go inside a
little bit more than be too perimeter oriented tonight. And again, I just
thought that the offensive script that we laid out for them, I don't think
that we have executed like that out of the gate where the ball moved and we
cut so hard and we had great screens where we actually went and made contact
with people and got people open. I thought that first four minutes was
phenomenal.  
  
It was a quiet locker room. It's been a unique situation pregame for about two
weeks now where I go back in the coach's room and worry about if they're ready
to play. And they have a quiet confidence right now about themselves and a
really business approach pregame. And I thought that showed to start the game.  
  
Q. Having to win three games in three days for a short bench, tough for
anybody. How do you think playing in the Great Alaska Shootout and even in the
back-to-back tournament here in Vegas has helped the team get ready for an
environment like that?  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think our guys, the difference is 25 years ago, 30
years ago, whatever, people weren't used to playing back-to-back-to-back. But
these guys have been playing AAU ball, and they've been doing it their whole
lives. I think they're used to it.  
  
Obviously what we did in Alaska helps prepare, playing in the other tournament
here in Vegas helps. And right now we've got one game to worry about and
that's tomorrow night. And it's important for these guys to get their rest and
eat properly and turn their lights and TVs and cell phones off as early as
possible tonight to sleep and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about being the No. 1 seed. The tournament on your
back. The 1 seed hasn't performed too well the past few years in this
tournament. Talk about the pressures involved with that.  
COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We don't really feel there's pressure. We're no
different than any other team. If you look on the bracket it has a No. 1 next
to it. But it's meaningless. Everybody has the same chance, and we all got on
the airplane and showed up here on Tuesday, everybody in the Mountain West had
equal opportunity.  
  
It's the third season. And we talked to our guys at the beginning of the year,
how it was three years in college basketball, non-conference, conference and
then conference tournament. And now some teams have gone home and there are
teams still surviving. We have so much internal pressure, even in practice,
that I think that they're used to pressure.  
  
And I'm not worried about them thinking they're the No. 1 seed because we have
such great respect for everybody in this conference. And we understand that
anybody can beat anybody on any given night. And that's been proven over and
over in this league.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Jeremy Hemsley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32925)

### [Malik Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28635)

### [Max Hoetzel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32926)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 87 Boise State - 68  
  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We played really, really good. I think that's obvious. The
first half was both teams playing exceptional offensive basketball. We
couldn't stop them consistently nor could they stop us. And we finally in the
second half got a few stops, got a little separation, played smart, found a
way to do what others were saying, Where have you been all year, make baskets.
But we did it the right way.  
  
It's obvious that Malik was a pretty hard guy to guard. And we did a good job
of finding him. Max Hoetzel had five 3's against him in the first game. He was
no secret. They knew he could shoot. He had five more tonight.  
  
We played the best we played all year, and we picked a nice time to do it.
This was a good college basketball game. And we are moving on tomorrow, play a
team that's beaten us twice.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, are you okay? What happened on that play with
your knee, are you okay?  
MALIK POPE: Yeah, I'm fine. It was real minor. Still talking with the doc.
Everything should be good. I think -- I'm not sure if it's a minor
hyperextension, but it should be good. It's nothing to be worried about for me
or my teammates or Coach Fish.  
  
Q. Did you bump knees?  
MALIK POPE: I was on acceleration to block a shot. I don't know what happened,
but something got tied up down there and it didn't work out.  
  
Q. Last night here someone was asking if you were soft. And you kind of
took offense to it a little bit. Did you carry that over tonight, because it
looked like you were playing with that comment in mind?  
MALIK POPE: I mean I wouldn't necessarily say I've been playing aggressive
just at tournament. I just feel like I've been battling with what I've been
fighting all year, which is small injuries. But I'll be fine. Little injuries
won't stop me. I'll still be aggressive. It's really what the game is to me. I
love the game.  
  
Q. You guys get the win last night, obviously in an ugly fashion.
However, you put two halves together and complete offensively. Defensively you
shut them down in the second half. Is this a relief to win be able to ugly and
to be able to put a complete game together?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: Of course we're happy to at least -- we're happy to be moving
on. I wouldn't say it's a relief. We played hard. We fought. We were down in
that first game we played and we fought back. And this game we gave them I
think five or six 3's in the first half. And I think they only got two in the
second half. It's a fight. It's not anything we really need to be relieved
about. We're basketball players and that's what we need to do. We need to
fight. Whatever the outcome is, if it's a win or loss, it's something we have
to deal with. If we do a good job of fighting and never giving up, then
everything will work out?  
  
Q. 13 of your first 15 shots came from inside the arc. Was that by
design at all?  
MAX HOETZEL: I think a common theme for us moving into March was to play
inside out. We have threats like Malik, who tonight was just clearly
unstoppable in the post. So, yeah, I think that when we get the ball into him
it was just clear that he could just play aggressively on his man. And if
somebody collapsed he could go down and kick it to one of our shooters. I
wouldn't say it was by design, it's just how it happened.  
  
Q. Max, that was a career high. Did you sense that coming? You had a
lull. Was there anything that gave you an indication that this game was on its
way?  
MAX HOETZEL: No, but what I'll tell you before this game, I'm sure any of our
teammates or Coach will tell you, there was a collective energy and vibe that
everybody was ready to go. It was a great feeling, it was something I've never
felt all year. And I'm just hoping we can carry that into the next few games.  
  
Q. How much do you guys want this other shot at Colorado State given how
the two games turned out earlier this year?  
MALIK POPE: Oh, very bad, come on. Buzzer beaters for both games. We've kind
of been itching to play them. We're going to come out with an aggressive
strategy, I'm pretty sure, and leave it all out on the court, basically.  
  
Q. Everyone who played in today's ballgame scored a basket. What does
that say about the team's depth?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We've got good players, so does Boise. We're unafraid to
go to the bench. And when we go to the bench we expect somebody to come in and
give us a lift. That happened last night with D'Erryl Williams. We're not here
tonight without D'Erryl's play last night. Forget about points.  
  
And tonight Zylan Cheatham has been a starter. He played great. Max Hoetzel
has been a starter. He had a career night point-wise.  
  
We've got a team that's capable. We've got a team that competes. And tonight
we made baskets, and we're all there. We've not been a team that's made
baskets with regularity this season. Tonight we did. It didn't stop at
halftime.  
  
Part of that, I think, was we made a conscious effort to make an extra pass,
don't shoot hard shots. We took 14 3's against them and made nine. And 14 of
them -- 12 of them were wide open. And we stayed with it. So it feels good. It
feels good to play well and have success. And that's what we did tonight
against a very good team.  
  
Q. You guys disrupted First Team All Mountain West Player Hutchison, can
you talk about Dakarai's effort on him defensively?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Dakarai Allen is a delight to coach. All he cares about is
winning. In his career we've called one play for him and he's never batted an
eye. All he wants to do is find a way to win. He can guard. He takes great
pride in that. Chandler Hutchison is a terrific player, he's a hard guy to
guard. Dakarai stayed in front of him.  
  
But it was a collective effort. Dakarai was not on him to start the game. We
had -- we were worried about Reid shooting the three. So we started Dakarai on
Reid. So I think it was a good team effort. Dakarai had him quite a bit. But
we had a lot of guys conscious of, Where is he, don't let him drive it to the
rim. Make him take hard 2's.  
  
Q. Malik said his knee is nothing, it's a minor thing. Then he also said
hyperextension, which is usually not a minor thing. Do you have a sense of
what it is and what his status will be for tomorrow?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I have no idea. Obviously I'm concerned. Everybody is.
When you have a guy that has had a lot of missed time because of injuries and
he hobbles off, you're worried. So rather than speculate on it, we'll wait and
see. Hopefully he will be able to play. But I don't know anything more than
what you do, to be honest with you. I've not talked to our doctors. I'll find
out more a little bit later.  
  
Q. How do you see the matchup going with Colorado State given the kind
of games you've had with them twice this year already, going right to the
wire? What do you think is going to be the key to this one?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: See if we can play a 39-minute and 49-second game and
we'll be okay. They're good. They're well coached. Larry Eustachy has done a
magnificent job with that team. They're shorthanded. They play with an edge.
They play with a leader in Clavell that brings energy to the whole group. And
we're smart enough to know we're going to have to play and play for 40
minutes. The two games won't have any significance on what happens tomorrow.
They are as determined as we are to be playing on Saturday. So hopefully we'll
play well. And we'll see what happens. But we're playing a really good team.

## March 9, 2017

### [Prentiss Nixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32912)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 81 Air Force - 55  
  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, I was really proud of our guys. We got here and we
were a little loose and yesterday we really got focused I thought. And they
were really listening to what I had to say, understanding what Air Force had
done to Wyoming.  
  
So I give these guys a ton of credit right here for being ahead of their years
as far as maturity and really locking in in a place that can be distracting,
and not be distracted. And Air Force, they showed what they could do yesterday
going on 25-0 run. For us to do that to that team was very impressive in my
mind, it was seven guys and I'm really proud of them.  
  
Q. You got 58 points in two games against Air Force. I believe you hit
11 3's combined in those two games. What feels right when you're playing
against the Falcons?  
GIAN CLAVELL: I just -- I'm just playing my game. I'm a very confident player
so I just -- if I like it, I shoot it. He always says that. If you're open,
you like it, shoot it. They are a very defensive team, too. It's always hard
to play against them. But I don't know what to say.  
  
Q. Graham hit his first four field goals in this game, had 13 points in
the first half. He was the reason they could stay in it early. In the second
half he only had two points, those were on free throws, so you clearly shut
him down the second half. How were you able to shut him down?  
GIAN CLAVELL: It wasn't just me. It was a team effort. We switched pick and
roll handoffs. It was a team effort, the whole team. I think we were aware of
where he was at the time. We lost him at times during the first half. And it
was a team effort.  
  
Q. Was there any discussion in the locker room about how to key on him
the second half?  
GIAN CLAVELL: Play the board.  
  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: You liar. I said he's the one guy that's hurting us
(laughter).  
  
See what I've got to deal with? Give me a little credit. I'm kidding
(laughter).  
  
Q. They got off to a really strong start and you seemed to stay locked
in. Was the focus really significantly better today, like Coach said? They
made 70 percent of their shots in the first seven or eight minutes and you
were able to stay locked in and keep going and got on your own run to take
control.  
GIAN CLAVELL: He's right. Yesterday he talked to us about being focused. And
today in the locker room everybody was locked in. Air Force is a great team.
They have a great coach. Yeah, if we wanted to win this game, we had to be
locked in and focused on what we want to do.  
  
Q. Just from your perspective what was it like seeing Gian go off like
that, more points than minutes played tonight?  
PRENTISS NIXON: When he's hot, get him the ball. That's what I've learned
since I've been here. That's my job being a point guard, if someone is hot,
get him the ball in the right spots. Gian knocked them down.  
  
Q. It seemed like the harder shot, the harder the difficulty, the better
you are, more contested or fading away. What makes you so good or more
comfortable in those situations?  
GIAN CLAVELL: Honestly -- playing with my brother, since he was always taller
than me. I think that helped a little bit. I don't know, I just feel more
comfortable taking those shots.  
  
Q. You seem to be always smiling out there tonight. Are you, not in a
bad way, but are you taking things a little less serious and having fun, is
that bringing your game out?  
GIAN CLAVELL: I'm just having fun. I take everything serious, but I'm having
fun, enjoying this last year. He always says, it's a great opportunity that
you don't get a lot. I'm a happy guy, I'm always smiling.  
  
Q. What's the thought process in terms of the semifinals, is there a
team you'd rather play, or are you going to approach Boise State or San Diego
State the same way?  
GIAN CLAVELL: Whoever wins we play.  
  
Q. You guys have a much bigger goal. How do you enjoy this and yet make
sure you're focused for the semifinals, and you obviously want to be in the
title game?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: We want to be in the title game. So whatever we have to
do, that's what we're going to do. If that's being focused and being locked
in, that's what we have to do. Yeah, it's a great win, but we've got to play
tomorrow.  
  
Q. I think you're 10-0 against Air Force at CSU. What is it about this
matchup that just favors you guys so much?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, we've been fortunate in a lot of those games.
They've come down to last-minute plays. So I don't know if it's -- they're
hard to play against. They're extremely well coached. They're obviously
disciplined being in the Air Force. We've been fortunate, I think.  
  
I don't think the record indicates just how good Air Force has been in those
ten games. And we've been fortunate enough to win. But there were a couple of
games where we basically had lost and it took some special situations to come
back and win those. 10-0 is not indicative of how tough this series has been.  
  
Q. Is there a bad shot that Gian can take?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: He has a lot of freedom. And that's what we recruit to.
If you can make it, you can take it. But he discounts -- he really did a great
job of distributing the ball early. He moved the ball well, got it out of his
hands. We talked a lot about kind of the LeBron James theory, where -- LeBron
won't take a shot in the first quarter sometimes, he gets his teammates
involved. And Gian, I thought does a great job of getting his teammates
involved. And obviously late clock he's our best, and you want him shooting
it.  
  
He's been extremely coachable. He's having fun out there. That's a good
observation. He's having fun. And I'm having fun coaching him.  
  
Q. You always talk about wanting to be playing your best basketball in
March. It's March. Is this team playing its best basketball of the year right
now?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, we hadn't. You know, the last three games have
been a struggle up until today. We played as good of any team play at Colorado
State at New Mexico, then we did lose focus. The word Gian used so much. We're
lucky to get away with a win against Wyoming and San Diego State, and it
caught up with us against Nevada.  
  
That's what's neat about this team. They believe what I say. And they see it
on film. And they know that we had to get back to who we were. And I really
loved the way we played today. We played so hard. You guys saw it. We just
played so hard. When guys came out they were just totally spent. The game plan
was to switch everything and we did an excellent job of it.  
  
Q. When you see Gian out there having that much fun, what effect do you
see it having on his teammates?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, we have seven players and they all have a role.
And he wasn't the only guy having fun out there today. Everybody knows what is
expected of them. And we like to steal something from the Patriots, just do
your job. J.D. Paige does a great job of throwing the ball up to the rim for
Emmanuel. He just dribbles the ball extremely well. He's one of the better
defenders, him and Prentiss. I don't know if there's a better tandem of two
defenders of sophomores in the country.  
  
Gian is not the only one having fun. They like each other, which isn't
mandatory, but it helps. It really helps. They get along. They have each
others' back. It's obviously been an up-and-down season with a lot of events.
And I've often said people have tried to break us, but this team has not even
bent, let alone break.  
  
Q. How did a short bench, how big was it in a low-stress situation, late
in this game, to be able to rest a few of your starters moving forward?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I thought it was neat and it was good we got Juan in
there, who is icing his elbow right now, because he got three shots off in
about 30 seconds. But Willie Glover is really someone who does a great job for
us.  
  
I'm always so paranoid, with four minutes to go and you're up 30, I asked, Can
we lose this game? I've always been so worried about that until it is over.
But we did get a chance to sit Emmanuel and sit Gian. And I think it's big.  
  
But this team is built to play three straight games, all of them could play 40
minutes, being that's what they've done and they've had success at it. But it
only helps when you can -- first, when they're not in there they can't get
hurt. And second, we need all the energy we can get.  
  
Q. You guys have been to the semifinals now a bunch of times in the last
couple of years. You're there again. But you haven't gotten past that. What's
it going to take to get to the final. Are you in a position, even though you
don't have 7 guys, but no one is injured, where that hasn't been the case the
last couple of years?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, we came so close. Last year we could have really
won it had Emmanuel not been out and Dantiel gotten in foul trouble. We came
so close in spite of those things against Fresno, and then Fresno went on to
win the conference championship here.  
  
So there's just some really good teams left in this. Fresno is playing as well
as any top 40, 30 team in the country. Reno is playing just as well. The
winner of this game, both teams are playing terrific.  
  
So the only thing I want to say is they say this league is down. It's ranked
9th in the country. You take the power 5's out and we're stronger than the
WCC, according to -- maybe I could be wrong, but somebody told me this --
we're stronger than the Missouri Valley. This is a strong, strong league. It
just doesn't have your typical top 25 team in it.  
  
But from top to bottom it's as strong as it's been. Look what San Jose State
has done. Look who's beaten who. On a given night people -- anybody could have
beaten anybody, and that hasn't ever been the case since I've been here until
this year.  
  
Q. You've lost two tight games to Boise State, and won two tight games
against San Diego State. Do you feel you match up better with either of those
teams or is it kind of the same at this point?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: You know, I just walked, Coach Fisher's locker room,
accidentally, we were laughing about we hope we play each other. But both
coaches are great friends of mine. And I don't know, I think they're both a
tough matchup. They're, again, extremely well coached. They play similar.
Boise shoots it probably better. San Diego State is more athletic. But either
team is, I'm sure, the line would be whatever, would be very similar, whoever
we play.  
  
And we are more focused on ourselves. Today wasn't about Air Force, it was
about us. And I thought we did a great job of the word "focus" has been used a
lot and we were extremely focused. Now we've got to put this game behind us
today and find out who wins and prepare for them.  
  
Q. And Boise State has beat you by a combined four points, has that
gotten in your team's head at all or it doesn't really matter?  
COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: You must be in between millenniums because this new
millennium they don't -- there is no thought about those type of things.
They're more worried about is their phone charged than those type of things.
So I don't think it has anything to do with that.  
  
Again, either team will be very difficult to beat.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2017

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Jalen Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28554)

### [Koby McEwen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32795)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 83 Utah State - 69  
  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I give a lot of credit to Nevada. I thought they were
tremendous. And I didn't think we played poorly. But they were very, very
good. And when you're the No. 1 seed and you come in and that's in the back of
your mind and you're somewhat expected to advance and win, we were hoping that
they would feel a little bit of pressure, have some kinks to work out. We
thought we were past that yesterday. And, boy, the start they had was really
good. I think they were -- they played extremely well. And we needed them to
have a little bit of a slow start and have some doubt, and they didn't do
that.  
  
If you would have told me before the game that Fenner and Oliver would miss a
lot of the first half, then I would have thought we were in better -- we would
be in better position than what we were. But part of being a really good team,
kids like Kind, comes in the first half and he's shooting less than 20 percent
from three on the year, makes two 3's. And Lindsey Drew throws in a couple of
three's, and that's not his role for them. And Josh Hall plays well. They took
up the slack and wouldn't let us close the gap. I give them a lot of credit. I
thought they were very, very good today.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to sort of weather the first couple of minutes when
they came out with a lot of energy and you guys made another run. Late in the
half what did you see that sort of got them going again? Because I think they
scored like 14-2, when they finished the half.  
JALEN MOORE: Their bench players came in, played well, did some things that we
weren't expecting them to do. That's tournament basketball. Everyone plays
their best. And they came in, like he was saying, hit some 3's, played good
defense. And that's pretty much it. Their bench players took over different
roles that we couldn't really get back into the game. We were in a big hole
and kind of just stayed within like 14 points to 11 points, we couldn't ever
cut it back into single digits.  
  
Q. My question is for Jalen. You scored 27 points, the same amount that
Koby scored yesterday. Can you talk about what went well for you
offensively.  
JALEN MOORE: I was just trying to be aggressive. Just trying -- just playing
my game. Like I said, just being aggressive, trying to keep the game close. I
do what I needed to do to lead the team, be the senior leader. I didn't
obviously want the season to end, I was trying to be consistent, make the open
shots and just play consistently. That was pretty much what went well for me.  
  
Q. You guys played some rough customers in pre-league. You went to
Cancun and had to play Purdue and Texas Tech, and you played BYU, too. How
does Nevada play compared to those teams you faced this year?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: They're right there. I think athletically they can play with
either one of those teams. Obviously Purdue gives you unbelievable trouble
with their size, with Swanigan and Haas. But on the perimeter, Nevada is every
bit as good or better than them. Texas Tech athletically, size-wise resembles
Nevada a lot. Those two teams remind me of each other, style of play, style of
players, with athleticism, shooting ability, a lot of multidimensional guys
that can do different things.  
  
So I think that's a very favorable comparison, Texas Tech and Nevada. On a
neutral floor, I think that would be a very good game. Obviously Nevada could
more than hold their own.  
  
Q. Obviously it's right after the last game, wondering what do you feel
like is going to be the biggest takeaway from you for this first season,
playing so much and getting the experience you got?  
KOBY McEWEN: Just learning how to keep your composure when teams make runs.
Basketball is a game of runs. They're going to make their run. We're going to
make our run. And it's really what you do on the defensive end, just trusting
your teammates on the offensive end.  
  
Biggest thing for me my freshman year is the difference between high school
game and college game, because the players are a lot bigger and faster. You've
got to think quicker, make smarter decisions. That's what I'm going to come
back next year and work on my decision making, just work on the things that I
need to work on to become a better basketball player for this program.  
  
Q. You've had a great career at Utah State. Now it's over. Talk about
how it feels and look back on your career for a second.  
JALEN MOORE: Goes by really fast. I mean Koby's going to look back on it and
realize how fast it goes by. It's been a blessing to play with all the players
I've played with, the coaches I've played for. It's just been a fun run,
getting better every year, playing with different players, playing in this
conference is fun. Playing against good teams. Playing against good
competition every night out.  
  
It was fun to get in the weight room from high school and just get bigger,
stronger, getting better every day. Those are the things I enjoyed. So I
appreciate the coaches giving me the opportunity to play here and just playing
with all the different teammates has been fun. And there's nothing like
college basketball, so it's been a really fun four years of my life.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit, the start was really rough, but seemed
like you weathered that first run, got back within a point, and it seemed like
the first half was momentum swings both ways until they finished off the
half.  
KOBY McEWEN: They came out of the gate making tough shots. There's nothing you
can do about that. When they made tough shots, you've got to shake their hand
and say good shot. There's nothing really you can do.  
  
But really what helped them was their bench. They came in, a lot of the guys
they usually don't come in and do what they did. A couple of those guys hit
some 3's unexpectedly, Kind and Drew had a couple of 3's. We weren't expecting
that. We kind of weathered it out a little bit. But they just made that run
with their bench. We'll learn from it and get better next year.  
  
Q. What did you see at the end of the half, I think the guys were
talking about thinking that you were within -- you were down ten, got within
five and they made that run to finish it out. What did you see there that sort
of went against you guys to let them sort of build up that cushion?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: Yeah, you know, I was thrilled after we survived the first
run, obviously. They came out of the gate and I knew that there was no
jitters, there was no issues in terms of their performance that I hoped there
would be, honestly. And so to weather that storm and get back into the game, I
thought from that point on it would be anybody's game the rest of the way. And
it seems like good teams, when you're on a roll, you overcome adversity in a
lot of different ways, whether it be an injury, whether it be foul trouble,
whether it be cold streaks, whatever the situation may be.  
  
Obviously they got two key guys in foul trouble. The game should swing our way
a little bit and yet the game went their way. And that, I think, was the game
in a nutshell because instead of us being able to go to halftime with a lead,
with some confidence, maybe the pressure shifts to them a little bit. The game
turned the other way where they probably had more confidence than they had
even to start the game. When you've got two starters that score a lot of
points for you sitting on the bench and you expand the lead after another team
makes a run at you, that's a big bonus and a big mental boost for your team
going to the locker room.  
  
And conversely for us, that's tough to overcome, because we did overcome one
run, felt like we were right there, we were playing back and forth, kind of
settled into the game. It's not we really did anything wrong in terms of the
way we were guarding them, we gave shots up to people that we wanted shooting
the ball. And they converted.  
  
Like Koby said, you kind of tip your hat and hope you can overcome another
run, and we just weren't able to do that.  
  
Q. You had a decent start to the second half, Julion and Quinn Taylor,
just going a little smaller and got within ten.  
COACH TIM DURYEA: We were talking about that four-minute stretch, is what you
do when you're behind, you don't want to be in that situation a lot. But at
the end of the first four minutes at the first media timeout, we've whittled
six or seven points off the lead and we were -- I thought that we would
continue to play well. Obviously you're going to have to deal with their
starters out there. But thought we were doing a lot of good things
offensively.  
  
And then we gave up a couple of easy baskets during that time defensively
where we really needed to string together some more stops to get the game down
to nine, eight, where the pressure can switch to them. When we needed a
basket, we didn't get it. We had some stretches where we took a couple of
tough shots and then we got some really good shots and didn't convert them.
When you give them easy shots and they can withstand a couple of surges, that
probably spells your doom from there.  
  
Q. Kind of a rough night for Alex and Norby, they didn't play very many
minutes, and you went smaller. Is there a reason?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I just didn't think they were -- I just didn't think they
were ready to compete and never really settled into the game. I thought Norby,
really, two games in a row, wasn't the player that he had been down the
stretch. I really don't know the reason for that. Two teams that he should be
able to match up fairly well with, and we just really got zero production out
of him.  
  
And the way Nevada was playing our ball screens, almost trapping, they were
showing their hand early in terms of jumping out on Koby, on Sam. There was a
lot of things open for Quinn that he could take advantage of with his mobility
and his passing mobility more than Norby could, so we went that way the rest
of the half. But that lack of production hurt us a lot during the tournament.  
  
Q. What has Jalen Moore meant to this program? You recruited him, what
has he meant to you?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I've known Jalen since he was eight years old, and he has
been the same kid, from a tremendous family, and he has been everything that
you hoped he would be when he came to your camp as an eight-year-old. And you
saw him go through high school. We got a commitment. He wanted to stay home,
play for his family.  
  
And he has been a phenomenal representative of our program in the airport, on
the airplane, in a restaurant. People compliment him, us, all the time,
regarding the kind of representative he is for Utah State, and that doesn't
even say anything about scoring a basket or the kind of player he is. We can
all see that.  
  
He really is what college basketball is supposed to be about. Great kid. Great
student. Great player. You want to coach about ten of those.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the future? Looks like it's pretty bright with a
lot of players coming back.  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I think our freshmen guards have learned a lot. Sam Merrill
was out there today with duct tape and everything else going on. He's got lots
of stuff, lots of issues physically. Koby learned -- I thought Koby played
really well today in terms of his passing and just the way he sees the floor.
He's come miles from where he started the beginning the year. I think we're in
great shape with those guys. We've got to improve internally, we've got a
couple of kids coming in, got a couple more to add, pieces on the front court.
But I like the direction we're going.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Dave Wojcik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27886)

### [Ryan Welage](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30504)

### [Isaac Thornton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32794)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 90 San Jose State - 64  
  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: We battled back in the first half and tied it up in the
first half. Second half, it was all second half, gave up 59 points. And can't
do that with good teams, especially everyone in this league. We didn't defend
them. They took advantage of it. The McEwen kid got going, and Jalen Moore got
into the act. And they were tough to defend there.  
  
So at the end of the day they beat us up in the second half and we didn't do a
good job defensively against them.  
  
Q. Seemed like today there was a lot of possessions where it came down
to the end of the shot clock and you guys kind of struggled to move the ball
and get good shots. Why do you think that was?  
ISAAC THORNTON: We needed to do a better job of executing offensively. We were
trying to do some things and we just had breakdowns that you can't have
against a good team like Utah State. Moving toward, something we have to do
better at.  
  
Q. You finished with 14 points, but nine of those came in the second
half and really those points helped you to at least climb back into striking
distance. Can you talk about the momentum shift and how you were able to start
fighting back?  
RYAN WELAGE: Yeah, obviously it was tied at halftime and then they made a push
right out of halftime. And then we were able to cut it to four, and so I think
that's when I scored the majority of the points. But we made a good run there.
We cut it to four and next time down they hit a 3, and that was a really big
3. I think -- we've fought the whole year, but came up a little bit short
today.  
  
Q. So there were multiple possessions where you guys struggled to switch
on defense. Was there a lack of communication today or why do you think you
struggled with that?  
RYAN WELAGE: Yeah, we -- I think we had a couple of breakdowns over the course
of the game. I don't think we had a lot of miscommunications. They hit some
tough shots. And they're good players. And they just hit shots.  
  
Q. Definitely a tough way to go out, but you have a young team, that
kind of showed today, especially with turnovers. So what did you tell your
team after the game?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I didn't want them -- I wanted them to understand the big
picture. I know they're upset, mad, angry, whatever word -- adjective you want
to use. But understand the big picture, how far we've come. I know that's hard
because they're in the moment.  
  
But I'm proud of them, to be where we were, how we had a heck of a season, to
be honest. We made a lot of progress. But at the end of the day it wasn't our
turnovers today. It wasn't turnovers; it was all defense.  
  
You've got to be able to guard one-on-one in this game of basketball, I don't
care if you're playing in the Mountain West Championships or playing out on
the street in the playground. It's about guarding the ball one-on-one and we
didn't do that today. When you give up 59 points you don't deserve to beat
anybody. And that's going to be a big, big, big emphasis in the off season
with these young guys.  
  
You're right, we played two freshmen and three sophomores, that's who we
started. And it showed today, especially with our young guards. They didn't
know what to expect. But I wanted them to have that experience this year.
They'll be better for it going forward into their careers, their sophomore
year. Nobody likes to lose, especially me, but I'm really proud of our guys
for what they've done, or their body of work over the season.  
  
Q. So the second half you cut the game down, after being down 13 to a
4-point game. All of a sudden Utah State goes on a 24-3 run over the next
eight to ten minutes. Why do you hit that wall?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: That's a good question. I think if I knew that I'd stay out
here in Vegas and make a lot of money, if I knew that answer.  
  
But I think the difference was the beginning of the half, the second half.
McEwen scored I think the first nine points of the second half. And tie game,
within the first four minutes we're down ten. And to me that was the
difference. And we were playing catchup from then on.  
  
And like you said, we made a run, and then we just ran out of gas on that
second time. And you can't get down 13, 14 points against good teams and
expect to come back. And that's what I thought was the difference in the game,
that first four minutes of the second half. And he's a good player. He's a
really good player. He made a lot of good shots. He was five for five from the
three. He made plays. And at the end of the day, players make plays, and he
did.  
  
Q. You mentioned the young guards. Brown had three turnovers, but Jalen
is not young and he had three. Nichols started the game, why didn't you go
with him more?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I thought he would be a better defender for us and put him
on Merrill. Because Merrill and McEwen hurt us at our place. So I thought a
bigger guy would be better on him. And so that's why I went with that, to be
honest with you, that was the whole mindset of it all. And we did a pretty
good job on Merrill, too. He wasn't the one that really hurt us. It was McEwen
and Jalen that hurt us today.  
  
Q. Did Koby McEwen do anything differently in the second half where he
was hurting you so much, because it looked like you were defending him well in
the first?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I think he kicked it into another gear. There's a couple of
shots, Terrell was on him, he made the three. He made shots. And that's
probably why he's the freshman of the year, best freshman. We didn't do
anything differently. We tried to change up a lot today defensively. Did a
good job in the first half. And we tried to get him -- they're a rhythm team.
And I didn't want them to get into a rhythm. And they got in a rhythm in the
second half and we tried to change up a couple of times and they figured it
out. And their older guy, Jalen Moore, made some plays for them, and obviously
McEwen made some shots. I have to credit them.  
  
Q. The first half you moved the ball, got good looks. Second half up
until after the run, you guys were kind of stagnant on offense, tossing the
ball back and forth, why do you think your team struggled?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I didn't see the final stats, but I don't think Brandon
Clarke took more than five or six shots. Took four shots. You ain't going to
win. He's one of the top players in the league. He was First Team. That's what
I tried to tell the guys. He needs to touch the ball every time. Conversely,
like I told BC, I thought he was a little bit too unselfish today passing the
ball. There were some times he could have taken that. I remember the play, we
had a steal in the press and he should have just taken it right to the rack
and shot it. He tried to flip it off to the guy and it was stolen.  
  
But we're not going to win if he's not shooting 12, 15 shots for us. It's one
thing I try to tell the guys, go inside, get him the ball. We might run a
play, they cover the play, throw it in to BC and play off of BC. He's really
good at that. He's got to shoot the ball more for us to be successful. And
that was a big deal, too, today.  
  
Q. Obviously in a game like this you've got to look for some positives.
I asked you a week or so ago, because you guys won the rebounding battle, and
you won it again. What does that mean going forward?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I'd rather get beat by 20 on the glass, as long as we win,
and that has happened before.  
  
You're right, the rebounding got better. But we're not defending. And that's
going to be a point of emphasis going forward with this program. We've got to
defend better. And if you want to win championships you have to play defense.
And you have to rebound. We are rebounding, but we're not defending. You can't
do one or the other, you've got to do both.  
  
But I'm proud of our guys, don't get me wrong. I'm mad, I'm upset right now.
We had a heck of a year, I'm proud of our guys for that. We made tremendous
strides from where this program was to where it is today, and it's only going
to be better. Guys are going to be juniors and sophomores next year, I'm
pretty excited about that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Isaac Thornton, he got you ten points off the
bench and two blocks, just with the hustle and play making. He's a senior,
this is it. Can you talk about him overall?  
COACH DAVE WOJCIK: I'll miss Isaac. He was my first recruit. He's a coach's
son. He's been a great ambassador to our basketball program and to the school,
to be honest with you. He was the glue guy for us, I'm going to miss him a
lot. He understands the game. He plays hard. Never bitches. Never moans.
Always trying to find a positive in things. It's hard when you lose those kind
of kids and a career comes to an end. But I'm going to sorely miss him, just
being around him. He's a great kid, great person, great family. So I'm going
to miss him.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [Hayden Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28478)

### [Jacob Van](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30492)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 83 Wyoming - 68  
  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: What a start. We had, I believe, a 25-0 start. I joked
with our staff and I said I would coach the first 25 points of the game and
then they could take it from there. So I think we got off to a good start.  
  
All joking aside. We didn't have the last part of our season, for that being
said, our season going the way we wanted it to. But these guys refocused and
reenergized, and we had a really good session on Sunday, and Monday and
Tuesday. For them to come out with that intensity and effort and enthusiasm to
start the game, it's a credit. That's who our cadet-athletes are at the
Academy, and I'm so proud of them. And we get to live for another day.  
  
Q. The fast start, did anything change? Did you do anything different?
Just hit shots? What was the biggest difference for the fast start?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Against Boise, we kind of had -- we let too many plays
offensively, we weren't paying attention on the defensive end of the ball, as
much as we should have. We emphasized it throughout practice Sunday and Monday
and leading up to this game; defense was an emphasis for us. We had to jump
out, talk more, communicate. We told everybody our defense would lead to our
offense and that's what changed everything.  
  
Q. They closed within 16. What was the mood and how much tension was
there?  
JACOB VAN: You know, at halftime we wrote on the board, 0-0 second half. We
didn't act like we had a 20-point lead starting the second half. We had to
play our game continuing on from the first half.  
  
Q. How important was the free throw line in maintaining that lead?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: It was huge. A lot of games that we've lost, close games, we
haven't shot the ball well from the free throw line. Tonight I don't know what
we shot from the free throw line. That wins games for you. I'm not
historically a free throw shooter and I ended up making my free throws today.
JV over here was good.  
  
Q. You haven't won away from Clune this year. To do it now, what does
that mean to you?  
JACOB VAN: I think it means everything. If we had to win one game away from
Clune I'd want it to be this one because it builds momentum going into the
next one. And we have the confidence now, and we're not looking behind us,
we're looking ahead of us.  
  
Q. Now CSU, a team you guys have never beat. You only had one shot at
them in the regular season and now you get them again.  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: We're excited about it. If there was momentum to be given to a
team and we have it, we feel good about ourselves. CSU, we've only played them
once. I haven't beat them at the Academy. Everybody is going to be super
excited about this game. And we'll come out, try to do the same thing we did
today and take care of business.  
  
Q. The first shot of the game, Scottie maybe a foot inside the three-
point line, he banks it in. Could you tell fortune was on your side?  
JACOB VAN: Yeah, we had a couple of shots like that. At the same time, we're
not going to rely on those shots. We're relying on our defense, we're relying
on getting to the basket. It always helps when shots like that are going in,
but we felt the confidence how we played on the defensive end.  
  
Q. With that hot start, have you guys ever had anything like that in a
game you've been in?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Yeah, so actually earlier this year against Utah State I think
we had a 15-0 start. We talked about how impressive that was. It's basketball,
people score. I got asked after the game, did you ever think you'd top that?
Absolutely not. But 25-0, came out and just intense. And I think we kind of
shocked some people a little bit, the way we came out and started playing.  
  
Q. What is it about the Rams that in four years you haven't been able to
get over that hump and why now?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: They're a good team. They're a good basketball team. They're
aggressive. They play full speed all the time. They're a tough team. Over the
years we haven't been able to -- they've had our number. This year we've kind
of made some changes that we beat teams we don't usually beat, San Diego
State, Utah State at home. And this year it's been up and down, but this is
the year to make some stuff happen. And I don't want to be done.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering how you guys prepare to stop a scorer like Gian
Clavell. Do you have to change anything defensively?  
JACOB VAN: We're going to have to key in on him. He's the player of the year.
He knows how to get his points. If we come out with this kind of intensity,
like we did against Wyoming, I think we'll have a chance and we'll really
focus in on him. But rely on our teammates and just really work to get stops.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played was in Fort Collins. Eustachy picked up
his 500th career win. The place was rocking. Do you feel like playing in a
neutral site gives you a little bit of an advantage?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: He's not going for 600 tomorrow, is he? We're okay
then.  
  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Neutral sites are -- honestly, I don't care where we're
playing. We happen to be in Las Vegas for the conference tournament. And
that's where we get the matchup. Tomorrow, 6:30, we get to play Colorado State
and get a chance to beat them.  
  
Q. You guys have been the opening round team before. This year of the
Mountain West top teams look vulnerable at times against anybody. Everyone is
talking about this year is kind of wide open and the parity of the league.
Does that make a team in the opening round enter it thinking differently, with
a different mindset or is it the same as it's been in the past?  
JACOB VAN: Definitely. We know we can beat any team. We've competed with
everyone. Honestly, winning this game is going to give us the momentum and
confidence going into tomorrow. There's a lot of positives playing in this
game and winning and coming out with such a good start. We're excited and we
know we can compete with anyone in the league for sure.  
  
Q. You've had 72 points in three games in this building. First of all,
do you regret not transferring to UNLV? Secondly, this is the first time
you've won one of those games.  
JACOB VAN: I'll take a win anytime. We've been close I think the last two
times we played UNLV, five overtimes, couldn't get the win. It feels good to
get a win. It feels good to get that confidence and really know we have the
momentum now. It's exciting.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked the guys, is there a different mindset? Every year
the Mountain West has been a little bit different. This year sort of everyone
agreed that parity and kind of had a wide open field to it. Did you approach
this tournament thinking there was more of a chance coming out of an opening
round?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: We did. As we started this journey back in August, we
thought maybe our numbers would be different, to where we're at now, as far as
wins and losses. And for whatever reason they haven't. But we knew we had an
opportunity to beat a San Diego State and Fresno State and play some good
games during the course of a year. Utah State beats Nevada. Fresno beats
Nevada twice. There's not a team left in the field that can't win on Saturday.
And we thought that.  
  
And we talked to our players, and it's a credit to them because we didn't
finish the right way on Saturday. Nothing against Boise State, they were very
good that day. But we didn't think we played Air Force basketball. We wanted
to prove, we had one more opportunity, we were only given 40 more minutes, and
can do that, and I thought our players did. And their preparation was
unbelievable for this.  
  
Now there's eight left. We've got Colorado State that we haven't beat in a
while. It's an opportunity for us to gain another victory. Troy Garner said
we've been 3-17 in Mountain West conference games. This group has won two of
them. That's something about them. We beat New Mexico two years ago and now we
won this game.  
  
I don't think there's been an Air Force team that has competed in a Mountain
West semifinal. We're 40 minutes away from being 40 minutes away. We have a
lot of things to play for. There's a lot of grit. There's a lot of pride in
these young men. As we said in the locker room, our journey to this point, our
GPS got screwed up a little bit, we didn't go the right way. But we had our
third season and we're 1-0 right now, we feel pretty good about ourselves.  
  
Q. Second half, they got within 16. I saw the game against Fresno State
a couple of years ago. Was that going through your head?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: The clock was going extremely slow in the second half.
I'll say that. And there's been some games during the course of this year
where no lead was safe, as you've seen on TV.  
  
But we told our players to continue to play with aggression, continue to take
care of the basketball, continue to share the ball. And let's be gritty on the
defensive end of. There was a play at the end, with about a minute left in the
game, and we're up, our margin of -- at that time -- we turned it over and
Trevor Lyons hustles down the end of the court and steals the ball back. A
player can give up on that, because if they score, you're still up 12 or 13.
But that showed what kind of character our team has.  
  
And we were extremely fortunate to manage the second half. That's a good
Wyoming team. They had us down I think 25-plus in the games this year. I think
we were down 29 at Laramie, and 20-something at home. For us to flip it,
that's a 50-point flip, for us to start 25-0. Again, that's a credit to the
young men and their preparation and execution early on.  
  
Q. Scottie got a big three.  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: Big three, and our guys on the bench are saying he's a
shooter. That's one coaches say, No, no, no. Great shot. He made it.  
  
And Pervis Louder, we called his number, he didn't come in the game the first
half, second half, first possession, he makes a three, gets a drive and
scores. Everybody who played contributed to our victory.  
  
And our scout team, our guys who did play today were extremely good on Monday
and Tuesday.  
  
Q. As you mentioned the first two games Wyoming had big leads, but you
came back. Did that help coming into this one?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: It did. We showed that in our film preparation why they
extended the lead to that considerable amount, but why we were able to close
the gap. We really focused on that. But all our energy had to be on the
defensive end. If we didn't get stops today we wouldn't be up here smiling.
That was a credit to our players today. No one has called us to put out a
defensive clinic tape yet this year. For us to do that today, we were pretty
good.  
  
Q. What did you do defensively, did you do anything different?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: We played more man. We started the game man, we
switched one through four, and we stayed aggressive on the switches. We were
there on the catch, we contested and we didn't give up any second
opportunities. And that was big for us.  
  
The third thing was we controlled the ball, we managed to not turn the ball
over, 6 turnovers in each half, and that was pretty big for us.  
  
Q. You played a lot of man today. Are you going to go with a similar
approach against CSU?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: Wow, we talked about it. We normally don't plan ahead.
But we talked about some things coming up for the next game if we were
fortunate to do that. I can't say right now. I'm not sure. We're going to
think about it.  
  
Q. Facing a scorer like Clavell, just typically do you adjust for a guy
like him?  
COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: He is so talented. He can score different ways. He can
shoot it so deep. He plays with unbelievable passion for the game. We may try
to find him in the hotel tonight and lock him down a little bit and keep him
there until Friday so he doesn't show up tomorrow.  
  
In all seriousness, our effort has to be on him. And then when those guys
shoot it and miss it, who gets it? Omogbo. He's an unbelievable player, he's
so confident to gain offensive rebounds, and kick it to his teammates. It's
going to be a big challenge.  
  
They're second in our league to the last game of the year, they've won 20
games. They've done some incredible things. They're a really good team. I
think they're an NCAA tournament team. We're going to have to be very good
tomorrow to overcome some of the things they do well.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Marvin Menzies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20785)

### [Jovan Mooring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32822)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 62 (OT) UNLV - 52  
  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: I'll keep it short. I'm happy for Coach Fisher and the
staff over there. I thought they did a really good job of keeping their guys
engaged and fighting, especially with the deficit, coming into the second
half. So proud of my guys and those guys and the way they fought. It's a
credit to the program that they have.  
  
Probably a little more proud of my guys and the way that we played, in spite
of the mental faux pas there at the end of the game. I thought we showed a lot
of heart, a lot of fight. Kind of a microcosm of our season in terms of the
attention to detail at critical times. I thought we still had enough to get
over the hump. And a couple of missed rebounds, a couple of missed free throws
and the rest is history.  
  
Q. You looked pretty spent down the stretch. Was that true? Were you
playing on fumes down the stretch? Did that contribute to your struggles at
the line at the end?  
CHRISTIAN JONES: Maybe. I'm not sure. It was more of a mental thing than
anything. I was just missing free throws, basically.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference offensively for you guys between the
first half and the second half? The second half you started having some of
those droughts. What was the big difference to you guys?  
JOVAN MOORING: We missed a couple of shots in the second half that we were
making in the first half. And I think it had a lot to do with them making
shots. We weren't getting the stops we were getting in the first half. So
that's pretty much how it goes.  
  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: You can ask them positive questions, too. They fought.
Their season is over. You can allude to things that will help them move it
forward. It's not just do what we normally do. Their season is over, so let's
be conscientious of that, please.  
  
Q. You're coming back next season. What do you take away from this game
and this season going forward and what you've seen with the program?  
JOVAN MOORING: I think I've learned to be more of a leader, set an example for
the guys this year and the guys we have coming in. And I think next year there
will be a little more structure. We're pretty much put together on the fly.
And I think we did a great job of coming together and fighting the way we did.
There's no doubt that we could have won this tournament. I think we are headed
in the right direction.  
  
Q. When that lead starts getting lower and lower, how tough was that
when you knew they had the momentum to combat that and just get the game into
overtime?  
CHRISTIAN JONES: Just -- we just needed to stay with our principles. They're a
good defensive team. And they attacked our weakness. Execute from the opposite
end. They came down and made big shots. And that's how they kept the lead --
they went up.  
  
Q. Obviously it's a change of scenery here for you. Can you reflect on
your senior year here and your experiences here with UNLV this season.  
CHRISTIAN JONES: I had a lot of fun, knowing that this is a completely
different scene. I knew some challenges that we might have, but most of the
time it was all fun. We had a lot of close games. This team, we had good
chemistry, we had everybody brand new. Overall I had a good experience here.  
  
Q. You had that big lead early in the second half. Do you feel like your
players at that point were trying -- I won't say sit on -- but maybe not to
lose it?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: Not at all. I thought the pressure of the press turned
the tide. I think as soon as they got some turnovers. I think it was Malik
made a big three. And I don't think we were playing to protect the lead at any
point. I thought we missed some good looks.  
  
More importantly I don't think we handled the turnovers. In the second half we
ended up with 12. We only had, I think, three turnovers in the first half. So
that's -- nine turnovers, between that and overtime. So that was probably the
biggest difference. I think the way that they -- we practiced for pressure,
but they very rarely run that 1-2-1-1, unless they're down. And I probably
should have spent more time in prep. It was something we had in our
repertoire, but just a couple reminders, maybe a couple more times in
practice, so we could have been a little more settled I think would have been
good for us. Hindsight is 20/20.  
  
Q. Defensively and in the first half, looked like you guys were flying
around. Did you make any changes in the second half or did you sense a
difference in the way guys were playing defensively in the second half?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: Well, they got tired. I rode a few guys. Played less
guys and played them more minutes. Six guys, you know, really played the game.
And it was working. But they did hit a wall. We just kept doing what our game
plan was, which was to protect the paint more, get three guys back in
transition, rather than two. And we did a couple of things different to try to
post some -- we had a matchup zone a couple of times, I don't think they
recognized it and we got some good turnovers off of them in the first half, as
well.  
  
We did some things I don't think they recognized right away, and tried to
disguise a few things. When we got to the second half, the bottom line, their
full court pressure is probably the difference maker.  
  
Q. A lot has been made what you inherited, Coach Fisher spoke on that,
what do you believe should be the next step in terms of improvement for a year
from now, two years from now, as you try to build recruiting, what do you
think is fair at this point?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: This will be the first year I can get a class together,
even though we're still kind of behind the clock on this class. But combining
junior college guys, transfers, potential transfers, things like that, I think
we could at least get a solid foundation in. We have a good culture. We have a
good staff. We have some guys that are returning. I can see them being
integral in our future.  
  
But there's no question I have to go get some guys. We've got some new guys
coming in that I like, but most of them are young. So they'll be at kind of
the foundation.  
  
So we'll be better, hopefully significantly better, but I think at the end of
the day it's going to come back down to balancing the classes the right way
and not try to knee-jerk and just go get guys -- just experienced guys. We're
going to have to tier it up a little bit.  
  
Q. Following on that, would that be one of the things you want to not do
in terms of -- especially with a season like this -- do things like knee-jerk
to where you're trying to sign experienced guys to get to a certain point
where people think you should be, and is it going to be tough to balance
classes and going in the pattern you want to go?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: No, I think it will be different than next year's
recruiting class and the year after that, because hopefully we'll be in a
position by then to constantly trade on younger student-athletes, high school,
maybe a prep school guy from time to time. But I'd like to recruit high school
kids predominantly, when we get at that place. We're not at that place right
now. We'll have a mixture that will give us the depth in the different
positions and also the depth of classes to create a paradigm that we can be
very, very competitive next year, and play at the style of play, as well.  
  
And then build upon that. So we'll have a lot of returners, even on next
year's team going forward that we can start to plug in the holes to make the
puzzle work.  
  
Q. When JoJo picked up his fourth foul, did you feel you had no choice
to leave him in, then when he got his fifth foul?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: It was one of those six on one, half dozen on the other.
We're getting the -- with the full court pressure, I felt like I really needed
to keep him on the floor. Him and I talked about it, he knew that he had to
stay on the floor. But he just -- but I told him, I want you to play D, you
have to make sure you show your hands. And there was some music in the
background and I lost my concentration. What were we talking about?  
  
So it was really one of those deals where you've got to make a decision. And
he was just playing so well. And it's like most things, man, if I could do it
again, he fouled out, so I would have given him a break. And then he would
have maybe made it to the end of the game. Heck, what are you going to do.  
  
Q. The first season is completed here. Has anything happened since you
took the job that has made you alter your plan or your blueprint or your long-
term thoughts?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: No, I still feel like the luckiest man on the planet who
has had a bad day. We're in a great city, great city. We're in a town that's
the mecca of basketball. We'll be able to get players in here. That's not
going to be an issue. We've got a fantastic fan base. We had some loyal fans
that suffered the worst record of the history of the program and showed up
cheering to the last buzzer. You can't make that up.  
  
We had so many positive emails and texts and people reaching out saying,
Coach, you'll get it going. You'll get it going. So it was easy to stay
positive.  
  
I think the challenge for me was the expectations I probably had on myself and
this program for this year. I wasn't sure what I had, so I'm always a positive
and optimistic guy. So I'm hoping we'll get more upsets during the season. But
that didn't come to be. So next possession. Let's move forward and doing what
we do, which is win games and win over fans.  
  
And there's going to be some people that are going to be negative and still
talk about the season as if it were a disaster. If you only go by wins and
losses, it was pretty much a disaster. But if that's what you're judging the
program on, then you're right. But I don't coach for just wins and losses. I
coach to build a program that has a lot of components. Our guys will be in
classes tomorrow. We'll be out in the community. And my seniors will have
great lives because they said yes to me, and they said yes to UNLV, and I'll
make sure they're good.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what your speech was like to the players after the
game.  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: Pretty much that. I talked to the seniors, specifically,
because I've got the rest of the guys that I can embrace going forward. But
basically we're going to have some player meetings and evaluations that we
typically do at the end of every season, you have kind of a season exit
interview meeting. So we'll have those next week. So we talked about that.
Talked about getting their butts up and getting to class and fighting through
that adversity of wanting to stay in bed.  
  
And we talked to the seniors. And I just thanked them for their effort, their
constant positive outlook, their character and their commitment to giving me
the opportunity to coach them in their senior year.  
  
Q. You asked us to be positive. So I'm going to ask you, from a
basketball standpoint --  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: Now that they're gone, you can ask me. I have thick
skin. I just didn't want you to beat up our guys.  
  
Q. From a basketball standpoint what do you take positive out of this
season?  
COACH MARVIN MENZIES: I'm positive about the future based on a whole set of
dynamics that exist at UNLV, the brand, the support, like I said, the
community, the fan base, the city. So there's things that I understand now
from the head coaching chair that I didn't quite understand or experience when
I was here as an assistant with Lon Krueger. So I feel even more inspired that
we will be successful and that I'm glad I have the job.  
  
From a basketball standpoint, I think there's nowhere but up, right? And so I
think the climb is going to be fruitful. And I think it will be enjoyable. And
I think people will see the growth and see how we do what we do in the
Menzies' house. And so I think that will be pleasing to the folks. I'm looking
forward to getting that.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 62 (OT) UNLV - 52  
  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I rarely get on my phone after a game. But we had a minute
before we came down here and I was talking to Angie, my wife. And she -- first
thing she said was how happy she was for me and our team. And very quickly out
of her mouth came how bad she felt for Marvin, Marvin Menzies, who is like
family to us. And then she went on to say, But Marvin's day will come. And it
will. And it will. He will get players. He will love them and teach them and
he will win.  
  
This was a game where not many people, including our own fans, thought we had
a chance at halftime. And anything we could do to hurt ourselves we did. And
they were brimming with confidence. And we found a way to muster the fight
that you have to have to have a chance. You've got to fight.  
  
And my only comment was, it was nothing about, Here's what we're going to do
with X's and O's; it's fight. And have some pride in the name on the front of
your jersey, in this program. This program has done too many good things.  
  
And I said I know I'm going to start two guys. I wanted to start the guys that
normally start for us. But until I talked to the staff, I said I'm starting
Zylan, because you've got a fight. It's got to be a productive fight in the
second half. And I'm starting Dakarai. And Dakarai and D'Erryl didn't want to
go home. And I think Dakarai tried too hard in the first half. But he's a
prince of a man, and nobody competes harder, nobody is for the team more than
he is. And we found a way to make a basket and then they did what we did in
the first half, they couldn't make a basket.  
  
So we're appreciative that we're playing tomorrow. And we're going to be
determined to play 40 minutes, like we did the last 20.  
  
Q. That first half, was it more of what UNLV was doing defensively or
was it you guys just not converting?  
DAKARAI ALLEN: I feel like it was more of us. I know I had three turnovers in
the first half. And they really get out and run here. So that's something we
talked about, we harped on, not turning the ball over. And as a senior, as a
leader, I can't do that. I have to play better for us to continue winning.  
  
Q. What kind of clicked in the team the second half? You came out in the
second half and you didn't really do anything different than the first half.
And then Trey hit that three. But what clicked? Did you decide we're not going
to lose? What happened there?  
DAKARAI ALLEN: Well, when Trey hit that three, instead of laying a ball up to
three people, he kicked it up to me, I made an extra pass, and he hit that
three and that's how we need to play, if we want to continue winning. And so
that's what we did.  
  
Q. Obviously offensively there was trouble for you guys first half. But
second half from a defensive standpoint, do you think the impact you had
particularly against Christian Jones was a huge factor to turn things around
in that second half?  
MALIK POPE: Yeah, I would say so. Fish honestly just told us to be more tough
in the second half. And it all started with guarding -- with five. And that
really turned the game around for us offensively, because you know that
creates momentum. We just followed Coach Fisher, he has experience and we know
we can trust him. That's what it came down to for us. Just being tough, having
some grit in the game, not playing soft.  
  
Q. Did you feel that you were a little soft up until maybe the final ten
minutes or so? Coach talked about a couple of guys that had to fight, didn't
mention your name, but you definitely seemed to turn it up in the last ten
minutes. Give us that perception. And also what was said at halftime.  
MALIK POPE: I wouldn't necessarily say I was playing soft. I just wasn't
grabbing the ball. I was boxing out and doing what I could to get the ball,
and I would get my hands on it and just couldn't get it. I stepped my game up
in the second half. I wouldn't necessarily put myself in soft, but I wouldn't
put myself in aggressive, either.  
  
And at halftime, those were really the words that were spoken, soft and
aggressive. And that was our transition to go to win this game. That's what it
came down to.  
  
Q. Coach, you went through something similar your first season that
Marvin is going through. What is it about him that tells you he is going to
turn it around the way you have?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I've known Marvin for 18 years now. And I've watched how
he handles every situation. He's tough minded. He's fair. He's relentless in
his approach to recruit. And this game starts with recruiting. You need
players. Everybody needs players. And he was working with less than a half-
filled deck. Nobody's fault. But that's a fact.  
  
Tonight we benefited from that, when they had limited numbers and they got in
foul trouble, Mooring fouled out. And to see a team compete like they did for
40 minutes tells you that he has the respect of his club, that they listen and
they care. And that will win for you.  
  
Marvin can recruit. And Marvin can coach. So you combine the two, I'm
convinced he will be successful.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on D'Erryl Williams, and also with his
injury, and also talk about what kind of lift he gave to the team? It was like
you had a point guard out there for the first time all season.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I hope D'Erryl is okay. He said he dove for a loose ball
and hit and kind of jammed his head. So I think his neck is where he's having
some issues. I think he's okay. I'm sure he's going to be sore and stiff.  
  
But you're spot on. I told the team after the game, I said this is not about
individuals, so I don't like to single out, but I have to. D'Erryl Williams
was such a huge factor in our winning this game tonight. And he didn't try to
do anything extraordinary, he just tried to make the right play and be
relentless with how he played. I think so often we let up just enough, whether
it's consciously -- usually not consciously -- just a little bit, because of a
negative play. And you can't do that.  
  
But your point, D'Erryl made the right play. He made some plays off a ball
screen and hit a guy on a lift. He made a play off a ball screen and took it
to the rim and got an and-one. He made some plays that you win with, that you
didn't say, Well, they got lucky. He made the right play and right read and we
got easy looks as a result of that.  
  
Q. Obviously a tale of two halves for both these teams tonight. Can you
talk about your approach going into the overtime period after coming off a
solid second half for you guys.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We just talked about, let's get the tip. We wanted to run
a particular look to throw the ball inside. We got the ball and we got a
basket to start the overtime. So we had a positive feel right out of the gate
starting the overtime. And all of us knew we got lucky. We got lucky that we
were able to come back. Rarely do you come back from as big a deficit as we
had. Because usually you're playing so bad, so poorly that you don't have the
toughness to come back.  
  
Somebody talked about Malik and not having toughness. He had 12 rebounds, and
he looked, body language was better as the game went on. And it's not easy.
But if it was easy we'd have a million people that would say give me a
scholarship, and you give them to the smartest and best looking.  
  
We've got a group of guys that care. We haven't played great this year, you
know that. And we've had games like this, where we've had moments we played
okay and moments where we've looked God awful. And we did just enough to get
ourselves a victory today. And at this stage of what we do, that's most
important, because we're playing. We're going to be playing tomorrow. And
we'll be excited to play. We're going to have to play well for more than 20
minutes. And I think that we will.  
  
Q. You get down by 21 points at one point. What do you say to the guys
or how do you get them to believe that they can win this game down 21?  
A. There's not a time for a lot of pep talk. We talked about, what I said
before, have some pride in who you are. Believe that you're good. Make one
play. And I think what helped us out of the gate in the second half, and it
wasn't right out of the gate. I looked up and I asked Mark, my son, What was
the halftime score? And he said, Exactly what it is right now, and that was
about four or five minutes in.  
  
And then when Trey made that three, we'd been -- the game, it felt -- there
was a little bit of a lift finally. It shouldn't be that way, but I thought
our defense was a little bit better, a little bit smarter.  
  
And, again, when Mooring got in foul trouble and fouled out, they're playing
too many minutes for their key players, but they had to. That helped us, too.
And I think D'Erryl needs to get a little Q and A for him, because he was so
instrumental in what we did.  
  
Q. Just give us an update on what happened on that play and how you're
doing.  
D'ERRYL WILLIAMS: I just saw a loose ball, and I've always been taught to dive
on loose balls, and go for every loose balls you can. I tried to dive on the
loose ball. Another UNLV player was coming in and my head kind of smashed into
somebody's back and kind of flexion downward. The right side of my neck is a
little sore, but I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Coach was talking earlier and the players were talking about what
happened in the second half. And a lot of talk about heart and not being soft.
Did you as a senior just say I don't want this to be my last game?  
D'ERRYL WILLIAMS: Of course as a senior you always think about that last game.
And me coming off the bench, my job is always to bring energy to the team and
just make the right play for others. I just try to go in the game and observe
the floor, make the right play, if it's me taking a layup or just me hitting
somebody for a wide open three, a dunk, whatever I can do to help the team win
I'm going to do, and that's been me from day one.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to follow up on the point you made. You said you guys
haven't played well this year, obviously, and with a 6th seed coming into the
tournament, pinpoint the reasoning why you don't think you have played well up
until this point.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We've played well. We haven't played well enough. We
haven't played well for 40 minutes. I said to our team, and maybe to Mark
Zeigler, if you give me ten points to use any way I want we'll get four more
wins, in league play. And now we're fighting for first in the last game,
instead of fighting to stay out of the play-in game. But we didn't.  
  
So through 18 games we weren't the best team in the league. We were picked
first, but we weren't the best team in the league. We were picked first maybe
because we were 16-2 last year, maybe because we've been good lately. And
oftentimes people say, well, they're good, they're supposed to be good. Yeah,
they're good, they've got these guys back, but you have to play. And nothing
is given to you. And we haven't played well enough. We've played in spots well
enough. But we haven't been consistently what you have to be.  
  
Will we be that tomorrow for 40 minutes? I hope so. They get harder as you go.
But we'll have a chance to do that tomorrow. And D'Erryl is the epitome, and
I've said this before, of what you hope to have in a student-athlete, going to
med school, eventually, he cares. He cares about the team. He cares about
winning more than he cares about himself and stats. And you win doing that.  
  
He gave us a huge lift tonight. He knows that. Our team knows that. And when
we've had games where we didn't come back, we didn't get that lift from
somebody. Somebody has to make a play or two for you. Tonight we did. And he
was the ringleader on guys making plays for us. He started. Trey made the
three, but he started it with his energy and intelligence when he came in.  
  
Hopefully we'll get more of that from everybody tomorrow.  
  
Q. It's been two months since you played Boise State, just curious on
your thoughts on the matchup tomorrow.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: They're good. The worm has turned. We won every game for a
while. I didn't think they were ever going to beat us. And now they have
started to win these games, in different fashions. They beat us up pretty good
at their place in the first game. If you watch our first game, the first 10 or
12 minutes, we looked like the best team in the league. But we couldn't
sustain it. They made plays. They ran by us. They beat us down.  
  
A year ago, we had the game won, seven, nine points ahead with a minute or two
to go, and couldn't make a free throw. They did to us what we did to them when
they first came into the league. They're a good team. They're well coached.
They've got a nice blend of youth and veterans and they make you guard. And
they can make shots. They've been tough on us.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Allen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14543)

### [Hayden Dalton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32800)

### [Justin James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32801)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 83 Wyoming - 68  
  
COACH ALLEN EDWARDS: Obviously, first, just all credit to Air Force. I thought
they came out with some tremendous excitement for the tournament, shot the
ball really, really well in the first half. And we were forced into a
situation of playing catchup for pretty much the whole game. I couldn't say we
were just horrible on defense, I thought they made some tough shots, as well.  
  
But I thought their offense was very crisp. They got the ball moving and on
defense I thought they had a tremendous edge, which affected our scoring on
the offensive end.  
  
But, again, giving them credit. I thought they did a tremendous job today and
obviously wish them luck going forward.  
  
Q. It was a tough start, down 25-0. What were they doing defensively?
Coach said they maybe played a little bit more man today. Just what happened
where you got in such a hole?  
JUSTIN JAMES: It all started with turnovers. We weren't being aggressive on
the offensive end. We were careless with it. It's hard to score the ball when
you turn it over 30 percent of the time. Credit to them. They play really good
defense. And that's just a bad play on us.  
  
Q. Talk about beating them twice, do you feel like looking back now you
might have done that at all?  
HAYDEN DALTON: I just say we just, from the jump, we weren't playing as hard
as them. And I can't give you a reason why. But I would say they outplayed us.  
  
Q. How would you assess this first season with your guys' roles, with
Coach Edwards? I'm sure you're disappointed now, but was this good? Learning?
How would you sum this up if this is your last game of this season?  
HAYDEN DALTON: It was a solid year. Love all the guys on the team. We all love
each other. And that's all you can really ask for. And we're always fighting
for each other night in and night out. So I can only say we're going to work
hard this summer and be ready for next year.  
  
Q. When they do get off to such a big lead, was it a feeling of shock?  
JUSTIN JAMES: Obviously it's just like, wow, we're down 23-0. I mean credit to
them. They came out with a lot of fire. They came out with more passion than
we did. And they just came out and dominated.  
  
Q. You talk about being pretty confident. You've had other comebacks
this year, whether or not you won them, like CSU come back from a big deficit.
Was it frustrating not getting the run going in the second half today?  
JUSTIN JAMES: It was hard to come back when we're fouling so much. It's hard
to come back when we were giving them easy free throws. But all credit to
them. They came out ready to play. And they dominated today.  
  
Q. Coach, what did they do defensively or was it more just being
careless with the ball for your team, when you just couldn't score? I know
Coach Pilipovich said they played a little bit more man, did you notice that
or was that the difference?  
COACH ALLEN EDWARDS: I don't think it was the difference. Whether they're
playing their matchup zone or switching man to man. At the same time at points
it could all look the same.  
  
But our concept was to move the basketball, space them out and look to attack
and play off two and find the next best play for the Pokes. And I just think
we didn't do a good job of spacing once we made passes. We were cutting --
sometimes the cut didn't make sense, because we were cutting towards the
basketball, when we could have opened it up a little bit more.  
  
But I thought the best thing about the defense was just -- just how hard they
were playing.  
  
Q. You talked this year about putting 40 minutes together, and probably
came out with maybe your worst 10 minutes so far in the beginning. Why do you
think it is or what was the attitude then?  
COACH ALLEN EDWARDS: A lot of things go through your head, just about the
start. I mean you can only go to the game as a coach, as a staff, as a
program, with the best you feel like you need to do to go out there and
compete and play to win.  
  
But like I told the guys at the end of the day, I'll probably self-assess it.
And at the end of the day I'll put it on me. I was the head coach and I felt
like that wasn't Poke basketball in the first ten minutes of the game, and
through stretches of the game. Even when we tried to make our comeback or chip
at the lead. We still, to me, reverted back to being careless with the
basketball. And I thought we were actually a little passive on the offensive
end of the floor, turning down some shots. And I felt like as the game went on
and they were scoring the basketball, the goal got a little bigger for them.
And they were making shots and making plays. And like J.J. said, fouling, and
putting them at the free throw line didn't help, either.  
  
But proud of this group and what we were able to do as a team. But at the same
time you're disappointed in the sense of how today ended.  
  
Q. I know it's not under your control, but you got 18 wins. Is there a
possibility of some sort of postseason tournament? If so, would you welcome
that or have you thought or even care about or do you know what area you're
going to go now?  
COACH ALLEN EDWARDS: I spoke to the guys after the game about that, because
there are a few tournaments out there. But our mindset right now is just let's
wait and see. But at the same time this group has been going since August and
it's a young group in the sense of playing time. But we do have a lot of
juniors out there.  
  
It will be interesting to see, but at the same time if we have the opportunity
I think this team still needs to continue to grow. And I know we lose Jason,
and obviously Mo, who's been hurt. But I'm excited about the future of this
program, as well.  
  
Q. Just looking back on this first year as head coach, what's your
initial evaluation of this season?  
COACH ALLEN EDWARDS: Well, I think first off, the expectation was very high. A
lot of people didn't think we would be able to do some of the things that we
did, being picked second-to-last to finish in this league, and to finish 7th,
I think that speaks volumes for this program.  
  
But at the same time, you lose Jason, which is pretty much one guy. Because Mo
was injured all year. So you look at what the future holds, I think that's
pretty good, not only with the guys coming back, the guys that are sitting out
and the recruiting class that's coming in, very optimistic that this program
is going in the right direction.

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Koby McEwen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32795)

### [Jalen Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28554)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 90 San Jose State - 64  
  
COACH TIM DURYEA: Thought we started the game a little bit tight and a little
bit cautious, and just kind of felt our way through it. Second half I thought
we played with a lot more force, a lot more thrust. We got out, got in
transition. I thought we just made a lot of really simple, easy plays that
resulted in high-quality shots. And we knocked them down.  
  
So defensively we scrambled around, tried to change our looks up on Clarke and
just protect our paint in the second half. They did a good job I thought in
the first half of driving the ball and getting us into some bad situations.  
  
Obviously second half felt like we kind of found the rhythm of the game. First
half felt like we were tight and sluggish and slow. Good to see the change.  
  
Q. Did you feel more fresh today or how do you explain your big game?
Did the shot at the end of the first half kind of get you going?  
KOBY McEWEN: Yeah, I definitely felt fresh. Coach gave us a couple of days off
when the season ended and we got right back to work Monday, Tuesday. So I was
ready to go.  
  
And the shot that I hit at the end of the half definitely got me going, just
to see the ball go through the net. That usually -- that's a good thing for me
to see that I just gain confidence and anything can happen after that.  
  
Q. You guys got a lot of easy baskets today, both inside the paint and
on the perimeter. Why were you able to get some easy looks?  
JALEN MOORE: Just trying to penetrate and then kick for looks, and just drive
the ball. We got in the bonus kind of early, just keep driving the ball, get
to the free throw line, get some easy baskets.  
  
The main thing was we were just trying to drive it, kick it to our open
shooters, and just be more patient. Like Coach said we were a little tight the
first half and came out in the second half. And transition helped us a ton,
too.  
  
Q. In the first half it seemed like you were able to get some looks that
you weren't able to get to fall. How did you sort of handle that mentally?
What changed for you the second half? Seemed like you were definitely more
aggressive. Did you feed off of Koby and the second half he started to have?  
JALEN MOORE: I was struggling a little bit, seniors, I'm used to it. I've just
got to keep playing my game. I went out, like you said, got more aggressive
and was just playing like I know something has got to fall eventually, and
they ended up falling. I was just trying to help the team in other ways,
passing it to open teammates, rebounding.  
  
And Koby definitely fueled the fire for our team coming out hot. Me and Sam
fed off of that and the rest of the team. From there on out we were just
playing good ball.  
  
Q. So as a team defensively you forced the Spartans to shoot 35 percent
from the field. Why were you so effective on making them take difficult shots
and having them get toward the end of the shot clock every single time?  
KOBY McEWEN: That was credit to our coaches. They prepped us pretty well,
watching film. We know -- they make us watch film a lot. We know a lot of
their players' tendencies. So we just went out and executed the defensive game
plan. We forced them to take bad shots at the end of the clock, and we started
running.  
  
Q. You had that transition dunk in the second half. It seemed kind of
like an emphatic statement from you. And I don't know if a turning point is
the right term. Did it feel like that from you guys on the court, did you feel
that made the statement you wanted?  
JALEN MOORE: Yeah. I feel like dunks like that always do. I just got out and
ran and Sam found me. And after that I was like, I'm just taking off. So it
was a fun play. That's always fun to do.  
  
But it definitely -- that is a huge play in basketball, whenever you get a big
dunk like that. That was big for our team, too. And from then on out we were
just playing hard. I feel like we were the tougher team in the second half and
that's where we were able to pull away from it.  
  
Q. You've been a second half player for a lot of the year. Obviously you
really got it going starting the second half.  
KOBY McEWEN: In the first half, it wasn't that shots weren't falling. I was
just really getting my teammates involved in the first half. I wasn't really
taking any shots. And that wasn't really what I was supposed to do in the
first half. All my teammates were helping. I was just trying to make the right
play at the right time.  
  
And the second half I just -- I didn't really come out saying I'm going to
start gunning, it just felt right. And every time I felt right taking the shot
I just shot it and just my instincts took over. And usually when I do that,
good things happen.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, how big was it to have Quinn Taylor cleared to
come out and play?  
JALEN MOORE: Quinn is just a solid player. We found out yesterday he was going
to be able to play. He hadn't prepped at all. He's smart. Has a high
basketball IQ. We played them three games ago, which helps us.  
  
And Quinn came out and did what he does. Finished the plays, play defense, be
a smart player out there. That was huge for us off the bench. He came in and
gave us good minutes, and that's what he does. That was huge for us, we
weren't sure we were going to have him or not, but when he's able to play he
does what he's able to do. He's a great role player for us, and plays the way
Quinn plays.  
  
Q. You didn't stick with the small lineup for that long, but you did
start out with a little bit different look. Did you feel any bit of
difference, whether it was easing into the game or the spacing, did you notice
any difference? Did you notice any difference when you were going back to your
more traditional?  
KOBY McEWEN: I felt like with Jalen playing the three it's easier for us to
get out on transition. He's really athletic. He's always trying to make the
right play. He gets to the basket real easy. I felt like our big lineup is not
really as big as it really seems. We really have three guards out there, even
when Jalen is playing the three. When we get out in transition it creates
havoc for the defense, for San Jose.  
  
I thought switching back to the original lineup was a good decision by the
coaches.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but when Koby and
those guys are hitting those outside shots, how much does that open you up to
do that inside-out game that you like to do?  
JALEN MOORE: They're good shooters, so when I'm in the post and teams like to
double me, I kick it to them. And they can usually knock it down. It expands
our whole team when they're hitting the outside shots. We're tough to guard.
We shoot well from the outside. We can drive it. We can kick it to open guys.
It opens up the floor for me for drives and to finish or drive and kick to
them that most likely they're going to hit open threes. It just opens up our
whole offense for our team when they start hitting threes.  
  
Q. Simple question, why the constant switches back and forth between the
zone and man defense?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I thought that was one of the ways that -- and they were
doing the same thing to us, by the way. There's a lot of change in defenses
going on out there. But just thought that was another way to keep them off
balance.  
  
When we play them, we try to neutralize Clarke any way we can, whether that's
doubling him when we play man or going zone, just giving him different looks I
think neutralizes them kind of playing through him. And that's probably the
main reason.  
  
But I thought that was key for us in keeping them off balance. We got them to
miss, in the second half, especially. And like I say, we played with a little
more thrust going to the other end and we were able to convert some easy ones.  
  
Q. Did you have a sense Koby was a different guy today? He hit some kind
of wall late in the season.  
COACH TIM DURYEA: He and Sam both have had a pretty rough for freshmen, and we
put a lot on those guys, not only offensively but defensively. Koby is kind of
learning to run a team as he goes, along with he's always had to score the
ball at a high rate for the team he's played on.  
  
I thought the first half, even though he didn't score, he made a lot of really
good plays. We didn't convert them all, but I thought he was seeing the floor
really well. And then the shot right before the end of the half was big, not
only for him, but for our team. Because we were really struggling and didn't
feel like we had much flow. And to get out of half when you go tied to the
halftime in the locker room, I thought that was mentally huge for us coming
out the second half.  
  
Q. You look like a different team the second half. Was your halftime
message more motivational or did you make some adjustments that helped to play
better the second half?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I think it was more them. When you come to a tournament the
first game, the first half of the first game is hard because they all
obviously know it's single elimination. You're fighting for every possession.
You're fighting for your life. You're fighting to get to the next day. And it
takes a little bit to kind of work through that and start playing basketball.  
  
That was my message at halftime that it's a one-half game. The most aggressive
team is probably going to win the game. And that's really what we talked
about, being more aggressive. We made one free throw in the first half, they
had made nine. And I told them, that can't be the case in the second half
because that means they're more aggressive than we are, and that's not going
to be a good sign.  
  
So it was all about being more aggressive, freeing up mentally, physically.
Jalen, I thought, made a couple of key plays to kind of infuse some energy
into our team and helped us kind of get going.  
  
Q. Going into halftime would you say you were somewhat encouraged that
you hadn't got what you usually expect to get out of your big three, they
didn't give you what you usually get? Or was it more anxiety it just a night
where they're all going to have less than what you expect?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: There was some anxiety early in the half. But by the time I
got to halftime I was relieved to be tied at half, to be honest. I just did
not think we played with any rhythm or fluidity in the first half, at all. And
so to be tied, we got a handle for how they were playing us a little bit. They
switched defenses more than they ever have against us, throwing some junk out
there, some triangle and two, some zone, some man. We knew we they were going
to press us most of the game. That was one thing we talked about this week,
we're going to have to handle full court, three-quarter court pressure. We
didn't do a great job of that at their place, we only played them once this
year, and I knew that was going to be something that Dave hit us with pretty
hard. Second half we were much better.  
  
Q. Jalen had a couple of big threes, seemed like he hit buckets when you
were struggling.  
COACH TIM DURYEA: I thought he had two of the bigger shots in the game. The
one in the second half when they were coming back at us a little bit, I
thought that was a huge play. They lost him once and he made them pay. Julion
did a good job in the first half. I thought it was one of his better
performances, in terms we weren't getting -- like we just mentioned, we
weren't getting some production we usually do, and I thought he came in and
hit a couple of timely shots for us.  
  
Q. I wanted to comment about Quinn Taylor being cleared to play.  
COACH TIM DURYEA: We've added some new stuff to our offense and Quinn has not
played, obviously, or practiced. And so Quinn and I were in the hotel lobby
today walking through our new stuff. That's not a position you really want to
be in on the day of your first game of the tournament.  
  
But Quinn was just cleared yesterday afternoon after his cardiac MRI and we
were thrilled. The whole team obviously loves Quinn. He's a great teammate,
besides being a very key component of our team. And we found out yesterday
right before we got on the flight that he was cleared to play. That gave
everybody a little boost.  
  
We practiced four days not thinking we may have him. So we were juggling and
moving some things around. That was great to have him. He was big in the
second half. He kind of makes things work, he's a facilitator, both ends of
the floor. He talks on defense constantly and offensively he's great at making
his teammates better, in subtle ways, he makes the offense work. Love having
him back.  
  
Q. Nevada tomorrow, how do you prepare for them and how do you make sure
it's more like the first time you played them instead of the second?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: We've got to rebound the ball. In the second half or the
second time we played them, I didn't think we played that poorly at their
place. But we got killed on the boards. We gave ourselves no chance to win,
just in that area. And so obviously that's the biggest thing we've got to talk
about and do going into the game is we have got to rebound the ball, which we
did in Logan. We did a really good job on Marshall, No. 1, and we rebounded
the ball.  
  
The game at their place I thought we did some good things. They played us a
little bit differently. But when you get beat as bad as we did on the boards,
you give yourself no chance to win. That's probably the key going into the
game tomorrow.  
  
Q. That was the start of Marshall's little mini slump, he's since turned
it around. Do you notice any difference with his shooting the last four games
you've seen on film?  
COACH TIM DURYEA: No, he's an aggressive guy. He makes tough shots. He takes
tough shots. And we did a good job in Logan of making almost every look he
took be tough. And he just missed them. We gave him a couple of open looks. We
lost him a couple of times in Reno, and he made us pay. So it's kind of us one
and Marshall one in terms of that battle.  
  
But he's a guy you can't really stop from taking shots because he takes
guarded shots. He's just a talented enough guy to be able to make those shots.
And that's a pretty rare guard that can take that tough a shot and shoot the
percentage he does. We'll do the best we can on him. We hope he misses a few.
And like I said earlier, we've got to do a better job, if he does miss, of
getting Caroline and Oliver and those guys off the glass.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 30, 2017

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Quinton Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32048)

### [Josh Okogie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33312)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
TCU 88, Georgia Tech 56  
  
Q. Guys, what are your emotions right now after the game?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: I mean, we would never want our season to end this way but I
don't think it takes anything away from what we did this year. TCU played a
great game. I think that we played till the last buzzer.  
  
But I mean, we stuck together. We stayed with the way we need to play. We all
embraced as a team. We knew it was bigger than us and we knew bigger things
were coming and this is only the beginning.  
  
COACH PASTNER: First off, Lee, want to make sure, give a recognition to Lee
from the ACC is here to represent us, appreciate you being here. Want to give
just a great recognition to your young men, these student athletes. They have
just been absolutely phenomenal.  
  
From where we started to where we are now, these guys to my left and the guys
in the locker room have been just unbelievable and I promise you, like if
you've seen us in the beginning, and to be playing in this Final game, it's
miraculous.  
  
And I'm just, I'm so happy for these guys. Obviously this is not the ending we
wanted. But I'm not going to allow it to steal the joy in the type of season
we had and the amount of overachievement we've had.  
  
These guys have just been crazy good, and these seniors have been phenomenal.
They have left a lasting legacy. And these underclassmen, guys like Josh next
to me here, can build and take on what these guys have left and now we've got
to build as we continue to move forward.  
  
So just ultra, ultra proud, honored and very grateful with sincere, genuine
gratefulness to be able to coach these young men and be around them for this
length of time.  
  
Q. For Josh, and the entire podium, they started the game on that run,
were you surprised they came out that hard?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, they jumped on us early. We've been talking about our
starts, and we've had great starts here in this run of the NIT. The last time
we had a poor start was in the ACC Tournament versus Pittsburgh. They jumped
on us, and since then, we had four great starts in. This game we just did not
start well. We dug ourselves in a hole and we totally were trying to climb out
of it the entire evening.  
  
It just made it hard on us and we just could never really get over that hump
or get it close enough. We would get it, maybe get it to eight or seven and we
didn't come up with a big loose ball or an offensive rebound. They received
and got -- we never could get close enough to put the pressure back on TCU.  
  
Q. Coming into the season, finishing off here in the Final, how much of
a steppingstone is this coming out of ACC play, getting that experience,
having this experience for your team and a first year at the school and moving
into next year?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, it's phenomenal. Just absolutely outstanding. You know,
for the seniors to have the continuation of play, we have 17 home wins which
is a Georgia Tech single-season record. We have 21 wins this year. You know,
and for a guy like Josh, here to my left, the experience that he gets in
postseason play; you know, for what we're trying to do, I mean, he's got to be
a team captain for us next year. Quinton was a team captain for us this year,
so Josh has got to take those reigns and do the same, as well, too.  
  
Will and Jeff, from the NCAA and NIT, I just want to thank you both for your
hospitality through the whole trip and we appreciate it and we're very honored
to be part of the tournament. To you both, thank you. The NIT people,
everything was first class all the way through.  
  
Q. Repeating an earlier question but to the players. I think it was 10-0
after like three, three and a half minutes. Before the game, did it feel
normal? Did it feel like you guys were ready? And what was going on in the
first few minutes of the game, because it seems like they ran over you.  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Yeah, definitely. I think that we come out with the same
mindset. They punched us first. We come out with that same mindset. We punched
CSU Bakersfield first, and we saw the outcome of that. We put ourselves in a
little bit of a hole, and we stayed positive. I mean, our huddles, we were
always staying together.  
  
Coach would let us know, they usually let us know, we've got to get our energy
up, keep playing hard. I mean, we're playing for -- when the game got out of
hand, we finished and we have to play with some pride and keep playing hard. I
appreciate the guys that came in at the end of the game. They played hard. Got
a couple loose balls. Finished some plays. We just had to keep playing hard.  
  
COACH PASTNER: Losing, having a tough night really hurts us offensively. It
makes it tough on us because we count on obviously to open some things up for
driving angles, so he had missed a couple shots and that allowed them to maybe
shrink the floor or spread out a little bit more, both in a way that --
crowded one way and just didn't have that many -- for us to penetrate, as
well.  
  
Obviously the start was really the difference in the game, the way they
started. Both halves, both halves they had better starts.  
  
Q. 54 points in the paint and 21 second chance, have you ever faced a
team that presented that much of a problem?  
COACH PASTNER: We have been really good defensively all year. We came in the
game fifth in the country in defensive efficiency, and we came in the game,
led the ACC in conference play in field goal percentage defense. We just
didn't -- we just weren't real effective tonight.  
  
They did a nice job on second shots. And that really hurt us, the second shot
there hurt us in the paint there. We just weren't as effective. TCU deserves
all the credit, but we were not good today on both sides of the floor, and
both ends of the ball, and just one of those nights that we had and obviously
when we're having that and the other team is playing really well, it's a bad
combination.  
  
Q. Quinton, Coach mentioned the second-chance points that TCU had, can
you describe the energy that they were playing with? Seemed like they were
really attacking the offensive glass.  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Seems like they sent all five to the glass. They were real
physical. I think they just -- they played hard and they came up with some
loose balls. I think both teams played hard. But they found a way to get the
balls.  
  
Q. Josh, two questions. First, you went through the point in which you
went down pretty hard. Looked like you might have hurt your ankle or something
and went off the court. Did it affect you at all the rest of the game? And
then also, at the offensive end, what were you seeing defensively from them,
because it seemed like they were doing a really good job sort of clogging the
middle and preventing you from driving.  
JOSH OKOGIE: Yeah, I got to the lane and we got tied up and I fell kind of
funny on my knee. Really didn't affect me. I was able to come back in and
perform.  
  
Driving in the lane, they made it hard for all of us to be honest, we couldn't
penetrate inside. Clogged it up and they made it hard to kick the ball out and
they forced a lot of turnovers.  
  
Q. Josh, I know Ben got in foul trouble --  
COACH PASTNER: Ben has done such a good job this year fouling and he had those
couple early fouls. I don't think he was in as rhythm as he usually has been,
and we just weren't in rhythm, and you know, we just -- like that, we were
down 14-1 I think, and against some -- we missed a couple layups. We had some
missed free throws. And then they would come down and store and just
avalanched a little bit there. And then we fought back and they just -- there
was some key times where we were making a run, and they got a second-chance
basket or a second-chance and one or something like that, and it just -- you
know, they were -- when that happened, it just kills the momentum that we were
on.  
  
17 turnovers is just too much for us, and they had 28 points off of our 17
turnovers; that, and the second-chance points. We had 16 offensive rebounds,
21 second-chance points and the points off of turnovers is the difference
right there. In a high-level game, you can't do that.  
  
And that's why we beat Bakersfield. We only had seven turnovers and through
the NIT we've done such a great job of taking care of the basketball. Today we
had too many turnovers and they gave up too many second chances.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

### [Kenrich Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32824)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
TCU 88, Georgia Tech 56  
  
COACH DIXON: Okay. Not a lot to see. Well, let the players talk. They did all
the work.  
  
Fun game. Certainly loved how we played, especially defensively. It's a team
that's gotten better defensively as the year's gone on and especially these
last couple weeks. Made some adjustments but really they have just I think
committed to it and understood it and saw the value of it. That's why we're
where we're at.  
  
I told them, I wish we had a game tomorrow, the way we're playing right now.
Otherwise I told them, 8:00 class tomorrow morning. So we'll get back. And
certainly excited for our program. Excited for our school. Our turnout was
unbelievable. I think we're starting something special and really looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Brandon, you've talked about it a lot, your journey, going 0-18. To
cap it off like this, what does it mean in?  
BRANDON PARRISH: This moment in itself is a dream come true for me and
everybody. I just know, thinking about this for the last, since we knew we
were going to New York, I knew our team had championship potential. Went
through the trenches, and seeing a lot of success early -- for me to stay the
course and to continue to believe in this program and in the coaching staff
and in my teammates and myself, man, it's so big for me to have this moment
right now.  
  
Q. Kenrich, you're coming back next year. Can you elaborate, is this a
momentum-builder for next year, to try to get into the NCAAs?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: This is huge for us. This is huge for our program and our
school. I think people are starting to realize that our basketball team is on
the map, certainly by winning this tournament. And even next year, I think
we'll be even better.  
  
Q. I know you really touted your seniors a lot. What's your feelings on
their last game? You made a comment a couple of games ago, that they were like
foundational.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I mean, I'll be quick on this, because these players got to
talk. But yeah, just they have committed to it and they have sacrificed, and
you know, you need your seniors and when you come to a program, it's hard. And
they have been -- they have had a different coach, obviously challenges, and
they had to buy in for us to be successful.  
  
And they bought in, and they believed, and they led, in so many ways. But that
was the most important thing. And as I've said all throughout, you've been
through so much to believe, and to have faith, is really even more impressive,
given the situation. So I can't thank them enough.  
  
Q. Did you get a feeling at any point that you were breaking their will,
because you gained a lot of fast break baskets, especially in the second half.
Did you think they sagged at any point, maybe emotionally?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: No, I just think we came out ready to play. The first five
minutes for us was huge in the first half and I think that translated to the
whole game. So I think the whole game, we were just ready to play defensively
and in transition.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you've really picked up your game these past
three games in the tournament and how the team's leaned on you?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Well, it starts as a team, team sport. But I think with
Jaylen being out, I really had to step up and be more aggressive. My teammates
do a good job of playing hard. We all just played hard and played for each
other, so I mean, that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Brandon, you had the trophy. You cut down the net and you have that
pretty cool-looking necklace around your neck right now. What's been the best
part tonight for you?  
BRANDON PARRISH: For me, the best part about it is just being here with my
brothers. I mean, like knowing today, today was going to be my last game no
matter what the outcome was. It's been really emotional for me.  
  
But for me to be able to have this moment with my brothers, and now we have
something that's forever, and nobody can ever take this away from us.  
  
There was so many times that people said that we would never be able to do it;
that the guys on our team weren't good enough; that our program wasn't good
enough. Just the fact that we can silence all the doubters today, it's a dream
come true.  
  
Q. For either of the players. TCU traditionally obviously prides itself
on football and baseball. How are you guys been able to tell that basketball
is now starting to work its way in, whether it's on campus among the students
or just among kind of the TCU Nation in general? How can you tell that
basketball is putting itself in that conversation?  
BRANDON PARRISH: When I first came in, we were in an old arena. It was kind of
hard to bring fans in from time to time. Often times it was in a polo field
arena, even if it was a home game and from then, we went to a high school gym
where people would get lost trying to come to our games.  
  
And now we're in a situation where we have one the of top-of-the-line
facilities in the country. Just having that right there on the campus can help
you bring in fans.  
  
Coach Dixon has brought in a whole new energy to this program. There were
times that I thought it would never be possible to have it like this. Now we
have the city behind us and I mean, like I said, when they are behind us, who
we got against us.  
  
Q. I have to ask you about your brother's dunk at the end.  
BRANDON PARRISH: Yeah, to be able to see my brother -- I've always known my
brother was so bouncy. And then to be able to see him come off the bench after
39 minutes and be able to jump up there and do a windmill, it was just
phenomenal for us to be able to share this moment.  
  
Q. I know it's been a few minutes, but can you gauge where this season
ranks in your career, in your coaching career?  
COACH DIXON: I don't really do that with rankings. I guess I've got to start
over when you're at a new place. I mean, I can give you descriptions or
thoughts on it.  
  
Just like I said, I talked about it; if we had another game, the team just
keeps getting better down the stretch here. We've won seven of the last eight.
Only loss was Iowa State. We've beaten Kansas, one-up at Iowa; we've beaten
Georgia Tech by 30. You talk about this team, how good are we, and you wonder.
So we've got a lot of them coming back.  
  
You know, I mean, it's interesting, because you know, I came -- I took the
job, and I'm one of those guys that says, I don't come into a place and say:
You know, we don't have this; we don't have that; this guy can't play; I
didn't recruit him.  
  
My thing has always been: There's no limitation. We can win. And so our goal
is to get to the NCAA Tournament and win the conference.  
  
So in some sense, I have higher expectations, and so this is dramatic for our
program. This is a step, as I like to say. I'm so happy to see our guys to
happy. That's where I'm at right now, just to see them and hear Brandon talk.
It was only the last couple months, last couple weeks, really, where I
recognized how much, the struggle that they went playing-wise. I learned as
the year went on.  
  
But I guess to see that, it ranks -- because I really think that I was a part
of these seniors leaving their career feeling good about what they did for
TCU. That, to me, is more important than wins or a championship. I mean, these
four guys are going to feel proud about their experience.  
  
They came here to build a program and it maybe took a little longer than they
thought. But they did, and now they can feel good about their four years,
their commitment and their school. And they did something. And I've used the
word a "foundation"; and I've used the word a "believer."  
  
But I just know now that these four guys are going to be celebrated for their
commitment to a program that was -- no other school has done this. They have
gone from a mountain -- a non-power five to a power five. We're the only one,
I guess Utah to some degree, but they had a program and they had been in a
National Championship game. I mean no, other one has done it and now here we
are. And you know, we were at 34 in Ken Pom, and we probably made a -- that's
a big, dramatic increase. I'm just -- those guys should be very proud of what
they did, and I feel like they are now.  
  
Q. You hear so much from other coaches about the importance of defense
not leading to offense. Looked like you guys racing out to the 18-3 lead was
exactly textbook, exactly what other coaches talk about.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, well, our defense has been coming along. It was
interesting. I thought early on our defense, it was where it needed to be. It
was getting better. And then we hit a lull where we weren't getting it done
defensively.  
  
But as the year has gone on defensively these last seven games our defense has
stepped up and it's improved. We made some adjustments, but I think it was
just the young guys getting a little better understanding. But yeah no,
question, our defense led to our offense. That's what we want to be. And we
got turnovers; we got stops; we got transition the other way. And we've been
pretty good in transition, and we're betting better at it, but the defense
starts, no question.  
  
Q. Kenrich missed all much last season, so you probably didn't get a
chance to see him. What was it about him that you had a lot of faith that when
Jaylen went down these next three games, the offense seemed to go -  
COACH DIXON: Well, it's been interesting with Kenrich because like you said,
he didn't play last year. But also, was hurt this summer and in the fall, and
he missed the first three, four games. So we never even really saw him play as
we practiced.  
  
So obviously we knew he was a good player but as the year's gone on, we've
found better ways to use him in even better situations where we're even more
comfortable and to be honest, he was out for about a year and a half. He's
just now getting his legs under him and getting game like conditions.  
  
So you're seeing the numbers that he's putting up. His play down the stretch
here has been unbelievable. I've talked to him late in the season about, I
can't wait to work with him in the off-season. We have a foreign trip planned.
His offensive numbers have gotten better, I think as we've gotten the
understanding of where he needs to be and what positions to put him in, and
then he's just getting his legs under him and getting game like conditions.  
  
I can't wait to see him next year, what we do this summer with him, and you
know, his play has taken off. You know, he stepped up, yeah, maybe because of
Jaylen, but I think it's just because he didn't start playing till December,
really, of this year and being out for a year and a half.  
  
Q. You shoot 52 percent tonight and you get 16 offensive rebounds, 17
assists, do you think tonight was the most efficient offensive outing of the
year?  
COACH DIXON: It was good. I mean, we didn't make threes early, so that hurt
us. But I thought our shots were good. We were good. I thought we got a little
bit stationary after we lost the lead in the halfcourt.  
  
But we attacked their zone pretty well. I think they got out of the zone.
Their zone has been their best defense, but we hurt it early, and I think we
hurt it again in the second half so they got out of it.  
  
It's interesting. I mean, my assistants make fun, joke about it, but we work
on zone offense so much, and we just didn't see as much as I would have
thought. And the few times we have run into it, Baylor and now there, we've
attacked it well, and we've gotten out of it.  
  
So we're prepared for zone defenses. And you know, we got a little stationary,
which we got up so much, but then we finished it well which was good to see.
I'm proud of our guys and how they were able to stay on it with such a big
lead it. Shows a lot of maturity.  
  
Q. You keep saying that your team is getting so much better. You're
bringing a lot of people back next year. Obviously you want some carryover.
Can you talk about the goal of making the NCAA next year?  
COACH DIXON: It was a goal this year. As I've said it a couple different times
tonight, and I guess not in here but that was our goal and I know people
laughed at me, that was our goal to get the NCAA Tournament. We were picked
last in our conference by a substantial margin. We've been last every year.  
  
People probably frowned upon me or looked at me crazy, but I believed we
could. I thought we were an NCAA Tournament team, but simply put, we didn't
get it done down the stretch. We lost a number of close games. We were an
eight-seed, nine-seed at one point late in the season, but we just didn't get
it done.  
  
Maybe you have to be in that situation of big games and finding ways for these
guys that had not been in that situation before. So hopefully this did it for
us. I think it did, and it's just getting better and better as this tournament
went on.  
  
But yeah, there's no question. This is a great, great accomplishment. It's
hard to win five games. Hard to go on the road and win in the end of the year
like this, and we did it.  
  
Yes, it would have been great to be in the Tournament and lose in the first
game as half the teams did. But this made us better in the long term and I'm
looking forward to again, as I joked about, coaching tomorrow, but we'll give
them a little time off.  
  
Q. You talked many times about want to go make your alma mater proud of
this program and take it to a different level. What went through your mind,
you're up on the ladder, cutting down the net, you grab it, you look out,
people cheering you. What's going through your mind in that moment?  
COACH DIXON: Well, this moment, I thought we were going to have to get a new
writer for our local newspaper, our school newspaper, but he's okay up there.  
  
You know, I mean, as I said earlier, our goal is to get in the NCAA
Tournament, go on runs in the NCAA Tournament. That's what I'm used to doing.
That's always been our goal.  
  
But I guess you have to take steps. And this is a step and this is a huge step
and yeah, the Richmond game, the fans, the crowd, the talk around the city; I
feel like -- I feel like I wanted our players to be proud of our program, and
I wanted our school to be proud of our program, and that's what I came to do.
I thought I could be the guy to do it. I thought I had the background. I
thought by coming -- and being a guy they took a chance on; when I was 17
years old, they gave me a scholarship when no one believed in a 6-1, 170-pound
guy and then the Chancellor and Chris Del Conte giving me this chance.  
  
So this school has always given me a chance and given me an opportunity. So
there's -- I won't stop until we win a Big 12 Championship and that's going to
be the mentality going forward. But this is a good step in the right
direction.  
  
Thank you.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2017

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the NIT Championship
coaches' conference call. We'll start today's call by talking with Georgia
Tech Coach Josh Pastner. The Yellow Jackets got a 76-61 win over Cal State
Bakersfield in the first semifinal game. Coach Pastner, if you could give an
opening statement about last night's game and about tomorrow's championship,
please.  
  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, well, we were fortunate to win yesterday against a really
good Cal State Bakersfield team. Very well coached. They play hard, have great
energy and they compete. For us to only have seven turnovers, I was really
proud of our guys for that, because that's hard to do against a team like
Bakersfield. So a really good Bakersfield team.  
  
And then tomorrow, it doesn't get any easier obviously as we're playing TCU.
Coach Dixon, one of the best coaches in the game; obviously his run at
Pittsburgh was amazing, and he's doing the same thing at TCU.  
  
We're going to have to be really, really good if we're going to have a chance
to win the game. They are excellent and they are probably just -- probably
like us. They will probably be playing the best basketball of their season at
this time of the year.  
  
Q. TCU has a real big guy in the middle. What kind of difficulty does he
create for you that maybe you've not seen before?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, the big kid in the middle is really good. I mean, you
talk about -- he's fundamentally sound. He just knows how to play the right
way. He's just a high-level basketball player. He looks like he has a high IQ
of the game and really knows -- just makes the right reads. His footwork is at
a high level. He's just sound at everything he does. He's a really good
basketball player.  
  
You know, and their team is good. Their team, they don't beat themselves. I
mean, if you're going to want to beat TCU, you're going to have to earn the
victory. There's no doubt about it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the kind of defensive run you guys have been on
through this tournament, just outstanding effort and intensity for the last
four games.  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, we've been an elite defensive team all year long. We
obviously have had, if you look at our offensive numbers -- and we are playing
our best offense we have had all year long in the NIT. But we have been
offensively challenged throughout the season. We have been an elite defensive
team and that's what we did, and if you look at our numbers, we're in the top,
I think five now in Ken Pom ratings in defensive efficiency. We've led the ACC
in dribble percentage defense, and to be able to do that, you've got to be an
elite defensive team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined by TCU Head Coach, Jamie Dixon. The
Horned Frogs defeated UCF 68-53 in last night's semifinal game to earn a spot
in tomorrow's championship.  
  
So Coach Dixon, at this time, if you could, please begin with an opening
statement before we open it up for questions.  
  
COACH DIXON: Excited obviously about the win. We had a lot of fans here from
Fort Worth and around the city and expecting a lot more coming in for
Thursday. An exciting time for our team and our program and our school.
Obviously Georgia Tech is a very good team. Very familiar with them from my
ACC days and we're looking forward to the challenge.  
  
But was really excited for our team last night, just kind of how we did it,
came back and down early. Because they were making shots, playing well, and we
withstood their run and got back in it, and cut down a 10-point deficit to tie
it up and obviously win in the second half. It was a team effort. Our seniors
came off the bench and did a great job and gave us what we needed. And we did
what we wanted to do against a defense that's guarded the three well and we
kept the ball away from Fall inside. All in all, we stuck to our game plan and
did a pretty good job of it.  
  
Q. I was wondering if by any chance when you took the job, did you have
a chance to sit down or even talk on the phone with Trent Johnson, or in part
of that transition, did that conversation never occur?  
COACH DIXON: Oh, yeah, Trent and I are long-time friends. We've known each
other; I have great respect for him. I know he's won everywhere he's been. I
mean, what he did at Nevada, with building that program, and obviously
Stanford, winning there, and then obviously at LSU.  
  
Known him for a long time, and yeah, definitely reached out to him after I
took the job and talked to him about it. And we're also members of the NABC.
We were assistants on the road years back. Yeah, talked to him about TCU and
about his career, and then when he thought of -- what he thinks he can do.  
  
So yeah, we've had a lot of discussion. I think I talked about it last night
on TV. I mean, he's coached these guys hard, and they had a lot of challenges:
Whether it be the injuries, whether it be facilities, whether it be a new
conference; all kinds of challenges that our seniors have been through.  
  
You know, I think we're kind of reaping the rewards of his hard work and
discipline for these four seniors. So yeah, he's a great coach and we're
fortunate to follow a good man.  
  
Q. In terms of giving a guy -- obviously he came into a difficult
situation, you just mentioned facilities, conference, etc. Can you really
quantify how much credit a guy like that should get in light of the fact that
you've done very, very well in this first season with a handful of his
players, including Vlad and Kenrich?  
COACH DIXON: Well, I mean, I think after they went through the year last year,
they recognized what we needed and what they needed. I think we had Jaylen was
obviously -- and Alex; the point guard is so critical in any program.  
  
I felt last year that we needed to improve that by watching film; that
position had to improve for everybody to get better. We were fortunate to
solve that with a little bit of guard play. Obviously getting Kenrich healthy
was huge for us, and development of the next guys.  
  
I've always been a guy -- I've come into these situations before, whether it
be at Northern Arizona, Hawaii, Pitt. Some coaches go with the: You're not
very good, we have bad players, it's going to take time.  
  
I obviously have gone the exact opposite and saying that we have good players
and this is not a rebuild. And you know, I have great respect for Coach
Johnson. I know the challenges that he faced, and I knew before I got here and
I recognized even more so once I did get to TCU. I think he had some tough
challenges -- we all have things happen. You're at a place long enough and
you're in this business long enough; injuries or things just come up you can't
-- you're sometimes not equipped for, and that can happen at any place.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask, talk about how you have two first-year coaches and
your success and what that can do for both programs, especially your
program.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, you look back at the history, and we did that the other day
of teams that have won the NIT. We were actually looking at the CBI, teams
that have won that. But more so the NIT, and what it's led to, and I think we
saw Joe Lunardi speaking on that yesterday when I was watching the Bakersfield
game against Georgia Tech.  
  
You know, it's different with every team. With us, we're so young; it probably
can resonate a little bit stronger. Georgia Tech is an older team and got some
experienced guys. With us, this will be a great experience going forward.  
  
But I think for both teams, it's just playing for a championship, playing in a
tournament-like situation, where it's one and done, and if you don't win, you
go home. It's a different atmosphere and I think it's great preparation for us
going forward.  
  
We had a nice run of that in the Big 12, which I think has helped us in this,
as well. So you know, our players needed to be in the situation like that with
higher stakes, win or lose, go home, national TV games, two days to prepare
for opponents. This has been good for us in so many ways going forward.  
  
Q. And if I could ask one question, talk about the difference in playing
against UCF, as far as like you said, guarding their three-pointers, and when
you're playing Georgia Tech, the way they like to cut a lot.  
COACH DIXON: Right. Yeah, the offenses, I think they are different. But
defensively, both having a game-changing shot-blocker inside defensively, in
Fall obviously, and then Lammers, as well.  
  
And Georgia Tech, Coach Herrion, my assistant, was at Georgia Tech had told me
how good this kid was. We had recruited him. Looked at him down when he was in
Texas back when I was at Pitt.  
  
Obviously he's playing behind some really good players last year, big guys,
because they had good big guys. But he is an unbelievable defensive player and
he rebounds at the same time. So he does some really good things and he's
unique. He's got size, long arms, good timing and a good feel. We have to go
at him like we went at Fall last night.  
  
Q. As far as Georgia Tech, you talk about some familiarity from last
year. Also got a pretty nice freshman, Okogie. What strikes you about him? He
caught my eye last night.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, obviously his numbers are tremendous for a freshman,
especially in the ACC. I mean, it's hard to put up numbers like as a freshman.
Obviously Jaylen and Desmond, we have two really good freshman do some really
great things.  
  
But this is a guy, I'm very familiar with him, too. We saw him play a bunch.
He played with the CP3 team in the EYBL, so watched him play. Better shooter
maybe than I thought he was going to be, watching him in high school in the
AU, but played hard. And I think everybody saw him play, so he's probably
surprised some people, better than most as far as being able to put those kind
of numbers.  
  
But he got the opportunity. They have a lot of experienced guys Georgia Tech
planned to play with, but they needed a guy who could put the ball in the
basket and he kind of fit that bill, and it's almost like a perfect situation
for him to step into.  
  
But unbelievable athlete and plays very hard. Gets to the basket and is always
trying to get fouled, get to the free throw line. So we'll try to do that,
keep him off the line, make him take jumpshots and keep him off the offensive
boards.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Dixon for joining us. Congratulations again.
As a reminder, tomorrow's championship game between TCU and Georgia Tech will
begin at 8:00 PM Eastern and will be shown live on ESPN. Again, thank you,
everyone.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Quinton Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32048)

### [Josh Okogie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33312)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
GEORGIA TECH 76, CSU Bakersfield 61  
  
COASH PASTNER: That's a good team, to only have seven turnovers against that
type of hard-nosed tough defense that they play, and they are one of the best
defensive teams in the country. That's a great credit to our young men, to
these two men to my left, and so it's a great win for us, an opportunity to
play for a championship on Thursday.  
  
From where we started and to where we are now, it's been a remarkable year,
and for these young men, these two, and the rest of the guys in the locker
room, just deserve all the credit. My assistant coaches, as always, have done
such a good job with game planning and development, and so here we are and
have an opportunity to play for a championship on Thursday.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the lack of turnovers. What do you think the key to
hanging on to the ball tonight was?  
JOSH OKOGIE: We definitely had great preparation prior to this game. We had a
couple great practices and a great shootaround on being ball tough and just
passing drills and making the right passes, sharpen our passes, and I think we
did a good job of transitioning that into the game. We had crisp passes.  
  
Coach told us before the game we had to be comfortable being uncomfortable,
and I think we did that early. We knew the press were coming and we just stuck
to what we knew with our fast breaks and we just trust each other with the
ball.  
  
Q. Quinton, not a lot of people know Cal State Bakersfield. What did you
think when you were drawn against them, and how do you prevent yourself from
maybe taking them lightly considering they are kind of a mid-major?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: I think our coaches really prepared us to let us know they
are really going to come at us. First day of preparation, started off went
from stretching to breaking the press break, and we don't usually do that. But
I thought that was a pretty cool way of preparing for them because we know
they are just coming right at you and we just attacked first.  
  
Q. How would you evaluate how you guys played?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: I think that we really started the game off with our hands.
We got a lot of deflections, whether we got steals off them or the ball went
out-of-bounds, it gave us a lot of energy. And we kind --- of our hands
started going down a little bit later in the half. We picked it up and our
talk was really good, too. Really just staying out on their shooters. We lost
them a couple times, but we tightened up in specific areas and I think we did
a good job.  
  
Q. Josh, you had a help block that kind of came out of nowhere. Do you
remember how that play unfold?  
JOSH OKOGIE: You talking about the block? Actually I was supposed to be there
a little earlier. I kind of got caught sleeping, but I ran as fast as I could
and he ended up shooting, so I tried to contest the shot to make up for me not
being there on time. Fortunately it was a block.  
  
Q. You're a game away now from finishing your season. You must be
excited. Can you describe what you're feeling to be close?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: I would say I'm happy with us winning but like I said
earlier, we're not really satisfied. I feel like I could have played better. I
feel like our team could have played better today.  
  
I think we got a little rust off, so we'll be ready for Thursday. I think
we're ready to attack them, whoever we play. But to be able to play Madison
Square Garden, my last game, will be awesome, especially with the team that we
have. Win or lose or draw, I've had a good time.  
  
Q. What is it like playing here at Madison Square Garden?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Beautiful place. High-class arena. Everyone welcomes you.
They wish you good luck. You don't see that in many arenas.  
  
Great to get a win here. Great to play here. Just the air; you can't help but
love playing here. It's a basketball player's dream.  
  
Q. For both you guys, I know you talked about this the past few days,
but sort of reiterate trying to finish the season strong.  
JOSH OKOGIE: You know, beginning of the suspect, we all had -- we all wanted
to make it to the NCAA Tournament, and you know, after losing to Pitt, we kind
of lost our hopes of getting there. We realized we still had a lot of stuff to
play for: To reach 20 wins, which we weren't there yet, and we had a chance to
play for another championship, which I don't think this school has won an NIT
Championship.  
  
Us winning on Thursday, says a big thing on this team about where we came from
this summer. We worked our butts off day-in, day-out, and you know, just being
here is a blessing, and being able to win a championship just shows how great,
how hard work pays off in the end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Josh's performance, not only tonight but
throughout this tournament as a freshman, playing on the road?  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, Josh-O has just been terrific all year. His continuation
of his development has been just terrific. He's such a high-character young
man. His work ethic is just awesome, and he's just gotten better and better
and better, and he's playing the best basketball of his freshman year right
now at this stretch of games, and we're very fortunate for that. He's going to
be a really, really good basketball player as he continues to move forward in
his career.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could sort of pick up what Josh was just
talking about. Did you wonder going into the NIT where the players' heads were
at?  
COACH PASTNER: I tell you, our guys, to be sitting here at 21 wins and
playing, there's four college basketball games after tonight remaining, three
in the NCAA Tournament and one Thursday.  
  
So for us to be playing one of those games on Thursday night on national
television, it's a credit to the young men, to the players. Because from where
we started to where we are now, to see how a team unfolds in front of your own
eyes, the character of these guys. And so even with us playing in the NIT, we
were excited. We wanted to keep playing.  
  
This is important for our program. This is a major rebuild job. We took over a
situation where it's a major rebuild. We couldn't give any opportunity to
continue to get better and work and improve. The players and the assistant
coaches, my staff, has done just such a great job of developing these guys.
The continuation of their development is a big plus for us.  
  
Q. They had 39 rebounds in the games but it seems like it was actually
more of how they got them, and they had more control of the rebounding stops
and their rebounding --  
COACH PASTNER: They are an aggressive team. They are above the rim. They are
tough. They are hard-nosed. They play hard. Their well coached and they hurt
us on the glass. I mean, even they had 13 offensive rebounds, which is too
many. We're fortunate that it didn't end up biting us in the rear.  
  
But that's just too many, and they got some on some key times. Part of our
thing defensively, we are an elite defense team if you look at our numbers. I
mean, on Ken Pom, we're Top-10 in the country. I think we're coming into this
game six in the country in defensive efficiency.  
  
So we're fortunate. We always talk about, we've got to finish the possession,
and a few times today we didn't finish the possession. But that's a good team
we played, and we prepared for that for last three or four days of practice
with that type of intensity, and the guys did a nice job of only having seven
turnovers.  
  
In the NIT, we have 101 made field goals; 77 of them are assisted. And that's
why I was upset towards the end of the game. We had a couple of plays where we
played out of sync where because we were -- I'm a big believer: The open man
is the go-to man, and we played a little bit where it was my shot, not our
shot, and that drives me up a wall. That's been a staple of ours. To have 101
made field goals, 77 of them were assisted; we're one of the best in the
country at made field goals assisted, and part of that's our ball movement.  
  
So you know, that's just a great stat for us, as well, too, and there's a
reason we're able to continue to play and have a championship on Thursday.  
  
Q. To touch on the rebuilding job and the journey, could you have
predicted such a big jump your first year with this team?  
COACH PASTNER: I've said it many times: It's a modern miracle. I can remember
like yesterday watching our first work outs. If you told me we're playing on
Thursday for the NIT Championship, I would say you're crazy. I remember at
spring meetings and I had multiple coaches from the league just said, you're
going to have to get -- I remember it like yesterday: "It's going to be a hard
year for you. You're never going to experience the amount of losing that
you're going to go through this year."  
  
So it's been a heck of a season, and as I said, it's a great lesson for me
that these guys, to see it all unfold, the power of team. That gets thrown in
words a lot, team and chemistry. But to really see it and how we have been
able to beat teams that are more talented than we are, because that night we
were the better team on different games throughout the season.  
  
Yes, of course, you've got to have good players. I mean, that's easy in
sports. But then they have got to be as a team, and when we're in areas we're
playing teams that have better talent than we do, some of our wins have come
because that night we were the better team. It's been a remarkable journey and
a great lesson for me to see it all unfold.  
  
Q. This is a very physical game. The score was very lopsided in the end.
But what do you attribute to the fact that your team had about one-third fewer
personal fouls in this game?  
COACH PASTNER: Well, if you look at our numbers, we really do a good job
defending without fouling. We came in the game six in the country in defensive
efficiency. We led the ACC during ACC play in field goal percentage defense.
We chart deflections, and we have all these different charts that we chart and
coach up, and we really do a good job of defending without fouling.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about how good Bakersfield is, especially
defensively. As a coach, is that something you're aware of with a team like
this that plays in the WAC; that maybe isn't on ESPN as much, before you even
start preparing for this team?  
COACH PASTNER: If we take anyone -- we are not good enough to take anyone for
granted. We'll get our butts beat. We're not talented to show up. We're not a
juggernaut. We don't have any -- our margin for error is zero. So if we end up
thinking we can just show up or take anyone for granted or lightly, it's an
automatic loss for us. We're just not good enough.  
  
Our guys know that and we just don't take people for granted and if we do,
we're not winning the game. And we didn't have any opportunity to take
Bakersfield for granted. We know they are really well coached, they are good
players and they are a really good basketball team.  
  
Q. How much emphasis did you put on pushing tempo a little bit? It
seemed like both teams played more possessions -- make or miss, you were
pushing up the floor, especially the first half.  
COACH PASTNER: No, we always want to play with good pace. I always use the
word "pace" in our offensive system. We talk about pace, pace, pace, pace. So
we want to attack and we were better in fastbreak literally, even though we
weren't as good today, we missed some opportunities on some fast break points.  
  
But we've been much better during NIT on transition offense. However, we've
missed so many layups this season, and today we missed a lot. It's just we
missed enough to last, you know, not only my lifetime but plus ten, you know.
It's an Achilles' heel of hours, but hopefully we can make enough on Thursday
to have a chance to win the game.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

### [Matt Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16298)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
TCU 68, UCF 53  
  
COACH DAWKINS: First, I'd just like to give TCU a lot of credit. I thought
they played a very good basketball. Players played with a lot of heart. I
think you can tell by the numbers: 20 assists, 15 offensive rebounds, they
played a really good game tonight.  
  
Now for us, you know, I'm proud of our team. Our team had a good year. I
thought we really came together as a group. I wanted to thank our seniors for
everything. You know, really just creating a culture for us and leaving their
legacy at our program with the season that they had.  
  
Q. You guys struggled in the second half. You shot 25 percent. What did
they do in the second half?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Played with a lot of energy in that second half and we just
didn't make the shots that we normally make. So give them credit. They are a
good team, and we just didn't make shots we normally make.  
  
Q. For Coach and for Matt, there was a stretch at the end of the first
half, at the beginning of the second where they out-scored you 20 to five.
Felt like their energy picked up significantly and you guys didn't match it.
Did you feel like their energy level dropped a bit and didn't quite match what
TCU was bringing?  
COACH DAWKINS: I thought they were very active, and TCU played the way they
normally play. They are a heck of an offensive rebounding team. I thought they
kept some balls alive. I think we had a pretty good lead. They were cutting it
on effort plays, like you say, offensive rebounds. We maybe missed a block or
missed a rotation and they really capitalized on that.  
  
We watched a lot of tape and we talked about it as a team. We worked on those
things. But it's different when you have to play against a team who actually
does it every possession and they played to their strength, which was that,
and that did give them a chance to make a run.  
  
We realized it's going to be a game of runs. Unfortunately we just didn't make
enough of them in the second half, put us in position to give us a chance to
win.  
  
MATT WILLIAMS: Similar to what Coach mentioned, we prepared for the game and
Coach let us know they was going to come out and play very hard. Let us know
they was going to come out and press the offensive glass and towards the end
of the stretch, they did what they did.  
  
Q. What was the range of emotions that you guys went through when you
went into the locker room for the last time?  
MATT WILLIAMS: The range of emotions in the locker room were more so, it was
emotional. Everyone was emotional. But it was more so just because -- not
because we lost, but just because the bond we formed with each other. We
formed a bond with one another that was unbreakable and that was the emotion I
think.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: Like Matt said, very emotional. I just want to say thank you to
the seniors, all they done for us this season and establishing the culture. We
won't let them down.  
  
Q. For the players, obviously there was a lot of euphoria getting this
point. What's the emotion now, disappointment, or do you still feel, hey, we
had a great season?  
B.J. TAYLOR: No, we're never happy with season. Coach has instilled that in us
this season, not only in basketball but in life in general, we'll never be
happy -- I mean, moving forward, for Matt, I know he's anxious about it and
he's got a great career.  
  
For me being a younger player, I know that I need to -- I think I've got to
hold that accountable moving forward that we have for next season, that we
don't want to, which, which moving forward we don't want this feeling, and we
need to do everything we possibly can to avoid it and end the season with a
win.  
  
Q. Not sure if you could tell how many fans that were there but a lot of
UCF fans traveled up.  
MATT WILLIAMS: We appreciated our fans. It's just good to know that we
established something that's bigger than us. A lot of people maybe think that
we played for ourselves, but we play more so for our community and we play for
our coaches and we play for our respect and it's just good to see UCF has
earned that respect and we laid the foundation for the time to come.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult it was offensively to generate good
looks in the second half against their man-to-man defense?  
COACH DAWKINS: You know, it was, and they did a really good job. They scouted
us well and they took away a lot of things that we considered to be our
strengths, and give them credit for that. They were active. They really game
planned well to try to take B.J. out more.  
  
They face guarded Matt all over the place and tried to eliminate him from what
we do and any time they came off screens they switched it and made it
difficult for us. Give them a lot of credit, as I said.  
  
For us, I thought you know, we also, you know, we didn't move the ball as well
as I think we normally do. We didn't space as well as I would like for us to
do, and we didn't go inside as much as we would like to do.  
  
So give them a lot of credit for being successful in their game plan and we
got a little bit of out of character from what we do well and I think that
combination hurt us.  
  
Q. The second half with the three-pointer, was it a matter of shot
selection or what they did on defense?  
COACH DAWKINS: Well, I think, you know, we talk about being down and we've
been down in games before, and we have to remain poised. I think at times when
we got down, we felt -- I felt we were rushing.  
  
We were like trying to make it all up on one shot and that's not who we've
been. We have to understand that it's a long game and keep playing it
possession by possession. It's one of the first games, and probably a good
stretch for us, where I felt like we were frantic. Like we were getting fed
up. It comes from a good place: You want to win, you want to come back, but
there's no 10-point shot. So we need to have a little more poise and
unfortunately that's part of growth. It's part of these young people figuring
out this game.  
  
Q. Matt, how difficult was it to get the three outside? I know Coach
Dixon talked a lot about guarding the three and really trying to take that
away.  
MATT WILLIAMS: I've been seeing that all year, just tonight happened to be
some shots weren't falling. I credit TCU. They did a good job playing defense.
I've seen that defense all year and they did a good job tonight containing me.
Tonight we just once they came out, we just really couldn't hit.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Vlad Brodziansky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33314)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Kenrich Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32824)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
TCU 68, UCF 53  
  
COACH DIXON: Just a great win for us and what I liked about it was we played
all nine. Mike Williams, a senior, made some big shots for us; and Brandon, a
big three early. Just to have all the guys, everybody, all nine of them as
we're down a couple guys. All nine just making plays and doing what we need to
do and just found a way. And different guys stepped up early, different guys
stepped up late and that's what you want to have as far as a team in March.
It's just been fun to coach.  
  
I told the guys, we love coaching these guys all year long and we just want
two more days with them, so they gave us that. We'll look forward to getting
ready for Georgia Tech.  
  
I thought Kenrich was terrific the second half. He just kind of took over,
passing, finishing, offensive rebounding, and you know, that's pretty big.
Just let him go do his thing.  
  
Q. Kenrich, can you talk about the second half? Seemed like every time
the ball went up it came down in your hands on the glass, offensively,
defensively, what have you?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: Yeah, going into halftime, one of the assistants just told
me I need to pick it up, pick my play up. I did a little bit more hustling the
second half, and thankful that the ball touched my hand.  
  
Q. What was the strategy? Obviously you made some real adjustments in
the second half. What did you tell them?  
COACH DIXON: Just, you know, I felt pretty good. We made a run in the first
half at the end of it and I kind of thought we had the momentum going in. I
felt we played pretty good defense. Williams hit some really tough shots, but
we didn't get too upset about that, frustrated. Just stick with what we were
doing defensively.  
  
I thought the second half, we emphasized more driving, penetrating and making
decisions, jump-stopping and finding the open guy. Fall obviously is going to
rotate, change shots. I thought once we started hit some guys, getting some
layups on some dump-offs, then we got some layups at the end when he had to
stay closer to his guy.  
  
But I thought that was the key, real will I, getting after it offensively and
just making a little better decisions in the lane one we got him. They
overplayed, yeah, they tried to force the drive, force you into their size,
Fall. And I just thought we made better decisions at the end, and Vlad
finished really well and then obviously Kenrich got a lot of put-backs.  
  
Q. Tacko is really tough to combat. Can you talk about your approach
today?  
VLAD BRODZIANSKY: It was a challenge to play against the tallest basketball
player in the NCAA right now. You cannot really get ready for that. We were
talking about in practice: He is going to be tall; he's going to be there.
Just get used to that he's going to be there all the time and try to block the
shot and go harder and finish.  
  
Q. How much of a fight did it feel like out there tonight on the
rebound?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: It was a fight. Of course, you've got Tacko Fall, he's a big
guy. But I mean, I think everybody did a great job rebounding on our team. We
really picked it up second half. We got a lot of loose balls. I mean,
rebounding was huge for us throughout the game.  
  
Q. Did you feel like at halftime that the motivation was coming player-
to-player, coach-to-player, or was it just looking up at the score?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: I mean, it was just player-to-player. First half, we didn't
play too well but we were playing hard. Second half we played, I think we
played pretty good. We were hitting shots.  
  
And as player-to-player, you just go out there and you've got to do what
you've got to do and that's what we did tonight.  
  
Q. You guys opened the half on a 16-3 run. What really sparked that
charge for you guys?  
VLAD BRODZIANSKY: We were just talking about in the locker room, we have 20
more minutes, and if we're going to last 20 more minutes, how about just try
to come up with blocks and play our hardest and try to execute.  
  
Q. The last time you had the triple-double, flirted with another one,
and all year you've had a bunch of double-doubles. What's been the increase in
the assist numbers?  
KENRICH WILLIAMS: I mean, getting the ball more; I'm being more aggressive in
finding my teammates. It has something to do with our point guard missing, me
stepping up and Jaylen missing. Just me being more aggressive and finding open
guys.  
  
Q. You talked about getting momentum turned. How big was the 10-0 spurt
to give you life and build on that going forward?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, just they made some shots early that we thought we guarded
well, and we didn't think they could sustain it. They were 1-for-14 in the
second half, and I don't think they really had a good look in the three. And I
thought really, really that was the big difference. Out rebounding by ten was
our goal; we got them by nine.  
  
And then guard the three. And obviously they hit some early. So that obviously
gave them the lead. But as the half progressed, I felt good because the shots
they made, except for the one on the breakdown when we were in zone to man,
were guarded. So he hit tough shots, Williams, but we didn't believe he could
sustain that. That was our mentality. That was our thinking.  
  
I thought we defended really well. They shot 33 percent, 24 from three, and
again, most of those makes were early, early in the first half. So we stayed
with our self defensively against their tough shots they had early and didn't
panic.  
  
We threw the zone in there a little bit to get them out of rhythm a little
bit, but the end of the day we knew we were going to have to man. That was the
message at halftime. We're manning and we gave up an open three in the zone,
which we hated to do. But we said at that point, we're manning the rest of the
way and we're doing what we do, and I think that message got to across to our
guys.  
  
You're talking about Kenrich. I mean, Kenrich, he missed so much. He didn't
start playing until a couple games into the season. We didn't even know, he
was so far behind; you talk about being out a year and a half. He's just
getting, finding his legs, getting better. We're finding ways to play through
him and play with him. I think it's just growth with him and us, and he's
getting better. He's getting better.  
  
But we're telling him to be more aggressive, straight line drives, just go by
people. He's too good an athlete and too good a decision maker, and he's a
player in the making as far as doing those things right now. I think it's
something that's evolved and come and we're playing through him in the post
and we're playing through him on the perimeter, as well.  
  
Q. Outside of the rebounding, what was the most important aspect
tonight? Was it perimeter defense?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, guarding the three, that was important to us. We actually
did it against Richmond, too. Their big guy scored on us, Richmond, but we
didn't guard the three. We felt the way they could beat us was by making a lot
of threes, and same thing here with Central Florida. And Williams was
3-for-11, Taylor is 1-for-7. So when you can hold them 4-for-18, we'll live
with that.  
  
Those were the two main guys, and you know, Banyard, we were going to -- we
were going to live with him making some. He only had two. But we wanted to
make it tough on all those and like I said, I think Williams got one open
three, and the two he had were deep and guarded of those three.  
  
So guard the three, and you know, that was the message and that was the goal.
I thought we did a good job for 40 minutes. Again they are 24 percent from
three. So they made five in the first half, and our goal was under ten, and
you know, that was a key.  
  
Q. What was your opinion of Tacko Fall now that you've played against
him? He took five shots, made three and had six blocks. Just your opinion?  
COACH DIXON: He got some touches. Main thing was get him farther out as far as
we could and not let him be by the rim and not give him second shots. If he
made -- I think he made one little jump hook on us. We can live with that. But
no put-backs, which I thought we did a pretty good job. I think maybe he got
one in the first half. So that's how I thought we hurt him.  
  
But we pretty much let our guy guard him in the post offensively. Defensively,
as I said earlier, I think that we had to get in the lane, we had to
penetrate, and I think we had to do -- as the game went on, we did a better
job of decisions once we got in the lane, whether it be passing or going to
the rim.  
  
I thought our big guys finished well, once the game got going: Vlad getting
fouled, finishing, and I thought that was good. But Kenrich getting in the
lane; I think Josh getting in the lane -- I mean, Alex getting in the lane was
key for us, too.  
  
We also spaced the floor well; that they had to guard the threes and we are
only 7-for-20, but we thought we were getting open looks often times lead to
offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. You get 20 assists on 26 made baskets today, and it seems like the
offense has been moving fluidly. Can you talk about that?  
COACH DIXON: It is, and the spacing's been better. Our penetration has been
better. And that's an amazing number because I don't know how many put backs
we had, so you're talking about 26 baskets, 20 assists like you said, and I've
got to think we had four or five put-backs after second shots and we look at
those as almost assists that we're taking a good shot and we're going to the
glass. That's part of good offense.  
  
So yeah, we didn't shoot it great, and you're not going to shoot it as good
when you have a guy like Fall in there. It's just fact. You know, you can say
play the same and do this and that, but he is changing the game in some way.
But I thought -- if told me he would shoot 43 percent, 35 from three, I would
be comfortable with that if we had a low turnover. I thought we had a few too
many turnovers but that's something we should -- we've got to work on here
going forward. We've got two days to figure that out.  
  
Q. You say you like playing in Madison Square Garden, but can you speak
about what it means to you and the program?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I mean, I love this place, and obviously being, I don't
know, I guess a New Yorker by parents, but it's special. My parents are here.
I tried to get the message across to our players how special playing in
Madison Square Garden is and how important it is, the history, and get it
across.  
  
I think they sensed how important and how much it meant to me, and I
appreciate that them for recognizing that and understanding my connection with
West Point and New York and our families connection to Madison Square Garden.  
  
So we love this place, and our family can't thank them enough for the
hospitality, the history and Joel Fisher, he's a good friend, but just so many
people, Joseph Fiene (ph) that make this place so special for us and I try to
get that across to our players.  
  
But as far as getting to the championship and winning 23 games now, we've kind
of put all these firsts, things that we could do first. Obviously we've kind
of had to adjust as we've won maybe more than people thought, but our goal now
is to get the second-most wins in school history, which would be 24, which was
my senior year I guess, and then get a championship at NIT.  
  
I think we just like -- we don't want the season to end. I think that might be
more the motivation than anything. These guys are practicing hard. You talk to
my assistants, you can't believe how much energy they have brought to etch
auto practice. I think more than anything, we don't want the season to end.
They love going to practice and they love being around each other, and the
celebration in the locker room was, you could just see the joy. We're going to
enjoy it for about a couple more hours and then we'll get ready for Georgia
Tech.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it's been like this year to go back and coach
at your alma mater, and are there any surprises once you got back there?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I talked about it a bit with our seniors. I would say the
biggest surprise is our seniors. The type of kids, the type of character, the
unbelievable unselfishness they displayed throughout the season, and their
work ethic. I mean, their roles have been different. They have changed
throughout the year.  
  
But they have come and practiced hard, and how much they love TCU and the
opportunity they have given them: Brandon, Chris, Mike, is less spoken about
it, but Karviar, but they just love -- they love TCU. They love the
opportunity they have been given and I think they are really enjoying the
ride.  
  
So I mean, I just can't believe -- I can't thank enough. When you get into a
job, you wonder if you're ever going to get those seniors to buy in; they have
a new coach, and how are they going to respond, how are they going to handle
and these guys have been, as I call them, the four believers, because they
have been through a lot: 0-18, playing in a high school gym for a year and a
half, practicing in different place, injuries, coaching change.  
  
But Trent had them ready and had high-quality kids, and I was just fortunate
to be falling after it. That has been the thing that's really been the biggest
surprise to me but a pleasant, pleasant surprise.  
  
Q. (Off-mic).  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, he's one of my best friends in coaching. He's been around
for success at Pitt and he's a former coach that won a lot of games and was a
big part of Georgia Tech, having a great year last year, because they won.
They got deep in the NIT, as well. Barely missed the NCAAs and won; I think
the highest team not to get in RPI wise so they had a great tournament last
year.  
  
He's great with Zebo (ph). Watched a lot of film with his positioning and can
do a lot of different things. He brings a lot of knowledge and just great for
all their assistants, too. Just great in letting them know what we are trying
to do, I'm trying to do as a coach, not so much basketball but just building a
program.  
  
Thank you. Thank you very much.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Rod Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13789)

### [Jaylin Airington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33313)

### [Dedrick Basile](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30718)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
GEORGIA TECH 76, CSU Bakersfield 61  
  
COACH ROD BARNES: First of all, I would like to thank God just for giving us
an opportunity to be here. Really proud of our team for this season. We need
to give Georgia Tech some credit. They did a really good job tonight. Really
caused us a lot of problems out there.  
  
But I'm proud of our guys. I'm proud of these seniors and what they have done
for our program and for the university and for the City of Bakers field.  
  
Again, we're thankful to the NIT and committee and the way they have looked
after us and cared for us and shown great hospitality and the professionalism
that they have shown us during this journey.  
  
Q. Does anything feel differently tonight from the past three games? Any
nerves or anything at the beginning? Just seemed off-kilter from the start
compared to the last.  
JAYLIN AIRINGTON: No, just we had a sluggish start I guess. Give credit to
Georgia Tech. They were making shots, and they was just the better team
tonight.  
  
Q. Offensively, specifically, Jaylin, that offense had really caught
fire the last few games. What was the difference?  
JAYLIN AIRINGTON: I guess we saw different defenses. I guess they kept
throwing different things at us: One-three-one and then switch up to a man,
and it was just spread it out. It was just a different defense they kept
throwing at us. That's about it.  
  
Q. Only forced seven turnovers; is that just a credit to them? What did
you see there?  
COACH ROD BARNES: Again, I think they just played well tonight. We can't take
anything from what they have done. They spread us out. They took care of the
basketball. We had some plays, there was a lot of tips that we didn't get to
tonight, and whatever reason that was.  
  
But again, they are a good basketball team. They have been playing well down
the stretch just like we were, and tonight was their game. The pace was their
game. The flow was their game. They are a good enough team that we couldn't
turn it around.  
  
Q. Seems like the last few years, it's always been a team of firsts, and
this is the first time you guys end the season at Madison Square Garden. Can
you reflect on your two years here?  
DEDRICK BASILE: My two years here has been fantastic. I'm very pleased and
grateful to be around the guys and the coaching staff that I've been around
for these two years. To just, like the way the team became a family, I mean,
it's just a crazy two years. I don't regret nothing that happened. I just love
everybody around this school. This is a great two years.  
  
Q. For both guys, what's this run been like through the NIT? You've
played on the road every game, and you got here to Madison Square Garden earn,
first 8-seed ever to get here.  
DEDRICK BASILE: It's been a great run for the team and for our program. I
mean, it just great opportunities for us, and we just came up short. We would
like to win it all, but we just ended up coming up short.  
  
JAYLIN AIRINGTON: To piggyback off what Dedrick said, it's been great to be
with these guys and the coaching staff. It's a great time on the road, on the
road a lot. We have been used to it. I'm sad it had to come to an end tonight
but I love these guys, and we're just enjoying the moment and we enjoyed the
process of the season.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that man there,
your coach.  
JAYLIN AIRINGTON: Coach Barnes, man, he's great. I don't know the words to
explain how he is. He's a man of God, first of all, and I'm grateful for him
for that, and for giving me the opportunity. I'm just blessed to be part of
his life and have him in my life. I don't know, I'm just lost for words and
I'm just grateful and thankful for to him for giving me the opportunity to
play here at Bakersfield.  
  
Q. You got to play some big-name teams. Wondering what you think this
run did for your program?  
COACH ROD BARNES: I think that people realize who we are now. We have been a
team that we felt like over the last two years, and even at the end of three
years ago, that we were making a move. The last two years, as I told our team
today, to win almost 50 games in two years is something special.  
  
I think people realize now that each team has its own, but we're building a
program, and that's where we started six years ago. I think now on a national
level, people are starting to realize we have a pretty good program there in
Bakersfield, and these guys play a huge role in it.  
  
But our administration has been really supportive of us and the community,
it's really energized our community. We feel like the next step is just for us
to keep going. We were anticipating this year being a great year, but I think
we're getting to the point where we expect a great year every year.  
  
As I challenged our guys that are coming back: We've all got to get better.
These guys have set the bar high, and it's going to take a lot of work,
determination, to keep this thing going at the level we have it now.  
  
Q. If you could reciprocate what Jaylin said, the senior class, and Matt
and Justin as well, you mentioned many times how much you enjoy being around
them, now that it's sort of finished could you reflect on it?  
COACH ROD BARNES: Well, you have kids, student athletes, that come, and they
trust you. When they trust you to come, and you have a vision and a dream,
that it's hard to see; when I asked Jaylin to come here, who was just trying
to get into a league. After Dedrick watched us play a little bit, he said,
"Coach, I can come help you." So not only just to see what they have done on
the court; I could speak of great things that have happened off the court.  
  
In our program, that's the most important thing to us. We've got young men
that are graduating; that they are good people. They will it be great
neighbors, husband or brothers, and they have grown. That's the most
satisfying and pleasing thing to me. I think when you look out on the court
and see the way they play, I think you can correlate that to what kind of
human beings they are.  
  
We had a rough, tough game tonight and Georgia Tech really caused that
somewhat but our kids continue to play and play with sportsmanship, and played
until the horn went off, and that's our expectation for them in life.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
TCU - 94, Iowa - 92 (OT)  
  
Q. Fran, would you say turnovers first half, missed free throws the
second half, two things that --  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Absolutely. I mean, you know, there's so many things to be
proud of with this team all year long, but particularly in this game. You make
16 threes, you out-rebound the opponent, shoot 54 percent, you're supposed to
win. But they got 21 points off those turnovers in the first half and we
missed 11 free throws. That just completely changed the game.  
  
Q. You guys came back multiple times, you were down 11 twice in the
second half. Even down five points with 14 to go, still had a chance to win.
What does that say about your team?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I was really proud of the way we fought all year, but in this
game, you're right. I mean, we corrected the turnover problem. We only had two
in the second half, three in overtime. Unfortunately we went back to
uncharacteristic turnovers in that overtime period, but sometimes it happens
when you get behind. You try to be aggressive.  
  
We got it to the front of the rim a couple times and didn't score, got
frustrating. But I'm just really proud of how we kept fighting, how we kept
moving the ball, sharing the ball.  
  
Q. Your point guard had 34 assists in the three last games. Seems like
he just keeps getting better, 13 today.  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Well, I think what's happening is as he has gained experience,
he's figuring out exactly how to make those kinds of plays. You know, in the
beginning, he's coming off the bench, and then he's starting, but he just
earned a starting spot, and he's trying to run the play we call.  
  
I remember the Indiana game when he tried to run a play, and he turned it over
because they took him out of it, and then later on he just went and made a
great play, and so I think he's got that figured out now, okay, when to stick
with the play, when to just go because of how they're playing him or they're
playing the guy he's trying to throw the ball to, essentially what he did on
the last play of the game.  
  
I give him that kind of latitude to make those kinds of decisions, and you're
seeing a guy who's just enjoying that freedom and the benefit of his
experience I think at this point.  
  
Q. Jamie said he felt like they played good defense, you guys just
played good offense and made shots. How would you analyze how you guys played
defense? Was it similar, you guys were just making shots?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: No, I think our defense wasn't as connected as it needed to
be. In the beginning they were driving the ball to the basket, and we didn't
have a lot of rim protection. Most of Baer's blocked shots I think were in the
second half if I'm not mistaken. So we've either got to take a charge or we've
got to block a shot.  
  
Again, we really were trying to force tempo, and we made a couple crazy
turnovers in the beginning that led to baskets for them, and that was
unfortunate. But you know, they were running a lot of screen roll. We were
helping, but we weren't helping the helper. Again, that comes down to being
connected, so you've got to help the helper, help the helper, help the helper,
and that's what the rotations come from. When you have a team that shoots it
that well from three and has a 6'11" center that can catch and finish and
score off either shoulder, they've got you all spread out. It's going to
require us to recognize where do I have to be, does Jordan need help on
penetration, where is my shooter? We try to get into gaps and do some one-way
close-outs, but we got caught staring at the ball a few times.  
  
Q. Cook had trouble getting going, had some turnovers, but at the end of
regulation he came through. Is that a sign of maturity?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Yeah, I'm always going to go back with him. He was really out
of sorts in the beginning of the game. He was fumbling the ball, and it's
reflected in his turnover numbers. But what's been impressive about him is
when he's struggled like that, as long as I go back to him, he'll come back
and he still ends up with 16 and 5. Shot 7 for 7, so he was really a very
effective player in the game. I thought he got some big-time traffic rebounds
late. I thought defensively he was better late. A lot of guys can't do that.
Once they're sideways, that's it. You can't put them back in. But he knows I'm
going to put him back in. I have confidence in him, and little by little,
he'll get it figured out.  
  
Q. Your defense, I know it's not the way you wanted to end the season,
but how far did you guys come with the young group on the floor?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Well, I think a long way. If you remember, and not many people
in this room were in Florida. Our defense in Florida was as bad as I've ever
been around. I felt terrible that my staff and I hadn't done a better job
getting those guys to play better defense. You know, we were scoring the ball.
Obviously didn't do it against Virginia but did it against Memphis and some
other games. We couldn't stop anybody; couldn't stop them in transition,
couldn't stop them in zone, couldn't stop them in man. I thought the Iowa
State game was a turning point for us, and our defense became better. We were
really locked into the game plan. I think they did a much better job as the
season progressed in that area.  
  
Came apart a couple times on the road in the Big Ten early. Sometimes you've
got to learn from that. And from that point forward, we were a lot better.
Today we didn't get much from our changing defenses. We didn't get many
turnovers. They handled the ball well. They've got a lot of guards that can
pass and catch, and they've got a lot of shot makers.  
  
Q. What's your final memory going to be of Peter Jok?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: The thing about Pete that I love, and a lot has been said and
written that he's here because I stuck with him. What I said to him just now,
I said, Pete, you stuck with yourself. He had a tough journey. It was well
over 12 months. When he came back, he was not himself. He did not look good. I
was at the game and saw him get a shot blocked by a six-foot guy, and he was
as down as he could be, wondered if you could ever put it together, and he
just kept working. I had seen him before and knew he could play, and we stuck
with him, but he stuck with himself, kept working, and ends up leading the
state in scoring, Mr. Basketball, and the rest is history, comes here and has
a fabulous career. So I'm really proud of him, and again, when you get to know
somebody like you do in recruiting, his character is tremendous, and I said to
him, I said, a lot of the players in this room are here because you hosted
them on their visit. They all wanted to play with Pete. They all respected
Pete. They all listened to what he had to say, and as a coaching staff, you
really appreciate that.  
  
Leadership manifests itself in a lot of different ways. It's in practice, it's
in the locker room, it's on the road, it's in tight games, but it's in the
off-season, and it's in recruiting. What do we do off the floor? What do we do
to stay connected as a group in the off-season? And he's always been a guy
that's in the gym all the time, so they just follow his lead, and our guys are
in the gym all the time. That's why we have the practice facility. That's made
a tremendous difference in our ability to build this program.  
  
Q. What did you think of the crowd?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Oh, the crowd was fabulous. It was electric. It was -- I mean,
they were all in every possession. I think that's what you appreciate as a
player and as a coach. You know, they didn't just cheer when we made a run.
They cheered the whole game, every time we did something well, when we got
behind, and that's what you need. You need that energy level then, and that's
what I'm so thankful for, for this crowd these last two games and all season.  
  
Q. When you look big picture, you had to replace 392 starts coming into
this year, you had five, maybe six freshmen coming in. It's going to be a
journey. It's going to be a climb --  
FRAN McCAFFERY: That's exactly what it was. You're absolutely right. That's
exactly what it was. There's incredible highs and some lows, and you think a
guy turned the corner and then he starts making some freshman mistakes again.
The key is to stay positive with them. Challenge them, hold them accountable,
which I did early, a couple timeouts I got after them pretty good, but then
come back and put your arms around them and trust them, give them another
shot, and you know they're going to keep getting better, and I think we've
seen tremendous growth from a very young team because we've got a lot of guys
that were freshmen, we've got a lot of guys that were sophomores and didn't
play a lot because of those 392 starts that you're referring to. Look at Baer
and Ahmad Wagner in particular, Brady Ellingson. Those guys all had tremendous
years, and they're just going to keep getting better.  
  
Q. What do you tell the younger guys after this game wraps up?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I'm proud of them, I love them, and we've got to go back to
work. You know, we're not going to take any time. We're going to get back in
the gym. We've got an opportunity I think to have a really good team, but the
only way that's going to happen is if we keep fighting and keep working, and
it starts immediately. Off-season conditioning, summer workouts, we get extra
practices and we're going to take our team overseas. That will be an
opportunity for us to grow together, to assimilate our new players into that
group, and play some games overseas, and I think as a result, we'll benefit
greatly.  
  
Q. Was a big part of this year unexpected for you, or did they kind of
play about how you thought?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I don't know that I ever -- I think a lot of people say, hey,
what was your expectation for wins and losses. I don't ever have an
expectation for that. What I have an expectation for is we're going to play a
certain way and individuals are going to play a certain way, and it's my job
to get them to play to their potential, and how you do that is you coach each
player individually. You don't scream and yell at all of them. You don't say
one thing and assume -- everybody is different. They have different
personalities, different games, different strengths and weaknesses, so you try
to get the best out of each one, so collectively the group becomes better.  
  
And then self-evaluate, that if I'm not doing a good enough job, my staff is
not doing a good enough job, what do we have to do to help them. A lot of
coaches throw everything on them. We're all in this together, and it's my
responsibility to take care of that.  
  
And so I would say this: I really appreciated how they responded to me and my
staff all year long. They kept grinding and kept trying to get better, so I
think ultimately that would be my expectation, that regardless of whether
we're 5-5, 8-5, three-game losing streak, we're going to keep grinding and
we're going to keep concentrating on the game plan, stay true to the game
plan, and be a great teammate that helps the guy next to him. And that's what
we'll keep trying to do.  
  
Q. What did you think of Dom Uhl's contribution?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Dom was great tonight, and he wasn't so great when I first put
him in. I didn't leave him in very long, in his defense, but I thought
defensively, offensively, he was terrific. I'm really proud of him.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
TCU - 94, Iowa - 92 (OT)  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, I think you saw two very good teams, that both programs,
both schools are excited about the future. Obviously they have so many good
young players, Iowa, and so do we, and just a shootout, a shootout.  
  
I thought we guarded them pretty good, and they shot 54 percent. Jok, I'm not
giving you any news, he's really good. You guys knew that. I wish you had told
me beforehand. Bohannon is terrific. Baer is really good.  
  
We found a way, and we've been doing that lately, and that's called growing
up. That's what we did.  
  
Liked what we did offensively. We shot 51 percent. We had 26 assists. We said
let's get 20 tonight, and it was just two good offensive teams going at it. I
don't know that our defense was that bad. They made shots. It was a great game
all the way down through. Two really good programs that have great futures
ahead of them.  
  
Q. Every time Iowa seemed to take a big advantage in the first half, you
guys came back with an 8-0 run or something like that. What does that say for
the growth of the your program?  
JAMIE DIXON: I thought Alex was terrific. Obviously the 11 assists, constantly
in the lane. We played him 44 minutes. We rode him, rode him and rode him, put
him in ball screen situations, and let him get in the lane.  
  
That was where we were going, but I thought Kenrich did some great things and
Brandon was huge for us. Offensively we just responded, like you said. I
thought we had some good defensive possessions, and I mean, I really just
thought they were making shots. I mean, tough shots, and our defense was
pretty good on times when they made shots.  
  
Just two teams going at it and fighting and battling and playing for their
lives but playing for their futures because I think both are very good.  
  
Q. 52 points in the paint. What were you able to exploit inside?  
JAMIE DIXON: You know, Brodz, he's an all-eight guy, and we spread the floor.
I think we made shots early so that meant they had to guard the three. I think
Brandon making some shots spread the floor for us, Parrish. So when he does
that, it kind of opens it up a bit, and then obviously Alex's penetration, he
gets to the lane, Brodz finishes. I thought that was huge, and we want to get
some put-backs, too, as well. We didn't get a lot of those, but we didn't miss
a lot of shots, either.  
  
But yeah, it's something we emphasize because we want to get there and we want
to drive it, and we got some good minutes out of a lot of guys.  
  
Q. Why didn't you use -- you had a foul to give right at the end --  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, we used one, but I don't think we could have fouled at the
end, on the missed shot at the very end? In overtime, the rule has changed.
It's three in overtime, so we weren't, and we could have possibly used it in
the regulation, and we used one, and the second one we left it up to our
players and probably didn't do a good job of that. Maybe I should have used
it. I thought it was where we wanted to be. We didn't want Bohannon beating
us, we didn't want Jok beating us, and we've just got to play better defense.
But they're hard to guard, and they can really get it going, and they got it
going tonight.  
  
Q. With Jaylen out, obviously you needed Alex to step up, and he did.
What about Desmond?  
JAMIE DIXON: Desmond was terrific. I thought he was passing up some threes
early and driving, and we told him to shoot the ball. He had a big three in
the second half. But obviously the free throws are huge. He was steady. I've
been saying we've got to get him more minutes, but with Alex, Jaylen and
Kenrich, it leaves us some, but obviously you knew he was going to make the
free throws because he just did on national TV and made three in a row against
Kansas. He's a grown-up freshman, as we say. I thought he played pretty good
defense, too, and that's something we've been striving to get out of him, but
a really good guy to pick up in April, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Was this one of Alex's best all-around games?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think so. I think he played pretty good defense, too. We put
him on Bohannon. I say that, and the guy had 25, but a lot of them were in
transition, and we switched on that play at the end and it wasn't him guarding
him when he hit the three in the deep corner, and the one he hit at the end.
He had six in the last minute or so.  
  
Those deep threes -- I thought he played really well, and we'd like to
continue using him and get him rested for Tuesday, just getting everybody
shots, but 11 assists speaks volumes.  
  
This is an unbelievable environment, an unbelievable place. I've always heard
it is. And Fran is a great coach. I thought it was a great game, obviously.
Thank you for the opportunity.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_De Moines, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 87, South Dakota - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach.  
  
COACH McCAFFERY: I want to thank our fans for showing up the way they did. We
had a couple days to sell tickets. I'm not surprised, they've always done
this.  
  
Had great impact on our energy level, our ability to keep coming. Just very
thankful. I know the players and the coaches really appreciate that kind of
support. That was an unbelievable atmosphere in here tonight, and we're very
thankful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. 59 points out of the freshmen tonight. When you get into a tournament
like this, is this exactly what you're looking for, for them to get that
experience in the post-season?  
COACH McCAFFERY: What I'm looking for is to try to win the game. Truthfully
I'm not thinking about who's scoring, what year they're in. I'm not trying to
be disrespectful. That's the farthest thing from my thought process.  
  
I go to those guys because they produce. I don't consider them freshmen any
more anyway. Those guys have been through a lot.  
  
Q. Is this the Tyler Cook you thought you would see all year? Injury
kind of set him back.  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think that set him back a little bit defensively. I wasn't
seeing it defensively early. So consequently, he was in foul trouble. He was a
little bit late on rotations, whether we were pressing or whether we were man
or zone.  
  
So as he's had a chance to mature through experience, he's affecting the game
at both ends. You're also seeing it reflected in his rebounding totals, his
rebounding numbers. At the beginning of the year he wasn't getting eight, ten
rebounds like he is now.  
  
Q. (Question regarding Isiah.)  
COACH McCAFFERY: Especially because Pete was in foul trouble. I've been trying
to get Isaiah to consistently play with that level of aggressiveness. When he
does, we're a better team. And he does more things. I mean, defensively he
makes more plays. I want to see him keep playing like that.  
  
Q. 21 assists in the last two games for Jordan. How much has he matured
as a pure point guard?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think the great thing about him tonight was they really
came after him. They were trapping him as much as they could. He really had to
work, especially in the first half. But he just kept going. He's really smart.  
  
They were up into him. He just would go. That's when you make plays for
people. He got a few layups. We got him on the backdoor the one time.  
  
So he's just going to keep coming. He's a tough guy. He's also really smart.
He knows who's with him and how to get those guys the ball, what we need to be
done.  
  
It makes a difference for everybody out there when you have a guy that thinks
like that.  
  
Q. The pressure Peter gets when he was up top. Is that the most he faced
all season, Jordan?  
COACH McCAFFERY: No, he's faced that quite a few times. I don't know, they
trapped him a lot. But he's been trapped before. Sometimes they switch.
Sometimes they trap. Sometimes they shut out.  
  
But he is a target. He has been a target for a while now.  
  
Q. Seemed like Ahmad's energy was huge.  
COACH McCAFFERY: Right when we needed it. You're absolutely right. He got on
the glass defensively. Made a couple baskets. Transition basket was huge.
Really got the crowd going.  
  
When he's playing like that, we're a lot better.  
  
Q. Anything special you told them at halftime?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I don't think so. I really don't. I mean, we try to evaluate
the first half. What worked? What didn't work? Did they do something we
weren't expecting? Who is hurting us? Are we going to go man, zone, press?
What are we going to run offensively? We just kind of reviewed some things
that we thought needed to be reminded. Just wanted to compete.  
  
Q. The hustle plays that Ahmad made, one point he had two, going out of
bounds, he saved one, scored off of it. You've talked a little bit about him,
but...  
COACH McCAFFERY: That's kind of what you expect from him. That's what his game
is. He's smart. He's athletic. He can guard smaller guys, bigger guys.  
  
You expect him to make that kind of impact. Especially if we're struggling
offensively at any point in time, you want him to make those plays defensively
and get us some second shots back.  
  
There's nothing worse than having to play two or three possessions.  
  
Q. (Question about turnovers.)  
COACH McCAFFERY: I was more upset about the 10 turnovers in the first half
than I was six in the second half. That's a reasonable number. Maybe one too
many.  
  
When a team is pressing, a team is doubling, you're going to turn it over a
few times.  
  
We had some chances in the first half, I thought, in transition. We jammed it
in a few times, came up with nothing.  
  
Q. Looked like you really controlled the boards in the second half.  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think the first half was pretty even, if I'm not mistaken.
The second half was a lot better.  
  
Q. Is that one of the biggest keys for your success?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Well, it has to be because, you know, that's going to trigger
our break. We played a lot of zone in the second half. You got to rebound out
of the zone, especially with this kind of team because they have slashing
rebounders. Mooney is going to shoot, Burch-Manning, Flack, those guys are
going to go, Hurst.  
  
They're going to knife in from various parts in the floor. I thought we did a
much better job. Then we got out and ran.  
  
Q. After Indiana, did you challenge them specifically on the glass?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I would say it was a lot more than that. I thought
defensively we weren't where we needed to be against Indiana. We weren't
connected at all. Obviously rebounding is a part of that.  
  
So I just felt like we needed to be a little bit better in that area. We let
Indiana do some things that they like to do. You've got to try to take that
stuff away. We didn't do that. That's disappointing.  
  
Again, it's another part of the journey where you learn, grow. Sometimes you
have to fail to come back and get it right.  
  
Q. TCU coming in Sunday. A little more time between games than in a
normal tournament setting.  
COACH McCAFFERY: I haven't seen anything. I'll watch them tonight. We'll get
it figured out. I know this, they're very good. I know Coach Dixon. I know
Jamie. I've coached against him in the past when he was at Pitt.  
  
Really good team there, really good guards. Just beat Kansas in the Big 12
tournament, I know that. We got our hands full.  
  
Q. Turnovers in the first half, were the guys pressing a little bit too
much?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I don't think they were pressing. I think you have to give
credit to our opponent there. We talk all the time about what we don't do,
what we should have done. But sometimes your opponent takes you out of some
things. They knew some of our sets. They were trying to go after certain guys,
make it hard for them.  
  
So, yeah, I just respect them.  
  
Q. You talk about the journey. If you can get a 20th win on Sunday, does
that mean anything, or is that just a number?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I think it's just a number. I mean, I just want our guys to
keep winning. I want them to experience winning and success.  
  
They really work hard. They're a terrific group of young men that have
tremendous character. They bring it for me every day. There's no issues with
this team. No selfishness at all. Those are the kind of teams you want to keep
winning.  
  
We're going to try to do everything we can as coaches to prepare them to play
a really good team. In conjunction with our fans, hopefully get it done.  
  
Q. Bubble teams have a history of coming out flat in the NIT. How proud
are you of your guys playing hungry, hustling?  
COACH McCAFFERY: I am very proud. I quite frankly would have been very shocked
if they didn't do that. I mean, just knowing this group the way that I do, I
felt like they would come out and play this way with tremendous fight.  
  
I think when we prepared for this team, they recognize, okay, this team won a
championship, they won a regular-season championship. They're a 20-win team.
They're a championship team, okay?  
  
So what comes with that is an element of respect. So we respected our
opponent. We fought. We got the job done. That's what you want to do.  
  
Q. How much can a tournament run help a young roster?  
COACH McCAFFERY: Oh, it helps it tremendously. But, again, we just look at we
have to win Sunday. I'm not looking at, Let's get a long run. Everybody wants
to have a long run. You can't have a long run if you don't win the next game.  
  
All we were looking at is this game, then we'll look at TCU. Hopefully we can
look back on a long run. If you start thinking about a long run now, you won't
have one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH McCAFFERY: Thank you.

# [NCAA 2017 BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+2017+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2017

  

### [Mark Hollis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29496)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: Good evening, everyone. Appreciate your patience tonight on a
day that's been exciting. I know you're anxious to talk to Mark Hollis.  
  
A reminder that a transcript of today's call, as is the case with all
transcripts from press conferences throughout the NCAA Division I Men's
Basketball Championship, will be housed at www.NCAA.com/Transcripts.  
  
This will be the only media opportunity for Mark Hollis before he heads to
Dayton for the First Four. Mark will be in Atlanta with us for the start of
the first round on Thursday.  
  
Without further ado, we will turn it over to the media to ask any questions
you might have of Mark Hollis.  
  
Q. Mark, I'm curious if you can break down the seed list that concerns
the Big East. It's pretty clear that Marquette, Xavier and Providence probably
caused you some trouble.  
MARK HOLLIS: I think as you go through the Big East situation, many teams very
comparable. We looked at the interchange between each of the different
programs there. Remember, we don't look at them as conference programs, per
se. But obviously very comparable résumés as we were going through that
situation.  
  
I don't know if you have anything specific that you want to ask relative to
them.  
  
Q. Providence beat Marquette twice. They only played twice. They were a
full line ahead of Providence. Providence goes to the First Four and they do
not.  
MARK HOLLIS: As you know, being from Providence, it's a unique situation in
that Providence was out of the First Four. Rhode Island was in as an at-large.
By winning the AQ, that's what positioned Providence to play there.  
  
Specific to the numbers, I think as we were looking through different teams in
this framework, they were so incredibly close. I think that's part of what's
making the seed selection so difficult, but also the tournament so
competitive.  
  
Q. Mr. Hollis, unless I'm missing something, it looks to me like the
mid-majors, so-called mid majors, that received at-large bids are Saint
Mary's, VCU and Dayton. Was there a feeling this year that the mid-majors just
weren't measuring up as they might have in the past?  
MARK HOLLIS: I think one of the things you have to look at, it's very
difficult to define what a mid-major is in today's world. At the same time, of
the 32 tournaments, 20 of them were won by the No. 1 seed or the co-champion
in those conferences. You had a lot of quality teams percolating up and
winning conference titles and getting the AQs.  
  
That would have an impact, as I mentioned as far as the competitive nature of
the tournament, but also those teams that would be available for at-large
selection.  
  
Q. Mark, with the big storm coming to the East Coast, have you changed
any sort of travel arrangements for the teams?  
MARK HOLLIS: The answer to that question is we're concerned about Buffalo.
We've been reminded of this, number one is safety, it's of the foremost
protocol.  
  
The process is to try to get everyone in early. We're making maneuvers to do
that at this point in time with our travel agent, reaching out to teams,
officials, and publicly to fans, that if you're headed to Buffalo, that would
be a location that you want to watch the weather, you want to be safe, and
make those arrangements.  
  
The NCAA staff, JoAn Scott, Dan Gavitt, are working at this time in efforts to
ensure that safety is at the forefront, that getting the teams into those
locations is handled.  
  
Q. You talked on the CBS show, about Duke. Can you rehash that, starting
on the 4 seed line, weren't able to get higher than the third spot.  
MARK HOLLIS: As you look at the procedures, we don't start seeding on Sunday.
We start selecting teams and seeding on Wednesday.  
  
When Duke came onto the line, they were on the 4 line. I believe they were the
first team on the 4 line. Throughout the week, they picked up a number of
neutral-site, top-25 wins, three of them, which has an impact on scrubbing.  
  
'Scrubbing' is a comparison of one team against another, providing an
opportunity for those teams to move up and down the seed line.  
  
Duke, I believe, was the team that moved the most. Arizona moved along in
similar fashion from the 3 line. They were stopped by Kentucky.  
  
As you look at the 2 line, Kentucky stopped Arizona, Arizona stopped Duke, and
neither Duke nor Arizona were compared directly with any team that was sitting
on the 1 line.  
  
It's not a situation where we come in on Sunday and look at everything with a
clean slate. These are the procedures that we follow. Those procedures are
reviewed every summer. But feel very good about how they've played out, in a
good position.  
  
Q. This year there was supposedly a softer bubble. Syracuse's résumé is
either similar or maybe a little better than the one it had last year. Correct
me if I'm wrong on that. How much did Jim Boeheim's nine-game suspension come
into play last year, because many of Syracuse's bad losses a year ago were
when Jim was under suspension?  
MARK HOLLIS: Well, first of all, there's no comparison to last year. We don't
do those comparisons, nor was that a conversation at all in this deliberation.
Every year is a different year. We looked at this one straightforward.  
  
Syracuse had some good wins. I think you're also probably aware of the
challenges that they had in their résumé, both with wins out of the Carrier
Dome, but also the losses against teams that they had that weren't tournament
teams, going 8-5 in the non-conference with a non-conference strength of
schedule of 215.  
  
Those were challenges for this year. Anything relative to last year, nothing
was even discussed.  
  
Q. I didn't mean to compare necessarily this year to last year. I was
mainly wondering, going back to last year, how much was Jim Boeheim's
suspension really a factor?  
MARK HOLLIS: Like any conversation you're going to have with either a player
or coach availability, it's something that committee members are aware of.  
  
I can speak honestly in talking last year, not a major conversation. We were
looking at neutral wins that they had last year, the road win at Duke last
year. Those were things that were relatively significant that didn't exist on
this year's résumé.  
  
Not a major conversation whatsoever, but awareness.  
  
Q. Mark, I'm calling from Louisville. Louisville didn't have a ton of
great wins away from home. Obviously their strength of schedule was highly
rated. How did you approach them in terms of ranking them where you did and
giving them a 2 seed?  
MARK HOLLIS: Well, I think, again, they came in I believe on the 2 line. It
was something that we hit on the front end.  
  
As you look at their résumé, as you look at basically 50 and beyond, no
losses, no bad losses whatsoever. You look at road wins that they did have,
winning at Pitt, winning at Syracuse, both top-100 wins.  
  
Also having the win at home with Duke, having the win at home with Kentucky.
Those were very significant wins with a 4 and a 6.  
  
Those were the factors.  
  
They also, I believe, beat the Big Ten champ, Purdue, which was a top-20 win
for them. Wichita State is another team in the tournament. Neutral-site win.  
  
You kind of go through those résumés, look at where they had wins, where were
their bad losses, if any, which they did not have any.  
  
Like some other teams, you want to take a look at who did they schedule.
Strength of schedule overall was a 2. Strength of schedule in non-conference,
I believe they were ranked about 5.  
  
Those are very strong indicators. Who did you schedule, who did you beat, and
where did you play. Those are the things we looked at. Louisville came out
high on the committee's votes.  
  
Q. Mark, how long did Monmouth stay in the conversation? At what point
were they eliminated from the conversation?  
MARK HOLLIS: They were not on the under consideration board at all. They were
not voted onto the under consideration, so they were not discussed.  
  
Q. Mark, the deal about who you played, when you played them, where the
game was, if you beat them, that kind of mantra. Again, getting back to the
Duke thing. They have more top-25 RPI wins and more top-50 RPI wins than
anybody. Why were they blocked moving up, based on that, forget what they did
in the ACC tournament, it seems their body of work, doesn't it compare to
almost any team in the country?  
MARK HOLLIS: Yeah, they have a very good résumé, obviously. They were a fifth
seed in the ACC regular season. That's something that we're aware of in that
process.  
  
It's a matter of putting résumés against each other. I don't, unfortunately,
have them in front of me right now. But as you take the vote of the committee,
what they're looking at are all the things that we just mentioned.  
  
As they were moving up against the progression line, we're aware of things
that happened, games that took place throughout the season. That's where the
vote stopped.  
  
With a scrubbing process, that's how it works. That's how the procedures work.  
  
It's not a head-to-head with anyone up there. But as you look, Arizona State
and Kentucky both won their regular season and their tournament. Committee
members can take that into consideration as they're going through the process.  
  
Q. Also the idea of geographical placement.  
MARK HOLLIS: I meant Arizona and Kentucky.  
  
Q. Right. Geographic placement, try to keep teams close to their
locations. If you just look at the top two lines, 1 through 8, the 2 line
doesn't match up with the 1 line. Are we really talking analog versus digital
here, having what supposedly would be competitive matchups based on the seed
line, versus trying to keep teams close to home?  
MARK HOLLIS: If I understand your question, you're asking about an S-curve.  
  
Q. The seed list you put out, if it was just the top eight teams, it's
obvious how it would match up.  
MARK HOLLIS: There is not an S-curve that's used. There is a protocol that the
first 1 not play the first 2.  
  
What we look at is conference affiliation and geography. Those are the two
components. So as you're going through each line, on the top four lines, the
first four teams that come out of any conference are in separate regions. You
have to take that as a given. Then what you do is take the first team out of
each line, and you give them geographical preference.  
  
The only caveat I'll go back to is the top 1 not playing the overall 5 or the
top 2. There is not an S-curve, per se, provision. Things we protect are not
moving teams up and down seed lines. We have provided geographical preference
based upon the principles that have been put in place.  
  
Q. Mark, again, the broader mid-major at-large question. I have no doubt
you did what you were supposed to do, and probably arrived at the right teams.
I was wondering if you could additionally put on your athletic director hat.
You know what it's like to run an athletic department. Yours has more
resources than most mid-major schools do. Is there ever a part of you that at
least sympathizes with the fact that it does seem like mid-majors are having
something of a tough time of securing those at-large bids?  
MARK HOLLIS: Well, again, I represent a total of 10 members of the NCAA
committee that come from very diverse backgrounds, very different schools. I
also worked in the Western Athletic Conference back in the day that was
challenged in similar ways.  
  
I will say there are teams that have found successful ways to go about and
have been rewarded in the tournament. You can look at different examples, as
you go through the seed line, on teams that have reached out.  
  
What the committee is looking for is something to provide a comparison against
other teams that are being under consideration for the tournament.  
  
I would say it wouldn't take much. But if you want to ask about a specific
school, I'd be happy to go into it.  
  
You have to have something that gives you the opportunity to do some of those
comparisons, programs that have done it have been recognized and have been
rewarded in the tournament process over the years.  
  
Q. Mark, a couple Big Ten questions. I know you start seeding on
Wednesday. Did Michigan move up through the week? Were they at the 7 this
morning? Could that championship game have much effect?  
MARK HOLLIS: They were not at the 7 this morning. That game basically created
a switch between Wisconsin and Michigan from the 7 and 8 lines.  
  
Q. That's a case where you have two different brackets?  
MARK HOLLIS: We had a total of eight brackets that were built, but had
contingencies to build up to 25. As games were being played out throughout
Sunday, we were able to back off some of those.  
  
Q. Michigan State. Obviously you can't be in on any of those
conversations. What kind of feedback were you given from the other members
once they were placed in their spot?  
MARK HOLLIS: None.  
  
Q. They don't offer that for you at all?  
MARK HOLLIS: No. I think they give an update. It's from a standpoint of it's
best. We have a number of committee members that had teams that are in the
conversation. In order to keep open dialogue, there's not a situation or an
environment where you can come in and they're going to say, This is what
they're saying about you. That's not the way this committee works, nor should
it work.  
  
Duke, Kentucky, Creighton, myself, we step out of the room. When we come back,
we're provided information in order that we can move forward with
conversations of other teams that are around us.  
  
But specific to Michigan State, I was not provided with any information, nor
did I expect any in the process.  
  
Q. Mark, historically we hear from the committee where they emphasize
quality wins. Syracuse this year had six wins against teams in the top 50.
Southern Cal only had two. Kansas State four. With those facts in mind, what
put Kansas State and USC ahead of Syracuse?  
MARK HOLLIS: I'm going to pull in the mid-major question at the same time.
It's what you do with your opportunities.  
  
As you look at Kansas State, they had three wins away from home against
tournament teams, including two through road wins. While their RPI was around
57, they were considered significantly higher in other metrics. But the three
wins away from home, a significant consideration for Kansas State.  
  
With USC, they had a 6-5 record on the road. Recognizing that half of those
were against teams that were 200 and higher, they also had two in the top 100
that gave them an edge over other teams under consideration.  
  
USC also had the situation with a student-athlete that was injured, Bennie
Boatright, during February. He's come back and is making significant
contributions there.  
  
Those were the things that the committee talked about prior to them making
their votes in that process.  
  
Q. Mark, I want to clarify what you were saying before about Arizona.
Were they on the 3 line entering the week? Also, going into the Pac-12
tournament, did you have all three of those teams in a pretty comparable start
where the winner would be in the West as the 2?  
MARK HOLLIS: I can't draw conclusions because we didn't do the votes. But
Arizona did start in the middle of the 3 line and ended up as the overall 6 on
the 2 line.  
  
Obviously being a co-champion during the regular season, and the tournament,
that was discussed in the room, along with other teams that had done something
similar: Villanova, Gonzaga, Kentucky. Kansas and North Carolina both won
their regular seasons, as well.  
  
Those were things that were discussed as sort of secondary components, but
Arizona did move up from the middle of the 3 line.  
  
Q. Is that unusual and/or is it more difficult or easy when you have
three teams with similar résumés entering the championship week?  
MARK HOLLIS: We had several of those in different leagues. It is challenging.
It's especially challenging when games end on Sunday.  
  
What you're looking at is the full résumés. I think there's a pretty good
indication of, in some cases, those teams that rise up.  
  
Another thing with Arizona is all their losses came to top-16 teams on the
RPI. So as you're looking through those, they're rising, they get the wins on
the neutral court against pretty good teams in the tournament, with Oregon and
UCLA. That helped bring them up.  
  
Those were pretty big moves by both Duke and Arizona historically when you're
looking at the scrubbing process.  
  
Q. In evaluating all these teams, being as the Final Four hasn't been in
the West for 20 some years, what is the mood, the feeling, of you and the
committee? Can one or two of these teams out West make it?  
MARK HOLLIS: Can one or two of the teams make it where? One is going to make
it.  
  
Q. To the Final Four, based on your evaluations. Have you seen a year
like this where you have a fair amount of contenders out West like that?  
MARK HOLLIS: I've had the opportunity to see Gonzaga play. I've seen Saint
Mary's play live. I've seen UCLA, as well. Very good basketball being played.  
  
I guarantee you one of the teams out of the West Region will make it to the
Final Four. But they're very good teams, very good teams, very good basketball
being played.  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: As there are no more questions, we want to thank everyone for
joining us this evening. We hope you enjoy the start of March Madness, which
is Tuesday night with the First Four from Dayton, Ohio. Enjoy March Madness,
and we'll see you on the road to the Final Four.

# [NCAA 2017 BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+2017+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Mark Hollis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29496)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's
Division I men's basketball call with committee chair Mark Hollis. We want to
extend our appreciation especially to everyone on the West Coast who is up
early this morning to join us.  
  
Transcripts will be posted at www.ncaa.com/transcripts. That same site will
house all of the game-day and off-day press conference transcripts at each of
the 14 sites from the First Four through the Final Four.  
  
The selection show will air Sunday at 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. eastern time on CBS.  
  
The tournament begins with the First Four on Tuesday night in Dayton, all four
games, two on Tuesday, two more on Wednesday, will be aired on truTV.  
  
Then TBS, CBS, TNT and truTV will carry first- and second-round games
throughout the day and night Thursday through Sunday, March 16th to 19th. TBS
and CBS will provide regional coverage Thursday through Sunday, March 23rd to
26th. CBS will carry the three Final Four games, April 1st and 3rd, when we
will crown our 79th national champion.  
  
In addition, the selection show and all 67 games of the tournament can be
heard on Westwood One Radio. You can watch all the games on your laptop,
tablet, and other mobile devices, via the March Madness Live app.  
  
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hollis, the director of
athletics at Michigan State University, and the chair of the 2017 Division I
Men's Basketball Committee.  
  
MARK HOLLIS: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time today. This is
the second year in a row that the selection meeting is taking place at the
Marriott Marquis in New York City. It is here in Times Square, where I'm
sitting now.  
  
Soon my colleagues on the Committee will start our meeting by submitting an
initial ballot which will result in several teams being voted immediately into
the field, and several others will be under consideration for the tournament
inclusion over the course of the next few days.  
  
As you know, last month the Committee took the unprecedented step of revealing
to the public our top 16 teams in a show that aired on CBS on February 11th.
This was a great exercise for the Committee, and it generated considerable
positive attention over the last few weeks.  
  
Even if some people didn't agree with the teams or the seeds, we believe an
overwhelming percentage of people found it to be educational. It certainly
generated excitement, and that is a positive thing.  
  
However, it's important to stress that today, March 8th, is day one of
Selection Week. We are starting anew, meaning today is a restart of our
season-long evaluation of teams. It's not a refresh of the work we did nearly
four weeks ago.  
  
Too much has happened since February 11th. In fact, since the bracket preview
show aired, roughly 1300 games have been played. Some of those games were
played in conference tournaments in recent days, and the Committee
congratulates East Tennessee State, Florida Gulf Coast, Gonzaga, Iona,
Jacksonville State, Mount St. Mary's, North Carolina Wilmington, Northern
Kentucky, South Dakota State, Wichita State, and Winthrop, on being the first
11 teams to punch their ticket to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Interestingly enough, seven of those teams were regular-season champions or
co-champions. Two other leagues that are in the championship stage of their
tournament also feature the No. 1 seeds, Bucknell in tonight's Patriot League
title game, and Vermont in Saturday's America East championship game.  
  
This is drastically different patterns than last year when only 11 of the 31
No. 1 seeds won their conference tournaments. It demonstrates just how
different each year is. It also is a reminder that regular-season conference
champions are automatically added to the 'under consideration' board, which
will be populated later this afternoon when we cast our initial ballots.  
  
With that said, we want to wish good luck to the remaining teams playing in
their league tournaments over the next five days, and we're now prepared to
answer questions that you may have.  
  
Q. Just wanted to check in, give us an update of how you think things
are going with the Final Four so close now.  
MARK HOLLIS: Being a national tournament, it's very exciting to have the Final
Four in the West. Gives us an opportunity. The individuals there, Dawn Rogers,
is leading the charge there in Phoenix, has done a fabulous job in
coordinating all of the different sites, not just where the games will be
played at the stadium, but also all the other ancillary activities that really
surround the Final Four, from the music festivals, to the FanFest, to the
activities that fans attending a Final Four will experience.  
  
It's the best of Phoenix and the best of the Final Four coming together. I
can't say enough about the individuals in Phoenix that have put the work in to
really put forward what I think is going to be one of the great Final Fours.  
  
Q. Mark, I know you canceled your trip to bounce around to a bunch of
different games. Have you been able to go to other games? How much has some of
the stuff back in East Lansing precluded you from the Selection Committee or
have you been able to keep up with it?  
MARK HOLLIS: No, I'm keeping up with all the activities of the Committee,
observing games, watching games, as well as input here. We've been all in. I
came into New York on Saturday. I have been part of the CBS process here, as
well as the Committee launching last night, the meetings today. Full steam
ahead.  
  
Q. How has this tournament Committee been different than the other four
you've been on?  
MARK HOLLIS: Not greatly different. We have 10 members that come from a
variety of different backgrounds. Each one of us bring a different
perspective.  
  
Being in the chair role, I think you have a responsibility to lead the group.
That's what we're striving to do. But we have such great individuals that have
great basketball backgrounds, either as coaches, as former student-athletes,
around programs that have great traditions. Really, it's a great group of
leaders that we have among the 10 different members on the Committee.  
  
Q. I cover a team that's been fairly inconsistent this year. They've
been good at times, then at times not as good. I'm wondering how the Committee
tries to judge. Do you judge the good side? How do you weigh all of that in
trying to make a determination?  
MARK HOLLIS: Well, that's going to start this afternoon with all teams. Our
charge is to select the best 36 teams, based upon results. That's exactly what
we do. We look at the results of all games. It's not necessarily the most
deserving teams. It's the best teams based upon results.  
  
That's what we have to dive into. We'll do that with all teams. But while
you're focused on one team, we started with over 300, we're now trimming that
down to a manageable number. That process will start at 1:00 today when we do
the first initial ballot.  
  
Beyond the one team you're discussing, teams have ebbs and flows throughout
the year. We go through and we observe all of those.  
  
Q. You mentioned the announcement on February 11th of the top 16. If I
heard you right, you said the Committee starts anew. It's not a refresh kind
of thing off of that. What impact, if any, does the February 11th announcement
have on the Committee's work now?  
MARK HOLLIS: If you watched the CBS show, you saw me crumple up the sheet of
paper at the end of the show. That was the end of that process from the
Committee's perspective.  
  
What did it do? I think, one, it put intensity into the Committee February
11th that we haven't had in the past. I think you could look at that from both
a positive and a negative perspective.  
  
From a positive, all 10 members were really focused in, in delivering
something we knew was going to be public. It wasn't a practice round, per se,
like it had been in the past.  
  
We still kind of term it as the PSAT, where what we're starting today at 1:00
is the SAT, this is the real test.  
  
In light of the intensity on the 1 to 16, perhaps we didn't get through the
full body of what we would normally do in a practice session, or what many of
the media have had the opportunity to come in and do, be part of the mock
selection process.  
  
Our focus, while still getting the practice, was to get that 16 described as
good as we possibly could at that point in time. I think there was some pros
and cons that came out of it. We've heard them all. That will go into the
queue for next year.  
  
Q. Mark, how do you weigh a road win versus a home win, how that process
goes, particularly how it relates to the RPI? We cover Syracuse. That's a team
right now that doesn't have a good home record, but has three solid home wins
in Duke, Virginia and Florida State.  
MARK HOLLIS: Again, let me talk in general terms, which your question was
framed that way. That's great.  
  
When we're going through the process, not only for selections but also for
seeding, we're talking about teams that are very close in résumés. The
differentiation that occurs can come from a variety of areas, and it really
changes from year to year based upon the scenarios that are out there.  
  
Road games, road wins, really provide an opportunity to separate when you're
in some of those conversations. Along with that, you have opportunities to
look at head-to-head competition. You have opportunities to look at common
opponents. Those are all points that come in.  
  
I would say this, and I think your question provides an opportunity for me to
describe this, as well. Conference tournament games, while they count the same
as any other game, it provides opportunities for teams to play quality
opponents on a neutral site, and enhance their résumés possibly.  
  
Your question kind of gives the opportunity for us to talk about that
conference tournament component. It's no different than a neutral-site game
played in December or January. But it is potentially a combination of games
for individuals, neutral sites, to get that opportunity.  
  
So road wins are an important component, things that we look at very heavily,
but it's one of the components.  
  
Q. Mark, what would you say is kind of the Selection Committee's job in
picking the best at-large teams?  
MARK HOLLIS: I think you just answered the question. Our job is to pick the 36
best teams based upon results. As you go through that process, you're looking
at résumés that in some cases are different. You're looking at the number of
opportunities individual teams have against a variety of opponents.  
  
We've done a lot of work this year with the NABC forming an ad hoc group. I
want to be clear that those recommendations are things that are still ongoing.
But we still use the RPI as our sorting mechanism. That's the mechanism that
goes on the team sheets that lays out top-50 wins, top-100 wins. It goes into
that whole component.  
  
I want to emphasize the RPI is a sorting mechanism. We then dive into those
team sheets and look at virtually every variable that's out there that gives
us an opportunity to really differentiate one team versus another.  
  
The scrubbing process, for those that have gone through the mock opportunity,
is right in line with what's done there. I sort of equate it, after five
years, that the selection and seeding process is very much like a stroke play
golf tournament. Once you get to the scrubbing process, it's very much like a
match play, where you're comparing one team against another with all the
different variables to determine which team is better.  
  
So two very different processes. But selecting teams, seeding teams, then
scrubbing are the three components that we go in and play with the different
variables.  
  
Q. Mark, you said the magic word, which is 'results', not necessarily
based on predictions. This has become a little bit not so much statistical as
philosophical. You are based on results. Has there been any discussion in the
Committee about what the potential repercussions of that could be, whether
you're at risk of leaving out teams that might do better in the tournament
because you're dedicated to putting in the teams that deserve to be there
based on results?  
MARK HOLLIS: Yeah, I think one thing, to be very clear is, the principles and
procedures of selection, seeding and bracketing, items that we review every
summer, are available online publicly. That's what we follow.  
  
While following that, each Committee member has the opportunity, and has
resources available to them, to pull in. I think from my perspective, speaking
for me as one of the 10, I do look at other analytics, and I look at
variations in those to try to tell the story that allow me then to go back
into the team sheets and make some of those decisions.  
  
So it's not to say that other analytic tools aren't available to the Committee
because, indeed, they are. What I am saying is that when we do look at the
team sheets, when we are looking at results, when we make statements on
Sunday, it's going to be relative to the principles and procedures, the RPI,
that's used on the team sheets. That is the sorting mechanism that we are
currently using.  
  
I think hearing the feedback from the analytical summit that took place, there
is still much conversation and much debate on how those should be used in a
framework going forward in the future to improve. But I think your improvement
that you're looking for is miniscule. All the metrics do a reasonably or very
good job of providing a framework in which to look at teams.  
  
But at the end of the day, and the reason that we're here for so many days, is
to really dive in and look at virtually every game played by every team that's
under consideration, how that impacts the selection process.  
  
Q. Mark, coach's absences. I know there's not a blanket rule on does it
help if a coach is absent for certain games during the year, if they do come
back relatively early, you're able to see how that team looks with the coach
back, kind of with the full complement of players? Does it help if that
happens earlier?  
MARK HOLLIS: You're cutting in and out on me. Could you shorten the question.  
  
Q. When a coach is absent, is it a little bit more helpful for you when
it happens earlier in the year where there's a lot more data points and games
after the coach returns?  
MARK HOLLIS: You're talking about coach-player availability?  
  
Q. Yes.  
MARK HOLLIS: I think that's one of the more challenging things that we look
at. The one thing I would say right on the front end is coach and player
availability does not change wins to losses or losses to wins.  
  
I do know that we have an extreme database here on both scenarios, both with
coaches and student-athletes. Our objective is to determine the teams that are
coming in the tournament.  
  
To answer your question directly, I don't think there's any question that
issues that occur earlier in the season are probably more quantifiable for the
Committee to look at if there's subsequent games.  
  
But we take all of them into consideration. We have to be fair, not only to
the teams that are missing individuals, but also who they're competing
against. So those are choices that each Committee member has to take into
consideration when they're making the voting process.  
  
There's not a blanket perspective from a Committee standpoint that things move
up or down because of absences. We have to do our best assessment based upon
the information we have available.  
  
Q. You opened the call with the conference tournaments, there not being
as many 1 seeds knocked out as last year. As someone who has kept tabs on a
lot of those teams, from an athletic director's perspective, is there sympathy
for teams, for those not making the tournament after two plus months of a
great season?  
MARK HOLLIS: I can't hear you. Hang on.  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: You were asking about regular-season champions, how we feel
about their inclusion in the tournament, how they determine the automatic
qualifier?  
  
MARK HOLLIS: I got you.  
  
I think it's important to note that the NCAA, nor the Committee, determines
who the AQ is coming out of any conference. The conference sets that up. I
guess the Ivy League would be the most recent example of making a choice in
how their AQ is selected. So that's a choice of the conference.  
  
I know there's been some conversation out in the public about that process.
From our perspective, from the Committee's perspective, we accept the AQ
that's submitted forward.  
  
From an AD perspective, I was a manager for Jud Heathcote, so I value the
regular season greatly. I also see the excitement of the tournaments as being
a lead-in, giving virtually every team an opportunity to be part of the NCAA
tournament from kind of a reset standpoint.  
  
So those aren't really NCAA issues, per se. I think it's a national
conversation among conferences. We accept the AQ that's sent forward by the
leagues, based upon their protocol.  
  
Q. Mark, you mentioned you do look at your own analytics sometimes. I
heard a lot of stuff coming out of the analytical summit. Do you look at
analytics and include margin of victory, because so much is available out
there online now that includes that? I think some of the coaches, like Gregg
Marshall, start to get confused that they are maybe rated higher in some of
these ratings than they would be under the Committee's protocol.  
MARK HOLLIS: If you look at analytics, really beyond the RPI or the KPI, you
are looking at analytics that take margin of victory into consideration.  
  
Again, I can speak from my perspective. I do look at them, but I look at them
in a framework of cycling me back to the team sheets. Those team sheets are
solely RPI based or results based, and do not take it into consideration.  
  
I think there's valuable information that can come out of some of those
different metrics. As Committee members, you want to gather as much
information as you can in order to get back to the framework.  
  
There's also the concern that you're looking at too many things. As you look
at a variety of different measurements out there, I think they're almost
endless in individual comparative data that's out there. You have to kind of
frame it into something that you trust, you have some consistency with.
There's many good ones out there. Most of them are extremely accurate in
nature.  
  
Again, what I like to do, and it's just my preference, is to put up a few of
them, both results based and analytics based, and look at the variations, look
at the standard deviations, and let that allow me to cycle back and look at
certain team sheets in a little more depth than maybe I would.  
  
To answer your question, I guess that would be the margin of victory. We don't
use it in the room. But because those analytic tools use it, it would be naïve
of me to say I don't look at analytics that take that into consideration.  
  
Q. Just to be clear. I haven't take the bracket seminar since '09, which
is eight years.  
MARK HOLLIS: Time to sign back up, I think (laughter).  
  
Q. You still use the same process, right? Basically it's with the RPI as
a baseline, then expanding from there?  
MARK HOLLIS: I think at the end of the day, with all the debate that's out
there, you have to have some mechanism that allows the Committee to sort. I
keep using the words 'a sorting tool'. That's really what it is.  
  
It's not a standard where you just take the numbers and throw it out and go
with it, because there are too many variables that you have to look at, like
road wins, like strength of schedule, like neutral-site games, who did you
beat, who did you lose to. That all comes out of the sort process.  
  
It allows the Committee to have conversations on certain points about each
team, following the principles of selection and seeding, in order to get us to
the point where we can differentiate between one team and another.  
  
Q. Mark, obviously you don't use the final 12 games any more as a
standard listing. You are all human as well. You're watching more games at
this time of year than other times of the year. Do you find, with yourself,
there being some type of recency bias, you get a feel for hot teams in your
selections?  
MARK HOLLIS: Not at all. I think you phrased that in a very good way because
human nature would be to do that. That's one of the things from year one you
have to fight against.  
  
The games that are being played right now are extremely important. I want to
reemphasize the conference tournaments. While they're equal games, they're
opportunities on neutral sites to play against quality opponents. So from that
standpoint, there are games we'll obviously be watching this week in that
process.  
  
As we're going through the process, several years ago the last 10 games used
to be part of the team sheet. They no longer are. At least I do, I can speak
for myself, you look at flows throughout the year. You look at when losses
occur, where it happened, what did the scheduling sequence look like. All
those things are turned over.  
  
But within the Committee, there's no conversation about rising or falling.
It's looking at the full body of work and selecting those 36 best teams.  
  
Q. Are you looking at dates on the team sheet when things happen?  
MARK HOLLIS: Yeah, dates are available on the sheets, when games are played.
You can see that, absolutely.  
  
Q. It's obviously a different year than last year. As the vice chair
last year you had to recuse yourself from the room while the debate was up for
the No. 1 seed. You're going to have to do that again this year with the
potential for Michigan State being on the bubble. What was last year like in
that situation when you have to pull yourself away? Is there any difference in
feeling this year?  
MARK HOLLIS: Last year was a challenge I think for the whole Committee because
we had situations where Joe Castiglione, who was the chair last year, and
myself, spent a lot of time together in the room outside the room.  
  
When you're gone, I think what you miss in those conversations is a concern.
One of the things we put in place this year is kind of a reset for individuals
coming back in.  
  
We are going to have a number of situations this year with Committee members
being out of the room. Kentucky, Duke. Kevin White's son of course is the head
coach at Florida. He'll be asked to step out of the room in those
circumstances. Bruce with Creighton. Myself. Perhaps others.  
  
I think what I look at, one is a level of trust, one is a level of integrity.
It's the right thing to have individuals out of the room no matter if it's the
bubble or the 1 line.  
  
The reason for that is it allows very frank conversations to take place about
those teams. When you reenter, you're back, reengaged with the conversation
with the rest of the field.  
  
Where it is on the line I think has no difference. I always enjoy being in the
conversation more for the 1 line than the bubble. But that's the way things go
in this tournament. It's what makes it crazy.  
  
Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Look forward to an exciting week here. A lot
of conversation. Selection show on Sunday, then hopefully one of the great,
great NCAA basketball tournaments.  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: Thanks, Mark. Just a reminder that Mark will be available for
another media teleconference at 9 p.m. eastern Sunday night after the
selection show. Thanks for listening.

# [NCAA 2017 BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+2017+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## February 8, 2017

  

### [Bruce Rasmussen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32578)

### [Dan Gavitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25313)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We really
appreciate your time.  
  
We want to start off and ask for your forgiveness as we're calling a late
audible for today's teleconference. We are happy to have our vice chair, Bruce
Rasmussen, director of athletics at Creighton University; and Dan Gavitt, NCAA
senior vice president for basketball, will be joining us.  
  
I think everyone can agree Mark is one of the more accessible ADs in the
country. He will be available at a later time, but will not be available for
today's teleconference.  
  
I'll turn it over to Bruce Rasmussen for an opening comment and then we'll
take questions.  
  
Go ahead, Bruce.  
  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: Thank you, Dave. Hello, everyone, and thank you for your time
today.  
  
I'm in Indianapolis with my colleagues at the NCAA headquarters where we have
been conducting our annual Selection Committee meeting, which serves as a
refresher for us veteran committee members as well as an introduction to the
voting mechanisms and software for our two new committee members, Mitch
Barnhart of the University of Kentucky, and Paul Krebs of the University of
New Mexico.  
  
As you likely know by now, this year's orientation meeting has a new twist
since we are releasing our top 16 overall seeds for the first time ever. Those
seeds, which will be based on games through Friday, February 10th, will be
revealed Saturday on CBS at 12:30 eastern time.  
  
While we are confident Saturday's show will generate considerable discussion
about what my colleagues and I determine this week, it's important to
emphasize that every team in the country will play six or seven games apiece
between Saturday and the end of the regular season.  
  
In fact, if you estimate 300 games will be played in the 32 conference
tournaments between February 28th and March 12th, there are roughly 1,350
games to be played between Saturday and the time the bracket will be revealed
the night of Selection Sunday.  
  
The discussions we are having this week, which included a conference call late
Monday afternoon, meetings that started yesterday, and will continue until
about noon tomorrow, are in the context of Saturday being Selection Sunday.  
  
There are 343 teams eligible for this year's tournament. While the focus will
be on selecting and seeding the top 16 teams for the show, we will also go
through a full bracketing exercise. That likely means we have to expedite the
process of selecting and seeding teams, but it's more that every committee
member are comfortable with the process of selecting teams for the field,
seeding the teams, scrubbing the seed line, and putting together a full
bracket.  
  
It's commonplace for us or the staff to select the last handful of teams and
finish the seed list for us during this meeting because of time restraints,
but that needs to be done in order for us to have a full bracketing exercise.  
  
The top 16 teams, though, will be in order and bracketed based on the votes of
the committee. That's what will be shared with viewers this Saturday.  
  
As usual, it's been a fun season with a lot of storylines, and it's setting up
for another great tournament. The positive statistical trends we saw last year
have held up this season. There is a great mix of teams from all over the
country that have a shot to get to Phoenix for the Final Four, and as Saturday
proved with a record-tying six top teams losing, you never know what you're
going to get with college basketball. That's what makes it so much fun.  
  
With that, Dan Gavitt and I are ready to answer any questions you might have.  
  
Q. Obviously the whole idea that there's been so many upsets, there's no
dominant team this year, obviously that affects the top. Do you have a sense
of how much that affects the bubble at this point, whether there's some ripple
effect there?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: My sense is we're looking at a tremendous number of teams,
and the difference between the top teams and the bubble teams is really thin.
So we have to slice each of those résumés very thinly and take a look at a
number of things.  
  
But it is going to be an extremely difficult process, I think, for the
committee this year because of the parity.  
  
Q. In terms of road wins, I know everyone has their own criteria, but
how much do you individually value that as a committee member?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: I think last year 68% of the games played in Division I
basketball were won by the home team. So one of the most difficult things to
do in college basketball is to win on the road. Every committee member looks
at that a little differently. But certainly I think every committee member
values road wins.  
  
Q. I know you met with all the analytics guys. I am curious about what
are your thoughts about incorporating some of these other analytic people into
the way you're determining things this year? I know that's not supposed to
happen this year, that you'll mostly rely on the RPI. What kind of things did
the meeting generate? Specifically, what does it mean for teams that are
playing better at the end of the season in terms of predictive ways teams are
getting into the tournament?  
DAN GAVITT: The committee has for a number of years now had at its disposal a
variety of metrics to help analyze teams for selection and seeding. They
continue to use some of those metrics in that exhaustive and thorough process.  
  
As you noted, the meeting that took place here a couple of weeks ago in
Indianapolis was a meeting about the future, not about this year, whether we
could consider replacing or adjusting the use of the RPI as the main metric
for ordering the data, and in essence coming up with a composite ranking of
several different metrics that would possibly give us a higher level of
confidence in that data.  
  
It was a recommendation that came frankly from the NABC, the National
Association of Basketball Coaches. The coaches feel strongly that using more
advanced metrics that are available in the game now, as compared to when the
RPI was introduced over 30 years ago, makes the game more relevant, the
selection process more relevant and timely. That's something that's being
considered for the future, not before the '17/'18 season at the earliest.  
  
But the committee's use of other metrics in the process just to have a
thorough evaluation of the teams has been the case and will continue to be the
case again this year yet still using the RPI as the main metric for sorting
the data.  
  
Q. The predictive way of sort of determining which teams are hot at the
end of the season, that kind of thing, is that something that you would
consider or are considering or have considered?  
DAN GAVITT: Good question. The committee, as you know, several years ago did
away with part of the criteria that placed more emphasis on the last 10 games
or, indeed, the last 12 games. That's no longer a criteria the committee uses.  
  
As part of that meeting last week, a couple weeks ago, there was a lot of
discussion about results-oriented metrics, versus predictive-oriented metrics,
whether there should be use of both, and whether indeed results metrics should
be used in the selecting of teams process and possibly predictive more so in
the seeding of teams process.  
  
Another determination is (indiscernible). I think it is a philosophical
question that the committee is going to have to wrestle with a lot over the
summer. But it is one of the things that was discussed, among others.  
  
Q. Generally speaking, every year it's always mentioned that you take
into account suspensions and injuries with each team when you're considering
specific results. Is there any way to quantify how much that actually goes
into a decision when you're looking at a team's results and you have to
remember that they played the game and won it or lost it with who they had?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: Our job as a committee, certainly all injuries, suspensions,
absences of coaches, transfers, new eligibility, all of those items are
discussed. But we can't project whether a team would have won or lost with a
full complement of players. It is a discussion item we have and it's looked at
on a case-by-case basis.  
  
Q. The bracketing principles indicate that teams from the same
conference that met only once during the regular season and late tournament
could meet as early as the second round. If it comes down to placing a team in
a venue for the first weekend that's close geographically as opposed to
matching it against a conference foe, would you try to avoid that conference
rematch in the second round and send them elsewhere or would you keep them
close to home?  
DAN GAVITT: This is a relatively new principle and procedure just as of a
couple years ago. The loosening of that policy was meant to avoid having to
move teams up or down a seed line in order to keep them away from conference
opponents, in games that may not even materialize, frankly, depending on the
results of first-round games.  
  
So I think in practice it's been very successful. The committee has not had
to, in the last two years, move a single team up or down a seed line in order
to avoid a conference opponent.  
  
So I think that hearing from the NABC, their main recommendation in this
regard was to be true to the seed line and not to have to compromise the
seeding process by moving a team up or down the seed line.  
  
In practice, and I think in philosophy as well, the committee would likely
allow for a matchup like that to happen, not have to move a team up or down a
seed line or, indeed, move them out of their geographic area to avoid that.  
  
There is some discretion that can be used. If, for example, a team is going to
take a flight in either case, and it's far removed from their natural
geographic region, and maybe the other option is the next closest geographic
region, then they may use their subjective discretion to avoid the possibility
of that second-round matchup.  
  
But by and large, I would say that in both practice and philosophy they would
allow for that potential matchup to happen.  
  
Q. Could this be the year that the committee might include more mid-
major teams?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: We evaluate teams on their own merit. We don't take into
account what conference they come from or what level of division they are in
Division I. We look at each school on its own merit.  
  
Q. Obviously this is the first time you'll do one of these shows you'll
do this weekend. Depending on the reaction, if there's a lot of interest, is
it something you'll reevaluate this summer in terms of is this something we
should do more often, every week leading up to Selection Sunday, or is the
committee pretty resolute this is something you can only do once?  
DAN GAVITT: Like anything new, the committee will certainly evaluate how
effective and successful a new initiative is, like the rankings show. There
hasn't been a determination about the future.  
  
My strong sense is as long as it meets with some level of success and interest
by coaches, players, fans, media, they would repeat the same thing next year,
at least with one ranking show.  
  
Whether they'd consider multiple ranking shows, there are a lot of logistical
challenges with that, none the least of which is the frequency with which
basketball games happen on a nightly basis. The committee doesn't get together
in person except for this week and then in March for selection week.  
  
I don't know. The committee took a lot of care and consideration to get to
this point. It probably was a year-plus evaluation even to get to this point.
I don't know. I'm not sure how likely it would be to do it more than just one
time.  
  
Q. What has it been like working with Dawn Rogers and the Phoenix local
organizing committee putting on the Final Four?  
DAN GAVITT: Dawn has been a fabulous executive director of the Phoenix local
organizing committee. Her experience working at Arizona State as a senior
administrator, former athletic director at Xavier, her familiarity with
coaches, ADs, commissioners, and the respect that she has across the business,
has been unrivaled.  
  
Of course, having been a resident of Phoenix for a long, long time now, over a
decade, she's got so many business and civic contacts there, she really has
done a terrific job, especially for a place that's never hosted before, and in
a region frankly that hasn't hosted a Final Four in over 20 years.  
  
Couldn't be more pleased or excited with what Dawn and her team have done and
how excited we are about being in Phoenix in April.  
  
Q. I'm curious about Mark Hollis. We know him as an innovator, creator.
In his leadership role on the committee, as the chairman, is that something
you have noticed that he's taken a different approach than previous chairmen?
Is there something unique about him?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: That's a great question. Mark is certainly an innovator. He's
creative. He thinks outside the box. He's a dynamic leader.  
  
Mark has been consistent in the years that I've been on the committee, whether
he's the chair, whether he's been a committee member, he's had a tremendous
influence on the entire committee and the process.  
  
Q. Do you have any example of things he's offered that have been
creative or a different way of looking at things?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: Let's look first of all at Mark's Madness. In a couple weeks,
his van tour, which will get him to a number of different conferences to see a
number of different teams. That is certainly unique. It's not been done
before.  
  
Mark has always been at the forefront of looking at a lot of different
analytics to try to slice the banana as thin as we can to really try to
examine the differences between teams and why teams have earned the spot that
they earned. He's been at the forefront of that.  
  
Q. Bruce, we're talking about selection and seeding today. I believe the
committee is also responsible for future sites and locations, is that
correct?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: It is.  
  
Q. You're heading into this bid cycle, the nitty-gritty of the decision
process. As you get to these final decisions on the next four years of sites,
at what point will the cutoff be where North Carolina bids will be eliminated
because of HB-2? How much longer are those bids viable?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: The NCAA decided in September to remove championships from
North Carolina for the '16/'17 season. It has not yet determined future
championship sites. The NCAA expects to announce site selections for the
'18/'19 through '21/'22 championship seasons in April, but there hasn't been a
discussion other than that.  
  
Q. Does it make your job or the committee's job more difficult having a
variable like that hanging out there as you make these important decisions?  
BRUCE RASMUSSEN: It certainly does. I think you're aware of the fact that I
think there are roughly 60 bids we evaluate for sites in a site selection
process or bid process. That just adds another layer of complication to the
process.  
  
DAVE WORLOCK: We want to extend our gratitude for everyone for joining us
today. We want to remind everyone that the bracket preview show will air on
CBS at 12:30 eastern this Saturday. Mark Hollis will be on the set with CBS
talent as they lead into the Kentucky-Alabama game at 1 p.m. We wish you a
good afternoon.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Donte DiVincenzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32854)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Villanova - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova University head coach, Jay Wright, as well
as Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart. We'll open with a statement.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Great college basketball game. Just fun to be a part of it, and
give Wisconsin a lot of credit. They played a great game. I'm proud of our
guys. We played tough, battled. These were what NCAA Tournament games come
down to. Down the stretch, they made two great offensive plays, two great
defensive stops, and that was the difference in the game.  
  
We knew it was going to be a tough game because we have so much respect for
them and they deserved it. They got it but we played hard, too. I was proud of
our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Donte as well as Josh.  
  
Q. Josh, on the last offensive play for you guys, was that inbound
supposed to go to Jalen, and what did you see after you received the inbounds
play?  
JOSH HART: Yeah. We wanted to get the ball to Jalen and go down to the half
court and run a play. You know, they picked us up full court, and we couldn't
get it to him, passed it to me, and we went into a ball screen. But Wisconsin
made a heck of a defensive play.  
  
Q. Josh, the accomplishments of the senior class are going to live
forever. Obviously it's hard to look back at that right now in this moment,
but just the idea that you guys aren't going to be on the court together as a
group, how difficult is that to sort of accept or process right now?  
JOSH HART: I'm always going to be with my brothers. I'm not going to be there
on the court making plays with them, but I'm going to be talking to them all
of the time, texting them, face-Timing them. They're my brothers for life
regardless what happened this year. We're close on and off the court, and that
bond is never going to be broken, so that is what it is. But I guarantee, you
know, I'm going to be closer to them to the day I die.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for how student-athletes?  
  
Q. Yeah, for Josh, just you're down there, you're behind, sort of five,
six, seven minutes into the second half and it seemed like you guys just
started getting downhill. Can you talk about getting that lead by -- I mean,
was it a kind of conscious effort. I know that's what you do, but get it to
the rim more and you kept scoring that way?  
JOSH HART: We always want to be aggressive. We always want to try to get into
the paint. And for a good couple minutes, we were doing that, and we were able
to get it in the lane, either make a lay-up, or get fouled. So, give them all
the credit. They're a heck of a team. They made great adjustments. That's what
it is, but we just tried to be aggressive, really.  
  
Q. For Donte, you guys went up 57-50. Did you feel at that point like
the intensity level dropped because that's -- it seemed like maybe you had
things in control at that point but then they were able to make the
comeback?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I don't think the intensity dropped for us. I think we were
intense on defense the whole game. They just made a heck of a play down the
stretch. Their shots went in. Offensively, we executed and so did they. They
went on a little run, but I don't think the intensity dropped at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Donte, Josh, thanks for your time. Appreciate it. And we'll
open for questions for Coach Wright.  
  
Q. Jay, kind of the same question I asked Josh. It's always difficult at
this moment, but the perspective of the senior class that you're losing,
pretty remarkable run that they had, winningest all-time, I think. And for you
to accept that you're not going to have those guys in your gym as well?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. Three of the -- Josh and Kris and Darryl are three of the
greatest Villanova basketball players of all time. Their class is going to go
down as the most successful class in Villanova history. But what we take pride
in at Villanova even more is all three of them will graduate on time, all
three of them, on the court, good times, bad times, always conducted
themselves extremely well, represented Villanova well. Off the court, big part
of our student body, great Villanovans. To be that successful on the court and
really represent the University like they do, is something special. We told
our younger guys that that's what you want to be. That's what you want to be
as a Villanova basketball player. You want to be like Kris and Josh and
Darryl.  
  
Q. Jay, same question I asked Josh about you're playing on the last
play, what did they do to just bottle up Jalen. I guess you were trying to get
it in to him?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. It's simple for us. If they let us get it to Jalen, we're
going to run a play. If they don't, we're going to get it to Josh or Donte and
run a middle ball screen. Josh got -- down two, we got all of the way to the
rim, and that's what you want to do. You want to be aggressive going at the
rim and try to score and get fouled. They made a great defensive play.  
  
Q. And also, when it was 57-50, you guys only had one basket after that,
and five points in the last five and change. What did they do to just bottle
you up and try to keep you from scoring?  
JAY WRIGHT: The game -- from 57-50 the game really got shortened. They had a
couple of possessions where they got an offensive rebound. They had another
possession where the shot clock went down to zero, and then there was a foul
called at the shot clock, so they got a whole other possession. So there
weren't that many possessions.  
  
We just had a couple -- I think that's what the game came down to. We had a
couple empty possessions at the end, and they had two great possessions, the
one by Nigel Hayes driving the baseline, and that one baseline out of bounds
when Koenig hit the three was huge. That's what close games come down to.
We've been on the other end of that a lot. And when another team steps up and
makes those plays and two great players like Koenig and Hayes make those
plays, you got to give them credit.  
  
Q. Two years ago, No. 1 seed, lost in the same round. We look at a
three-year window, you've won the championship but you were also eliminated in
the second round twice. You talk about how difficult this tournament is,
knowing first hand the highs and lows of it all?  
JAY WRIGHT: First, there should be nothing negative about this tournament.
This is the greatest, I think, sporting event in our country. You know, just
being in it, I say this every year to our team. I say this every year at
Villanova, we can't take it for granted. It's so special to be a part of it.
Every time you win and you get a chance to advance, cherish it. You're playing
the best teams in the country. You're going to come down to games like this,
you know? We had a game like this against Kansas last year and we came out of
the good side of it. We had a game like this against N.C. State last year, and
we had a shot to win it and we missed it.  
  
To me, there's no dishonor in losing in this tournament but I do know that --
and we've lived through it. You are judged by how you play in this tournament
and that's the reality of it. So, you have to accept it.  
  
Q. Could you just sort of comment on Koenig's performance and their
ability to get him the ball and get him decent looks?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I thought the biggest play was when he came off that
baseline out-of-bounds and hit a three. That's a breakdown on our part, but
it's also great execution on their part, you know? You know they're going to
them based on out-of-bounds and he set his man up as -- he goes out opposite,
sometimes, sometimes he comes out the same side. And he set his man up like
he's was going out opposite, and he beat us on it. And that was a big play.  
  
And we had shut that down all during the game, but again that's where you got
to give them credit. It's great execution, great job, great coaching job, and
that's how you win and lose these close games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great senior class.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you, guys.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 83, Notre Dame - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by victorious West Virginia University head coach, Bob
Huggins, and student-athletes Jevon Carter, Daxter Miles, Jr., and Tarik
Phillip.  
  
Congratulations, guys, on advancing to the Sweet 16. We're going to go right
to questions for the student-athletes and then we'll release them and have
questions for Coach Huggins after that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this back court that you guys form and what you
thought about in the beginning of the year and what you showed today?  
JEVON CARTER: All year we've been telling ourselves that we got the best group
of guards in the country, and we truly believe that. So, when it's time for us
to play, we go out there and give it our all. Sometimes it worked. But we
going to put forth 100 percent and we're going to live and die with it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other comments on that?  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: He pretty much said it all. We believe that we put in a lot of
work in the summertime. We came in believing that we were a tough group of
guards, and we just got to go out and show it.  
  
Q. Just wondering how important was you guys getting off to that huge
start right off the bat and smacking them in the mouth right away. How much
did that do for your confidence and what did it do to get you in the game?  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: It was great flow from the start, and we've been having
some really good practices leading up to the tournament. I don't know, man,
that was just great flow on both sides, offense and defense.  
  
JEVON CARTER: I wouldn't say it's a confidence booster because whoever steps
on the court, we feel like we can beat them. We just got hot early and we just
kept going from there.  
  
Q. Jevon, obviously, you guys are known, especially in the back court,
for your defense, but today your offense was impressive as well. Do you guys
carry a little bit of a chip on your shoulder because you don't get as much
attention for that as you deserve?  
JEVON CARTER: Definitely. We keep that chip on our shoulder. A wise man once
said, remember where you come from, and we always keep that in the back of our
mind. All three of us up here, it wasn't an easy path to get here to West
Virginia. We had to grind it out every step of the way, and when we get on the
court, that gives us a chance to show it prove that other schools missed out
on us.  
  
Q. To jump on what Dana just said, Tarik, if you could talk about that,
you just said big chip. It's almost like there's a notion out there that you
guys can't play offense, but you have some good, really good shooters, on this
team.  
TARIK PHILLIP: Yeah. We do. First couple years here, they thought of us as
defensive players, you know? But Coach, the coaching staff instilled a lot of
confidence in us and helped us develop our offensive game and we became pretty
good offensive players.  
  
Q. Daxter, for you to start, and I guess Jevon, Tarik, you can follow
up. They were known as a team that didn't turn it over a whole lot. You got
ten the first half and sort of set the tone. Did you feel your press was good
against them no matter how good they are normally handling such pressure?  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: The Irish, that's a great program, you know, great coach.
Today, like I said, it was a great flow, defensively and offensively. I think
all five guys was on the same page early into the game. That gave us extra
confidence leading -- you know, as the game went on and we just took it from
there.  
  
Q. Guys, did you feel out there that they were wearing down the -- you
know, bringing in a bunch of people? Did you feel that they were starting to
wear down?  
JEVON CARTER: Yeah, definitely. That's what we pride ourselves on. We go 11,
12, deep, 13 sometimes, and other teams only play six, seven, eight people.
So, we was always told that our 15 is better than their 15, so we get into
that bench, that's a bonus for us.  
  
Q. Any of you guys can answer this because you all were on the
perimeter. Were you surprised how much room that you had on the perimeter,
whether or not they respected your outside game enough?  
JEVON CARTER: Yeah. I guess you can say that. We just play, man. We knew they
was small, trying to get inside to our bigs a lot, play inside out. And we
knew they was going to have a hard time guarding us.  
  
Q. So, Tarik, do you guys ever get tired of hearing about foul shooting?
Obviously, again tonight, like yesterday, you guys were really good at the
line to seal it there?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Coaches always said turnovers and free throws is going to
determine ball games with us. So when we go to the line, we just got to step
up, man up, and hit free throws.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks very much for your time. Congratulations.
We'll now open up for questions for Coach Huggins. Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, I know you expected this from the back
court, even before the season, but is this the best you've seen of the total
back court all year?  
BOB HUGGINS: There was a sportswriter in West Virginia who put a poll out: Are
we top 20, are we top 50, are we top 100? And I shared that with our guys, and
our guys goes, top 100. And we used that as kind of a source of motivation.
Did I know they were that good? I know this, they put an enormous amount of
time in. They're in the practice facility 12 months out of the year and, you
know, it's great when you don't have to kind of tell people to go in there.
They go in there.  
  
And you can see -- I mean Tarik came in not a very good shooter. He's a pretty
good shooter now. J.C. came in and was not real consistent. He's pretty
consistent now. And I think, you know, Nate, Elijah's put a lot of time in, a
lot more time than what he once did. So they deserve a lot of credit for it.
They want to get better. They want to get better and they want to win. They
get tired of people talking down about them, honestly.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.  
  
Q. After the first two days of the tournament, the prevailing fan
sentiment about the tournament is there haven't been a lot of big upsets. I'm
sure in this case you're pleased with that. I wonder if you can speak
generally from someone who's been involved in so many tournaments how
important it feels this year and how important that is to a good tournament?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think the TV people would tell you, if they're honest, they'd
rather have West Virginia and Notre Dame than they would a smaller school,
because the numbers are going to be better. I mean that's pretty much a fact.
I mean, you have an upset, so they have to play it and they play it and they
play it, and then they have a meeting on Monday and they say, what the hell
just happened? I mean, that's the reality of it all. So, does it make it a
better tournament? I don't know. I don't know if it does or it doesn't.  
  
Q. You guys take obviously so much pride in your defense. Do you ever
quietly kind of laugh to yourself because you know what this team can do
offensively when there's so much attention paid to the defensive side. This
team's really good offensively.  
BOB HUGGINS: We just today broke the school record for points in a season, and
we're averaging 82 a game. I did the pre-game radio show and Tony said, you
know, there's people saying that you can't score with them. And I said, we're
averaging 82 a game. Now, there's days, honestly, I don't know how we get to
82, but somehow we do. And our guys play so hard, I think it forces other
people to play harder, but I think it also -- people aren't used to playing at
the pace that we play at.  
  
Q. Coach, just your ball movement. What can you say about your ball
movement? You had some stretches nine straight possessions scored. First half,
you have seven of eight and eight of nine. What did you think of that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank God. Because we threw it away four straight times to start
the second half, which we're prone to do as well. When we stay in our stuff,
when we get -- our whole deal with them has been do what you can do. Don't try
to be something you're not. And, you know, we've got post guys now that have
turned into really good post guys because they don't go in and shoot three-
pointers for 20 minutes before practice. They actually go in and work on
shooting jump hooks. And that's been a process; quite frankly, it's been a
process.  
  
Q. And then just your defensive plan against them. I mean, to start the
game, both teams were missing, so there wasn't -- you didn't have a ton of
makes real early where you could put the press on, but it seemed like you
didn't throw the full weight of the half-court traps at them as much as maybe
you did against Bucknell. Thoughts on that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we just wanted to wear them down. We wanted to make them
work really hard at advancing the ball. They shoot the ball so well, it's --
you know, if you trap them and you don't do a good job or you don't make the
right rotation, they're going to make shots. And so we were a little bit
concerned about that. I didn't want to turn them loose. I thought against
Bucknell we did a horrible job of stopping the ball, and so they constantly
were attacking the rim and I didn't want Notre Dame to attack the rim. I
wanted them, quite frankly, to shoot threes, rather than turn them loose in
the pressure.  
  
So that's what we do. We try to make people play the way that kind of the way
we want them to play. It's hard. Mike's a great coach. He's not a good coach,
he's a great coach. And to do what he's done is just phenomenal, and I've got
just a world of respect for him as a coach and as a person.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.  
  
Q. In the first game, kind of to piggy-back off this question, you gave
up, I believe 45% from the three-point line, and you did also early in this
game. In the second half you only gave up 30 percent their behind the arc. Did
you credit the traps for that like you were talking about. I know you said you
wanted to shoot threes and were missing them?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. That's probably a better question to ask them. I
don't know. I thought in the first half we didn't really -- we didn't contest
as well as we did in the second half but, you know, I don't know. People tell
me that it would -- it's just the constant having to work hard to get the ball
up the floor, work hard to get open, kind of takes people's legs. But that's a
question really better asked to them than me.  
  
I have a hard enough time trying to figure out what these three knuckleheads
up here were doing rather than worry about what Notre Dame was thinking. I
struggled at figuring out what they're doing, you know?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: Can I say this? Listen. I love Buffalo. I came here in '93, World
University Games, we won. Played Canisius in '07, and we won. Came here in
2010, and we won too. And we just won two now. I love Buffalo. Anytime you
want to invite us to come back, we'll come back. Thank you.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Villanova - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Wisconsin head coach, Greg Gard, as well as
student-athletes, Ethan Happ. Vitto Brown, Nigel Hayes, and Bronson Koenig.  
  
GREG GARD: Obviously, extremely excited beyond -- I don't know if I can put it
into words how happy I am for these guys and their teammates in the locker
room. Just an unbelievable, gutty performance against a terrific team.  
  
You know, we didn't play perfectly, but we played well enough, and we had
enough perseverance to be able to get things done in the amount of time we
had. Just so excited and proud of these guys because they've had to battle
through a lot this year as we've worked and grown through the season together.
So, I'll leave it up to those guys.  
  
Q. Nigel, could you take us through the go-ahead basket and kind of what
you saw during that play?  
NIGEL HAYES: Coach drew up a -- it's kind of a play we run all of the time,
just a side isolation. If you will. Ethan set a screen to try to give me a
little traffic to try to baseline. Went down there to -- I didn't know what
move I was actually going to do before I caught the ball. Just went, did a
fake spin, got to my left hand and fortunately the lay-up went in for us.  
  
Q. Like a wrestling term, you showed intestinal fortitude late. Could
you give us a window, what was the conversation with like 3 seconds to go.  
NIGEL HAYES: Three seconds to go?  
  
Q. It was 3.4. When you guys were up.  
NIGEL HAYES: Did he make his free throw? It was, one, don't foul; Ethan and I
don't foul. And if he makes the flow, try to get them to catch the ball going
towards our basket so we don't give up a Hail Mary because they won a
championship on a shot similar. So we didn't want to give up anything like
that.  
  
Yeah, we wanted to have some composure. We played a really great team, great
team. It took a great effort from us, and we're just proud of ourselves for
getting the job done.  
  
Q. Could you describe the anxiety of sitting on the bench with four
fouls and being able to come back eight of ten shots and get the lead back?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah. I felt terrible, to say the least, when I got my fourth
foul and I was just sitting on the bench trying to be a coach from the bench
and help all our guys out. I knew that's not how my career was going to end. I
knew that when coach gave me the opportunity to get back in there, I was going
to make something happen. So I'm just glad we pulled it out.  
  
Q. For the seniors, a couple Arizona games, Xavier last year, Kentucky,
now this. Lots of us have never been in the situation where we're on the court
in a high-stakes game and figure out how to win. Tell us what it feels like
and if there's something you guys know that we don't know about what it
takes.  
NIGEL HAYES: I think a lot of those games, probably -- excuse me. Correction.  
  
All of those games we've been the underdog. You have all types of your ranking
systems, statistic, analytics guys that they put. The thing is with all those
algorithms, they can't calculate heart, will to win, toughness, desire. They
can't put that into a formula to come out with a percentage chance to win, and
that's the things that we have. The things that we've grown with. We've seen
the older guys, they've had that.  
  
Our best example is Traevon. When we got here, we watched Trae make clutch
shot after clutch shot. Frank did the same thing, and now we're stepping into
their shoes and we're trying to continue.  
  
Q. For Nigel and Ethan, you guys struggled down the stretch last year in
Philadelphia, and ended up turning the ball over to lead to your defeat. How
have you guys, or how have you grown since that loss in Philly especially
against late game situations to pull out with a late win today.  
NIGEL HAYES: Honestly, we've grown a lot. First game, we had eight turnovers,
maybe. We've done a lot better job. Today we still -- we almost gave the game
away. Fortunately, thank the lucky stars, that that wasn't an intentional foul
on me. I did make a play for the ball. I'm glad the ref saw that, but if that
goes intentional foul, he makes those two, they get the ball back, we could
have been talking about a great career that we've had.  
  
Q. Bronson a follow-up to the one earlier. You talked about how tough it
was being on the bench. How proud of you are those guys that were out there
for those eight minutes that kept this game?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I was very proud of them. I think that's something we've done
really well recently. When somebody gets in foul trouble or someone is not
playing well, we've done a lot better of job picking each other up and trying
to stay positive the whole game. At times it does get a little impossible to
do that. We just stick together.  
  
Q. For Ethan, can you describe that defensive sequence, at the end you
got Josh Hart, potential Player of the Year, coming toward you and you stand
your ground and force the turnover. What did you see there?  
ETHAN HAPP: Nigel had him. Nigel picked up and they screened him, so we ended
up switching it. I know he likes to go left and spin back, but he just stuck
to his left hand the whole time and then Vitto came over with great help and I
walled him up and Vitto came over and got the almost tie-up, but ended up
blocking it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Vitto, your thoughts?  
  
VITTO BROWN: Yeah. The way some of the calls were going, we weren't sure if
there would have been a foul in the end and so Ethan did a great job keeping
his hands back and kind of taking the ambiguity out of so they wouldn't call
that foul and then I figured he wasn't paying attention to me, so I I kind of
reached in there and had to hold it strong because DiVincenzo was coming
strong to rip from me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last one for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You were joking yesterday, Bronson made all of the spectacular shots.
Did you figure it was your time?  
NIGEL HAYES: No, he did. We were down three. I was dribbling around the court
aimlessly, and I threw it out to him and he hit the shot. His shot made was
the reason we were able to get the tie and made a couple other big shots late
at the shot clock. I just made a lay-up. Lay-ups are easy. He made the tough
jump shots.  
  
Q. That was an easy reverse?  
NIGEL HAYES: No, I actually thought I missed it. I felt I threw it a little
too hard. Luckily it went in for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, guys. Good luck, moving on.  
  
We'll go ahead and open up questions for Coach Gard. We'll start right down
from here.  
  
Q. There's no formula when to put a guy back in with four fouls. How can
you decide when is the right time to get Bronson back in there?  
GREG GARD: Well, the assistants couldn't decide either. One wanted him to go
back in at 7 minutes. The other said no. I never got Krabbenhoft's vote. I
decided to wait. We were within 7 at that point in time at the eight-minute
media; I think it was 57-50. It wasn't going to get much further and I was
going to have to go back to him.  
  
So once we got to the five-minute mark, I think Trice had struggled with the
previous possession. I said all right it's time to go. Obviously, the kid came
in and played well. There's no set formula. You have to go on gut instinct.
The odds of where you're at, scoring time, how the flow of the game is going,
things like that.  
  
Q. Just taking a quick scroll through my time line walking down here, a
lot of the chatter is about you guys doing the eight seed and getting
selections right or wrong. Do you even care where you were seeded?  
GREG GARD: No. Seeds don't matter. I said that all along. These teams are so
good. At this point, you got 68. I know there's some playing games and things
like that and some automatic qualifiers that they have in the 16 seeds and
things like that. But having been in this long enough, having been a 1, having
been a 2, having been a 12, you know, you just got to go play. Like I said,
there's so much parity, and teams are so good when you get to this time of
year, you just have to lace them up and not worry about that. That's the
approach we've taken.  
  
I told these guys I don't care where we're seeded. We have to win six games.
Let's start with these two this weekend.  
  
Q. Coach, getting back to the question asked of Bronson. How much
anxiety was there when he was out of the game with four fouls, knowing how he
changed the game as he did?  
GREG GARD: As long as we can stay within striking distance, I have a lot of
confidence in my freshman point guard, D'Mitrik Trice. I thought other guys
picked us up too. Pritzi gave some us good minutes. Even though he didn't
score, Iverson was active and did some good things for us.  
  
The bench scoring goes 24-3 in their favor. But I thought we got quality
minutes from guys and were able to stay within striking distance or have the
lead in the first half, and then you got to kind of pick your time. It
happens. It's happened all year.  
  
We've got to deal with somebody at some point in time. You like to avoid it.
But when it does happen, you have a plan and trust the people you prepared to
step in and help us out.  
  
Q. Their last possession, did you assume the ball was going to go to
Hart the entire time?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. Either Hart or Bronson, just what we had seen on film.
They've made so many last second game-winning plays. Going through the film,
just the games of theirs, you look at the tight games and down the stretch how
many game-winning plays they've made. And predominantly it had been in those
two guys' hands or those two guys were somehow involved. Hart hits a big
offensive rebound against Virginia, did he tip one in? If it was him or got it
there late.  
  
But those two guys typically either have the ball in their hands or are
somehow involved in trying to make a play for them.  
  
Q. All right, coach. The question is, your second half defense, Hart and
Brunson were taking it to the rim strong and scoring to get the 57-50 lead and
then you started getting stops. Your assessment of what happened?  
GREG GARD: Well, we got better. We got better at the point of attack of trying
to stop some guys. I thought we got -- we allowed too much of an angle to the
rim at times. And also, you got to give credit where credit's due. Those two
guys are two terrific players. I've watched -- what are they 32-4 -- so 35
games, going through quite a few of them and watching them go downhill on a
lot of people and get the ball in the paint.  
  
I watched Bronson in high school, and know what type of guard he is. And Josh
Hart is a terrific player, too. That's how they played all year. There's been
a lot teams having a hard time keeping them out of the paint, and we were able
to shore it up enough down the stretch to be able to catch them and hang on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any other questions, coach, congrats.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Steve Vasturia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28640)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 83, Notre Dame - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by Notre Dame head coach, Mike Brey, as well
as V.J. Beachem and Steve Vasturia. Open up with a statement from Coach Brey.  
  
MIKE BREY: I thought our start really hurt us. We were in a 10-0 hole. You're
kind of digging out against them the whole day. It was hard to get over it.
Their style of play is hard to deal with. It wore on us at times. Even though
we only turned it over 14 times, four in the second half, it probably caused
us to miss some of those open looks. You're going to have to make some open
looks after you get it out of the trap, and we probably couldn't make enough
of them.  
  
But they're really good. They're really good. They got the look. They can play
for a while. Bob's done an unbelievable job, like reinventing with full-court
pressure. It's brilliant and really a unique preparation to try and deal with
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now for V.J. and Steve only at this time.  
  
Q. For V.J., just offensively, it seemed like a struggle for you
tonight. Just anything in particular that you can point to that gave you
difficulty? Was it what they were doing defensively or was it more your own
thing?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think, you know, my teammates did a great job of finding me
open shots like they usually do. You know today I just wasn't able to knock
them down. You know, of course, they wear you down a little bit. Maybe that's
why some of them were short, but I just didn't knock them down tonight.  
  
Q. Steve, for you, and I guess V.J. as well, in terms of their defense,
obviously their press gets the note. But is it just speeding you up as well as
forcing turnovers that causes you problems?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I think that's the goal of the press. They obviously
want to turn you over. If not, they want to get you out of your rhythm.
Besides our start, I thought we did a pretty good job. We got a bunch of good
looks, Matt, T.J., Greg. We did a good job getting the ball across half court.
Like Coach said, you have to knock down open shots once you get it across half
court, and we didn't make enough of those today.  
  
Q. Steve, did they shock you at all after the start? After that first
series at the beginning, it was a pretty even game. Did the pressure do
something to you guys that took you a while to adjust?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I don't think it shocked us. If you look at those first four,
five possessions, we got really good looks at the basket, we just didn't knock
them down. And those are shots we usually make and we expect to make those
shots. I think that's part of the reason they got off to such a good start and
that's why we were in a little bit of a hole.  
  
Q. Was their offense a bit of a surprise? They're sometimes hot and cold
from the perimeter. Was their ability to hit outside shots a little bit of a
surprise to you?  
V.J. BEACHEM: We know they wanted to bang it inside. They did a decent job of
that. As far as knocking down shots, they really knocked down some big-time
shots especially in the first half, kind of keeping us at bay when we were
trying to make our runs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Notre Dame student-athletes? Steve,
V.J., congratulations on a good season. Go ahead with questions for Coach Brey
at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned in your introduction there about the slow start
and you fall behind 10-0. What do you point to for the reason for that?  
MIKE BREY: It's like Steve said, the shots we got were pretty good ones. We
had a little runner in the lane, V.J. with a ten-footer on the baseline. I
don't know. I think we were awake and ready to play. I don't think we weren't
turning the ball over at that time to give them the 10-0 lead. I think it was,
you know, missing some stuff.  
  
We may have been shocked we were so open because we were really prepared for
them to be after us, and they were. You know, we had our spurts of turning the
ball over, but 14 against them is -- that's a pretty good day, only four in
the second half. But you got to make -- you know, you got to make a few over
the top of it. And your question, I thought -- I mean, I didn't expect them to
shoot it from outside as well. I thought we could play a little more zone and
make them make more threes, and they made every big three-point shot, and
Carter is a big-time winner. What a stud guard he is. He's fabulous. He's just
a veteran winner in college basketball.  
  
Q. I was interested, you said that how Bob kind of reinvented the book.
How is it different? How did he reinvent this?  
MIKE BREY: This is the first -- we played West Virginia a bunch back in the
old Big East days. Bob and I were actually talking about how we missed those
days, but they were not a full-court pressure team then. They played a little
bit of the 1-3-1 you saw, but they were still grinding you, and posting you,
and pounding you on offense.  
  
But I think going into a new league, I thought it's a brilliant move by Bob,
who's a brilliant coach obviously, to put together a style of play that
everybody really has to adjust to in league play.  
  
Q. Obviously you know him. What is it about -- what is his brilliance?  
MIKE BREY: I mean, this guy's been winning for a long time at a lot of places.
He is just a good old basketball coach. He loves practice, he loves to go in
and talk Xs and Os. He is one of those guys that just loved talking hoops. And
they've got a great culture about their program now, and they found a heck of
a niche in the Big 12. I feel for them. I don't know how they fly three hours
to every road game. It's unbelievable that they have to do that, but yet there
they are, playing in the Big 12 championship.  
  
The one thing about West Virginia that's the same, when we played them back
this the Big East and more so today, they got men. They have men. They have
old dudes, and staying old is a good thing in college basketball. They're a
little older than us today.  
  
Q. It seemed, for every time you guys started to chip away at the lead
they had a counter-punch for you. Can you talk about the frustration of that,
just as you seemed to get momentum?  
MIKE BREY: It does break your spirit. I've got a really mentally tough group,
but that was a real mental test today. Because any time we thought we'd get
this thing to four or get it to two possessions, somebody hit a big three or
they got a putback. It's really spirit-breaking after a while, and it does
wear on our group.  
  
I give our guys credit. We kept fighting, but eventually that really is --
that does a lot of psychological damage, and we hadn't been in one of in a
while. We hadn't been in one of those where we were digging out of a hole and
trying to come back. We really hadn't been in one in a while.  
  
Q. The decision to leave Bonzie in when he picked up his fourth foul.
Explain what went into that thinking on a day offensively you were having a
tough time getting a lot of guys going and he was really doing a lot for
you?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah. I don't think you're saving him for the stretch run. The
stretch run was a whole second half, trying to dig out of a hole. Quite
frankly, the staff and I talked, if he fouled out, I think we would have
played five guards and maybe tried to make some shots. But he's smart. He's a
veteran guy. He did a good job not fouling. He was unbelievable today.  
  
Some of our other guys didn't make some stuff. Again, he puts the team on his
back and he's not 100 percent. That ankle is bothering him. That's one of the
great performances, just trying to carry a team on a bad wheel. Yeah, there's
no such thing as taking them out with four because we're either going to get
it now or we're going to get beat by 20.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Thank you. Great season.

BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We've joined now by Villanova student-athletes, Jalen
Brunson and Josh Hart. Congrats on advancing to tomorrow. You guys will be
playing Wisconsin in the second game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Josh, after watching the film of last night's game, obviously you had
to be happy with the second half. First half, can you put your finger on just
what was going on with you guys?  
JOSH HART: No. No. We haven't really watched the film of that. And right now,
we can't. We've got to focus on Wisconsin, so whatever happened, happened.
We've got to play better. We're not dwelling on that, we just got to know what
we got to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh, the thing that you and Wisconsin have in common, you have a lot
of veteran players. Can you talk about just the experience you gained, just
staying in school all these years? What has it done for you?  
JOSH HART: You know, it gave me a lot of insight into the college basketball
game. You see so many different defenses, able to read certain things better.
You're not as anxious or nervous during big games or tough situations. You
know, that really helps you just be collected the whole game. That's really
it. It's always good to have that experience.  
  
You know, Jalen, who is only a sophomore, who -- Coach always calls him an old
soul. So having him out there, then you have Darryl, Kris, myself, Mikal, who
is into the end of his second year, guys who are experienced, who played in
the tournament last year, who played in the National Championship game, guys
just aren't rattled.  
  
Q. Villanova has a history of graduating its kids, four-year kids, Kyle
is the only classmate that ever left early. When you finished last season, was
it a difficult decision for you? I know you put your name and tested the
waters in the draft. What was the ultimate decision and what did it come down
to?  
JOSH HART: It just came down to the best situation for my family and myself,
and that was the biggest thing. Anyone that knows me knows that the first
thing and my main priority, I want to take care of my parents. That's the
biggest thing with me. And I knew I had that chance last year, and if I did
leave, teams said they would take me and it wasn't where I wanted to be.  
  
So it wasn't just -- I didn't want to just get there and take care of my
parents for a year or two. I wanted to have a long career in the league, and
I'm going to take care of them for the rest of their lives. That was
ultimately the decision for me. So when I got all of that information, and I
just sat down and thought about it, it was an easy decision.  
  
Q. Jalen, why does your coach call you an old soul?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I just -- I think just Coach, me and Coach felt like we've had
a bond these past couple years, and I felt like we've connected since the day
he started recruiting me. So when -- just going back to those days, we were
always talking, we were always on the same page and the same mindset, so I
think that's why he considers me an old soul.  
  
Q. Jalen, Wisconsin hit 13 threes last night and Koenig hit eight. Just
wondering how you're planning to control the arc there and make sure they
doesn't break loose for three?  
JALEN BRUNSON: We definitely have to find Koenig, he's a great shooter, but
they're a great shooting team. They're real balanced. They have a great post
game, great perimeter shooters, and we're just going to go out there and play
Villanova basketball and defend hard and rebound the ball and really just play
together.  
  
Q. Josh, what does concern you most about Wisconsin and how dangerous
are they as an 8?  
JOSH HART: Very dangerous. You see how well-balanced they are. I think that's
the biggest thing. If a team is just all post game, and you're able to kind of
shut down their post game, then at times, you can kind of have an easier
route. But with them, they're so well-balanced, with having Nigel down there,
then you have Brunson, and Showalter out there shooting threes, so the balance
of that team is going to be a challenge.  
  
Again, like I said, we have to go out there and play Villanova basketball for
40 minutes, defend the rebound, and just play our butt off, and see where that
gets us.  
  
Q. Kris has been struggling with his shot recently. What kind of
supporting role do you play when you have a teammate that's lost his way a
little bit. Are you supportive, tell him to keep shooting or do you kind of
stay away from him?  
JOSH HART: Tell him to shoot. I tell him if I pass you the ball, and you're
open, one, two, step and let it fly. That's what he does. He's a great
shooter. When you're a great shooter, you don't worry about slumps. And he's a
great shooter, and I just know his mindset. Every one that he's going to shoot
is going to go in. As a great shooter, you don't worry about the ones you
miss, you have a short-term memory. And that's how he is. Just tell him to
keep shooting.  
  
Q. Obviously, you win this last year. Was there like an aha moment, a
moment of clarity at any point, whether it be the offseason or early this year
where you're like, you know what? I want to do this again.  
JOSH HART: April 5th, you know, that's the first time I thought about it, then
went the whole -- the testing-the-water process. I told Coach on the 24th or
25th of May. That's when I had the aha moment. I say I want to do this again.
So, that's something we've been working towards since the summer, and
something that we got to continue to work on, and we've got to keep being
coachable and being better.  
  
To answer that question, May 25th, when I took my name out of the draft, I had
that aha moment, I want to do it again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jalen, how about you?  
  
JALEN BRUNSON: Probably the same thing. I definitely didn't have the process
you did last year. But I just think that we definitely have some key pieces
coming back next year. We definitely have a group of young guys that are still
hungry and still wanting to get better. I mean, that's definitely in the back
of my mind, winning another National Championship. But we want to take care of
business, so I just focus on our next game. That's what we did last year in
the tournament. We just focus on one game at a time and eventually got there.  
  
Q. Josh, Wisconsin has a reputation as a defensive-oriented team. What
kind of challenges does that defense present? Does it remind you of anybody
that you played?  
JOSH HART: A team like Seton Hall, a Butler, a very tough, physical defensive-
minded team and we know that. We know that's how they play. We've just got to
be aggressive. We can't second-guess ourselves or get in and not try to -- get
in the paint or break down the defense and not try to score. We got to be
aggressive, play Villanova basketball, and let that take care of itself.  
  
You know, when you get this late in the tournament, no one's playing that it's
an easy win. Every one is a tough team. We know that, we know they're going to
make runs, and, we've got to play Villanova basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for either Josh or Jalen?  
  
Q. Watching the game yesterday with you guys on the floor, there seems
to be, like, you can almost kind of communicate just by looking at each other.
Talk about sort of the closeness amongst you guys as a team. Of all of the
teams I saw here this weekend, you guys sort of work together as one of the
best.  
JOSH HART: Yeah. That's just how close we are. You know, we're close on the
court, we're close off the court. And that really translates to us playing.
Now, I don't know how many times Jalen would just look at me and I just know
exactly what he's trying to get to me. So, that just shows how close we are,
and shows that we don't care about our individual success. We want each other
to have success. That's really about it. So, when you have guys you just
genuinely love, and you're just connected with on a different level, you know
what each other is trying to say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Josh, Jalen, thanks for your time. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova coach, Jay Wright.  
  
Q. Wisconsin's won more games in the tournament than any other team in
the last four years. They've beaten 2's, they've beaten 1's. Looks like the
worst 8 you can run into right now. How are you and your team approaching that
in?  
JAY WRIGHT: I agree with you exactly. I agree with you 100 percent. They are a
great 8 seed. Everywhere in this tournament, teams that know how to win. Mount
St. Mary's last night, they had a great plan. They knew how to win the game.
We just look at it like next game. We love playing great teams, we really do,
and we look forward to it.  
  
Q. You guys played kind of a shaky game against Seton Hall in the Big
East tournament, responded with a great game against Creighton. Shaky game
last night. What is it about your guys that they seem to respond after less
than stellar performances with some of your better performances of the year?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think the guys are just coachable, and humble enough to look at
their performance and be honest about where they've got to improve as opposed
to making excuses, or blowing it off, like, you know, it doesn't matter. Our
guys looked at the last game, and I think -- I hope you'll see a better
performance tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Jay, several of your players mentioned Butler as a comparison to
Wisconsin. How do you view that comparison and how troubling is that given
what Butler was able to do to you guys this year?  
JAY WRIGHT: They are similar in a lot of ways with their pack-line defense,
their physicality. And Butler shoots threes better than people know. Wisconsin
shoots them really well as we all saw last night. It's a very similar type of
game, and it's going to be a struggle. And I actually think Wisconsin's
bigger, even bigger, than Butler, so probably even tougher. But let's hope we
learn from those games.  
  
Q. Jay, Happ presents a unique set of challenges for a big with his
skill set, not something you see every day, not something you practice against
every day or work against. Tell me about the challenge you see for your guys,
specifically with Happ. They've got good bigs, him specifically.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. He's got the best hands of any player of his size we've
played against, and also the best feet. So, individually, if you took the best
feet or the best hands, he's got them. And put them together in the same guy,
right, that's a really tough match-up, in that he could score in there, but he
passes extremely well out of there. And he can -- if he's got size, he can
score over you, and if you have size on him, he can score around you with his
ball handling. He's a great ball handler. He's a really tough match-up.  
  
And what really makes them good, is that he can score on you, and he can play
like a point guard and he can get Koenig and Showalter threes himself.  
  
Q. I was just in the locker room. I don't know who won, but you guys
were huddled around the phone, rooting for Seton Hall, their conference rival,
of course. I was wondering if you could speak a little about what kind of --
for fans and for people like you who are interested in it, what the NCAA
Tournament brings in terms of fan experience, especially compared to some
other sports events, especially compared to something like the NBA playoffs
which are same sport, but it's a kind of different feel?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I think what's unique about the NCAA Tournament, is that
everybody in the country feels a part of it, and everybody fills out their
bracket, and everybody kind of connects to a team or two, no matter who you
are. And then I think it's become almost a holiday, you know, an extended
holiday in our country. I think it's the best sporting event in our country in
terms of bringing our whole country together.  
  
And then you have the inside part of it, with the passionate fans connected to
their schools and following them on the ride, you know, in states and cities
that just take on the school even if it's not their school. I just think it's
one of the most unique and really the most entertaining sporting event in our
country.  
  
Q. Jay, Jalen was up here earlier and said that you referred to him as
an old soul. I was wondering what gave him that quality in your eyes?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's really mature for a 20-year-old. He's, sometimes I think,
more mature than me. During games, I can get more emotional and sometimes out
of control than he does, and he'll come to me and say we got this, Coach,
we're all right, Coach.  
  
He looks at every practice like a coach. He dissects everything we do, and he
looks at the game like an old-school guy, you know? Like one of those NBA guys
from the 1980s, just an intelligent skill-oriented game. I love all of that
about him.  
  
Q. And to follow up on that, is that why there's a trust level on your
part? He had two offensive fouls, I think, in the first half, but you didn't
go away from him. You were confident that he would make the right decision
when he got in the lane?  
JAY WRIGHT: Exactly. And last year, we started him out as a freshman on a
really experienced team because he acts like a guy that's been in four NCAA
Tournaments, even though he's only been in one. But he handles everything like
he's been here, you know, four times, and that's the old soul. He just acts
like a really experienced person.  
  
Q. Jay, Nigel Hayes has been on the big stage for a long time. You've
probably seen him for years. How do you think he's developed as his game has
developed? He seems to be playing quite well. What kind of match-up issue is
he?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. He's a nightmare matchup, and sometimes when you've been in
college basketball for four years, in the regular season, you know, you
realize at some point, okay, the NCAA Tournament is coming up. That's the big
show. And it kind of looks to me that's what he did. When the NCAA Tournament
hit, he's ready to go. In the Big Ten Tournament also.  
  
He's developed as a passer, decisionmaker, and shooter, you know? When he
first came in, he's kind of a rugged, aggressive guy, energy guy. Now, he's
just a complete basketball player. He can shoot it from three, he can drive
it, he passes it, he posts up. He's a great defender on the perimeter and the
post. It's pretty complete. It's pretty scary how I just described those two
guys and they are on the same team, right? It's a good team.  
  
Q. This time last year, Jay, you had to get out of this game to be a
success outwardly. What do you have to do in this game to be a success
outwardly?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question, Dana. Man, I don't know. Like, I think
there's varying opinions publicly on where -- probably this team would have to
get to the Final Four to be a -- you know, you're a one seed, you're supposed
to get to the Final Four, get out of your bracket. That's probably what we
have to be to be a success. And as you know, we accept that, we'll take it.
We're not going to define ourselves that way, but we do get it.  
  
Q. Jay, we all know Wisconsin is known for their defense and their
numbers always great. I mean, you guys' numbers aren't that much different
than theirs are. What do you feel about the way your defense played this year
and what is unique about how you play defense?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think we've gotten better towards the end of the year here, Joe.
I think in that Seton Hall game in the Big East tournament, our defense saved
us. We couldn't score. I think last night, second half, our defense saved us,
and we take pride in it. We play a lot differently defensively than Wisconsin,
and we take more chances. We trap more, we press more. We change up defenses
more. They are really, really solid and physical, and locked in, and it's
really different styles, it really is.  
  
But as you said, you look at the numbers, we're both trying to accomplish the
same thing. They rebound well, they hold their opponents to low percentage and
they try to take away threes.  
  
Q. Do you expect them tomorrow to be (inaudible).  
JAY WRIGHT: I do. I do. I wish it wouldn't be that way, but I think they're
going to be able to do that to us. I learned over the years you can try, but
against those real good teams, it usually doesn't work. You better figure out
how to play in their grind.  
  
Q. Wisconsin comes to mind as a team that can really shoot threes. A lot
of teams are, everybody is. Can you describe how that has evolved as a
strategy since you've been coaching minutes your days at Hofstra?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is. Defenses have really changed, and defensive concepts have
really changed since even I was an assistant coach, in that we were all so
help-oriented and protect the paint and don't give up easy baskets. And now
sometimes you give up an easy basket and say, thank God it wasn't a three. So
it is a completely different defensive philosophy, and the guys of our era
have had to adjust a lot.  
  
The younger head coaches, right now, are -- they came up that way. It's kind
of interesting to see some of the things they do, because they've come into
the game defending the three-point line.  
  
Q. Jay, I've just been asking all of the coaches, with the N.I.T.
experimenting with the four-quarter format, what's your opinion on that? Are
you in favor of the game moving that way? Why or why not?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, I don't know yet. I guess that would say I'm not in
favor yet, but I'm really interested in seeing how this works. Women's
basketball went this year for the first year and I didn't get to -- our
women's coach is a really bright guy, and he's a longtime coach. I want to
talk to him about that in the off season.  
  
But I am interested in it. I would like to see the game be the same
internationally, NBA, college. I would like to see it be the same game or as
close as possible.  
  
Q. You guys were in a dogfight yesterday at halftime and you came out in
a completely different gear. What was the message to your guys at halftime?
They obviously seemed to respond to it?  
JAY WRIGHT: For a good story, I would love to tell you I went in there and
ripped them, and they all came out fired up, but I really didn't. I just
sensed -- as I said earlier, we had a little nerves. I sensed we were a little
bit taken back by their speed and quickness, and they did a great -- you got
to give them credit, they did a great job of holding the ball until late in
the possession and then letting their little guards go and create plays, and
it was working.  
  
So, we didn't score until about 14 minutes to go in the first half. It was
only about seven or eight possessions. So they just had a great game plan. It
was working for a while. We had to stick to ours, and it eventually worked
out. That's really we did. I wish I could give you a better story.  
  
Q. When you look at Wisconsin film, they obviously play well through the
Big 10 Tournament and played well last night, but they struggled going into
the Big 10. What do you and your coaching staff focus on more? Where they
struggled two, three weeks ago or what they're doing now?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question. That's an interesting question for all
coaches. We always look at the last game. Because we feel like coaches -- you
know, if they played well in the last game, they're going to do a lot of the
things they did before. If they didn't play well in the last game, they're
going to change some things.  
  
So, we spend a lot more time on the last game, but then we go back in
importance, less importance, the further they are from this game.  
  
Q. Jay, you spoke about this a little bit last night. Kris, and his
shooting. You said you've spoken to him about that and keep encouraging him to
keep firing away. How does he respond to that, what kind of feedback does he
give you in those exchanges?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's great, man. A lot of guys -- we have a term, shoot'em up,
sleep in the streets. Kris lives that better than anybody that we've ever had.
Scotty Reynolds was one of the best, and Kris is in that category. They just
-- they don't fear a 2 for 13 night. I've been asked a lot by a lot of people,
good basketball journalists, that I know were around for a long time say, what
about Kris, what about Kris, is he going to be okay? It doesn't bother him at
all. That's what I love about him. I want all of our guys to be like that.  
  
Sometimes the younger guys, if they have a couple -- miss a couple shots, they
don't want to take the next shot. And we don't want them to play that way. We
tell them, if we have you out there on the court, we have confidence in you to
shoot. Really, he's the least of my worries.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Q. Question for Elijah. Notre Dame's offensive style is kind of unique
to the fact that they don't really have a true post player and they're kind of
five out and away from the paint. What does that do for you as far as
defending -- drawing you away from the basket? Was that something that you
think you could handle tomorrow?  
ELIJAH MACON: Yeah. Definitely. I just feel like as a team, we're going to go
over what we have to do today, especially just figure out who we're going to
guard in the game today and that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. You said you have offensive system (inaudible).  
ELIJAH MACON: Definitely. Kind of compare them to Iowa State. They try to
spread the floor a lot. But we're going to go over our principles today and
take care of it.  
  
Q. For Nathan and Elijah, you're going up against bigger, taller guys
yesterday. Tomorrow you're going up against a post player that's shorter, like
you said, more athletic. If there's a difference in the way you played them
and approached them especially in the post?  
ELIJAH MACON: Definitely. I mean just knowing, he like to play off angles,
just knowing that you have to stay down, especially just guard him off ball
and basically try to keep him out of the paint as much as possible. That's
pretty much what I've seen from watching film so much.  
  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think it changes how we have to guard them as a team more
than individually. You know they're five out instead of having someone sitting
in the post. It will be a whole team effort.  
  
Q. For Jevon, Mike Brey said you had done some playing with Matt Farrell
this summer. Is that accurate?  
JEVON CARTER: Yes.  
  
Q. What did you see out of him and how has he developed as a point guard
now that he's had a full season under his belt?  
JEVON CARTER: Pretty much what everybody's been saying all season. He's pretty
aggressive. He can pass, he can score. He's a good point guard. It's just our
job to do a good job and stop him from being comfortable.  
  
Q. Tarik, for you, and Nate as well, especially seniors. You guys have
been involved in a lot of these NCAA Tournament games. Tarik you hit a game
winner a couple years ago, but does it feel different now that you're a
senior, and this run has taken on more importance?  
TARIK PHILLIP: It's a little different. Because, as you said, we've been here
before. Not one time, but two times, so we feel more composed.  
  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I'd say there a little bit more difference towards the end of
the game, when it's a little bit closer, and you're comfortable and you start
to realize, if you blow this one, then you're not going to have another
chance. So it kind of gives you a little bit more of drive to win.  
  
Q. They make the fewest turnovers in the country, I guess for Jevon,
anybody wants to answer this. Do you think it's going to be tougher to impose
your will?  
JEVON CARTER: I don't know. Every game is a challenge. If we come out and do
what we've got to do, the it's possible. We just got to play hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Elijah?  
  
ELIJAH MACON: Yeah. I feel like if we come out and do what we're supposed to
do, just do what all our coaches ask us to do and everything, I feel like
everything will take care of itself. And we just go out and play our game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for West Virginia student-athletes? If not,
gentlemen, appreciate your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by West Virginia head coach, Bob Huggins, who has
his team preparing to play Notre Dame in the first game at 12:10 tip-off.
We'll go straight to questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said after every post season game, you haven't been
happy with the way your team has played. How far away are you from a level
where you feel like you'll need to get to to win this next game?  
BOB HUGGINS: We've got to make shots. We've got to make shots. We've got to
make free throws, and we can't turn it over. I mean, if we do those things,
we're pretty good. If you don't do those things, you're not very good. But
that's just not us, that's everybody. I just really say that we didn't play
very well so you guys have something to write. I know how hard it is.  
  
Q. We can write about anything.  
BOB HUGGINS: And do. And do, by the way.  
  
Q. Coach, you obviously saw Notre Dame a lot in the Big East. Just some
of memories going against Mike Brey in the Big East tournament games, whatever
it might be?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we had some great games. We hard a hard time winning in
South Bend. They had a hard time winning in Morgantown. Fortunate enough to
beat them in the semi-finals of the Big East Tournament in 2010 in Morgantown.
And they had a three to win the game. Fortunately for us, not for them, it was
short and got banged around a little bit. Actually Da'Sean Butler, nobody
knows this, he ran over and hugged Wellington Smith who got the rebound. The
reason he went over and hugged him was because Da'Sean did not block out man
and he had a clear run at the goal and it just happened to bounce Wellington's
way, so they he ran over and hugged him, because he said he would never have
heard the end of it if this guy would have rebounded it and scored.  
  
Q. Bob, a lot of times it seems like Mike and his team fly a little
under the radar nationally. What as a coach, do you think of the job he's been
able to do at Notre Dame over the years?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think Mike's one of the better coaches in our game. You know,
Mike's a guy who can pretty much take anybody and make them pretty good. And,
you know, they didn't always play the way they're playing now. I think he does
a great job of adapting style of play to personnel. And they do a great job of
-- they've got great ball movement, they've got great spacing. They can score
it at the goal, which is kind of imperative in our game, to be able to figure
out a way to score it somehow.  
  
I was just telling them, our game's about numbers, you know? 1 on 0 is the
best number, and we are generally pretty good at those. Then, you know, 2 on
1, and 3 on 2, we're not quite as good at. When you're 5 on 5, it's hard to
score, so that's why everybody does all of the things they do, ball screens,
single-doubles, staggers, flairs, whatever, they've got to try to create a 5
on 4, so that you've got numbers. When you add the spacing that they do, they
have great spacing, that makes them a hard team to guard.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have obviously gone up against a lot of talented
point guards in the Big 12, Frank Mason, Devante Morris Morris, Jawan Evans.
Farrell from Notre Dame, where does he kind of compare with that group, and
how do you kind of see him and Jevon going up against each other tomorrow?
What do you think that could be like?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think he's different than those guys because he plays so
well off the ball. You were kind of talking about guys who were really, really
good with the ball, and not that he's not good with the ball, but he can play
off the ball as well as he can play on the ball, which I think those other
guys kind of grew up with the ball in their hands and really play with the
ball in their hands. They're the guys that get in the seam, and create
numbers, where he's a guy who, a lot of times, comes down, gives it up and
he's the guy who's coming off the screens, and setting screens, and trying to
create numbers for his team.  
  
Q. Yesterday, first half, I think it was about four or five straight
times you guys converted on baseline in plays. I know you see it every day,
but what's it take to get to a point where your team's executing at that
level, and how important is that in these games here in March?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I'm like everybody else in our business. When, you know,
somebody runs something against us, that it's hard for us to guard and they
score, I steal it. And everything we run is something that I got from somebody
else that. You know, you might tweak it a little bit, but we've been running
the same thing for ten years at West Virginia, and we just keep scoring. So,
obviously, Nolan Richardson was pretty damn smart.  
  
Q. Just given how well they handle the ball and limit turnovers, is this
a bad match-up for you?  
BOB HUGGINS: They don't let us pick. I mean, if you're asking me, would we
have picked them, absolutely not. I don't know if it is or it isn't. I guess
that's why you play. We're going to try to do the same thing to them that they
do to us. We're going to try to create numbers in the half court, and we're
going to try to take transition when it's there. I don't know whether is or it
isn't. Probably about 2:00 tomorrow, I'll have an answer for you.  
  
Q. Bob, do you miss the Big East?  
BOB HUGGINS: Who doesn't miss New York? Who doesn't miss the Garden? Sure, you
miss the Garden. But, the Big 12's been great for us. And we're playing in --
it's been the best RPI league in the country for the last four or five years.
There's been great players. You look at -- the coaching in that league is
terrific, and there's no bottom. And the reality is for as great as the Big
East was, there was a bottom. There were nine or ten teams that were really
good and then there were about five or six that weren't so good.  
  
And, you know, you looked at the schedule. You talked about, you know, match-
ups. Those are the ones you kind of said these are the ones that we really
need to get because these are gettable, and the Big 12 doesn't have that.
Oklahoma State today takes Michigan to the wire, and they're really good, and
they lost their first six league games. I mean, think about that. If that's
the bottom, our bottom's pretty good. Then they ended up not being on the
bottom, obviously.  
  
But coaches in our league are just -- that's the worrisome thing. Every time
you look down there -- honestly, sometimes I'd look down there and think,
well, if it gets really good, I might be a little smarter than that guy down
there. I'm looking down there in the Big 12. I don't see anybody I'm smarter
than.  
  
Q. When your players were up here earlier, it was a bit of a somber mood
for some young men that won yesterday. Taking the emotion out of the game, is
that important, as like a key to victory, or do you encourage sort of the
highs and lows?  
BOB HUGGINS: I was in the locker room with them. They weren't very somber in
there. It's a long year, you know? It's a long year and you can't get too
excited about the highs, and you can't get too down about the lows. And, you
know, I think probably the appropriate thing to do is to keep an even keel.
But, I mean, if you don't play with a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm,
the way we play, you get exposed.  
  
We've got to cover a whole lot more ground than everybody else does, because
we're playing the length of the floor when everybody else is playing a half
court. So, energy and enthusiasm are incredibly important us to. They're just
probably saving it. Tricking you is what they're doing. See, they tricked you.  
  
Q. Bob, I was just curious about your thoughts on the N.I.T. going to
four quarters. Is that something you would like to see, experimenting with it
this year. Is that something you would like to see the game go toward? Just
what are your general thought on that format?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think we ought to stop having our Rules Committee in Palm
Springs. I think because they just feel this need to make changes to justify
them being there, and what's wrong with our game? I mean, I don't know what's
wrong with our game. Why do we need four quarters? I think everybody plays
four quarters in high school, and they can't wait to get into college and play
halves. But that's just me. But I do think we ought to move the -- we ought to
have them here in Buffalo in February.  
  
Q. Coach, have you figured out Lamont yet? He hit a lot of shots in the
Texas game then obviously he hit a lot of shots for you yesterday. Is it youth
or obviously a bad match-up?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think he started rushing things a little bit, quite frankly.
You know, people are bigger, stronger and faster, you know? And they get to
the ball a lot faster, and I think he just started rushing things. When he
slowed down, then he started making shots again. But that's the same with
everybody. I mean, nobody consistently makes hurried shots.  
  
Q. Other questions for Coach Huggins?  
BOB HUGGINS: As a side note, I think the other thing about the Rules
Committee, you have to have somebody on it over 6 foot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else about Rules Committee, or --  
  
BOB HUGGINS: I have a lot of things about the Rules Committee.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I thought you might. We have a little bit of time. That's why I
was wondering.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: No. I think I already got myself in enough trouble.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll call this it then. Thanks, Coach.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Nigel Hayes, Bronson Koenig and Zak
Showalter. Congratulations on advancing, playing Villanova in the second game
tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. You guys, over the last -- you're a senior, you've been on teams that
have beaten a couple number one seeds. What is it about this program that
allows you to really rise up in these moments?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I'm not really sure, to be honest, I know that ever since me
and Nigel came in as freshman we've been a resilient team. We don't get
rattled when we're down. Kind of like Villanova, just play with a lot of
poise. That comes from having a lot of confidence in ourselves, and us as a
team.  
  
Q. You are the leading scorer in this tournament. You might have some
insight.  
NIGEL HAYES: Has to do with our preparation. Our coaches do an extremely good
job of scouting, but we also do a good job of trying to sticking to the
fundamentals and do the little things. That's what gives you championships. Of
course, there's going to be plays made and he's the poster child for making
spectacular plays, but there's also a lot of the little plays that you don't
see, which is what Showy's responsible for. So, Bronson gets all of the
attention, and Showy is the one in the background doing all of the diving,
playing great defense for, and when you put all that together on one team, and
we're all playing together, playing for one another, you can do special
things.  
  
Q. Nigel, through all of this tournament experience through the last
four year, what is the most valuable lesson you guys have learned?  
NIGEL HAYES: How to remain cool, calm, and collected during moments of either
low points in the game or high points, knowing that you may get up, but it may
not be over yet. You still have game left to play, and even if another team
goes on a run or you get down on that again there's more time left. You can
come back, and we've seen both sides of it. Going back to our first time in
the tournament, really, when we played Oregon and Milwaukee, we were on pace
to lose by 20-plus, and you know, we kept our composure and we were able to
fight back and win.  
  
Q. This is for all of you. What was -- what were the emotions like on
senior night in Wisconsin, and what has the experience of being in school all
these years meant to all of you?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: I think it was a very special night for all of us. Obviously
this group of four seniors has been in a lot of big games in our career, and
really got a lot from Wisconsin. So, I think we -- it was a big night.
Especially, we want to get a big win going into tournament play and it started
turning our season around a little bit.  
  
BRONSON KOENIG: I think at that point we had lost maybe five or six games or
so, and having our final game at home against a really good Minnesota team, we
knew that that could really propel us forward going on in to the Big Ten
Tournament and just kind of used that as -- just kind of used that going
forward into March and April, hopefully.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nigel?  
  
NIGEL HAYES: It was extremely emotional, not that everyone was in tears or
anything, but just knowing it's an end to something that's been very, very
good to you. You've made some great memories there, even with the wins and
losses, the connections that you made with people, the experiences that we'd
had, we're extremely appreciative. Fortunately for us, we've had a lot more
wins than losses, so it's been pretty good. Knowing that that's an end of a
chapter in our life, obviously you don't want to see it move on, but it has
to.  
  
So now we're just trying to change that focus from that, use all of that
experience and all of that time we've had and try to do something special in
our last year.  
  
Q. It's a life lesson. Those four years, not everybody stays in school
four years. What did it do for you just being at Wisconsin those four years?  
NIGEL HAYES: Just changed as a person, able to mature on and off the court.
Able to develop yourself again, not necessarily just basketball-wise but also
as a person, you change, your beliefs, thought processes, things that go on in
your everyday life. You're also able to make new connections with people, able
to actually play school. He likes to call us student-athletes a lot. All of us
will be graduating, so you do a lot of great things. That's the beauty of
staying in school.  
  
Q. Nigel, Coach Wright said you had a look of a senior that doesn't want
your career to end. You're working on string of three straight double-doubles
here. What's going on that you were able to step it up more than usual in this
last little stretch?  
NIGEL HAYES: Just that sense of urgency that you have. Again, I've been
fortunate with Bronson and Showy to have been on some teams with older guys,
and we've been fortunate enough to make some long runs. Once you see that run
end, you know the look on the guys' faces, the faces in the jerseys in the two
years, the pain that you can hear. I saw that at a young age, and I want to
make sure I do everything in my power to not let that happen.  
  
I even mentioned to the guys having to being willing to die for the
opportunity to play in a National Championship. I know it may sound extreme,
but I'd rather go out there in the game and give everything I have. You can't
move with a win, then coming out of there feeling a little better with a loss
because a loss will feel a millions times worse than the amount of pain that
you can do with a win.  
  
Q. Zak, Kris with the tight turn, you guys talked about what you wanted
to shore up from last night. How do you balance what you want to do better
than yesterday and getting ready for the No. 1 overall seed?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: Yeah, we went over -- Nigel just talked about our scouting
reports and our coaches and getting us prepared for these games. This morning
slept in a little, got a good scouting report in from Coach Moore and just
handling ball screens and stuff like that a little better. I don't want to get
into too many details about what our plan is. That's why I think we have
success is we pay attention to details and stuff like that. So I think that
will help us and we'll be ready to go on Saturday.  
  
Q. Zak, we were talking before, two of the losses were to Butler, a team
that plays somewhat similar to you guys, tough on defense, grinds it out on
offense a little bit. Is that encouraging to you guys or do you not even
consider that and play your own game?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: It's encouraging. I don't think you want to read into it too
much. I think we'll play our style of play no matter who is standing on the
other side. I think Villanova is a team that sits similar to us, and they've
been in big games before, and they know what it's like to play in these
situations. So, it's going to be a heck of a game on Saturday, and I'm excited
for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by University of Wisconsin head coach, Greg
Gard. Coach, first, congrats on advancing to play Villanova. I guess whatever
congratulations you can get to play the No. 1 seed.  
  
GREG GARD: Great parting gift.  
  
Q. Several Villanova players mentioned Butler as comparison to you guys,
Butler beat them twice during the year. I was wondering if you had a chance to
see either of those games or see Butler and if there's any comparison there as
well?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I've watched Butler play them. Obviously, comparatively wise,
we haven't played Butler in a few years, so I think there's probably some
comparisons. I think there's also some comparisons between us and Villanova,
specifically defensively. Just watching them, how physical they are, how they
do a great job of playing a team-oriented defense. Really low to the ball
pretty well, and defensively they're very impressive. Everybody talks about
what Hart and Jenkins and Brunson do offensively and how they run the show.
Defensively they're very good as well.  
  
I think that's where you draw some comparisons, whether it's Butler, Notre
Dame, another team that's here, just how they play so well together.  
  
Q. Greg, I asked a few coaches this, and your program fits the bill as
well. In the era of one-and-done, when players stick at schools such as
yourself, is that more a formula for repeat champion looking at Villanova when
you've got that experience? Do you think things changing a little bit?  
GREG GARD: I think the experience definitely helps. You can look at the other
side and see teams that have won and done that with one-and-done players. I
think we're probably both in similar boats from a standpoint that we have guys
that stay for the majority of their time, maybe not all of the time, but for
the most part.  
  
And you have two programs that develop pretty well, and they get better as
time goes on. And you usually look at their roster, and I went through it last
night or early this morning, when I got back to the hotel, and I saw a lot of
RSs in front of names meaning redshirt. I'm going to go back and research that
even deeper because that's always been a big part of our program is when we
can redshirt guys and play with older guys. That's helped in our consistency,
and I'm sure Jay would say the same thing in terms of him sustaining what he's
done there. When you can have older guys for the most part on the floor, I
think that really helps.  
  
Q. How have you seen the development of how teams have chosen to defend
Happ as he's developed as a player. He brings such unique skill set with
elusiveness down there. I guess you try to deny and then you've seen a lot of
doubles to make him get rid of the two. Do you anticipate some of that from
Villanova and how has he handled getting that much attention, that he wasn't
getting maybe earlier in his career?  
GREG GARD: Well, he's gotten better in terms of handling double-teams over the
last month, six weeks. He struggled with it early, I think. And then as he
improved in terms of handling that, we also didn't take advantage of it on the
back side, whether it was back-side threes, we miss a lot of wide open shots
earlier in the year when that first became a scheme against us. And then,
secondly, we also missed the opportunity to throw it back in on the back side
of the -- or, the back side of the defense.  
  
So, he's obviously gotten better, but also the guys around him have gotten
better at taking advantage of what's there. We've tweaked some things. We've
drilled a lot of things to try to help him through that. So, he's probably
seen about every conceivable thing you can do with five guys on the floor in
terms of where the traps are coming from, whether it's the bottom, whether
it's the top, whether it's the same side wing, whether it's been post to post.  
  
It's just a matter of making decisions, being strong with the ball, not
panicking, and he's had to grow through it. And we'll continue to work with
it, and we work it about every week. But it's also, in large part, due to the
play around him, too. If guys can help him out, and not put him on an island
and change sides of the floor. And then when you make shots against it, that's
the ultimate goal to try to make teams pay for committing an extra guy towards
him.  
  
Q. You mentioned it the other day, but can you elaborate a little bit
about what you remember about your experience winning a national title here in
1995 in Buffalo?  
GREG GARD: Well, I'm in my second year of college coaching. I'm still an
undergrad student at UW Platteville. We get beat in the Sweet 16 the year
before, and then we come back and go undefeated. So, I got spoiled right off
the bat in terms of thinking it was always going to be like that, how easy it
was to march to a Final Four and have an undefeated team.  
  
But the experience here in Buffalo was terrific. Obviously there I am at 24 at
the time, and you have that type of an experience. And I think what those
experiences at Plattville taught me and Coach Ryan was always talking to me
about this, is that divisions didn't matter. Don't get caught up in the Roman
numeral behind the school or what division you're in. The experiences we can
have at Division III were maybe not the same stage as Division I, but the
experiences for the student-athlete and the excitement and the drama and
euphoria with it, those were great, great memories.  
  
And obviously, to Buffalo, the National Championship here, prior to the two we
won at Salem in '98 and '99, those are vivid memories for me, and that was
kind of where it all started in terms of my college coaching.  
  
Q. Do you ever look back when you're on this grand stage and think back
to it started for you on that smaller stage?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. And I think that helps keep this in perspective. That it's
still a game. They're still young men out there trying to play really well.
There's so much attention given to it from the outside that it's -- you keep
reminding yourself what it was like then, what an innocent experience it was
for those guys back in '95.  
  
And I actually talked to one of the players that was on the team two nights
ago, Saul Phillips who is now the coach at Ohio University, and he was a
senior on that team in '95. Just remembering back to how we rushed the floor,
that whole journey through the year, going undefeated, just the innocence of
what it's like. And I was close to their age. Those guys are 22, 23, and I'm
24, still finishing up my undergrad. It puts it in perspective, what the
experience is like for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Greg, Nigel is working on a string of two straight double-doubles
here. Is this just a senior feeling the end of his career coming on and
wanting to prolong it? Has he made some changes in his game or maybe have you
made some changes in how you're using him?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think it's probably all three. I think he's attacked the
paint a little more ferociously, gotten better at trying to play around the
rim a little bit more, and I think that's been a year-long process. We've done
a few things schematically a little differently over the last three weeks or
so to try to maybe emphasize it even more, take advantage of what they were
doing with Happ specifically. But I also think it's -- I've said it several
times, seniors hear the clock ticking. They see the sands going through the
hourglass knowing there's not much time left regardless of how we finish it
out. It's coming to an end pretty soon.  
  
I would say a combination of all three. But probably, number one, he
understands what time of year it is. And, number two, he's made a conscious
effort to take advantage of what his advantage is, and that's basically
playing 15 feet and in, and using his skill set to try to create those match-
ups or getting defenses caught in some of those match-up advantages.  
  
Q. When the team was struggling late in the season, they were pressing
and it was against teams that maybe they were favored against. The national
perception tomorrow night is you guys are playing a Villanova team that you're
not supposed to beat. Does that help the guys to go out there and play maybe
more relaxed, get it all out there, nothing to lose?  
GREG GARD: Well, I don't know. I think once the ball goes up, guys just play.
And I think sometimes there's more made of that type of scenario, in terms of
who's loose, who the pressure's on, who's favored. That, I think is really
irrelevant in players' minds. Once that ball goes up, like I said, all of that
gets flushed out, and you just play for the 40 minutes. And I think during our
stretch, I don't know so much if we pressed as we played some teams that have
played very well against us. We were not in sync specifically offensively.
Some of that was due to Koenig being hobbled a little bit, and that put us out
of sync. Even when he came back, we weren't quite as in sync was we were the
last couple weeks.  
  
It's a combination of things. I don't want to discredit the other teams'
efforts and what they did, and we also saw teams fighting for post season
appearances. We went to Michigan State when they needed to win. We were
playing Iowa when they were still trying to fight for their post season lives.
I think Northwestern, same example. So I don't want to discredit what the
other teams did and how well they played against us, but I also don't want to
put all the light on that our guys were feeling pressure. Hey, we didn't play
well specifically offensively, and, you know, we got back to being more in
sync and that's helped us.  
  
Q. I just want to get some of your thoughts. What are your impressions
when you watched Villanova in that classic National Championship game last
year and do you, as a program, do you see that in a different lens having been
in a National Championship game?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. What I see in Villanova is a championship-program-type
swagger, and I've seen it in our guys, too, just from the benefits of being in
two Final Fours. They understand what it's about and what you have to go
through and also that air of confidence that borders on arrogance. I mean,
without being arrogant, you watch Villanova walk on the floor and they are
very confident, led by Jalen Brunson, who has always been a championship level
guard. Even when he was back at Illinois in Stevenson High School, he had the
air about him then.  
  
And Hart carries that same type of presence about him. You look at that and
I've see it in our guys too. I think it's embedded in both programs. What was
the other part of your question?  
  
Q. Do you watch a National Championship game differently, having been in
one?  
GREG GARD: Not really. I probably watch it less, you know? Having been there
and knowing that you -- like I said, I don't get caught up in a lot of the
pomp and circumstance around it. I just lock in on the game itself, and try to
watch that more so than all of the fanfare around it. Having been there,
usually get to that time of year, your tank's pretty well empty, so you're
trying to recharge and get ready for what's next.  
  
So, obviously Villanova had a heck of a year last year. They've had a
phenomenal year this year. I think last year helped them springboard into this
year, even though they lost a few guys. But those guys that have returned
really carried the mantle pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did you expect to get from Khalil last night and how
much of that carries over with your bench tomorrow?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't know where he was going to be at
emotionally. He seemed like he was okay when I talked to him over the couple
days, but Khalil is also a tough read. He hides his emotions pretty well for
the most part. He would be a very good poker player because he doesn't let you
know a whole lot of what's going through his mind. But I thought he was
terrific last night. He was a huge boost for us. He was very active. We missed
him against Michigan in the championship game, there's no doubt, specifically
defensively. He had played very well at Ann Arbor, a couple weeks prior, three
weeks prior. So that void was evident on tape, and it was even more evident
when he came back to practice last week what he added back to us.  
  
I'm just happy for him because he's been through so much hurt and sorrow, not
only with his cousins, but also what he's going through with his dad. I know
he's still working to try to get through that, and rightfully so. I know how
it's been for me at 46, losing my dad a year and a half ago, and for somebody
to go through it when you're still in high school, I can only imagine how
painful that's been for him and then to add that on top of it. It's a lot for
a young person to handle. So I'm happy for him because he needed something
positive. He was definitely very positive for us last night.  
  
Q. Greg, I was just ask every coach today with the N.I.T. experimenting
with the four-quarter format, I was just curious what your thoughts were on
that. Would you like to see the game move that why, why or why not in?  
GREG GARD: I've watched very little of the N.I.T. I watched a couple of the
teams that are in it from our league. A little bit of Indiana, a little bit
Illinois, a little Iowa. I don't know exactly the impact it's had. I know from
talking to high school coaches in the state of Wisconsin and Minnesota, we
just went to halves in the last handful of years, and the high school coaches
do not want to go back to quarters. They really like the flow of the game in
the halves and the way it's set up right now. So, just judging from what their
feedback has been in both states, Minnesota's had it a little bit longer than
Wisconsin, it's been a positive move for the game in that regard. And I
probably, unless data or information tells me otherwise, I would probably be
in favor of keeping it how it is. And I've always been, if it's not broke, why
are we tinkering with it? I think there's probably some other things in the
game we can continue to work on, rather than worrying about changing to
quarters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Appreciate. Good luck tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Q. Matt, the other day, Mike Brey said that you were better than Bobby
Hurley. I kind of chuckled even just now. What was your response to that? How
do you take that praise?  
MATT FARRELL: It's kind of crazy to hear for me. The Hurleys are unbelievable
coaches. He's an unbelievable coach. He was an unbelievable player. So, I take
it as a huge compliment. I don't know if he's right, but I'll obviously strive
to try to be better than him or try to be even as good as him. He was an
unbelievable player and he's an unbelievable couch now. It's just Coach Brey
kind of relaying the relationship me and him have, so I'll take it as a huge
compliment.  
  
Q. And this is for you, Matt. How have you made the adjustment to being
a starter this season, and the fact that you've been efficient with the ball?
What have you kept in mind this year as you've helped lead this team to this
point?  
MATT FARRELL: Just maintaining the same confidence that I played with when I
first got my start in the NCAA Tournament last year. Just playing the same way
I do, sticking to what I know, and then playing with these guys around me
really helps. You know, playing with the guys that I really want to play for,
and I think that makes a huge difference. We got guys that want to play for
each other, and they make me better on the floor. And just the culture of this
program, you know? It kind of all worked out. It was all good vibes going
forward. So I'm just maintaining that confidence and trusting the system and
trusting the guys around me.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, Matt, as well as you played especially during that
one stretch in the middle of the second half yesterday with the steal, the
feed and the three-point basket, you were visibly disappointed as you were
walking off the floor. After I guess, you know, missing a couple of shots
there in the final 25 seconds, how do you use that to fuel yourself moving
forward? You guys won, and maybe you weren't at your best in some ways.  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. Personally, I feel like I got to be better down the
stretch. Take that hard. I got to make that free throw, and I got to make
better decisions down there. I don't think I was upset because we won. I'll
always be happy we won. These guys picked me up, doing that all year. We do
that for each other. But just use that as motivation, try to get better the
next day. That's the good thing about basketball. There's always another game
as long as you keep winning.  
  
Q. Two questions. One, it's kind of assumed that today's college players
are inpatient when it comes to playing time. I'm kind of wondering, how did
you find the patience to stick it out with Grant and Jackson in front of you
when you first got to school. And question number two, what have you seen with
West Virginia's Jevon Carter, and what do you think the matchup of battling
point guards will play tomorrow?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. I think, as I mentioned before, the culture. Guys in the
past haven't been able to play right away in this program. They wait their
turn. And fortunately for me, I was able to develop a good relationship with
Demetrius, so he was always in my ear telling me to keep working hard. As I
said before, it's hard to do that. Anybody that's been in that situation, not
playing, it's a hard thing to grasp every day. Like I said before, these guys
around me, being around them every day, that really does help. It's just a
matter of being patient, like you said, and keep working hard. If you do the
right thing, you'll getting an opportunity. I got my opportunity and I just
tried to do what I do and I try to play.  
  
As for West Virginia, we know what they do. It's going to be a fun game. It's
going to be fast-paced. Their guards are really good. Their bigs are really
good. So it's going to be another fun game in March.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how much has the a chronic conversation about what you
aren't, because of your size, fueled you for the entirety of your career?  
BONZIE COLSON: I'll just say being motivated, being motivated to do what I can
do to help us succeed as possible. Trying to lead by example on and off the
court, and, just use, what they say, as motivation. Our team, we're focused in
on what we can do and how we can be better. I think that's something that is
within our program. We don't really worry about what other people say. We lock
in and we know what we can do to win games.  
  
Q. Is there anyone that helped you believe that it doesn't matter what
mold you fit, you can just play?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think growing up, my father was a huge example of always be
there for me and just motivating me to be the best player possible. Then
coming here and having the great coaching staff, having great brothers and
teammates who just push me to be the best player I can be. And learning from
guys, former leaders, former captains, of how to lead on and off the court is
something that has really helped me to be a good captain and leader.  
  
Q. Maybe we'll start with Steve on the match-up. The number one
turnover-forcing team in the nation. What do you see?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. They do a great job of forcing people to get out of
their comfort zone. I think their defense creates and turns it to their
offense, and that's something that they're really known for. I think the way
we play, we do a great job handling the ball, give credit to Matty and our
guards to make great decisions. So for us I think for us the challenge is just
going to be making sure, making the right decisions and not rushing. I think
that's something we've been very good at all season long, so just taking our
time, making the right decision, and I think we'll be able to get some good
shots.  
  
Q. And, Matt, you're going to be in the middle of that. Have you ever
faced a defense like this?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, you know, we've kind of compared them to Florida State a
little bit. Being in the passing lanes, contesting full-court pressure. I
think there's is a little more difference, a little more havoc, I would say,
or reckless, you got guys everywhere. So, we just need to stay poised with the
ball. We need guys to be receivers. Everybody that's on the floor needs to be
a receiver. We need to be strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Bonzie, if you can comment. What allows you guys -- I mean, one team
made 40 turnovers. You haven't made 40 turnovers in the last six games
combined. What do you think allows you guys to have so few turnovers?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I just think within our program, that's something that we
like to do. We like to not turn over the ball, be strong with the ball, and I
think playing teams like Florida State and Louisville has really helped us
prepare for games like this, where they press. They deny the perimeter. I
think playing those ACC games really helped us to play the games like this.  
  
Q. Steve, what lessons as a team do you feel like you guys have taken
away from the Elite Eight runs the last two years, and personally how do you
feel, if at all, your mental approach has changed this being your senior
year?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think obviously the last two years, having that experience
has helped us a lot. I think you saw yesterday first round, close game, we
were pretty poised. We've been in those situations before, and I think those
two losses in the Elite Eight drives this team, especially since the end of
last year. The three who are up here, and the guys in the locker room knows
what it felt like to lose, and that's kind of pushed us this year to try to
take it a step further, and I think we just have to continue to take it one
game at a time.  
  
Q. Inaudible question.  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy it and soak up all the
experience of the NCAA Tournament. I've been lucky to be here the past three
years. Coach Brey always talks about not to take it for granted. Not everybody
has an opportunity to play in the tournament. We've had a couple good runs.
It's been a great season. We've had a lot of huge wins. I just want to
continue to play as long as I can, and that starts with tomorrow and trying to
get to the next round.  
  
Q. Matt, how would you describe Thursday's crowd in terms of Irish
support?  
MATT FARRELL: We love our fans. We feel like we got the best fans. Crowd
starting piling up, I think in the second half, a lot of Princeton, a lot of
West Virginia people, so I'm sure a lot of people seemed to be pulling for the
upset. But we love our crowds. They always travel well. They're always really
supportive, and there's been a couple games where we played in Greensboro for
the ACC Tournament and the whole place was blue, and we have our little spot
behind the bench and they're just as loud. So we appreciate everything they
do. They know that, we know that, that we appreciate it.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how typical of a comment is it, a team like Notre Dame,
sometimes it's like the Yankees fans, seemingly everywhere all over the
country. How common is that when you go play road games and neutral side games
when there's a large Irish contingency?  
BONZIE COLSON: Like Matt said we love the fans. We feed off the fans' energy
during the game. It's great when we're coming, getting ready for the game,
heading to the bus, and the band's playing our fight song, and the fans are
cheering and clapping. I think that gets us motivated and gives us a lot
energy to play well. We play for our family, we play for the fans, for the
University. So it just helps us play with that edge.  
  
Q. I was just in your locker room. There's a TV in there and guess what
it's tuned into. I'm wondering amidst all of your preparation for the games
themselves, if you're also able to be fans of March Madness and if it's like
us, like most of the people watching, if it's a cool annual event to you guys
beyond the fact that you obviously get to play in it?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. This is something we've all been watching our whole
lives. We've got a lot of friends from many teams, friends that we've grown up
playing in this game. We're texting each other, we talking about the games,
seeing when they play, trying to tune in. This is a great culture for our
basketball, just watching games. We're way into it, watching different
experiences, learning from the game. I think it's something that really helps
us bring the culture together.  
  
MATT FARRELL: I think it's all part of being in the tournament and that
experience. You get to watch these other games. You get to see all these crazy
games, the buzzer beaters, stuff like that. Like Bonzie said, a lot of us have
friends out here playing, too. We're always talking and seeing how they're
doing. It's a fun atmosphere. We do have the loosest coach in America. We got
TVs on, we just hang out and have a good time.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on that for Bonzie, well, all of you, what
impressions do you have of the tournament so far? Are there common themes?
What struck you when you watched these games?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I think all of the games are great. Just tuning in,
walking in, watching them. Enjoying the game and not taking them for granted.
The game's been fun. Hasn't really been any upsets, I don't think. Just paying
attention, watching the games.  
  
Q. What do you get out of it, Matt?  
MATT FARRELL: It's a tournament of champions. It's obviously really fun to
watch. Every team in this tournament is capable of winning games. It's a fun
time. It's a time for basketball fans to just really enjoy, and just sit down
and watch it. I think it's the greatest sporting event that we have. It's a
lot of fun to watch.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I would just say the one thing from watching yesterday,
is every single game is a close game. You're not going to see many blow-outs
in this tournament. Like Matt said, every team has had a heck of a regular
season. They probably won their league, and they are all coming down to the
wire. I know yesterday they played early, so we got to watch pretty much the
rest of the games for the day, which was cool. And just to see guys hitting
big shots, making plays, and especially the guys in our conference who we've
played against all season long. And watching them go against other
conferences, I think it's pretty fun.  
  
Q. First, happy St. Patrick's Day you to guys. I was wondering Bonzie if
you could talk about the matchup with West Virginia, first of all as a team
and secondly individually how you think of them.  
BONZIE COLSON: They're a team that's defensively oriented. They press the
whole game. They defend. They have some three-point shooters, have drivers. So
it's going to be a fun game, and I think going over their scout, we played
teams like that who can really defend and can really deny up to the perimeter.
So I think playing in the ACC has really helped us.  
  
Myself, just sticking with what I do, trying to be the best rebounder I can
out there, grabbing all the rebounds, just playing within myself, staying in
character, and motivating my teammates as best I can so they get to do things
they want to do as well.  
  
Q. Steve, the fact that it is St. Patrick's Day and you guys are the
Fighting Irish. Is there anything that you guys do that's special to celebrate
the day or anything like that?  
STEVE VASTURIA: No, not so far, I don't think. Maybe if we get a win and go
back to South Bend and enjoy St. Patrick's Day there. But nothing -- just try
to enjoy the holiday.  
  
Q. Inaudible question.  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. You could say that.  
  
Q. Matt, I wonder if you could expand on the loosest coach in America?
What makes Mike so loose?  
MATT FARRELL: How about this? He comes into the locker room right after he
gets off the court and puts on a green hoodie and said he has to get into St.
Patrick's mode for the media. We've got a game tomorrow, we got to the Sweet
16 game, and this guy is worried about what he's wearing for the media.  
  
It's an atmosphere and he creates an environment, where you're having fun and
you've got guys that want to win and want to play for each other and the
coaches, and I think that's really powerful.  
  
Q. What's your experience been like in Buffalo? Granted, there's a large
number of Irish fans here. This is a big St. Patrick's Day city. Have you guys
had any weird experiences with Buffalonians coming up to you, and whether it's
words of encouragement and what not, Bonzie?  
BONZIE COLSON: There's a lot of snow here. There was a lot of snow, so I think
it's kind of similar to South Bend, a lot of snow on the ground. But, I mean,
fans have been great here. We're enjoying it, not taking it for granted. We're
going to the hotel. There's cookies, there's snacks for us. We feel like we're
home. We're just having fun. We're enjoying it, and we're having a good time.  
  
Q. Have you guys done anything fun, Steve?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. We went out to eat the first night we were here,
probably one of the best steaks and lobster bisque that I ever had. It was
SEAR?  
  
BONZIE COLSON: SEAR?  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah, it was really good. I think we're going to go grab some
food tonight. Yeah, just trying to take it all in and enjoy the town.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach, Mike Brey.  
  
Q. Mike, well, you obviously did come out with a green pullover and
happy St. Patrick's Day. What is the feeling today, being it's St. Patrick's
Day?  
MIKE BREY: Well, can we make this quick? I'm the honorary grand marshal of the
parade in an hour. If I can get out of here, I've got to kiss babies, and wave
to people. The float I'm on, they say, is awesome. I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. No. St. Patrick's Day?  
MIKE BREY: No. It's awesome. There's always a little buzz around our
University and our place on St. Patrick's Day. There's no question about it.
And figured I would break out the festive green for it, you know? I'll say
this, St. Patrick's Day is great when you're still alive in the NCAA
Tournament. It sucks when you're not.  
  
Q. It was a stretch yesterday in the first half where you guys converted
coming out of time-outs on three or four and got what you wanted. There were a
lot of experienced teams in America. Not everyone could execute to that level.
Two parter. What's it like to have that ace and what's it take to get to that
point to get guys to do that?  
MIKE BREY: I think you have to have high basketball I.Q. guys and experience
and veterans, and we're an older group, and we're an older group that has won
together and we've won together in this tournament. So, I think the
concentration and focus level in Brooklyn was fabulous. And yesterday, even
though it was not pretty offensively for us, I thought we were very locked in.
But we did get some good stuff, especially post-ups for Bonzie out of time-
outs. We thought that was really good.  
  
You know, again, this group has played together a lot now, and they know who
they are. I give them a lot of credit that they kind of figure it out in our
motion, and it's not maybe a specific play all of the time.  
  
Q. Matt just termed you loosest coach in America. I'm wondering if
earlier in your career, if anybody referred to you as that or is that
something you aged into?  
MIKE BREY: I think I was a little more uptight when I got to South Bend in
2000 because I was trying not to get fired. You're trying to survive and build
it. Even though -- I would say this inwardly, I was more uptight. I think I
always tried to be loose with our guys and not get them uptight. Of course,
when you're a little more established, you can really be loose. I have tenure
now at Notre Dame, so I'm really loose.  
  
Q. Similar -- we have a rare confluence tomorrow of two coaches who
don't wear ties facing each other. I think we know a lot of the back story
behind Coach Huggins' decision there. But you got to do it differently because
you actually are dressed quite slickly, but without a tie. I know in the past
you had another way of dressing as well. I wonder if you can take us through
that and your current thinking?  
MIKE BREY: Maybe I was the one that got the turtleneck popular. That was my
look. And when I got to Notre Dame the first, I said did you really think that
through? I said I was in America East. It's a bus league. You wear a
sweatshirt on a bus, when you beat Boston University and you bus six hours.  
  
So it was comfortable and I stayed with it until my daughter said Dad, that's
got to go. That's out. That's got to go. But there's no way I can put the tie
on. You're right. Bob and I were kidding at the meeting and said, we run into
each other, two guys not wearing ties. I don't know how the NCAA feels about
that, the whole decorum rule, if we'll get a fine, or whatever.  
  
Q. Question about the Irish fan base here in Buffalo, did it feel like a
neutral site at all yesterday for you?  
MIKE BREY: No, it didn't. I think this town is a good N.D. town. Over 17
years, I've run into people from here that are big N.D. fans, whether alums or
subway alums. I hope they can get out of jail by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow to come to
our game, because they're rolling today, I can tell you that much. Matter of
fact, we have some extra bail money just to make sure we can get them out. We
know what happens with the Irish on a day like today.  
  
Now, there's no question in the second half yesterday, it felt like a road
game. You know, West Virginia fans, Princeton fans are certainly -- Bucknell
fans certainly cheering for Princeton, and that was kind of a road atmosphere
in the ACC we had to escape. I think we'll be well-represented tomorrow,
though.  
  
Q. With your son going to school around these parts has he told you how
Buffalo does St. Patrick's Day parades whatnot?  
MIKE BREY: He did a little bit, but the waitress helping us this morning, I
said Is it big here? And she went on for ten minutes how it's unbelievable.
I'm sure starting today, the bar's open at noon, and we're off and running.  
  
Q. Mike, in an era when so many players are leaving early, I wonder if
Villanova and even you if you would ever within a national championship,
programs like yours with your experience are more equipped to repeat?  
MIKE BREY: I think they are. Jay and I's program as you know is kind of built
the same way with guys that grow up into the program and get older and aren't
necessarily McDonald's All-Americans. I think it's a huge advantage. I think
what it's done -- through the Big East and the ACC, we've been very consistent
because we've never been too young. We've had guys growing up, we've had -- I
call it the junior year light bulb go on, Zach Auguste, V.J. Beachem, guys
that are with us for two years, Matt Farrell, you throw them in there, and
then as juniors they're really ready to deliver for you.  
  
I tell young catches when you get the job, get old and stay old. Can you get a
rhythm to your roster whether you're redshirting, taking transfers, which
we've done, to stay older really helps.  
  
Q. Mike you've got a long history from West Virginia from years gone
guy. Just some of your memory, good, bad. You've had a lot of success in those
runs.  
MIKE BREY: We've had great games with West Virginia. This is bringing back a
lot of Big East memories all afternoon and last night. I'm thinking about our
game certainly against John Beilein, and since Bob has been there. I guess my
memory is, how hard the Mountaineer crowd is on us down there. It is one of
the most brutal -- I have heard some of the most unbelievable stuff. What I'll
do is turn to my assistant and say God, that was a good one. He really ripped
me on that one. No.  
  
It's been unbelievable down there. Great games, great battles. The last game I
remember, we had that two seed with Ben Hansbrough, we go down there and West
Virginia beat us. Jerry West's son is a walk-on. He throws him in the game, he
bangs down a three across from our bench, and I said we ain't winning today.
Jerry hits a three, let's go home, get ready for the next one. Just great
match-ups, Pittsnogle, ball screen, stepping back and shooting the three,
Butler, you know, through the years. We played a lot of great games, a lot of
great memories.  
  
Q. That was obviously interesting the other day when you compared Matt
with Bobby Hurley. I was kind of wondering what have you seen with southwest
Virginia's Jevon Carter and how do you see the match-up with him and Matt
tomorrow.  
MIKE BREY: Matt Farrell is not better than Jerry West. Okay? I just want to be
clear on that. I think it's a gray match-up and they played on an All Star
team this summer, th East Coast All Stars. They know each other. They were in
Italy. They are buddies and went after each other in practice. It's a big
matchup.  
  
Carter is a heck of a guard and he's a winner. Big shot taker, heck of a
defender. That's a great match-up and the point.  
  
Q. It seems like the players are so phenomenal in shooting threes these
days, how has that evolved since you started coaching?  
MIKE BREY: It's an amazing weapon now and almost all of us really use it. You
know, I guess a great example is you have a three on two fast break. God, we
were drilled as young players, you got to get a lay -up. Now guys spot up and
fire and there's not even a second thought. I don't ever see a coach yell
that's a bad shot if it's the right guy shooting it.  
  
It's an amazing weapon. It's one that we use offensively, and it's one that we
worry about defensively. Certainly yesterday was an example of that. How can
we limit guys, you know, of making threes again? Our three-point line defense
is something we talk about and it's been probably our best this year. That's
why it's helped us.  
  
Q. Another unrelated question. You have a very solid fan in the governor
of New Jersey, where does that go back from?  
MIKE BREY: Delaware. He's a Delaware grad. Chris Christie is a Delaware grad.
When he got the job he was just an attorney. Big hoops guy and was real
supportive of my program. Now his daughter is at N.D. and is a manager for us.
We were great friends when I was in Newark, Delaware, and he was a hoops fan
lawyer from New Jersey. He knows more about my team than some of my staff. The
guy's unbelievably plugged into our stuff, so love having him around.  
  
Q. Steve and V.J. both gave you a lot of credit for saying they are both
kind of soft-spoken kids in their freshman and sophomore year, saying you were
really instrumental helping them open up. I wonder if you can talk about what
you saw from them from that standpoint when they were young and how they kind
of matured?  
MIKE BREY: They were really quiet guys and we had good vocal old guys when
they were young and I think what's helped them, too, is seeing some of the
older guys that have come before them. They saw Jerian Grant and Pat
Connaughton lead one heck of a team two years ago. That's the best example
ever. Nothing I can tell them is going to get them more ready to lead than
seeing that.  
  
Then they saw Demetrius Jackson and Zach Auguste do a job that maybe I didn't
expect they could do, being vocal and verbal. So they had come out of their
shell. You add Bonzie and Matt Farrell to that, and it's been a nice chemistry
of voices leading our team.  
  
Q. We've made a lot all season long about the idea of a quick
turnaround, getting prepared for the Mountaineers, and that pressure defense.
What has it been like for you guys from the scout with your assistants, to now
this 48 hours leading up to tip-off to face a bit of an unorthodox style?  
MIKE BREY: I think we tried to compare them to Florida State which we played
three times, playing, 11, 12 guys, getting up and getting into you. The game
in Tallahassee we lost. We turned it over 18 times. We did not take care of
the basketball. The other two times we did. We tried to make a comparison and
get back to that kind of prep. I don't want to over-coach it. We have press
offense that you work on back in October. You don't want to overanalyze it too
much. We need guys to be receivers. I think we can prepare in a day.  
  
I've got really pretty sharp guys and high basketball I.Q. guy, so I think our
thing is, you know, when we get through it, are we looking to attack? Are we
looking to run offense, and then we have to change defenses on them. We can't
play man-to-man the whole game. We got to make them play against something
different to kind of maybe change their rhythm, since they change your rhythm
with full-court pressure.  
  
Q. Speaking of rhythm. They say they want to speed up opposing teams. Is
that a mental thing, physical thing, how do you keep your guys from getting
caught up in it?  
MIKE BREY: We're not the fastest. If you look at our pace, we have been kind
of a situational running team. I think what we do is we've gotten to do a good
job when we don't have numbers in transition, we kind of back that thing out
and make you guard us for a while. And we're going to have to be disciplined
with that. Now that's easier said than done because they're really good in the
half court. They face guarding you, they just run and trap you there. So,
finding the rhythm in this game, I think, is going to gee a feeling-out
process us tomorrow in the first half.  
  
Q. Are you going to sleep easier tonight because you got Matt? Because
if you got an inexperienced point guard they'll chew that guy into much?  
MIKE BREY: There's no question. Matt, Steve Vasturia, Gibbs, Rex Pflueger, our
big guys. Bonzie can bring the ball up a little bit. We don't turn the ball
over much. It's a team that doesn't turn the ball over. I think we're first or
second or third in the nation against a team that turns people over. So
something's got to give. We're going to kick it around a little more than
usual, but we have to be great tomorrow overall to win.  
  
Q. Mike, this is almost a follow-up on Matt. I think you may have raised
at least some eyebrows here in comparing Matt to Bobby yesterday --  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. \-- or two days ago, I'm sorry. What gives you that confidence that
he is that type of a player and what do you make of the adjustment that he's
made in going from where he was a year ago to where he is now?  
MIKE BREY: You know, my comparison is skill set, not honor, skill set, period.
And I think his ability to play fearlessly and make plays off the ball screen,
which he's had to do all year, and then his ability, to score and make shots,
makes him unbelievably valuable to us. He shoots it and he shoots it deep. He
can make the runner in the lane. He can get to the hole with his speed and get
fouled. He's pretty much automatic from the foul line.  
  
So that why I made the comparison, but also that's why we got a chance to get
to the second weekend. We lose Grant and Jackson, two guards to the NBA, the
big question mark was who's going to handle the ball for us. And for him to do
what he's done, I mean it's just a great story. Really a neat story and glad
he's coming back for another year, I think.  
  
Q. Obviously, last night, being a high point of the season for you guys,
can you look back and think, you know, the lowest point of the season for you
and your team and what you guys did to kind of fight through that?  
MIKE BREY: We lost five out of six in the ACC and the fifth was at North
Carolina. Remember that game that was postponed because the water in Chapel
Hill was so -- everything was screwed up. We played great. We made a comeback,
lost to Carolina there. That was five out of six, and we were six and five in
the league, coming home to play Wake Forest. We kind of had to make our stand
against Wake, and we did. We played very nervous in the first half because we
knew how much was on the line to get going again, then we beat Florida State
on that Saturday, and we've been on a pretty good run ever since. Again, when
you have maturity and older guys and their demeanor is kind of like that, you
can handle five out of six without panic.

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Donte DiVincenzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32854)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Mount St. Mary's - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright and student-athletes,
Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo. Gentlemen, congrats on advancing to the
winner of the Wisconsin game. Same format. We'll have Coach open with a
statement.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: I just want to compliment Jamion and his team. They were just
great. They really outplayed us. We just, at the end, had more size and some
more talented players that just made plays. But they were better prepared,
Jamion had them better prepared than I did, and they played better. We just
had bigger, better athletes, but they were a great team. I thought they were
the better team tonight. And they deserve a lot of credit, a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Donte, is @DonteDiVincenzo your actual Twitter account?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Yes, it is. But I don't have Twitter anymore.  
  
Q. But you only have, like, 4500 followers?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Yes, it is. I don't have it anymore.  
  
Q. I know a couple months ago, Coach Wright dared to compare you with
your star player, and a lot of people are like, oh, really? But you had a bit
of a break-out performance tonight. How is it happening for you especially,
first half, when there was some turbulence?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: My job off the bench is just to bring energy, focus on
defending and rebounding. The offense came tonight after just pushing it on
offense, after getting a rebound. So if I just focus on that, all of the
offense will come.  
  
Q. Can you maybe talk -- describe how rebounding is a part of your game
because you come into the game averaging only three and a half, but you have
eight by halftime. And how significant do you think that was to getting the
team kick-started?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I mean, we didn't come out the first half with energy off
the start, and, I mean, we have some great rebounders on our team. All of us
can rebound the ball. I mean, throughout the year, you see us, some guys have
eight, nine, rebounds a game. But tonight, I just -- my guy was going back, I
was free to go to the rim and chase down the ball, and I just had a knack for
the ball tonight.  
  
Q. For Jalen, could you put your finger on why you guys got off to such
a slow start and were there any nerves involved?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I just -- Mount St. Mary's is a great team. We were watching
them. We knew going into the game that they have the ability to play the way
they did. I mean, they came out shooting the ball, sharing the ball and just
playing with great energy. And, I mean, you got to give them credit. We just
got to come out and play harder. Just got to give them credit about that.  
  
Q. Jalen, also, for you, you guys live a lot on the three-point line,
and when you come out slow like you did in that first half, particularly Kris,
not to single him out, but he got some really good looks. What's your mindset
in terms of how are we going to make up for what we're not doing?  
JALEN BRUNSON: We've got to make up on the defensive end. We got to make sure
we're defending and rebounding. I think when Donte came in off the bench he
did a great job sparking us with some energy and defensive rebounds. It felt
like he was getting every rebound out there and gave us a little bit of
energy. When we're not making shots, we can't really focus on that. We have to
focus on defending and rebounding on our possession. There are going to nights
like tonight where we don't make shots, like in the first half, so we've just
got to focus on defense.  
  
Q. Last time this year you were hurt. What were your emotions like
coming into this game to participate and play this year?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I mean, it's a big stage, my first time being in an NCAA
Tournament. But my mindset was just our next game. It was our biggest game
because it was our next game. My energy went towards my teammates. I wasn't
focused on anything on the outside, and I think it showed tonight.  
  
Q. What did you absorb last year from watching on the bench.  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: The leadership from Ryan and Daniel. When things got rough,
they got us together and they really calmed us down. Grinnell wasn't playing,
but you could can see we were just all together out there, all five guys on
the court.  
  
Q. Jalen, it seemed like tonight you made a concerted effort to take
your guy inside and get shots closer to the basket. Was that something you
were trying to do?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I think like Coach said, we had a little bit of height
advantage and athleticism. I was just trying to make the right play at the
right time. When I got in the lane, I just felt like I could shore up my
defenders and when I got that close, I just ended up shooting it.  
  
Q. Last question, I guess, Donte, has to be asked, the two missed dunks.
What happened there?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I don't know. The first one I took off too far, I guess. The
second one, I don't know what happened. I just didn't get a lot of lift. I
tried to get it back off the steal.  
  
Q. Was that one of those situations, the second one you were thinking I
the got to make up for the last one.  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I wasn't really worried about that. It's something that goes
through your head after that second missed dunk.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tried to get you out of here, Donte before that one.  
  
Q. Hey, Jay, a follow-up to that question about the two dunks. Obviously
Donte had a great game. Is that one of the things you let him know about or,
after missing the dunks you kind of let it slide?  
JAY WRIGHT: I have no problem with that at all, none. Like you said, he made
two great defensive plays to get out there and he just took off. He's one of
our best dunkers. He took off too far on the first one and probably on the
second one, he should have gone off one foot. I think he heard the crowd as he
was going. They were kind of laughing and I think he slowed up and said I'll
go off two feet, which he did didn't have to do. It's one of those things a
freshman does. I won't say a word about that. I'm so proud about how he
rebounded and how he defended.  
  
Q. I noticed during one of the time-outs in the first half you got a
little animated with one of the refs. Do you care to share that
conversation?  
JAY WRIGHT: I do remember getting animated. I get animated on a lot of things.
I couldn't remember which one that was. You get frustrated when your team is
not playing the way you like them to and the other team is actually playing
better. Sometimes at that time you think it's a call. You always go back and
watch the film and find out it wasn't the call, it was your team. But, you
know, you'd think I'd be better at that after all these years but no.  
  
Q. Jay, your team prides itself on energy and playing as a team, and
that really wasn't present in the first half. What do you think was missing?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, Dana, I honestly don't know. I really thought after
-- this is our 35th game. I didn't think we were capable of that. I thought we
were capable of coming out and, you know, missing some shots, coming out and
making some mistakes. But the level of energy we started the game with, I just
didn't think we were capable of that. I'm in a little bit of shock myself.  
  
I do have to say, when you play a really quick team like Mount St. Mary's,
that's coming off the game, too, like, they came in the game with great
energy, great confidence. I think that's a credit to Jamion and his staff,
that they were right from the start. And we tried to have our guys ready.
That's on me, too. We didn't. I honestly don't have an answer. If I came up
with something, I would be BS'ing you.  
  
Q. I appreciate you didn't. Could it be the pressure? You don't know how
they'll handle pressure of a repeat until they walk into it. Could that be a
factor?  
JAY WRIGHT: It could be. You guys asked me a number of times, you dealt with
all season having to repeat as Big East Champions, and all this, how does that
affect you? I know now that it's over, how is this going to affect you? I
don't know. We'll see. Maybe that was a part of it. It surprises me if it was.
I know they were fired up to play. I do think some of it was Mount St. Mary's.
I really do. I think those three guards are smaller and quicker than any
guards we played against. It gave us trouble. We had a hard time early. We
adjusted to their speed and quickness. I think that was part of it.  
  
Q. You mentioned you felt Mount St. Mary's outplayed you. You said you
had to do a better job and everything. You seemed pretty animated at the end
of the game talking to Jenkins and Brunson on the bench a minute. What are you
saying and how kind of annoyed are you by what happened here tonight?  
JAY WRIGHT: I'm not annoyed. As I said to Dana, I really am shocked. I really
am. Again, not how well Mount St. Mary's played, just that we didn't start the
game with energy. We always do; you know? And I really don't have time to
figure it out. We've got to get on to the winner of this game, and that's the
beauty of this tournament. The beauty of the tournament is, if this was the
season, I'd say all right, we got to address this right now. I got to say we
got to forget about it and we got to get ready for the winner of this game.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up on that, 48 hours from now, you're going to be
playing again. If you play like you did in the first half tonight, can you
survive that?  
JAY WRIGHT: No. No. And I think they know that, you know? But that's still not
an excuse for not coming to play. But again it's on all of us. It's on our
leadership. It's on me. That's just part of it, man. We're lucky to advance.
We're lucky, and I think we'll put it behind us and I think we'll get ready.
We'll get ready for the winner of this game.  
  
Q. Jay, just before the game, I saw you were talking to your alma mater
in the locker room of picture service. Can you tell us what you said to your
alma mater?  
JAY WRIGHT: I just told them all of us are really proud of them. I have a
bunch of Bucknell guys I play basketball with, and we have a text thread that
we all stay on and follow the games. We always follow them. I thought they had
a great season and I thought they played great against West Virginia. West
Virginia is good, man. They're good and so is Bucknell.  
  
Q. Jay, Josh Hart didn't have his biggest statistical game. He really
did settle things down for you when you put him back in in at the end of the
first half and then the second half. Was he a settling presence?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. Even at the end of the first half, we never had a
lead. He had a big play. We put him in at the end of the first half with two
fouls which was a shaky decision. Because when you play a smaller team like
that, when a bigger body hits them, they go flying, and it looks like a
charge. We were afraid on that drive he could pick up his third foul and it
worked out for us. But he, in the second half was fresh, played really well,
played defensively well. We posted him up some. He's a huge part of what we
do. Him getting two quick fouls made the difference in the first half, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you, guys.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 86, Bucknell - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by West Virginia University head coach, Bob Huggins, as
well as student-athletes, Nathan Adrian, Esa Ahmad, and Tarik Phillip. Game
time Saturday, time to be announced, Coach decided to forego opening
statements. We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nathan, how far have you come as a rebounder this season?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I've come a long way. We lost a lot of rebounding with John and
Devin last year, so I knew someone had to step up and go get those, and I feel
I've done a decent job at it.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: I agree.  
  
ESA AHMAD: Me, too.  
  
Q. Nate, obviously last year at this time it didn't go so well for you
in this game. How much was it on your mind personally, not as a team?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Personally, it was on my mind a little bit through our
practice. We didn't have great practices last year, but this year I thought we
prepared a little better. We've got to play a little better defense, but we'll
fix it.  
  
Q. Esa, obviously you've had back issues in the last month or so. You
looked like you were pretty good today. Did you feel healthy? Was there a
bounce there? Did you say I have to take responsibility on my shoulders?  
ESA AHMAD: My back felt great out there, got a couple rebounds, and I just
tried to cut. My teammates found me and got the win, so --  
  
Q. For both Tarik and Esa, obviously the foul shooting difficulties you
had at times especially at Kansas is well-known. Tonight, two of you
especially went to line at clutch moments and hit shots. Does any of the past
come back to you in those moments? Do you think about it at all?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Coach has been telling us for the longest while that turnovers
and free throws are going to be the death of us, so if we limit turnovers and
make free throws, you got a great chance of winning.  
  
Q. Nate or anybody else. Nate, you mentioned your defense needs to get
better. What were you guys maybe able to do to stem Bucknell's tide, and what
do you want to do better Saturday?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think switching on one-three-one today helped us a lot, kind
of slowing down their drive a little bit. That's an effort thing. Between now
and Saturday, we have to get our heads right and play defense like we know how
to.  
  
Q. Nate, can you just describe the play when were you on -- you scrapped
for a loose ball, you were on your back, nice feed for a dunk there. It all
happened so fast. I don't even know how you saw that.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Me either. Just kind of what we do. We see a ball on the
ground, we get on the ground, we got to go get it. We have to get every 50/50
ball for us to win. I just grabbed it, try to get my head up, and look for the
first open guy.  
  
Q. Nate, could you talk about, and Tarik, too, maybe, what did Bucknell
do that proved bothersome to you guys the most? I mean, what they were doing
tonight?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: They got their ball to their big man often, and he was very
efficient, so I thought he played extremely well. Him and a few others played
extremely well. They were tough to guard, so -- Kimbal had five threes, I
heard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations guys. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Okay. We'll open it up for questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Now, how much pressure is on Nathan as a Morgantown native for this
setting of the NCAA Tournament?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't think very much. He had a cyst in his wrist, his shooting
wrist, his right wrist, his sophomore year and didn't shoot the ball very
well, which nobody would have, and didn't tell anybody about it until the
conference tournament. And I think he -- you know, people expected, you know,
more, or making shots, and they had no idea he was hurt. I had no idea he was
hurt. And he's banged up now, but he just -- you know, he fights through
things. He's a great competitor and a great person.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, could you talk about the play he made on the
base diving and making the pass on his back, and then also his disruptiveness
at the head of the press and half-court as well?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we weren't very good today in pressure. He and J.C. were
pretty good. The rest of our guys kind of called it off way too early. Nate
makes plays like that every day, so when he makes a play like that that other
people maybe think is a great play, we see him do it every day. So I don't
think anybody thought it was anything out of the ordinary.  
  
Q. First, Bob, just a couple questions. First, what did you think was
most troublesome that Bucknell was doing and, second, could you comment on
Tarik and what he did today?  
BOB HUGGINS: What Bucknell did was make shots. They don't always, you know,
nobody does, always make shots that well. McKenzie's 5 for 7 from three and
Steven Brown hit some big threes. Seemed like every time we started to get
away from them a little bit, they made a three. And like the guys said,
Foulland is really a good player. He's a really good player in any league.
He's athletic, and not just at the offensive end, he changed so many shots. He
really disrupted us, I think, offensively, with the shot-blocking ability.  
  
Q. How about Tarik, Coach?  
BOB HUGGINS: That's what Tarik does. You know, Tarik went from being a poor
free-throw shooter, and he's really put a lot of time in. I think he had a
streak of maybe 28, 29 in a row, and then he missed a couple and then he's
back on another streak. But Tarik puts an enormous amount of time in. And he's
actually listened better. He's actually listened when we talk to him about how
he could improve his shot.  
  
Q. Bob, obviously offensive rebounds are always a big part of your game
but tonight, did you know you sort of had to dominate in that area?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I thought we had a chance to, because, you know, Esa's
getting back to being Esa. And when you got a 6'7", 6'8" guy playing against
6'2", 6'3" guys, you ought to have an advantage. And I thought he was good,
Nate's always good. Elijah has just gotten better and better. We have to get
our guards to do a better job. But I thought those three guys were pretty
good. We miss enough shots, you know, there's enough to go around.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Congratulations, see you tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 60, Princeton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Princeton University head coach, Mitch Henderson,
Devin Cannady, Steven Cook, and Spencer Weisz. We'll open with a statement and
open up to questions for student-athletes.  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: First, congratulations to Notre Dame. We had a shot. We
weren't that sharp tonight. Really, for us, it was such an enjoyable team to
coach, and I have to thank our seniors in particular, Steve and Spencer, for
their leadership. We lost two guys early in the season. Right now, this one
hurts. When you're in the locker room afterwards, it feels -- it's really hard
to say the proper thank you, because it feels like good-bye.  
  
But we're here because of these guys, and they made us a championship team
again, and we're thankful for that, and that they represented both Princeton
basketball and Princeton University in a first-class way, and I'm proud of
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, we'll take question just for Devin, Steven
and Spencer. Raise your and and we'll come across the aisle.  
  
Q. Devin on that last shot, did it feel good coming out of your hand,
and did you think it had a chance to go in?  
DEVIN CANNADY: I thought the shot was going in.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the plays you made down the stretch and with an
11-point lead. About 8 minutes to go, what was your mind set being able to get
back in the game.  
STEVEN COOK: You know, in a situation like that, you're trying to do
everything you can and claw back. I thought we really weren't sharp for the
majority of the game. We've been playing a lot better for the majority of the
year, and at the end, we started to get back to our old ways and get some
stops and make some shots, but, you know, sometimes you fall short.  
  
Q. Spencer, for you guys to shoot 8 for 31 from three and still be in
this game with a chance to win in this game. What did you have to do well to
sort of stay close?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Just bring toughness. I think it showed in the first half. They
definitely out-toughed us on everything, offensive rebounds, just getting
loose balls. Then the second half, we kind of adjusted and we asked ourselves,
what do we want to make of this game? We came out, clawed back, and it all
started, you know, on the defensive end for us. We didn't hit as many shots as
we would have liked, but we gave ourselves a shot at the end.  
  
Q. For Steve and Spencer, just perspective on the run here, this year in
the final season.  
STEVEN COOK: What was the question?  
  
Q. Ending your career with a run like in this season.  
STEVEN COOK: You know, I think this year has been amazing for us. You know,
accomplishing 16-0 in the Ivy League. You know, sort of getting the program
back to the NCAA Tournament, back to winning ways, and accomplishing
everything we set out to do. It's been an amazing season, and I've done it
with people I consider my family. And, you know, it's emotional for it to come
to an end, but I'm going to cherish everything I put into it, everything that
came up, because I put everything into this program, and into these four
years.  
  
SPENCER WEISZ: I'm just so proud of the team we became. Early on, we had rough
matches certainly, guys went down. People stepped up, goals changed,
nonetheless, we were committed to our goals and it showed. We had a great run.
We hadn't lost in a while. I'm sure people might -- it hurts for us right now,
certainly, and, you know, you want to go out with a win and a deep tournament
run, but nonetheless, we gave it our all, proud of the guys. It's been an
unbelievable year. It's been an unbelievable four years, and we couldn't have
asked for anything more.  
  
Q. Devin, you told us you thought the shot was going in. Can you take us
through the play, getting the ball, what your thoughts were?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yes. They missed the free throw. He came down the floor, I kind
of sent him a brush screen and both of the guys went with him. I got my feet
set, ball came in my shot pocket. I looked at the rim, and when the ball left
my hand, I thought it was good. It didn't go in and that's what happens when
you take those shots. It either does or doesn't. In this case it didn't and
the rest is --  
  
Q. For any of you three guy, last few years, the Ivy has really
increased its successes playing against three, fours and fives in the NCAA
tournament. How much of the gap now do you guys think you cut into to?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I think it shows. Every year, when the brackets come out, I'm
sure people are always looking at the Ivy League, who's representing and what
match-up they have, because at the end of the day, we feel we feel we can
compete with anyone. It's a testament to our league, testament to the players.
I'm looking forward to the growth of the league, and, hopefully, its
recognition. I think the Ivy League tournament certainly helps get us on a
national stage right before Selection show. There's a bright future, I think,
ahead for the Ivy League in general.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Devin, Steven, Spencer, thank you for your time. Congrats on a
great season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take follow-up questions for Coach Henderson at this
time. Right down here, front left here.  
  
A. Coach, the final shot by Devin at the end, what did you see from your
perspective and what did you see out of Notre Dame and the ability to defend
three-point shots?  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: I thought that shot's gone in an awful lot for us, Devin's
shot. It was a great look for us. I think we tried to get to the rim, but I
thought Notre Dame, they're smart, they're tough. They don't really put
anybody on the floor that doesn't have a ton of experience. And I thought that
was the story of the game, was they had a lot more experience in this moment,
and it showed. And we got -- this team has been punched in the face a little
bit throughout the course of the season, but they always respond. I've been on
teams where that doesn't happen. They did a great job but I was pleased with
the chances that we had.  
  
Q. Seems like your defense sparked late. Talk about the late run and
impact of the defense?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. Finally, right, Bill? We got going defensively and a
team that doesn't turn the ball over, they still only had six turnovers. They
do a really good job. You watch them on tape and it's a patient slow team. In
the game, it's even slower. It forces you to get out of your comfort zone, and
it really challenges all of the principles that you have defensively.  
  
I thought we settled in. We didn't play a great game offensively, but I
thought we really gave ourselves a chance to win the game on the defensive end
during that run.  
  
Q. Where do you see the Ivies now in the national landscape? The league
itself has really grown up and really re-established itself the last five or
six years, winning games, being competitive against good teams. Do you only
see that improving?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yes, yes. You know, there's Ivy League people here in the
room, and if you ask all of the coaches in the league, the answer to that
question is, you know, this comes as no surprise to all of us. Recruiting --
it starts with recruiting, and the message that these kids are hearing and
understanding is, why wouldn't I go to a high-level institution and further
myself in all parts of my life and take that opportunity and then play on the
national stage, too.  
  
Because that's what these guys are doing. And we sell that. It's not for
everybody. But we sell it, and then they get here and I think they commit to
playing team basketball. All of the teams in the league, the coaching, it's
team. What you see now is a product of three, four months of having to run
through the league. It's not the least bit surprising to me that we're here
and the talent level in the league is very high, an the coaching is very high.
So, we had a really good shot today. I felt good about it.  
  
Q. Going back to their perimeter defense, they were 5 for 17 in the
first half from three. That's maybe more, a lot of threes. Did you think --
what do you think you needed to do? Did you need to go to the rim a little
more, did you --  
MITCH HENDERSON: I thought we were a little impatient. But the looks we got
were good. 10 of those 17 were wide open, and just didn't go in. It went in on
Wednesday, and they went in this morning, and they didn't go in during the
game.  
  
And then people have had the same plan against us for a while. Like I said, we
haven't lost in a long time. This game looks very similar to some of the games
we've had recently and we've been able to get through it. I thought Colson
really changed things for us. Two fouls towards the end of the game hurt us,
they really hurt.  
  
Q. Mitch, considering some of that you just said about the shots not
going in and being open, do you sense this was a little bit of a missed
opportunity today?  
MITCH HENDERSON: You know, that may be, but that sort of smacks of being
bitter, and I want to give recognition to this group. We're here because of
them, and I'm so proud of the way that they responded and gave ourselves
chances to win. That's all you can ask for. So, no, we'll talk -- this will
hurt, but then we're going to get together and celebrate what the season was.  
  
Q. In the first half, Notre Dame shot five threes, in the second half,
they shot 11. Was there an effort to make them shoot more three-pointers?
Because their percentage did drop. Is that part of your defensive scheme?  
MITCH HENDERSON: We were hopeful. It's a little bit like looking in the
mirror. They made a lot of threes and shot them well. Our objective was try to
get them to put it on the floor. I thought we were double-teaming Colson, and
they kicked it to Farrell and he made two threes. And we've had a lot of
success with our double-teams and that hurt. We made an adjustment, and it got
us a little less aggressive. Those are key. Those still have to go in, and
they went in, and that changed the course of the game, I think.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about your seniors, but could you just
go a little bit more into detail about what it's been like to see them grow
through this process at Princeton?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. They looked just like my freshman did four years ago.
What you see now is a responsibility, and, you know, the one thing that's wild
is once they figure it out and they are exactly where you want them, they
graduate.  
  
I'm going to miss them all so much, and in particular, these two guys. Spencer
has allowed us to play a certain way, and we're very difficult to guard. And
then Steve, we were just in the locker room, and some of his teammates were
saying some incredible things about him. He truly makes you want to be a
better person when you're around him. He's academic All American, our first
since 1998, and he certainly deserves every bit of that recognition.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a terrific season.  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: Thanks, guys.

### [Nigel Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26720)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 84, Virginia Tech - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Wisconsin head coach, Greg Gard, and student-athletes
Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig. Congratulations, guys, on a victory that
advances you on to play Villanova Saturday night. We're waiting on game times.
Hope to have them to you before we're done this evening. We'll open with Coach
Gard making an opening statement.  
  
GREG GARD: Thank you. Obviously extremely happy for our guys, really proud of
how they battled. Virginia Tech's -- Buzz has got a heck of a team. Knew that
obviously, and not surprised watching them on film and preparing for them. We
knew, obviously when you get to this time of the year, they're all good. And
we were able to do just enough and make enough shots, get to the foul line
enough, specifically in the second half, to be able to hold them off and get
enough stops there at the end to seal it up.  
  
Like I said, I'm happy for these two guys to my right and the other 15 guys in
the locker room. A heck of a team effort.  
  
Q. Several times they cut it to one in the second half, and you would
come right back and hit a three. I was just wondering, were you looking for
your shot in those moments or did it just sort of work out that way?  
BRONSON KOENIG: You can definitely say I was looking for my shot. It's
something I take pride in, being a senior point guard, is making plays in
critical moments. And I knew when they kept cutting it to one that I was going
to have to make some type of play, so I was just trying to be as aggressive as
possible.  
  
Q. Bronson, were you just feeling it today? Were there certain things
you were able to take advantage of with their defense? How do you explain this
is the game where you broke a school record with eight three-pointers?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I was feeling it a little bit. I don't think I shot all that
well, to be honest, looking at my numbers. But I knew the way they were going
to play defense with the switching and everything like that, and going back to
zone, and back and forth, that I was going to be able to get some open looks
if I just kept moving them. My teammates did a good job of both screening and
passing me the ball. Like I said before, searching for it and just trying to
stay on the attack.  
  
Q. Bronson, how big of a lift was it to stay within -- stay up by a
point the entire time?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I mean, we just try to battle every single possession, and
their guards are really good, especially off that ball screen. So we were
trying to do the best we could to keep them in front and, I mean, that's
something we'll look back on and need to improve moving forward. But, yeah,
being up one and our guys hitting their free throws was huge for us and just
making big plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Nigel, how much do you feel like your just general tournament
experience that -- you guys have been here all four years with Virginia Tech.
How do you feel that paid off for you down the stretch.  
NIGEL HAYES: I think it definitely helped a lot for us to have the older guys
that we have and have been through some of the runs we've had in the
tournament. I think it showed with Bronson the way he responded to each time
they went on a run. Each time they hit a bit shot, he responded with a big
shot and that's something that you need. Although this another game, it's in
tournament, so the emotion is higher, energy is higher, guys are playing more
up tight. And I think when you have that experience, you're able to relax a
little more and you can go out and break school records.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. For the guy, your defense, what do you think worked for you and what
was your game plan that worked for you?  
NIGEL HAYES: Our defense, it wasn't good at all today. I'm sure he'll be up
all night with clenched fists watching film at how poor we were. We didn't do
well guarding their ball screens at all. We gave up a lot of paint touches, a
lot of and-ones and finishes. We fouled three-point shooters two or three
times, which is definitely a cardinal sin in any program. We didn't do well
with dribble penetration, which again was one of the key things we wanted to
take care of. We know they can drive and kick extremely well, so we were
fortunate that -- you know, we needed a score record-breaking performance in
order to beat them. They're a really good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any other questions, Bronson, Nigel,
congratulations. We'll see you here tomorrow. Further questions for Coach
Gard.  
  
Q. To go on the 10-1, I think it was run, in the last two minutes there,
is that more you guys and your experience in those type of games, or was it
rigid attack fading a little bit you see from their offense?  
GREG GARD: I thought we got the ball in some pretty high percentage areas. We
wanted to make sure, we tried to touch the post when we could. We shot quite a
few free throws down the stretch, too, so it's part of it. I don't know. I've
only coached one team, so I can't judge in terms of what they are going
through. I thought we had guys make key plays at key times, and that's what
you have to have at this time of year if you want to continue to advance.
Different people have to step up at different times. We're able to get enough
stops at the end to be able to come back and answer and get a little
separation.  
  
Q. You've obviously seen Bronson a lot. Where did tonight rank from what
you've seen?  
GREG GARD: Well, I can probably remember his two turnovers or whatever he had.
Oh, he had one. Okay? You know, he's -- I've known him since he was a freshman
in high school, recruited him for three years before he committed to us. So
I've seen him do a lot of things. Watched him win two state championships. I
watched him four years here with us. He's a heck of a player.  
  
He did a very good job without the ball tonight. He played more without the
ball than he did with the ball for the most part because of what we wanted to
run against what they were doing defensively. So, he found spots. As he
mentioned teammates did a good job of screening and finding him, and I don't
know if it's his best shooting performance. Obviously it sets a record, but he
had 17 attempts to do it, too. But he's a good player. There's no doubt about
that. He's the school's all-time leader in three-point shooting. It's pretty
obvious. He's been fun to coach.  
  
Q. Greg, what do you make of what, you know, Bronson said in taking
ownership as being a senior point guard and saying, you know, I needed to
respond when the time came especially when they were, you know, inching within
-- to respond to three-point basketball scoring?  
GREG GARD: He's done that throughout the year. He's hit big shots for us. He
hit a big shot -- everybody remembers the shot against Xavier last year that
he hit to send us to the Sweet 16. He has a tendency to obviously have the
ball in his hands, so the opportunities go up. That's usually where you put
your -- at the end of the game, you want the ball in your point guard's hands,
whether it's him shooting or making plays for others. And he was
opportunistic, and he hit obviously timely shots when we needed it. Like I
said, teammates found him, too. It wasn't always him making a play with the
ball. It was some inside out, touching the post, throwing it back out and him
relocating and finding open spots. So he gets the credit for knocking down
shots, but other guys had hands in helping that happen.  
  
Q. And just as a follow-up, I know the point guard, the mentality, to
have that confidence and to be able to deliver it, what does it say about
somebody like him?  
GREG GARD: Well, he's gone through games where he's gone one for eight or one
for nine, too. So the biggest thing about shooters, they have to have a short
memory when things aren't going well. We've gone through -- I think he went
one for ten when we were at Madison Square Garden against Rutgers this year.
He came over to the bench and said what's wrong. I said keep shooting. You've
got to keep shooting when you're a shooter of his level. Because eventually
you going to get one to go and it start to snowball. You can't lose confidence
when you're a player like that.  
  
Q. Nigel mentioned the cardinal sin of fouling somebody while taking a
three-point shot. Justin Bibbs had eight points on two four-point plays. I
don't know how rare that is?  
GREG GARD: In two out-of-bounds plays we went over specifically in practice
for two days.  
  
Q. Where is that on the aggravation scale?  
GREG GARD: Well, here's the thing. They shoot the three so well, and maybe we
made too big of a deal as a staff about taking away their threes, that we had
them hyper-alert to them shooting threes specifically off out-of-bounds plays
or anywhere. I'll look through the tape to see why we gave up so much dribble
penetration. Some of it we weren't as compressed and compact defensively as we
normally are, knowing that they had so many shooters on the floor. We were a
little more spread. They do that to you, too. They did it throughout the year
to teams in the league as I went through films.  
  
So the first one Bronson runs right into Bibbs, and the second one Iverson
runs right into him. They need to take a better route, but also we need to do
a better job taking away the action to that. And the scout team running is one
thing, when you go against a team that's done it all year, and has the timing
down of that. Late we made an adjustment and jumped it from the guy taking the
ball out of bounds to take it away. But we have to be smarter in terms of not
-- you don't foul three-point shooters whether it's an out-of-bounds play or
not.  
  
So, we'll look at the tape, I'm sure, and see if Villanova runs any of those
same type of plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any more questions, Coach, congratulate you again,
see you back here again tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 86, Bucknell - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Joined now by Bucknell head coach, Nathan Davis, as well
as Stephen Brown, Kimbal Mackenzie, and Zach Thomas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to have an opening statement from Coach Davis
before we take questions for our student-athletes only. Coach?  
  
NATHAN DAVIS: First off, let me congratulate Coach Huggins and his team. They
had an outstanding season. They have an outstanding team. We knew it was going
to be very difficult to win the game. We felt like if we played well, we'd
have a chance and we certainly did. I thought our guys showed tremendous
character falling behind, 27-15 or maybe 27-12. To find a way to not get down
on each other, to fight back, to get it to a three-point game there in the
second half. They showed the heart of a champion. Unfortunately I don't get to
coach this same group again, but I'm looking forward to getting back at it
with the guys coming back next year.  
  
It's going to hurt for a little while, as it should, because we're competitive
guys, these are competitive guys. But we'll move on and hopefully we'll get
better from this.  
  
Q. For any of you the players, you can all answer this. Offensive
rebounding for West Virginia, they're getting three-point shots, but got it
back on offensive rebound again. Did you know that was going to be an issue
coming in and how difficult was it coming into the game?  
STEPHEN BROWN: We knew coming in that offensive rebounding was part of their
game plan. Our goal was limit them to one shot only, to get the rebound, and
get out from beating the press, but down the stretch, you saw that they got a
lot of second-chance opportunities after their misses, and then that kind of
hurt us. Going in we knew that that was going to be part of the game plan,
too.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, I saw Jay Wright just came into the locker room.
If you wouldn't mind sharing what he had to say and what that means coming in
and talking to you guys.  
KIMBAL MACKENZIE: He just told us to keep our heads up. Part of being a
warrior is losing sometimes and we've got to learn how to lose just as we
learn how to win. We're very fortunate to have him in the locker room, giving
us a couple words. He told us to keep our heads up and keep fighting.  
  
Q. When you have the coach who is the defending National Champ, what
does that mean for him to say those things to you guys?  
ZACH THOMAS: It's an honor. He definitely sees we're a talented ball club.
It's his alma mater. He's proud of us. It means a lot.  
  
Q. Just, you know, you practiced against it, you watched tape of it, you
scouted it. What did you think of the fierceness of their pressure?  
STEPHEN BROWN: I mean, came in and came in with what we expected. It was our
first time facing the press. Once we saw we could get the ball in and get it
up the court, it was nothing new to us. Coach said going into the game, we've
faced press before, but the biggest thing for us was second-chance
opportunities. Once we got the rebound and got it out in transition, it was
easy to beat the press. But out of bounds, under, on the sidelines, it was
tough for us at times. But we were able to fight back, as you saw, and broke
it a lot of times.  
  
Q. And two follow-ups to that. It seemed you really did a good job of
not being tentative, really going after it. Can you talk about how important
that was or what you thought about doing that?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Coach kept telling us after beating the press, we're going to
keep attacking. Kimbal hitting threes in the corner and Nana catching it on
the post. Once you broke the press, our goal was get a shot off it, any
opportunity, whether it was a jump shot or something inside. So I think we did
a good job of breaking the press and looking for the open guy and just taking
what was given to us.  
  
Q. How unusual, when you get it out of the back court, they got Adrian
at the pad up there, 1-3-1 and then they got two 6'8 " guys on the wings
trying to push you out. It's obviously not something you're going to see too
often. How good do you think that is, and how did you manage it?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. We decided to use what we had to our advantage. I mean,
they're big, long, athletic, but I mean, we have speed. So, I mean, just
looking at the outlets or if we can beat them coming out to just go around and
then beat the press. I mean, other guys did a good job of getting open and
providing outlets for the guys in the back court. Despite their length and
stuff, we just looked for the right reads and just kept attacking it.  
  
Q. When it was 27-12 in the first half, what were you guys saying to
yourselves to frankly just stay in the ball game?  
KIMBAL MACKENZIE: You know, this year, we've been down a couple times. We've
been down big, and we know we're a mentally tough team who is able to fight
back. We have a lot of weapons and we didn't panic. We just, you know, tried
to win every possession, one possession at a time. And we looked up a couple
minutes later, and we were back in the game.  
  
So, we were in that situation before. As I said, we're a pretty mentally tough
group, so we were able to fight back.  
  
Q. For Stephen. The vast majority of you will be back next year. What do
you think might help you guys as a program moving toward?  
ZACH THOMAS: I feel like we know -- if we do get back here next year, we know
what to expect. Everything was new to us, nearly everything. We know what to
expect and we know the caliber of the teams we're going to play, especially
West Virginia today. So, I think we are more well-prepared, and we just have
to, you know, do some of the same things to get us ready.  
  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. I mean it was a great experience for a group such as us.
Just using this as fuel to come back next year and, from beginning to end to
just fight every single game and every single practice. Now that we have a
goal to come back, and get a win in the first round, I think we can use this
and it's much of a confidence boost for all of the guys returning back next
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Great, Stephen, Kimbal, Nana. Thanks for your time.  
  
Q. Nathan, what do you make of the perseverance that your team showed
today out there given the fact that you overcame several double-digit
deficits?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Well, I think that's been the story of our season. We've played
a really challenging nonconference schedule. Our league is always a challenge.
You're in those situations throughout the year, and you don't get to play in
this tournament unless you're a champion, and you can't be a champion without
buying able to persevere through bad times. They're going to happen in every
game, happen in every season, and the team -- the teams that usually handle
the situation the best are the ones that end up being most successful.  
  
I think all year long our guys have done an unbelievable job supporting each
other and picking each other up when they're down, not giving up on things and
fighting through to grow from it. That's a big difference from a year with us.
In a lot of respects, we've really grown in that respect.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously a press gets a lot of note. You handled that fairly
well. Was there offensive rebounding when you went into the game as big of a
concern. Do you think you did what you could against it?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We didn't win, so, we could have done better. Going into the
game, whenever you play them, first off, Coach Huggins is really good. There's
a reason he's a Hall of Fame level guy. They're very disciplined. They play
with purpose. They are extremely tough. They are physical. They don't let you
take possessions off, and that's a credit to him and his staff and the kids,
the way they play.  
  
Going in we knew the first you need to handle with them is you need to be able
to get quality shots. That starts by handling the press. The second part is
offensively, they're going to be significantly bigger than we are. They're
going to be more athletic, and we have to do a better job of keeping them off
the boards.  
  
I thought for the most part with rebounding was, when you're 6'3" or 6'4" and
you're going against a guy who's 6'8", and they run in the lane and jump, that
matters. We weren't going to make enough contact away from the basket to
negate their size some. We were trying. I thought we were fighting, but we
weren't doing as well as we could have. Give them credit for being relentless
at that end and not quitting on plays. In a lot of ways, that was the
difference in the game.  
  
Q. So they average 20.4 turnovers forced a game which led the nation.
And you made 14 or 15. Did you have a number in mind that you said, well,
hopefully we live with this?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We look at every game. I don't typically go by a total number of
turnovers. Just more we look at turnover percentage per possession. I haven't
actually seen the number of possessions we had in the game, but we like to be
around 15 or 16 percent, which is really low. If you're really getting in at
18, 19 percent you're doing a pretty good job.  
  
Our big thing was, look, we are going to turn it over some. Everybody turns it
over some on them. It's as much about us, when we have an opportunity to make
a play being able to make it. Whether it's to get a lay-up, get a good shot.
We didn't want to end up in a situation where we did break it, and then part
of what it is, is it gets you rushed, and all of a sudden you end up throwing
some balls out of bounds when guys are open, fumbling a ball out of bounds,
rushing a lay-up, those type of things. As much as not turning it over, I
think what gave us a chance is our guys did a really good job of taking
advantage when they did break it and not getting to the point where they're
playing too fast and we couldn't finish plays.  
  
Q. Then 27-12, what did you say to your team and what were you thinking
at that point?  
NATHAN DAVIS: They're not watching. What I said was probably a little
different than what I was thinking. I mean, like I said, we've been in that
situation before. You're going to have games where you fall behind. You just
got to keep playing. We're talking about how any game, but especially an NCAA
game, with the length of the time-outs, the intensity and all of that, it's a
long game. And 15 points looks like a lot, but it's really five possessions,
five or six possessions. So if we can put together a string where we're
winning a couple more possessions every time down or every few minutes that
we're losing, next thing you know we're back in the game.  
  
I was thinking I hope we can stop giving them easy baskets and turning it over
and give ourselves a chance. It was early. There was still over ten minutes
left in the first half, there was 30 minutes left to be played. We had a lot
of time left to make it up and again, give our guys credit for having the
mental toughness to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, similar question to what I asked the players. You know you
have the vast majority of this rotation back next year. What do you hope the
guys that were here this year took away from this experience?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think that first thing is you can never take for granted what
you've accomplished. I don't think having everyone back next year means a
whole lot if we don't continue to improve. Now, saying that, I would like to
think what we'll understand, even more so than having not been before, is how
hard it is to get here and the amount of time you've got to put in and the
dedication you got to have to your teammates, yourself, and the rest of the
guys; to be the best you can be and to give everything you have for the team.  
  
You're not going to win a conference championship, you're not going to get a
chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. You're not going to be a good enough
team to advance if you have any other thing on your mind when you're in the
team setting of doing the best you can for everyone else around you. And
understanding that it's really hard, and there's going to be ups and downs.
And as much as you can handle, as well as you deal with the good times, you
have to be able to respond to the bad times. That's one of the great things
about our players and Bucknell kids in general is they mature and learn to
handle those things.  
  
We've got a lot of work cut out for us if we want to get back here and
hopefully do better next year. But I think they'll understand that it's about
understanding how hard it is and embracing it and being able to go after it
again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great season.  
  
NATHAN DAVIS: Thank you.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Mount St. Mary's - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Mount St. Mary's head coach, Jamion Christian. We'll
open with a statement from Coach Christian.  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: First of all, just congratulations to Villanova. This is a
tremendous program, one of the best programs I think we've played against. I
think when we look back historically at what they've been able to do over the
last two years, I think we'll be able to understand what a good program they
are. They obviously have the opportunity to march on. They outplayed us today.  
  
But I'm really proud of our group, and I use that word "proud" because they
were tremendous in their ability to execute our game plan and just really give
this number one team a big scare there in the first half. We've got a lot of
things we can work on and improve, but we're expecting to learn from this
experience like we've done time and time again and have an opportunity to
improve on it.  
  
Q. Elijah, what were you thinking at halftime?  
ELIJAH LONG: Like Coach said, I was proud of the guys and myself, how we came
out. But Villanova is a great team, so we couldn't let up. It wasn't obviously
the end of the game. So we had to reset and try to do the same thing we did
the first half in the second half, and unfortunately that's not what we did.
But I'm proud of my guys for coming out the first half like that.  
  
Q. Miles, I know the result wasn't what you wanted but you went over to
the fan section and saluted each other. What did that mean?  
MILES WILSON: The fan base has been really strong for us, and for them to come
out to Buffalo and show support is amazing. We were 1-11 at the beginning of
the season, and nobody believed in us. Our fans and our family and our
community were so supportive. They stayed with us the whole time. That was
big.  
  
Q. Junior, you guys haven't backed down from anyone all season. Was that
the attitude that you brought on to the court tonight that you weren't going
to back down or flinch especially after you played two nights ago?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Yeah. I mean, I feel like we shouldn't have to back down from
anyone, after putting on a jersey, they play the game the same way we do.
There's no in backing down. Just come out and play hard and try to attack them
any way we can.  
  
Q. Elijah, you mentioned what the mood was at halftime. When it was up
10-2, what were you guys thinking?  
ELIJAH LONG: You're talking about the beginning of the game? Honestly, we
thought they were going to try to come in and punch us in the face right away.
That obviously wasn't the case. We had how many stops?  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Ten stops.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: Ten stops in a row. That was a great momentum swing for us when
we were up 10-2. I honestly didn't look at the clock until two minutes -- a
minute toward halftime. I didn't look at the clock. I didn't know what the
score was. I just knew we were playing good.  
  
Other than that, I was very proud. I was excited, you know, that this might be
a good game, we could get this win but unfortunately we didn't.  
  
Q. For Elijah as well. Do you guys feel like you almost squandered an
opportunity in some ways, too. They were really cold in the first half and
your shooting wasn't as good as it was on other nights. Do you feel you could
have built an even bigger lead at points?  
ELIJAH LONG: Oh, definitely. I feel like first half, we were doing well,
swinging the ball, getting easy buckets. But I think second half, I don't
think we were settling because we wanted to shoot a lot of threes, but I just
think the ball wasn't falling for us. I think half the shots went in for us
three. And the other players on the team, like Greg, Alexander, if half the
shots went in, it would have been a close game. The result might have been
different. It might have not, but it would have been a close game for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Not seeing any, gentlemen,
congratulations. Follow up questions now for Coach Christian.  
  
Q. Jamion, what do you think tonight's performance says about your
program?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I think everyone got a glimpse of how good we can be. That
was really a really well-played first half. It was at the tempo we wanted. I
thought we really dominated the pace of the game in that first half. It was
exactly where we wanted it to be, and so I think it shows that when you have a
program, no matter your seed, and you have guys committed to a plan and a high
level of enthusiasm to execute that plan, that anything is possible.  
  
So I think in one regard it shows how good we can be. On the other regard it
shows how much work we have to do to continue to get better and move our
program forward.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half, you had a moment to yourself before you
jogged off to the locker room. You kind of gave a chagrinned look. You looked
up at the scoreboard. Could you tell me what was going through your head at
that point? I kind of know.  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I felt like we should have been winning the game. I felt
like we really played a good half. I felt we were just right there. In one
way, I was really so inspired by our group's defensive effort, but I felt like
we really squandered an opportunity to finish that half and go into the half
up one, which would have been huge for us, momentum-wise. We talked about
getting a stop in the time-out. They got to the front of the rim and shot the
ball at the block. That was my thinking.  
  
Typically I'm a real positive person. I looked up at it and I though I wonder
how many 16 seeds have taken a one to being down one in a half. We're in
pretty elite company right here. Let me settle my troops in the locker room
and make sure we come out with some fire.  
  
Q. How did the schedule you played earlier in the season prepare your
team for this game, and did that factor into how competitive you were at the
start of the game?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: No question. I thought the schedule prepared us for
everything that was going to happen here. One thing we're trying to do as a
program is we're trying to learn from the mistakes we made before. Being able
to look at our team and to say you've played six NCAA Tournament teams. We've
play three or four teams that won their conference tournament that are elite
teams in this country definitely gave us a big benefit, and to also look at
them and say what do we need to do better in those games?  
  
That's was a tough stretch of games playing there, and the guys would say we
have to get back to transition defense. We have to have a focus on that. We've
got to rebound the ball. It's always more powerful when it comes from them
than when it comes from me. Trying to create a program where they have that
ownership is extremely important. And so that schedule allowed us to have
extreme ownership in a lot of different areas. I thought it definitely helped
us compete out there today against one of the best.  
  
Q. Not many teams over the last few years have been able to frustrate
Villanova like you guys did in that opening stretch. What specifically do you
think you were doing so well at that point, and what's going through your mind
when you're watching Josh Hart air ball floater?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Yeah. One of the things watching on film, when they get out
and play in transition, they all get going and I think you saw that in the
second half. We wanted to honestly come out there and control the tempo. One
thing when see on film, if you make shots against Villanova, they're going to
walk the ball up the floor. They're going to take shots under ten, and that's
going to give you the opportunity to set your defense and get stops.  
  
Some people might say Villanova didn't play their best in the first half. On
the contrary, I thought we controlled the tempo and played very well. And
there's another team on the other side of that that dominated that pace and
that tempo, made them have to take one shot and get out.  
  
Q. Jamion, are you aware Jay Wright said you out-coached him and the
team that played better tonight might not have been the winning team?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: That's very flattering. Jay Wright is one of those guys I
look up to. If you're a young guy coaching, you have a lot of admiration for
those who have done the job and done it well for a long time, especially when
you dress as well as Jay does.  
  
I don't know if I out-coached him tonight. I know his team outplayed our team.
I look at it as we're all a team, we're all a family. I didn't find enough
ways to give our guys the advantage. He certainly did that. He made a ton of
adjustments playing small some, playing big some. A lot of credit to him.  
  
I'm going to take from this game a lot of things I need to get better at, so
when we have an opportunity to get back here that we have more tricks up our
sleeve to make sure we move on to the next round.  
  
Q. You know, a 16 seed has never beaten a No. 1 seed. Mount St. Mary's
has been a 16 seed, I think four times. Do you think that will ever happen or
what will it take for a 16 seed to come in and win this game?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: What's crazy about me, I wanted the 16 seed. I really wanted
that. My team will tell you that. I think when you sign up to come to a good
program, you sign up to do something that's never been done before, and you
sign up to do it with the best of your ability and a ton of enthusiasm. I was
enthusiastic about it. I know where we are in Mount St. Mary's and NEC.
There's a great possibility we'll be a 15 or 16. I think it takes an
enthusiastic bunch, we have that. It takes a team that's going to make outside
shots. We have that. A team that's going to have some ball handling at the
four, five spot. We have that.  
  
And most importantly, it's going to take a team that has a defensive mindset
that can do that for a full 40 minutes. It's going to happen. The distance
between 1 and 16, as you saw tonight is closing down. They may have had bigger
bodies than us, they may have made some shots over top of us. But the heart of
athletes and the heart of teams is getting better and better. The gap is
really closing.  
  
It didn't happen here tonight. It might not happen here in this tournament,
but I'd like to think we're starting a trend with what we did there in the
first half.  
  
Q. I saw you share an embrace with Josh Hart. What was that moment like
what did you say to each other?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I love Josh, Josh and Kris. I love those guys. I would be
lying to you if I didn't say last year I was rooting for them and through the
tournament. I just love those guys. I told Josh I'm so proud of the man he's
become. I get a chance now -- I've known Josh since he was about 15 years old.
I remember the first day at Sidwell Friends High School. Now I get a chance to
see him do his interviews and see people react to him. I'm so proud of the
person he's become because I know his story.  
  
I'm disappointed that we lost today, but I just love those guys so much, that
I'm rooting for them. They don't have a bigger fan. Josh knows that, he knows
if he ever needs anything in this life, he always has my phone number, he can
always call me. I'm really proud of him and the person he's become. I think
that's what college athletics is about. It's about helping them grow up and
become all that they can become. Jay Wright has done a great job with that
with Josh.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 60, Princeton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from Coach Brey.  
  
MIKE BREY: First game in the tournament. Got everybody ready, gave everybody a
show. We know what we're supposed to do. I'm thrilled about our defense to
keep them under 40% and really guard the arc. I think they're 8 for 31. That's
how we were going to escape and we did escape. They're really good, but we've
been in a lot of games like that, where game situations, having to make a big
defensive stop, having to get a bucket, get it to the right guy, getting a
ball in bounds to win a game. We've been there, really proud that we're still
alive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for Bonzie and Matt.  
  
Q. For Bonzie and Matt, you guys typically are, you know, a prolific
three-point shooting team. Today it looked like you guys were really working
to the inside, getting to the lane. Is that something you were specifically
planning on coming into the game, or is that something that was happening as
the game was developing?  
BONZIE COLSON: I would say it happened as the game developed. We tried to
attack them with the three in the post. That's the way we play, we can post
up, we can play five all cutters and ball screen roll. We saw some mismatches
and tried to attack the best we can.  
  
MATT FARRELL: I think we made adjustments in the second half trying to get
Bonzie down there. That really helped us getting him in the lane and getting
deep position. He's really tough to guard down there. It's just about making
adjustments. I don't know if we shot the ball very well, but, like I said,
it's about making adjustments and we did what we had to do to get out of there
with a win.  
  
Q. For both players, can you just describe the emotions of that last
minute or so?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I mean, it was something we've been through. We've been
through a lot of those game situations. We've worked on it since summertime.
So we walked in, and we knew what we had to do. They had big shots, but we
stayed composed. We stayed locked in on defense and then on the offense end,
we was still in our movement. They're a good team, they have a lot of good
movement, but we talked and we communicated. I think that was something that
got us the win.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think we're a very confident group when it comes down to
game situations. We've been a lot in the past, especially in the conference
that we play in. We got a lot of guys that are poised. Like I said, we're
confident in game situations.  
  
Q. Obviously, a game like this, first round, there's fans from all four
teams there. Notre Dame well-represented. At the same time, especially second
half, Princeton going on a run, did you feel at all the crowd was against you,
that maybe some of the neutral fans would be thinking hey, it's fun to see the
little guys win.  
BONZIE COLSON: I'm sure you see that with all teams. Princeton was a great
team. They guarded us well. They played on the offensive end, but we just
stayed with what we do. It was a good game. No matter how we looked, we got
the win. That's all that matters.  
  
MATT FARRELL: We've played in some tough environments before. Try not to pay
attention to that. We knew they were going to go on a run. Talented offensive
team. So we just had to stick with it. Once they went on that run, we made a
couple adjustments, but we try to stay focused on the game and try to stay
focused on what we do.  
  
Q. Could we talk perimeter defense? They're one of the most efficient,
effective perimeter teams in the country. Just what was your focus and what
went so well?  
MATT FARRELL: Just running them off the three-point line. We didn't want to
get them going from behind the arc and we did a good enough job to do that.
They're lethal from behind there. We had to do that and we had to rebound. We
thought we had an advantage on that end, so we did both of those things.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I think their movement on the offensive end is really
different than what we've seen, a lot of back doors. They have a lot of three-
point shooters, so we wanted to run them off the three, create gaps and I
think that really helped us get some stops and rebounds as well.  
  
Q. Matt, last year you were in the starting lineup for the first time.
Now a year later, had a tremendous junior season. How much different does it
feel being up there right now?  
MATT FARRELL: I think it's the same. Having fun, having fun with the guys I've
been with. It's the same. March is crazy. We just saw that, but I think it's
the same confidence. It's the same mindset. I think it's a lot of fun to be
here, especially with the guys around me, so, kind of the same mindset, just
do whatever it takes to get the W.  
  
Q. This has already been asked. Bonzie, the ankle, how it felt today and
if it hindered you in any way?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. My ankle's good. I'm ready to play again. It's fine. I'm
going to ice it up. I'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Bonzie, Matt, congratulations. Thanks for your time. See you
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Same for you, Coach. Perimeter defense, they had some open looks but
not that many?  
MIKE BREY: You know, to force them into 8 for 31 is a heck of a job by us. And
it's probably why we won the game. We even blocked a couple. We got out. I
thought our sense of urgency, switching stuff, getting out on shooters, was a
key. And, again, I'm really thrilled, because this team is a good -- this
group's a good defensive group. And we had to win it playing defense. Because
we weren't in a great flow offensively. Some guys didn't shoot it as well as
they'd liked, but we continued to guard. That's where we're pretty mature. We
understand if our -- maybe different than some of my other teams. When we're
not scoring it doesn't affect us on the defensive end.  
  
Q. With Bonzie, he clearly doesn't want anybody to think he's injured,
but is he 100 percent, and also, what does it mean in a match-up of similar
teams perimeter games to have a guy like him with his inside ability?  
MIKE BREY: He's certainly the difference. We were able to post him more. We
really don't post him as much against ACC teams. He's outdribbling,
exchanging, and shooting 15-footers and then sneaks into the post off a ball
screen roll. But we were just throwing that darn thing in there. Looked like
the Harongody days. Just chuck it in there and see what happens.  
  
He's sore, he's a warrior, he played through some soreness. The great thing
about the NCAA Tournament, you've got a day in between to really get that
thing right again. And this time of year, you're playing on adrenaline
anyways.  
  
Q. You have a player that creates a foul but still gets dinged in the
head, gets six stitches I've heard?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Talk about the resilience there and the fact of physicality and
injury and all of that?  
MIKE BREY: I'm a big karma guy. Bonz is banged up a little bit. We used a lot
of energy in Brooklyn and Pflueger gets dinged and is bleeding. I thought,
God, I don't know about today. Is today going to be a weird day?  
  
He's a tough kid. We glued him up. We would have stitched any other of our
guys, but since he's from L.A., and he's into Hollywood, we didn't want to
mess his face up, so we glued his head up because he could be a movie star
someday. But he's been tough as nails, and to come back -- I actually said to
my staff, he was back in, and I said Is he right? Is he giving us anything?
And he hit the baseline jump shot and I turned around an said I guess he's
okay. He really defends. That attention to detail, chasing shooters off the
arc, he's fabulous about that.  
  
Q. Mike, last year you started him this year at this point in the
tournament. Now a year later, how much have you seen his confidence grow?  
MIKE BREY: He's at the controls of this program. He's been that way since the
summer. What helped him get confident early in the season, was that we did
start him in the NCAA Tournament. So when we went to Brooklyn and won the
Legends Classic, that was a great coming-out party, but he felt good, and that
made us all believe and believe in him.  
  
Q. You guys have been pulling NCAA Tournament wins kind of out of the
fire for the past three seasons now, and you've had a ton of close games this
season as well. What about your guys, when they're clicking, kind of makes
them able to survive those late runs or is there an X factor?  
MIKE BREY: We've had an unbelievable run in close games. I think we're 18-3 in
our last 21 overtime games. That shouldn't happen. The law of averages. But
we've been in so many of them, we really believe, and I think in this
tournament, this nucleus of guys, just feel like as this thing was getting
close, well, that's what we did all last year. We just stole wins to get to
the Elite Eight.  
  
And it's very similar to two years ago, the Northeastern game, you know? A
tough one, you escape, and maybe can get on a run. Our guys have really
believe that, because they've experienced it, which is huge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach, congratulations. See you tomorrow.

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 84, Virginia Tech - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Virginia Tech head coach, Buzz Williams, as well as
Seth Allen, Zach LeDay. We'll open right up with questions for our student-
athletes. At this time, please raise a hand we'll get a microphone you to.  
  
Q. Seth, they made 13 threes and their point guard obviously had eight
of them. Was that just them being very hot or was there anything defensively
that you think you guys could have done better defending the three?  
SETH ALLEN: I think we talked about their three-point shooting, especially
Bronson. A lot of it came off of offensive rebounds, some off of us trying to
dig in the post. They did get hot. I think he hit like three or four in a row
at one point. But we just had to do a better job running them off the line.
But we were really focusing on trying to pack it in and trying to play tighter
defensively.  
  
Q. Zach, you guys were able to cut your deficit to one point on five
different occasions in the second half, but never able to tie it or take the
lead when you had a chance. Just how frustrating was it that you were able to
battle almost all of the way back but never quite get there to even the game
up?  
ZACH LEDAY: I just know I had a couple opportunities. That's just my fault.
I've got to be better as a leader and make them shots. You really don't think
about that, you're thinking about getting stops and playing as hard as you
can. We weren't really thinking about the score. I know I wasn't looking at
the score for a second. I was just out there playing as hard as I could for my
teammates.  
  
Q. Seth, in the first half we saw you limping. Seemed like something was
going on with the foot or anything. What was your physical condition
tonight?  
SETH ALLEN: I kind of got beat up a little bit, but I was fine in the second
half.  
  
Q. Seth, you guys were 7 of 17 from three. Was their three-point defense
tough? Did they give you hard looks, tough looks?  
SETH ALLEN: I don't know. I'd say that they got some really -- they're a
really good defensive team. Some of the looks, we didn't touch the paint. We
executed out of bounds under pretty well. The threes we did get were all from
paint touches. A lot of those were -- we shot a lot of threes late. I remember
I shot two in the second half that was late. But 7 for 17 -- what percent is
that? 41? So, that's okay.  
  
Q. Obviously, it's tough after a loss, but is there any room for both of
you guys for pride right now, whether in each other or in the rest of your
teammates or in Buzz?  
ZACH LEDAY: We went out there, we fought as hard as we could. I guess at the
end of the day, they made more winning plays than us, but we're going to have
pride no matter what. We went out there and played as hard as we could and we
gave it our all. We just came up short.  
  
Q. Seth, why did you want to come over and give Zach a hug when he fell
down?  
SETH ALLEN: Because Zach's like my brother. We came in together and this is
the last game we play together in college, so I just wanted to tell him I love
him and that's it.  
  
Q. For each of you, you helped turn this program around in the three
years in Blacksburg. How will you remember your time in Blacksburg overall and
this special season? How will you remember it?  
ZACH LEDAY: This year, specifically, I was just really focused. I wasn't
really focused on my time. To be honest, I wasn't thinking about my time in
Blacksburg or anything. I was just thinking about basketball. Every day, all
day, how I can get better. How I can get better with my team and help us win.
At the end of the day, we fought as hard as we could. I literally dedicated my
whole life to this program this season this past year. I don't have any
regrets. I wish we could have won. I'm really mad that we didn't win. But at
the end of day, these are my brothers for life, and Coach Buzz is like a
father to me. I'm thankful I was able to come here and glad we got to this
point.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Same here. I enjoyed my time here. Like Zach said, this season we
made a deal with each other. We didn't get on any social media. We just stayed
in our house. We just went to the gym and shot, and we tried to be the best
leaders we could and follow Coach Buzz because he's one of the best leaders
we've ever seen or the best leader. And we were just trying to fight every
night. It's hard to change a program around. You have to be an everyday
digging person. You can't take any days off even when you're beat up.  
  
That was always our mentality. We knew that it wasn't going to be easy, and we
just wanted to just follow Coach Buzz and coaching staff's lead and just try
to play and work as hard as we could when the cameras weren't up on our face.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seth, Zach, congratulations on the season.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Thank you, guys. Thanks, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Williams at this time.  
  
Q. Buzz, with as little depth as you had, and you knew Seth was hurting,
Justin Bibbs said that he saw, at least during halftime, at points during the
second half where he was grimacing. Did you have a discussion at any point
during the half, I need you right now, there's nobody else I can rely on right
thousand?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No. We didn't discuss it. He knew, our team knew. He has really
bad turf toe. Our team doctor was here. Obviously he played less minutes than
normal. But that's part of it. We've obviously endured a short roster all year
long, and an even shorter roster since Chris's injury. Hate that it happened
to Seth in what ended up being his last game, not just for Seth but the
importance that Seth brings to the other six guys that he plays with. But
that's not why we lost. But it was a part of the story for sure.  
  
Q. Buzz, did they do certain things keeping you from having one of those
10, 12 three-point games that you have?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No, I mean this appropriately. I think with what has transpired
over the last nine games with each passing game, the scouting report has
skewed towards that. If you're shooting -- we were shooting 51% as a team from
the field over the last nine games. 47%, I think, from three. So, I think
teams are focused on -- we're playing for the most part multiple guys on the
floor that can shoot it from three. So, they're a great defensive team, and I
would say that that was a part of their plan going into the game.  
  
Q. Buzz, last year, Seth and Zach both said that the N.I.T. tournament
was a jumping-off point for you guys for wanting to have a good start. How do
you view this game and experience in getting back here for the first time in a
decade as a jumping off not just this year but for years to come?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: The thing I mentioned, obviously it's emotional any time you
come to the end. Our last game, postgame locker room, this is my tenth year as
a head coach. It's always been the same, and the one thing that I said
different tonight than I said last year, to answer your question, is, as
emotional as you are, it's important that you go back to the hotel, and write
down all of the things that you learned. Good things, bad things, basketball-
specific things, person things, student things. Because in order to use this
as an opportunity for growth, you can't wait until after the Final Four.
Because that's what typical kids do.  
  
And I think what we've asked of our staff and asked of a very young roster,
and in some ways a very depleted roster for various reasons, we've asked them
to be men in so many respects, and so I think this, all of this, all that
comes with this, is an opportunity to learn. And I think the best way to learn
is to flush it all out of your heart and your soul and your brain and make
sure that you have something that you can go back to. And just because of my
relationship with those guys, and I don't say that in an arrogant way, I think
they'll heed that advice, because I think it's important. I'll do it. I've
always done it. There's a lot to learn from all of this and you have to
dissect it in the right way.  
  
Q. Buzz, you got a lot of pieces coming back next year. How much will
you and this program and this team miss those two seniors that just left?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I don't -- you probably know this. I'm in the bottom percentile
in saying hello. And whatever percentile you think I am in that regard, I'm
worse in saying good-bye. I don't say hello to my wife when she calls me; I
don't say good-bye to my wife. That's the way I've always been and that's why
I'm perceived, sometimes, I think in the wrong way. Man, I'll miss those kids.  
  
Figuratively, those guys have carried a lot of water since they've been here,
and for whatever reason, they have never resisted anything that I've asked of
them. And not because they're good players, they're really, really good kids.
And what they've been able to help us establish in a very, very short tenure,
way faster than I believe we've been given credit for, I owe them for life,
and my children owe them, and our staff owes them, and those other kids on our
team owe them, and we're so thankful.  
  
Q. I know you're not real big on negative thinking, but even for a
second, do you allow yourself to think about, what if I had Chris, what if I
had Kerry, what if I had even Johnny. These guys that can give you more
minutes and especially bigs?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, no. I think the reason why is the pace of this is just so
fast, you know? And when you excel and give yourself time to go, well, if we
did this and if we had that, this could have happened, for whatever reason, my
whole career, there's some lemons, let's make lemonade. An you know why Zach
and Seth are so good? It's because they didn't have any other choice.  
  
And if you look at our staff, really and truly, the only guy whose resume
looks like they belong is our trainer. You know, he's got all of those
initials after his name. We send him all over the country to all of those
conferences. But I think one of the things that I admire so much about our
guys, they never paused either. Overtime game against UVA, you were there, the
next morning Chris gets the MRI. That afternoon, the doctor comes to the
office and we Face-Time his parents, but then we have to leave immediately
after that to travel to Pitt, and part of it is because of the pace of
everything.  
  
But part of it is as a leader, I'm inspired that the fabric of how we go about
things is, what's next? And that's a quote-shirt, but they believe it, and I
believe it, too. And I think that they've been such an example of that. You
know, the thing that I'm disappointed, Chris was Player of the Year in
Virginia. He was a part of our first four recruiting class. I hate it for him
that he didn't get to experience this in uniform, you know? I made the
decision on K., Kerry, and called his dad, after the win at Michigan, and I
said, in my heart, I don't think I would play my son, but I want to be honest
with you, if I played your son, we would win two more games, and those two
games could decide which tournament we play in. And he goes, Buzz, you need to
play him. And I go, I know. As a coach, I need to play him, but in my heart, I
can't.  
  
And Pig -- Tyrie -- he's really good, and the things that he's been through in
the last seven months, I've never seen in my 23 years as a college coach,
ever. And what Tom Gabbard has done for Pig, I've never seen an administrator
fight for. And Devin Wilson, he says to me, after the spring football game,
Coach, what do you think I ought to do? I said, well, the only way I can
answer that is, I think if I could tell my children that I played college
football and college basketball at the highest level possible, I think I'd do
that. Toughest guy on the roster. Best defender on the roster.  
  
And I knew when he said I'm playing football, I knew that meant he wouldn't
play basketball this year. And I think that you have to make decisions
individually, but those decisions have to be sustainable collectively. And I
think, like Berman said, of all of the guys that are returning, on paper, it
will be the highest number of the years of experience at Virginia Tech. This
group had seven years of experience at Virginia Tech, and we played 33 games
with the last one being here. It's pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Coach.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Just indulge me for a minute. Because we have some new media
members here for the afternoon session, reminder to please silence your cell
phones. When you have a question, please raise your hand. Give your name and
your affiliation, we'll get a microphone to you. Please wait until we get a
microphone there. You are allowed one follow-up question as well. That being
said, welcome to Buffalo and welcome Villanova student-athletes, Josh Hart,
Kris Jenkins, and Darryl Reynolds from my right to left. Welcome back to
Buffalo.  
  
Q. Josh, a year ago this time, you were sitting up there and nobody
thought you were getting out of this weekend. Now everybody thinks you're
going to be repeat champions. So, which is tougher?  
JOSH HART: I think the -- that's a tough one. There was a big monkey on our
back with the first weekend thing. It was kind of weird this year not having
to answer that question that I answered the last three years. But, you know,
it is what it is. Both of them are challenging. We just know we've got to be
focused and ready to play come tomorrow.  
  
Q. I guess maybe then you don't know the answer to this, but if you are
lucky enough to continue to go forward, do you think the second part of this
will become more difficult, the repeat thing?  
JOSH HART: I think the hype will be a little bit more. You know, if we're
lucky enough to advance far into the tournament, so the hype will be a little
bit more. So that will be something -- surrounding us will be a distraction,
and we just got to focus on each other and really fall into that distraction.
We just got to focus on playing basketball for 40 minutes. If we do that,
we'll take the outcome.  
  
Q. For Kris and Josh. Last year, did you enjoy the moment coming in and
this year now being seniors, and coming off what you came off last year. Are
you enjoying and embracing the moment more than you did last year?  
JOSH HART: I think it was harder last year to embrace it, just with, you know,
like I said, just -- not the pressure, but just everything that came around
with the first-round exit or the first weekend exit, the last couple of years,
so that was kind of hard to embrace. Because we knew, no matter how we played,
that first game, we knew we were going to have to -- if we won that one, we
knew we were going to have to answer that question, and we knew that was going
to be the big story and everything, the next couple of days.  
  
So and now, it's hard to do it now because we have questions about repeating.
So, you know, you can't really embrace it too much. Obviously, it's a blessing
being able to be here, this isn't a privilege. But that's why we got to just
rely on each other and focus on each other, and don't focus on anything else.
We have to embrace the time we have together at the end. That's really the
only thing we can really embrace.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Just like Josh said, just take it one day at a time, one game at
a time. We really enjoy being around each other, and we're looking forward to
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh and Kris, you got -- the last time you guys were in this
building was your freshman year against UConn with a shot to go to the Garden.
How much is that game and what happened that year, is it still a little bit of
a motivation when you get to this time of the year?  
JOSH HART: Yeah, we -- I remember that one vividly. Shabazz, that UConn team,
they were tough and talented, but we try not to think about that too much now.
Obviously, you know, we knew we were playing Buffalo. That was the first
thing. When we heard Buffalo, we were like, we went there freshman year. We
had a tough game against UConn there.  
  
But now, we don't really think about it. I think the only time we thought
about it was the first time we heard we were probably going to be going to
Buffalo. And it was like, oh, Buffalo.  
  
Q. Kris or Josh or both, how much do you think that the perception of
your team and your coach has changed? I mean, you win a National Championship,
and it's no longer this team can't win, same with your coach. Can you take me
through that a little bit, that now this guy, he was a good coach before but
somehow one win makes him better.  
JOSH HART: I got to answer every one? There's one -- the blessing about Coach
and this program is nothing ever really changes. I think that's the biggest
thing. No matter if you're coming off a National Championship year or we were
coming off for that 13-19 year. Nothing in this program ever changes. The core
values are still the same. The commitment to our core values is still the
same, so I think the only thing that might have changed is, you know, his
drilling in those core values a little bit more.  
  
Last year was amazing just in terms of everyone buying in, and we saw what can
happen if we buy into Villanova basketball. That's something that Coach told
us after it happened, you guys thought I was crazy about our core values now,
but that's the one thing about us. Nothing ever changes. We didn't -- never
talked about repeating this whole year. It was just about committing ourselves
to Villanova basketball, buying in and being the best team we can be at the
end of the year.  
  
Q. Kris, is there any downside at all in making one of the most iconic
shots in the history of college basketball?  
KRIS JENKINS: Is there any downside? Yeah. After I made the shot, there was a
lot of downside, you know, just focus on what else we have to do.  
  
Q. Is there any one amusing thing that's happened to you, though, just
because of the shot, people coming up to you or anything like that?  
KRIS JENKINS: Nah.  
  
JOSH HART: They come up to him everywhere.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: That's it.  
  
Q. Josh, how do you avoid complacency, or being satisfied when you've
won it all?  
JOSH HART: It starts with our coach, and it starts with us three and then
trickles on down. Coach is continuing to get on us, especially us three
seniors, and we got, at max, I think six games left, you know, possibly in our
career. And Coach isn't like, okay, let them go. We've had some successful
years. Let them just kind of do what we do. He's getting on us and he's
continuing to coach us, even at the end of our career. So we're doing that,
we're being coachable, and we're listening to everything he says. And it goes
from us and it trickles on down.  
  
When those younger guys see the seniors in their last go-around, their last
couple weeks left of their college career, still allowing themselves to be
coached, that forces them to do it. They're great guys and they're going to
follow our lead, but we know it starts with us three.  
  
Q. I know you guys don't talk about repeat, but, I mean, you have to
think about it at some level. Do you allow yourself to even process -- you get
that in your head? Because you know what you're going for.  
DARRYL REYNOLDS: Obviously, we would like to repeat. I think every team in
this tournament wants to win the tournament. There isn't a team that wouldn't
want to win. Just like before, like we dealt with it in years past, you can't
look too far behind or too far forward, because you end up tripping on what
you're doing right now.  
  
Coach is trying to drive that home, just focusing on the present, focusing on
the next game. We can think about repeating and completely overlook the next
game, and you lose, and you don't even have a chance to make it to that point
to be able to repeat. So it's just something we've been doing the last couple
years just making sure we're focused on the next game, focused on what we can
control at the moment.  
  
Q. Kris, how many times have you relived that shot in your mind and
thought about it, and for you personally, was it tough to maybe find
motivation again this season, given that -- I mean, that's like the ultimate
dream for any player and you've already lived it.  
KRIS JENKINS: I don't even think about it or talk about it when I'm asked
about it. It wasn't hard for me, because I still have a lot that I want to
accomplish. I'm a part of this great team with these great guys and the guys
in the locker room. So when you have guys around you like that, it's easy to
refocus.  
  
Q. How much, for any of you guys, how much do you know about Mount St.
Mary's and the history of the 1-16 match-up?  
DARRYL REYNOLDS: Our freshman year, I think we played Mount St. Mary's at the
beginning of the year, so we got to see a little bit of their program at that
point.  
  
We watched the game yesterday. They are a talented team. I think every team at
this point is a talented, tough team, especially the team that won their
conference tournaments, stuff like that.  
  
They're a good team. They're a good team like every team in this tournament.
They play fast, they seem to play hard. They're disciplined in their coaching.
Obviously we know about the 1-16 match-up, the hype that's built around that.
We understood that coming into this. It's part of this tournament. It's just
one of those questions you're going to have to answer with this tournament.
It's nothing to be upset about, anything like that. You understand what it is
and you move forward. Sorry if I wasn't talking loud enough, I just realized I
could have leaned a little bit forward. I see him in the back, I'm sitting
here whispering, I'm sorry about that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You're coachable. Good work. Other questions for our Villanova
student-athletes?  
  
Q. For Josh, you mentioned having a memory of coming to Buffalo. You
guys have been here now since Monday. Do you guys sort of feel like -- and
you've gone through a Buffalo snowstorm. Do you feel like an honorary
Buffalonian at this point?  
JOSH HART: A little bit. I thought I'd get to see the sun. I hope that's not
what it's like up here all 365 days. I mean, I like the warm weather, so I
don't want to say go back home, because I think it's snowing in Philly, too.
We just got to tough it through the last couple weeks and put up with the
weather. So I guess you could say we feel like, Buffalonians, I think is what
you said.  
  
Q. You feel like Buffalonians, what have you been doing in your free
time. Obviously you have practice coming up and you've been watching the game
last night. Anything fun? Have you guys had any time to enjoy it?  
JOSH HART: Not really. We just relaxed. We all watched a movie. Was that
Monday night? Monday night, I think we got here. We watched a movie together.
That was really about it. I wish I could tell you we had, like, this epic
snowball fight and it was amazing. But no, not really. We've just been in our
rooms, just relaxing, taking our mind off the tournament, and just enjoying
each other's company.  
  
Q. All right. Not seeing any more questions, gentlemen, thanks for your
time. Good luck tomorrow.  
JOSH HART: Thank you.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright. Coach, welcome back
to Buffalo.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: This is a regular stop for you. I think once at Hofstra and
another time here.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: 2010. It is great to be back in Buffalo. I love western New York,
and I think our team is excited about this upcoming game. It's pretty cool to
watch a game together last night and watch our opponent in Mount St. Mary's,
who is a tough team. Great guards. And very tough kids on their team, so
should be a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: With that we'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Jay, Josh came in before and said that it's been tough to embrace and
enjoy an NCAA Tournament when you guys never got by the first weekend, and now
talking about repeat or whatever. Again, it's hard to do that. What would you
tell your players about enjoying the moment, especially your senior class who,
this is their last go-around?  
JAY WRIGHT: He said it's hard to enjoy it because of that?  
  
Q. Enjoy it and embrace it?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I think what he means is in terms of enjoying all the lead-
up and all of the hype, all that stuff, the open practices, and this media.
Because I think they want to enjoy the end results, that's what they want to
enjoy, and I think they understand that. I think they understand there's a
commitment that you have to have during this time as you're preparing and
playing games. And you can get to enjoy it on the weekend, if you get past the
second game, and then you start it all over again.  
  
Q. Jay, is this a little bit weird for you at all, when you come back
here knowing -- there's the Rochester angle. There's the Bucknell side. You
have been here before. You know this area, recruited here. I grew up with Rick
Wnuk, by the way, who you recruited. What's it like for you when you come back
here?  
JAY WRIGHT: A lot of -- we just had the meeting, the coaches' meeting and Mike
Brey is in there and Buzz Williams and Huggins. We've all -- it seems like
Hugs and Mike Brey and us have been in the shape spot, you know, for the last
three years. I don't know how that works. But coming back to western New York
is always cool. I have great memories about starting at University of
Rochester and recruiting a lot in the Buffalo area. Not got getting Wnuk, not
getting the Torgalskis. The only guys I didn't get from this area. Trying to
recruit Christian Laettner as a freshman not knowing he was going to be that
good.  
  
But I do like coming up here and Bucknell being here is really cool, too.
We're really proud of Nathan and those guys, so, yeah, a lot of connections
here, and we're enjoying it. Also the Anchor Bar and Duff's, we like that,
too.  
  
Q. Last year, one of the lines you used in Brooklyn a lot was that you
knew -- your team knew that you would be judged by whatever happened in the
NCAA Tournament, fairly or not. Do you still feel that way with this group
because you've kind of climbed that mountaintop or does it change at all?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's something that we discussed as a team. I just think in
general, you're defined by what you did in the NCAA Tournament as a college
player. If you're a team that's getting there every year, the team and you as
a player get defined that way, nationally, with fans, and that's okay. But we
don't define our guys that way within our program, and they don't -- I don't
think they define themselves that way, and we want to make sure of that.  
  
But it is the reality, you know? There could be a guy that, you know, doesn't
have a great career, but if he does something in the NCAA Tournament,
everybody remembers him forever and that's cool, too.  
  
Q. So, this time last year, Jay, you're sitting up there, nobody thought
you could get out of the first weekend. Now everybody wonders if you can
repeat. Is one more difficult than the other and the pressure you faced last
year is that at all applicable to the pressure you might face going forward?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't know if one is harder than the other, Dana, but they are
different. They are definitely different. There's, I would say, the same level
of pressure, but it's a different kind of pressure. In terms of being
applicable, it definitely is. I think -- you know, pressure is pressure, so
you want to embrace it and try to make -- allow it to make you better, and we
had a different kind of pressure last year. It was like that second-round
pressure was crazy.  
  
And this year, it is about repeating. You're a one seed, and so you're
supposed to win it if you're the one seed, right? It's all about how you
handle that, and I think having that pressure last year and having pressure
this year, I think makes it a little bit easier to handle.  
  
Q. On a lighter note, Coach Huggins earlier said that he used to be the
best-dressed coach, better than you. And obviously, he went a different way. I
guess on the flipside, I was going to ask you if you'd ever consider going
without a tie. We have another tieless coach here in Mike Brey. I was
wondering how important the tie is to the coaching and to the image?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, the reason that I dress that way, it's just been the
tradition, you know, in coaching, you wear a suit and tie. But Hugs is -- I
would like to do an article on the lines Hugs give me before the game when you
shake hands about your attire, his attire, your look, his look. It's great. It
could fill an article. He's got great lines. And Mike -- I remember Mike used
to go with the crew neck, he was the trend-setter on that. I think he and I
had a discussion one summer, I said, you've got to go with the open collar.
That's the next look. I don't know if he did it because of that, but I know we
had a discussion about that, it's important.  
  
I like -- I don't know. I like Hugs' look. When you wear a nice suit and
you're in the huddle and they're sweating on your suit. The guys are dripping
on top of you. I'm thinking why am I wearing this nice suit? But it's
tradition. We'll see, we'll see.  
  
Q. Jay, did you have to worry about this group being complacent or
satisfied, kind of the idea of, we won it all last year, maybe not having
necessarily the drive that they needed?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. I was really concerned about that coming into the
season. Obviously, I hadn't been a part of a National Championship team
before, so I really didn't know how to handle it. They hadn't. But I did talk
to a lot of coaches and everybody said to me, there's a definite hangover you
have to deal with. Don't deny it. Don't hide from it. It's going to be there,
and it really is. And we talked about it all year.  
  
I'm very proud of our three seniors, Josh, and Darryl, and Kris and how, at 20
years old, they are able to handle the maturity of getting past it, taking on
the next challenge, continuing to be humble and get better. Really proud of
them. I don't think I could have done that at 22. Our staff jokes about it all
of the time. If we could have done what Kris Jenkins did last year, we would
have been uncontrollable. And he was, all of them, very humble and coachable.
I'm really proud of them for that.  
  
Q. When do you think you shook that hangover if there was one?  
JAY WRIGHT: We discussed it. We came back -- we all went to the ESPYS in July,
which is kind of the end of the victory tour. It's the last event you go to
after the White House, and state capitol. We discussed it as a team. Because
we're going on a trip to Spain. Hey, this trip to Spain starts the next year.
That's over. We went to Spain. It was great. Because no one knew who we were,
they didn't know we were National Champions. It gave us a fresh start.  
  
But when we got to the baggage claim in Philadelphia and everyone saw we were
there, and they started coming up and taking pictures, it hit all of us, oh,
we're back in it. We're going to have to deal with this. We did get a fresh
start that trip to Spain. It was really helpful to us.  
  
Q. Jay, when you were in Rochester, some 30 years ago, grinding away and
hitting the recruiting trail --  
JAY WRIGHT: 30 years.  
  
Q. Is this where you pictured yourself --  
JAY WRIGHT: Ten years ago I thought it was. No, not at all. I would have been
happy if I could have been the guy to replace Mike Neer at Rochester at that
time. I was just so happy to be coaching. It seems crazy right now that you
get to coach at Villanova and you would have been happy. But you didn't know
any of this was possible. I was having so much fun and enjoying being a coach.
I loved the University of Rochester, Mike Neer was a great coach. I would
have. At that time, Mike Neer was God to me back then. I was like if I can
ever get to do that someday. That was my thought process.  
  
Q. Kind of a combination of the previous three questions both with your
dress -- I talked to your tailor today by the way, Gabriel?  
JAY WRIGHT: We've got to get him under control.  
  
Q. He's a funny way. Did you know that he coached his church league team
to second place 40 years ago?  
JAY WRIGHT: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. I'm sure you did. And the attention paid. Now you have people, I'm
calling your tailor. People are talk bug your suits. How has your life
changed, when you look at the tournament, you were criticized before for not
winning enough in the tournament and now all of a sudden you win one game, one
shot, and so much has changed, if you can take me through that?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, it hasn't really changed that much, just with the media
and -- you know, in basketball venues. That's about it. And in my household,
please. Trust me. I'm number 5 on that list there. I still take out the trash
and do everything I'm told to do. But it really hasn't -- except in situations
like this, when you talk with the media. But I think I'm the same guy. I think
in the program, we all try to stay the same. I talked about our players, you
know? We try to enjoy the journey that we're on.  
  
This is why we do what we do, to be a coach and to be with your players and to
be on a college campus and to be at practice, that's what we love and still
the biggest part of my life.  
  
Q. The perception has changed I guess?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Is that kind of a weird --  
JAY WRIGHT: I'm not as articulate as you guys. That's what I meant to say.  
  
Q. You don't know me real well. Is that a weird transformation to see
how others view you, gets altered, even though you wake up the same way?  
JAY WRIGHT: As I said, we were criticized a lot for losing in the second
round. I wasn't feeling bad about what we were doing. I actually felt really
good about what we were doing. I was disappointed when we lost that game, but
where our program was, our guys were graduating we were winning Big East
championships, our guys were giving their best effort. I felt really good
about what we were doing.  
  
When people were criticizing us if I was feeling good, but then when people
are praising us, I really shouldn't feel better. You just don't take it on one
side. That's really I why think -- I hope we haven't changed.  
  
Q. You spoke earlier about pressure, is there a unique type of pressure
that comes with a one seed and 1 versus 16 match-up?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I don't know if it's top seed but there's a 1-16 pressure.
We've felt it before. I told our team about, we were one seed and actually
Philly guys might -- I might be wrong on this. I count on our media for
details, but when we played Monmouth were we a 1?  
  
We played Monmouth in the Wells Fargo Center where we play our home games,
they we were a 16 seed and they made a run on us and the whole building turned
on us, and it was like a Monmouth home game in our arena. I was shocked. I had
never experienced that. We were number one seed and everyone was going for the
underdog. That's a crazy kind of pressure especially when you're on your home
court. You know those teams, they can get it going and they put game pressure
on you when you're a one seed. You got to be ready for it and got to overcome
that, too.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, on Kris, he was up here earlier and mentioned he
doesn't think about the shot unless he's asked about it. I find that to be
unbelievable. I don't think I'd ever stop thinking about it. Is that just his
personality that he's able to put it aside?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I think it's more his intelligence. He's a confident, cocky,
in a good way, kid. But we talked about it right after the season. And he's
real bright. He's really bright. When we talked about you still got a year
left, you want to get better, you got this for the rest of your life. He right
away internalizes that. I'm amazed -- I've watched for this. When the guys do
shooting drills at the end of practice or they're doing competitions, you
would think one time it would slip, I hit the big shot. I've never ever, ever
seen him mention it ever, and it's really impressive.  
  
Q. Jay, in an era now when players are kind of coming and going because
of one-and-done and things, do you think a program such as yours is more
equipped to repeat than others that perhaps would look more likely repeat
champions?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good -- I hope, I hope so. I hope our experience is
really valuable in this, you know? And usually what gives you a chance to
repeat is a lot of returning players, a lot of returning good players. When
Florida repeated that entire team came back to repeat. Our team didn't come
back to repeat and we lost two great seniors. But we do have -- I think the
key is the number of quality players returning, you know? And, as you say,
because of one-and-done, if you're going to lose a lot of those guys you're
not going to have the quality players returning. So I hope it is an advantage
for us.  
  
Q. We keep going back to the wardrobe. Windsor, double Windsor and is a
pocket square necessary?  
JAY WRIGHT: Straight Windsor. No. It's not always necessary. It depends on the
outfit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: TV guys asking that.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: You all good?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Thank you, guys. I want to
recognize Mike Sheridan, athletic director, who can help you with any of your
needs, thank you very much.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, now, joined the Virginia Tech student-athletes, Seth
Allen, Zach LeDay, gentlemen, welcome to Buffalo. Glad to have you here, we'll
open for questions at this time. Please raise your hand, we'll get a
microphone you to. If you please give your name and affiliation.  
  
Q. Guys, obviously, Wisconsin has got a lot of size. How worried are you
about having to deal with those guys in the paint, especially when you got a
team that's trying to avoid foul trouble?  
ZACH LEDAY: Just going to go out there and play as hard as possible. Every
team is bigger than us. It's not nothing new, we're going to play as hard as
possible, try to box out and get the rebound.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seth?  
  
SETH ALLEN: I agree with Zach. That's kind of been our Achilles heel all
season, so we're used to it. We just got to fight hard for rebounds and
position, and limit them to one shot.  
  
Q. Guys, what have you been doing since you got to Buffalo, with this
being your one and only NCAA Tournament experience of your career, how much
are you trying to soak everything in this week in Buffalo?  
SETH ALLEN: We've just been -- we practiced. We go and lift in the morning. We
eat, we watch a lot of film, we do homework. We chill together. I mean, it's
all snow outside, so we're not leaving the hotel for walks or golfing or
nothing, but we do a lot of things in the hotel, a lot of like team stuff.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Yeah. We just chill. We don't really do nothing that much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: No golf trip.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: No golfing in the snow. They have some snow -- snow people.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Angels?  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Yeah. Whatever.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Oh, we went to the Buffalo Bills facility.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Oh, yeah, that was cool. Forgot about that.  
  
Q. Two of the last three games you blew second-half leads. What do you
take away from that and what are you going to change from the Wisconsin
game?  
SETH ALLEN: Would you say that again?  
  
Q. Two of the last three games you blew second half leads, Wake Forest
and Florida State. What do you take away from that going into the Wisconsin
game?  
SETH ALLEN: I think that we just got to just play our game, take it one
possession at a time. We can't get ahead of ourself, if we're up or down. We
got to just play by media time-outs, and try to win media time-outs. I think
that when we look ahead like for a whole game, we look ahead for a whole game
it's hard for us. So if we just break it down in little bits, it's easier for
us.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. What is it like as a former starter
coming off the bench and what do you think it has brought to your team having
you two come off the bench with all of the scores that you do?  
ZACH LEDAY: I say that it helps our team, because anybody can take any role,
and no one's entitled to start or anything like that. So just by playing that,
and seeing how hard you've got to work, it doesn't matter who starts, it's
whoever plays the hardest. And I feel like we give a big amount of energy
coming off the bench, and it gets other people's confidence up. I guess people
like starting, it doesn't really matter to us. We just want to come and play
as long as possible, and be in the game, affecting the game.  
  
SETH ALLEN: I think Coach Buzz always tells us to embrace whatever's in front
of us, whether it be a game, a role, anything. I think me and Zach did a great
job of just embracing our role coming off the bench. It's hard sometimes. Guys
are already getting past their first win, and we come in on our first win
trying to keep up with them. They're already loose. It's been tough sometimes,
but you just got to fight through it and keep going. We just try to play hard
off the bench and just bring energy and excitement to the game.  
  
Our teammates, they know all of us can start like any of us. We play seven,
eight guys, so, I mean, anybody, you could start -- we play a lot of guard, so
you could really just put anybody in there. So it doesn't really matter who
starts. It's about who finishes and who is on top at the end of the game. Each
team.  
  
Q. Seth, you said win the media time-outs. That sounds like a Buzz
thing, what do you mean by that?  
SETH ALLEN: Each game has ten media time-outs. Each four minutes, we just try
to win the four minutes. We call them like ATOs, like after time-outs. So,
when we come out of the time-outs, we try to win those possessions. There's
one possession for them and there's one possession for us, and that's what
counts towards an ATO.  
  
So when we talk about winning media time-outs -- so, if it's 16 minutes, and
me and Zach are coming in off the bench, when it hits 12 minutes, we want to
do better, get more stops before it gets 12 minutes, than the other team. So,
instead of it being like, before halftime, let's win, we try to break it into
media time-outs. Let's win this media time-out. Let's see good we can do this
media time-out.  
  
Q. So it's the time in between not necessarily being on the sideline?  
SETH ALLEN: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. We talked about what it meant to get to the tournament and you said
how hungry you are for more. Kind of a silly question, other than advancing,
what would a win mean just in terms of direction of the program and for you
guys in validation as well?  
ZACH LEDAY: I think it would be huge, just for everybody just to keep this run
going. It's been a special story. We don't play that many guys. We're small.
All of this stuff that's been rumored about us. It's really special, and we
just want to keep it going. We just want to play together as long as possible
and play as hard as possible for each other, and just be there for one
another. So, it would be really special to get wins in this tournament and
just keep on going, but we got to start off with this one.  
  
Q. You guys watched film of Wisconsin. What stands out about Ethan Happ
and Nigel Hayes, is this one of the better post games, two of the better
inside players you're going to be facing this year?  
ZACH LEDAY: I say they have very unique games. Happ likes to back you down and
get you under the basket. He's really good as pivoting and going different
ways. He's a good defender as well. Gets a lot of steals. He leads the team in
a lot of categories. Hayes is very versatile. He likes to do a lot. Bring the
ball up. He can rebound, shoot the mid range to three-pointers. He can get on
the glass. I say what's big for us is just keeping them off the glass,
contesting our shots, not falling for the moves, and just keeping them off the
glass. I think that we'll be fine if we do that.  
  
Q. When you watched the Wisconsin on film, do they remind you of anybody
you played with? Is it like playing Virginia, maybe or anybody you dealt with
before?  
SETH ALLEN: They're similar to Virginia. They're like a Big Ten version of
Virginia, kind of. Being that they play slower than most teams, they kind of
want to control and play at their own pace. Part of that is how they play.
Part of it is, like, the style of play they have. And they have, like, two
really good post men, so throwing it in and playing off the post takes
patience, and they want to guard you for long, so you can't take quick shots
against them.  
  
They're a really tough team, kind of similar to Virginia, except they play a
little bit more one-on-one ball than Virginia does. They throw it in in just
space and let him go to work whereas Virginia coming off down screens and just
try to lull you to sleep a lot.  
  
Q. Is this a -- because of their size and all that, is this a tough
match-up. You say oh, I think we'll shoot threes against these guys, it's not
going to be too bad? What is your assessment how tough a game this might be
for you or not?  
SETH ALLEN: I think we just got to go into it playing our game. Part of it,
you want to know what the other team does. You want to know how they play, but
you can't bend towards their style. You got to just enforce how we play. And
we play fast, we play hard, we play against each other, we play smart. So, I
think that's really what's most important going into tomorrow night. Are we
going to play like Virginia Tech or is Wisconsin going to control the pace,
and we're going to play it their style?  
  
Q. Everyone is obviously very excited on Sunday, when you guys got in.
What's been the mood of the team like since we last saw you on Sunday? What's
it been like at the hotel the last few days?  
THE MODERATOR: Everybody is looking at you, Zach.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: You know, we've just been going, going crazy, running up and down
the halls -- no, I'm playing. But everybody was very happy when we got in. We
wanted to see where we were going. We saw we was going to Buffalo and it was
snowing and stuff. That was cool. I'm from Texas, so I don't really see no
snow like that.  
  
After we found out where we got in, everybody was all business then.
Everybody's been watching film. Even the young boys been watching film, just
watching how Wisconsin plays. I think I watched six or seven other games. I
watched the Michigan game, like, three times in, like, the past two days. So,
I mean everybody is just watching film and just getting ready for the match-up
and just trying to get used to tendencies and stuff like that and trying to
get an advantage. That's important, trying to get an advantage on your
opponent in a short amount of time in a tournament like this. That's what
everybody has been doing. That's what I think, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Zach, Seth, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Joined now by Virginia Tech head coach, Buzz Williams. Coach, welcome to
Buffalo. Great to have your team here. Go ahead and open up with questions. If
you please raise your hand, we'll get a microphone you to. Please give your
name and affiliation before you ask the first question.  
  
Q. Hello, Buzz. I know you've had some days to look at Wisconsin. How do
you go about defending big guys like Happ and Hayes, especially for a team
that wants to avoid getting in foul trouble?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. It will be a constant stress for us. I don't know that we
have a simple answer, and I don't know if one answer is sufficient. I think
we'll have to do multiple things. Both of those guys are better than our guys.
Both of them can get you in foul trouble. Both of them are very good one-on-
one scorers. They have three really good one-on-one scorers, but within 15, 16
feet, both of those two guys are really good.  
  
Q. Buzz, you mentioned Sunday night that your job is kind of to get
these guys not to be satisfied with the participation trophy and want to hang
around a little while. Have you been satisfied with the level of focus that
they've had between having a little bit of fun and enjoying the experience and
dealing with the task at hand, or will you really have that answer until 9:40
tomorrow night?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I think the only way to judge it, Norm, is daily. I think
their concentration level has been superb. I don't want to be a task master as
a coach, relative to not being satisfied, while at the same time, this is a
memory of a lifetime for them. So, I hope that what I said didn't come across
in a negative way. But I also think that it is part of my job, part of my
role, to push them to be their absolute best. And that doesn't mean that we're
going to win every game.  
  
But since Sunday night, we had to abort our original travel plan because of
the weather. I thought they handled that well. We've become the most diverse
program ever, relative to altered travel plans, so they kind of thought it was
normal. But our two practices here, and our three film sessions thus far have
been outstanding. And I think that things change when you're playing games
after spring break, because guys understand the magnitude of what it is, even
if they haven't done it. As best they can, they understand that something
about this is different, and I think our guys have been really good.  
  
Q. I was just curious as to why you brought Zach and Seth off the bench,
what went into that decision, and, more importantly, what has it given you,
because us it must have given you something because you stuck with it?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, it started in the right way. We scrimmaged South Carolina
on the last Saturday of October, and in the first ten minutes, as you would
expect playing a team coached by Frank, Seth got hurt. So we then -- that was
on a Saturday. The Thursday before our second scrimmage, which was at George
Mason, Zach got an offensive rebound which is rare, and got hit in the head
and obviously, they're making movies about concussions now, and so he was out
for the next 14 days.  
  
Our first game was the second Friday in November. Seth was healthy by then.
Zach wasn't healthy by then. But both had missed a lot of practice, and so it
just started, as it would for anybody else. And I think what's happened is
Khadim, our freshman center, who starts, was forced into that role, and I
think he's handled it fairly well. And it's probably kept Zach out of more
foul trouble than we would have anticipated.  
  
For Seth, because he's a ball guard, he can play any position, so it -- we've
only suited up eight guys all year long, but the last eight games we've suited
up seven, so, there wasn't ever a lot of maneuverability, but over the last
eight games there's been zero maneuverability. And as it transpired, Tom, what
I mentioned to our team was, I think it was best for our team and it was right
in how it started, but as it evolved and morphed into something else, I
thought it was a great example of what I want our program to be and that's to
be selfless.  
  
So two red-shirt seniors, the two oldest kids on the team, you can argue the
two most productive players on the team, the only guys that would be
considered in some sort of stretch to get an All Conference vote of some sort,
and they're both coming off the bench. And in an unspoken way -- and you're
the only one that's ever had the sense to ask -- -I kind of like that I get to
answer it on this stage, because I think it speaks to the fabric of what we
want to be about.  
  
Q. On a lighter note, we had Coach Huggins in here earlier, and he was
talking about the origin of his game-day dress is he was sweating a lot in a
suit at halftime and decided I'm going to do what I'm going to do. Your
battles with this have been well-documented, and I was wondering if you ever
considered going that route?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Coach is a first ballot Hall-of-Famer. He'll be the next guy
that's in the Hall of Fame that's still employed as a coach. There's only
three of those left in our world, in college basketball, and he's one of them.
Coach can wear wherever he wants to wear. Where I'm from, the way I was
brought up, you should always tuck your shirt in, and you should always tie
your shoes, and if for some reason you ever get a job that requires a college
degree, it's the most respectful thing to start out in a tie. And so it's
partly, mostly, just because of how I was raised. And if I had as much equity,
and I never will, as Coach Hugs, I might get that company that sponsors him
with the pullover, I might do the same thing.  
  
Q. Buzz, you're dealing with a bunch of guys on your team that haven't
been in the NCAA Tournament, don't know what it's like. Wisconsin has two guys
in Koenig and Hayes that have played in 14 NCAA tournament games and 11 wins.
Is that a legitimate concern, or do you think that experience is overblown?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No. I don't think it's overblown at all. Four of five starters
in some capacity or another, have played in a Final Four, played in a National
Championship game, played in a Sweet 16. We have a roster full of guys who,
tomorrow night, that will be their first time ever playing on a court that has
an NCAA blue sticker on it. We can't compare to the job that Coach Ryan and
Coach Gar have done, nor the experience that their rosters has.  
  
I think when you look at how Wisconsin has played, what were they, 7-5 when
Greg took over? And then it went -- that was December 15th after Corpus
Christi, they were 7-5 and they ran it to 9-9, and then they end up in the
Sweet 16 and coach Alvarez has to hire him and they go to the Sweet 16. And
then they beat Syracuse, they beat Oklahoma, two Final Four teams from last
year, in nonconference play. They beat Georgetown. They beat Carolina, didn't
they? Played Carolina but lost, right. And then started 10-1 in nonconference
play.  
  
I mean, obviously, I've loved Coach Ryan forever and I've known Coach Gard
since 15 years ago, but I think the consistency of the program and what
they've meant, the Hokies, we're not even in that same sphere.  
  
Q. Buzz, we know you love your football coach?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: You have to introduce yourself, please. When I get fired, I'm
going to do that.  
  
Q. You have to wear a suit for that anyway?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I can wear a pullover.  
  
Q. Was it special for you to meet with Sean McDermott? We saw you got to
go to the Bills' facility and what did he tell you that particularly captured
your attention?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. I have way more football coaching friends than I do
basketball coaching friends, and for whatever reason, because of kind of how
those relationships started, I've been able to develop really sound
relationship us with multiple NFL guys. I love Coach McDermott's story, right?
He's 42 and he started in the lowest position you can in Philly for Andy Reid,
who's a first ballot Hall-of-Famer, and I thought it would be cool for our
guys to see an NFL facility. But the way that it all started, because I don't
have a personal relationship with Coach McDermott is, as a former manager,
I've always taken great pride in the managers that we have had within our
programs, and a former manager from Marquette is the assistant to the head
coach. It was the first person that Coach McDermott hired.  
  
And so we now have two guys in the NBA that are former managers, one guy in
Major League Baseball and one guy in the NFL, and all of them were awful as
managers, but I'm proud of what they've become as adults. So, that's how it
all started. It was really cool. I did not expect Coach McDermott to spend
time with our team but he said what you think he would have said with more
power and gusto because he's an NFL -- he's one of 32 guys in the world that
does what he does.  
  
Q. Buzz, having played Wisconsin when you were at Marquette all those
years, in preparing for this game, did that help, I guess? Are they pretty
much running the same stuff than they did under Beau?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: These two guys can probably answer that better. I do think that
it's helped. It was like the Cowboys and Redskins on Thanksgiving day every
time Marquette played Wisconsin. There are similarities in what they do, and
how they do it. I would say that their practice itineraries are somewhat
similar. There are also unique differences. Part of it is because of their
personnel. Part of it is probably what Greg is infusing into the program, that
is his own beliefs. Not that that would be negative to Coach Ryan, but there's
for sure similarities.  
  
Going back and looking at all of my notes and practice plans and all of that
stuff in the six times we've played them, I didn't do that at the start
because I didn't want that infiltrating my brain as I was studying them for
this year. But I looked at it all yesterday, and there are -- I showed our
players our practice plans, and see, I've already told you this, and, look, I
was saying that in 2012, too. So, there are for sure similarities.  
  
Q. Buzz, I don't need to tell you that you surprised a lot of people
when you left Marquette to take on this challenging rebuild. Here you are
years three, you're in the NCAA Tournament. Is that time line about what you
expected? Are you ahead of schedule?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. I don't know. I've never been smart enough to answer that
question. Obviously it's been asked a lot. The first thing I would say,
Marquette completely changed my children's lives and forever I will be
grateful. They hired me -- I don't know many A.D.s and presidents that will
hire a head coach with a losing record, particularly a losing record after
only one season, particularly when they hire him, and it's eight months
removed from him resigning from that one-year losing record.  
  
So, I know it's been maybe said and described in different ways. I've -- in
the right way, I want to process it all, because I don't think that it's all
me. But all of the things that were written in both of your papers in the
Journal Sentinel, I have zero negative to say about anybody, or any day that I
was employed at Marquette, incredibly grateful.  
  
The next thing I would say specific to the time line, the time line as of
today is 1,090 days, if you were counting at home, and there's no way that you
can be an agent of change as a single person in an organization and think that
it will ever change. Dr. Sands had been there three months before I was hired,
Whit Babcock, our A.D. has been there two months before I was hired.
Selfishly, I liked that I was the first major sports hire because they want
that to work. But I think that in order to get to this point, in this league
that we've competed in -- we finished in last place in year one. That was the
fourth consecutive year that they had finished in last place, and multiple
media outlets said I committed career suicide.  
  
The thing was, I had a history of people saying that, because that's what had
happened when I resigned at New Orleans, and it's always -- not gratifying.
It's always another lesson for me that maybe what's written is not completely
always the truth. But what can be quantified, other than words, are the hearts
of people that care, and what's happened at Virginia Tech is just a lot of
people care. That's it.  
  
And the 13 NCAA Tournament games we played at Marquette before I was 40 years
old, that happened not because of me, not because of Jimmy Butler, Jae
Crowder, it's not that. It was a lot of people that cared. That's it. And I've
never looked at the job as, well, by this day, we'll be successful, or by this
day we'll be successful. This time last year, we were playing in the N.I.T.,
and I can't tell you how humbled I was by that. It was only the third time in
the history of the ACC that there had been an eight game improvement. In the
history of, in my opinion, one of the best leagues ever, that there had been
an eight game improvement. But it was the first time that that had happened
from the last-place team and we did it in our second year.  
  
This year's team we'll only suit up seven and we've made multiple decisions to
red-shirt guys because I believe it was right for their life not because we
were making a push to go to the NCAA Tournament. So, to be in this position,
I've never looked at it on a day basis. I've looked at it on, today, did we do
what was right to be sustainable for their lives in the long term? That's it.
And it's not me. It's not Seth Allen. He's average at best. He's not received
an All Conference vote. Zach LeDay, he's below average at best. He has
received one All Conference vote in two years.  
  
So there's 14 other head coaches, so that's 28 opportunities for a vote. He's
got one out of 28. So, you -- then how did it work? That's just a lot of
people doing a lot of work for the right reasons in the intent of their heart
is right.  
  
Q. Hey, Buzz. It's documented that you and Frank Beamer have a great
relationship. Have you talked to him since Sunday and has he given new any
advice going into this game?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I love coaches in general, particularly old coaches. Old people
seem to think I'm kind of like one of those wind-up toys. You just wind him up
and there he goes. Coach has been great to me from the very beginning. I met
Coach before my press conference at Virginia Tech, and since he's retired, I
would say our relationship has increased by 100 percent and that's because he
has nothing to do other than watch "Ellen" every day.  
  
So, I think that he just -- he's more aware of what's going on, and I've been
overly kind to him on purpose, because I want somebody to do that to me. If I
ever am able to get to that point -- what most people that are retired say, is
make sure that you spend more time with your family and love them the way
they're deserving of it. And the next thing is, enjoy the moment so because
it's so hard to get.  
  
Q. Do you have a second-half outfit in case you sweat through your suit
tomorrow?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I always do. I did it in year one and year two. What I tried to
do is incorporate vests, so that the sweating -- I mean this in the right way.
It's the silliest thing ever, right? When you get your car fixed, does the
mechanic sweat? You know, the guy that builds your house, the carpenter, I
think he sweats.  
  
And I know it's funny, and I know I'm not the best looking guy in the world,
but I'm just working real hard. That's it, you know? And I know it's turned
into such a -- it's beyond silly to me, to be honest. Semi-offensive, right?
All I want to do is help our guys as much as I can. If that means I sweat, who
cares. That's kind of the way I feel, so I just wear a vest so it doesn't
become viral on Twitter.  
  
Q. Buzz, you mentioned Sunday that playing Wisconsin is kind of like
playing Virginia. How has that maybe been beneficial to you guys this week
maybe in preparation?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, they would be the only team that we've played that's
similar in philosophy, relative to pace of play, relative to their defensive
thoughts. This Wisconsin team throws it inside much more than this Virginia
team, but that's personnel-specific. Last year, Virginia's team threw it
inside much more. This will be -- Wisconsin's played 34 games, and three of
their 34 games, they've had 70 possessions, three. This will be our 30 -- we
played 32 games, and we've had 15 games that have had 70 or more possessions.
The three games for Wisconsin that have had 70 possessions in it were all in
overtime. And so just that in and of itself is very UVA like.  
  
You know, when we played Virginia the second time, they were -- pace-of-play
relative-wise -- I don't say any of this to be negative -- they were the
second slowest team in the country. Well, we're not fast, but we're for sure,
not comfortable, let's play it real slow and walk it up. And so I think that
will be a lot of the game. At UVA they just destroyed us on the offensive
glass. When you're playing a team that's as slow as they are, when they get a
second opportunity, well you're just going to guard them for 30 more seconds.
And their offense helps their defense, right? A team that plays as slow as
they do, their defense is always going to be good, because on offense, they
hold the ball, sort of, if that's the right way of saying it.  
  
And so I just told our guys, it's -- UVA, they just happen to wear red, and
they have really good players that have experience this time of the year in
winning.  
  
Q. Bill Dyer is here from the athletic communications office of Virginia
Tech. He can assist you --  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Why don't we bring Dyer up and let them ask questions of Dyer.
You sweat too, Dyer.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by West Virginia University student-athletes. At
the far end Nathan Adrian, Jevon Carter, Elijah Macon, Tarik Phillip. Same
rules apply. Raise your hand, we'll get a microphone you to. State your name
and affiliation and ask questions of West Virginia student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hey, for any/all of you guys, as you may know, there are certain
advanced metrics, advanced analytics. They all rate you guys. Top 15, top 5
team in the country. Are you aware of that? Do you talk about it? Does it make
an impact on you?  
JEVON CARTER: I would say we're aware of it. We don't really pay too much
attention to it. We've still got to go out and play basketball, no matter what
anyone says, so it don't really mean anything.  
  
Q. Start with Nate, as you and Tarik as senior, is there a different
feel for this NCAA Tournament as there have been for the last couple?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. A little bit. We lose this time, I'm done forever. So
you've got to come in with a little bit of a different attitude than what you
did before. Still got to go out and play the same game, so we will.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: To take off what Nate said, same thing. It's our last go-
around, so we got to leave it all on the floor.  
  
Q. For Tarik and Jevon, kind of wondering the three-point shot for
Bucknell is a big part of their game, obviously a big part of their game plan
to try to even the game out tomorrow. Just wondered, how do you defined that?
What do you see from the three-point shooters?  
JEVON CARTER: It's like playing Iowa State. Iowa State's got a lot of
shooters, spread the court. They got a big man inside, so they go in a lot.
We're just going to play our game. We're going to do what we do, try to speed
them up, turn them over, make them uncomfortable and run them off the three.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: We just got to locate shooters, know who you're guarding at
certain times. If you've got a shooter, you can't leave him too wide open, and
as he said, run them off the line.  
  
Q. For Tarik, how do you -- does anybody bring up the memories of what
happened last year in Brooklyn?  
TARIK PHILLIP: It's been brought up several times, but the taste is still in
our mouths, Coach's mouths, players' mouths. We don't try to dwell on it too
much, but it's still in the back of our mind that we lost in the first round
to a team we should have beat, so --  
  
Q. Elijah, their big, does he remind you of anybody? Looks like he's
good inside, has good touch with both hands. What do you think of him and who
does he remind you of?  
ELIJAH MACON: Just playing against guys like Jarrett Allen and Jonathan
Motley, just guys that like to get to their right shoulder a lot, just got to
be physical, keep them off the glass. Just take them out of the game and
everything will flow easier for us.  
  
Q. Can one of you guys give a little insight into what Huggins is like.
I mean, there's one thing when he's in practice and he's intense. In the game,
we see what you experience, then there's a different side to him.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. Hugs is a two-sided person. There's what people see and
what people perceive him to be and then what he actually is, and that's an
extremely loyal, kind-hearted guy, honestly. I mean, he cares about us more
than anyone I've ever known, any coach I've seen or been around. He's
definitely a different guy than what you think.  
  
Q. Elijah, can you answer that also and just explain a little bit the
contrast between him? What's it like dealing with him when he gets heated
up?  
ELIJAH MACON: I mean, kind of like a father figure, you know? Somebody, you
got to take him serious. I mean, he wants to win. Just a fire in his belly, he
just trying to put it inside of us. We're reading off of him, going off how he
feels. Like if he's mad, then we should be mad. If he's having a good day, the
we should have good day. I just feel like that's how it's been.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that Elijah, what's his mood right now? Is he
mad? Is he happy? What is his mood?  
ELIJAH MACON: I mean, just from me seeing and talking to him, he's been pretty
calm. Just trying to figure out the team, what we're going to do. We're trying
to figure out from scouting what we're going to do from the game. He's been
pretty calm from what I've seen, from what I've talked to him. Not knowing --
you know, not saying he's not mad. But he's real relaxed, just sit back and
watching.  
  
Q. What's the scare when he had the heart problem on the bench. How did
that go through the team and how did you react to that? It's only been like
three weeks ago.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: He's obviously had heart problems for a while now, but it's
something he's lived with. It's happened to him a couple times before. You
know, it's kind of scary whenever you don't really know what it is. All of us
are just walking back to the bench, and you turn back around and he's on the
ground. I don't know. Kind of fired us up and we played well for the rest of
the game, tried not to get him too mad at us anymore. Give him a little rest.  
  
Q. Tarik, you talked about after the Big 12 championship, you said
practices last year weren't what you wanted them to be leading up to the game.
How has it been dealing with travel and that sort of thing? What was the last
few days like leading up to this one maybe compared to a year ago?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Traveling ain't really been much of an issue for us. Practice,
there's been a lot of energy in practice. I feel like the players have been
more dialed in, locked in to knowing their scout, knowing their plays. There's
been a lot of energy in practice.  
  
Q. If I could ask similarly of Elijah, it seems this year, when you guys
are about to play a good game you feel it, and when you're about to play a bad
game, you know that too because of what happened in practice the days leading
up. What do you look for? What are the keys when you are readily as opposed to
when you're not?  
ELIJAH MACON: I just feel like if everybody is talking before the game, I just
feel like if it's too quiet before the game, nobody is like communicating with
each other, I feel like if we're not being goofy, if we're not being
ourselves, then I don't feel like we're ready to play. When I see everybody
relaxed, I feel we're ready to go out and compete. If everybody is too tense,
they're thinking about the game too much. If we're walking around and having
fun, and getting our warm-up, and everybody making shots, I feel that's when
we perform at our best.  
  
Q. Question for Nate. Nate, in your four years at WVU, obviously being
from Morgantown and having a good connection with WVU, you've kind of come a
long way. Not only in your game but the way people have perceived you. You
know, your senior year, you got guys in the student section, they got all the
headbands and stuff like that. It seems like people have really gravitated
toward you now as a senior. Can you just talk about how the progression has
gone for you when you first came in until now?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think people just recognize the work you put in. That's not
just me, it's any senior that comes in here. They're going to be -- some of
the fanfares because they've been there for four years, and people know what
they've done for four years. I wouldn't say anything is really different, it's
just being around for that long.  
  
Q. Have you seen the kids with the --  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yes, I have.  
  
Q. Are they ours?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I have no idea who they are.  
  
Q. Back to Huggins. He was there before, when you were a kid. So there
was some perception -- when you were coming out, was that a guy that you
absolutely -- just being from that area, you really, really wanted to play for
the guy, or was there any trepidation or what?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. That was the guy I wanted to play for. That's the kind of
person I want to play for. I want to play for someone who cares enough to get
fired up like that. I want to play for somebody who's that competitive, who
wants to win that bad. I don't know why anyone would want to play for anyone
else.  
  
Q. When you guys play tomorrow, key for you, is it the press, hitting
shots? What is it that you see that makes you play well, what aspect?  
JEVON CARTER: That's hard to say. Every game is different. I can't tell you
whether it's been the offensive end or defensive end. I just go play,
honestly. So, it's not really what am I doing, it's what are we doing as a
team, you know? I can't win a game for us. We all got to do it together. So,
it's not just about me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. I want to recognize Bryan Messerly,
over here on the left from West Virginia from their athletic communications
office. He's here to assist you in any other way with West Virginia student-
athletes and coaches.  
  
Gentlemen, thank you for your time today. Best of luck tomorrow against
Bucknell. We'll be right up with Coach Huggins.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by head coach Bob Huggins, West Virginia
University. Coach, welcome to Buffalo. Good to see you again here. We'll go
ahead and open to questions. If you raise your hand we'll get a microphone you
to.  
  
Q. Bob, what fond memories do you have of Buffalo from maybe seven years
ago, if any?  
BOB HUGGINS: Winning. We played pretty well in here. Actually, this is the
third time. We came in and played Canisius my first year, and of course
advanced from here to Syracuse, and had the epic game with Kentucky and
Syracuse to go to the Final Four.  
  
Q. In contrast, is it nice to be starting in Buffalo, a place where
you're familiar with and had some success as opposed to maybe erase some
memories of Brooklyn last year?  
BOB HUGGINS: We always want to go somewhere that has good weather. So, you
know, we were excited to hear you're going to get 20 inches of snow. Now, this
is -- we're really comfortable here, and, you know, I think it's great to play
in the city, but it's -- you know, the traffic and those kind of things, you
spend more time almost planning on getting there and getting back, and not
being late and those kind of things than you do really kind of preparing for
the game. I really like Buffalo. I actually came up here and went fishing. How
about that? I bet no other coach here has been fishing.  
  
Q. Sabres coach.  
Q. No. That's never happened here. You're the first.  
BOB HUGGINS: It's near and dear to myself.  
  
Q. It's funny when you say that. When you were here, I found you to be
fun, and funny and charming. I remember having a conversation about best
places to go for chicken wings and stuff like that. It's kind of like in
contrast of maybe what the perception is when people watch you coach, when you
see the intense, fired up, competitive Bob Huggins, a different Bob Huggins.
Is there any contrast -- how do you explain the difference in there?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, you probably don't want people bothering you when you're
writing a story.  
  
Q. This is true.  
BOB HUGGINS: So, you know, I mean, people see me in the workplace, you know?
It's like I told some guy one time, he screamed at me the whole game, you
know, over the rail and all that. I told him, how would you like me to go to
your place of work and scream and yell at you. When you're frying those French
fries at McDonald's, would you want me screaming at you?  
  
Q. So, simple question, Bob, where did you go fishing and how did you
do? When was this?  
BOB HUGGINS: Lake Erie, and it was terrific. Wasn't it Lake Erie? Yeah. Lake
Erie. It was terrific. Great small mouth fishing. You only have to go out half
a mile, maybe, if that. It was great. Then the other guys in the other boat
caught a bunch of walleye. So it was fun.  
  
Q. Somebody caught a sheepshead?  
BOB HUGGINS: We had a guy with us, that's all he caught.  
  
Q. I have a non-fishing question for you. Jevon Carter, what makes him
such an effective defensive player?  
BOB HUGGINS: He's very competitive, I think, first and foremost. He's probably
our most competitive guy, and he's got great feet. He really can move his
feet, and he studies, you know? He's a guy that, if you would ask him
schematically, what people are going to try to do, he knows. So, he's a little
ahead of the game, I think, in that regard.  
  
Q. You're probably aware that there's several kind of more advanced
analytics that routinely, and not even just this year, have West Virginia
ranked higher than, you know, some of the more conventional rankings, top 5,
top-10 team. I'm wondering if you're aware of that. I'm guessing you are, but
also if that's something you talk to the team about or if it's anything you
take anything away from?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think more educated people generally go that way. They think
much higher of the Mountaineers than the normal people do, but, yeah, I'm
aware of it. You can't hardly not be aware of it with everything that's out
there today. I don't really talk to our guys about it. You know, I talked to
them about not turning the ball over and trying to create some turnovers. I
think that's more important for us.  
  
Q. Coach, long season, some bumps and bruises at the end. How are you
guys health-wise going into this?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think other than Nate, we're pretty good. Nate's pretty banged
up. Other than him, I think we're pretty good. He'll play through it. He's a
tough guy. He'll figure out a way.  
  
Q. Follow up to that. Do you find seniors like Nate, do they have a
different purpose in an NCAA Tournament game knowing it's one and done?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think a lot of our guys do after last year. I mean, I was
very honest about the fact that I didn't think our practices were very good
leading in a year ago. I didn't -- I thought we kind of took Stephen F. Austin
for granted, and they were a really good team. That was a terrible mistake.  
  
This year, we've been much, much better, but I think probably, to a large
degree, of having so many of those guys back that went through the experience
a year ago.  
  
Q. Just an offbeat question, if I may. Are they -- as a team like them,
in an era of one-and-done, more equipped than a team built with more seniors,
more veterans? Have things changed because of the era we're in?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. I think kids have changed, certainly. I mean, we're
in -- I think, more than anything, it's instant gratification. You know, I
think that's -- when you sit and play games all day instead of being on a
playground playing, it's because you want instant gratification.  
  
We just don't -- I don't think guys spend as much time working at their craft
as maybe they used to. And we're fortunate. We got some throwback guys. Jevon
Carter, he's a throwback. He's like one of the old guys that would just rather
spend time in the gym than get on Playstation.  
  
Q. Bob, do you have any kind of relationship with Jay Wright at all?  
BOB HUGGINS: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. What's it like? How would you describe your relationship with him?  
BOB HUGGINS: I've known Jay for a long, long time. I mean, I know I don't look
like it, but I've been in this business 40 years, so I know everybody. And we
were in the same league for a long time. You know, I think a great time for
coaches to get together is at the league meetings. We get to spend a lot of
time socially together, eat together, you know, hang out together, so, yeah, I
know Jay well.  
  
Q. You respect him, obviously, I assume, as a coach, as a dresser?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, you know, I keep telling him, if I'd lose a little bit of
weight, he'd be the second-best looking coach out there, but to this point, I
haven't been able to do that. I think he's a heck of a coach. We had just
great games when we were both in the Big East. I mean, if you go back and look
at the scores, there were numerous overtime games. And I thought that the play
he drew up when they scored the lay-up to beat Pitt was -- you know, it's kind
of like an old football play. It's kind of like the kick-off when everybody is
lateralling it, you know?  
  
Q. Bob, just looking at West Virginia's numbers, I mean, the defense is
there with steals and creating turnovers. Are you in any way surprised by how
much offense you guys are putting up in 82 points a game, and what might that
be a reflection of?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we get so many more shots. You know? I think the key for us
is getting more shots than our opposition, and, you know, the more shots we
get, the better off we're going to be. We need to create turnovers and we need
to rebound the ball. And if we do those things, we're going to get more shots
than our opposition.  
  
And then I think, you know, the other thing that we haven't done a very good
job of at times is make free throws. But at times, we have; at times, we've
been very good at the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Someone brought up your dress, and obviously, you've spoken in the
past about when you decided to stop wearing the suit. When you still did wear
the more conventional coaching outfit, did you wear a tie? Because I note that
Mike Brey is also a coach who does not wear a tie.  
BOB HUGGINS: Yeah. I used to wear a tie. I did the whole deal. I mean, I had
tie, vest, I mean the whole deal. Probably if you look at pictures of me and
Jay early, I was probably better looking back then. Probably dressed better
back then. I had been doing it longer, had more money. I just kind of -- do
you want to hear the whole story? The whole story is this. I had a suit and
tie on, and we're playing somebody, and I'm at Cincinnati, and I go in, and
I'm like I got to put something different on, because I had sweat all of the
way through my suit and my vest. They were heavy.  
  
So they brought me in a pullover, and I put it on and coached the second half
in a pullover, and I was walking in, my A.D. said, I just want to tell you
look really good in that pullover. That's what really coaches should wear. So
I started wearing one. Which was good until I got the new president, and the
A.D. denied saying I looked good in a pullover. So, be careful who you trust,
is the moral of that story.  
  
Q. Bob, how are you feeling these days after that scare from a couple
weeks ago?  
BOB HUGGINS: I feel great. I really do. I've been through a battery of tests,
and everything's good. I don't really want that defibrillator to go off again,
though. Because it -- I've never been kicked by a mule, but I could imagine
it's pretty much the same. But I feel good. I actually feel like I have more
energy now than I did at some other points in time in the season.  
  
Q. And how much -- you talked about the experience of last year. How
much more do you think that this team is more prepared, knowing what you went
through and maybe took the opponent for granted? Do you think that was a
learning experience going that this tournament and do you even need to bring
up Brooklyn?  
BOB HUGGINS: No. We really don't. Well, I guess if we -- if I think we're
starting to have a bad practice, I guess we bring it up a little bit. But, no,
I think a lot of people didn't think we would be near as good as we were
losing Devin Williams, you know, declared early, and Jaysean Paige who was an
All-League player for us. Those two in particular, I think a lot of people
didn't think we would be where we are today.  
  
It's a tribute to our guys, and our guys do work. I'll say that about them.
They do work. They do get in the gym, they have improved, and they're, for the
most part, fun to coach. I think they would probably tell you I'm fun to play
for most of the time and they're fun to coach most of the time, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: They did say that, actually.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: They did? I'm sure they did. I've got about 175 assistant coaches
out there that never worked for me to thank for that. Because they're all the
time telling people you can't play for him. He's too hard on you, this and
that. I thank those guys all of the time, because then I get guys that kind of
want to get coached. So those guys that think they're killing us are really
helping me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Huggins?  
  
Seeing none, Coach, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Mitch Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27884)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined at this time by the head coach of Princeton,
Mitch Henderson. Same rules apply. Please raise your hand if you have a
question. Please give your name and affiliation and we'll go ahead and get
started with questions for Coach. Let's start up front here with John.  
  
Q. Hi, Mitch. Given your success that you had as a player at Princeton,
how much can you draw upon, you know, the upsets that you were part of, and
going into tomorrow's game, you know, where -- given where you're seeded?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Just a little. I think, that the preparation, when going into
the tournament game, is to remember that it's a game, and how you respond to
each moment throughout the course of the game. You've got to do your thing.
Coach Carril, I remember distinctly before we played UCLA, said, and he used
to say this all of the time, I'm preparing you to win the game.  
  
When the ball went out against UCLA, we all ran back on defense, all five of
us. We're not going to do that. I understood his point. This team understands
that as well. We're giving them every opportunity to win.  
  
Q. You know, you lost two key guys to injury this year, and a lot of
people didn't necessarily think you'd be sitting where you are, what did --
not just you do to kind of get everybody back together, but what did your
players do?  
MITCH HENDERSON: We had a meeting after we lost at home to St. Joe's. Pete
Miller, one of our seniors, said, one sentence, but to the group, we're going
to start guarding and we're going to win the Championship. And I've been in
meetings before where those words are said, and it doesn't ring as true. But
it was like -- it reverberated throughout all of us. We went up to Monmouth
and played a tough game. It was a very high-scoring game, and then our pace
slowed down. I think that was the key, one of the keys, for us.  
  
We played at Bucknell, and I think a really quality road win. I know they're
here. And the emergence of Myles and Devin for. Myles being a particularly
great two-way player, I think anywhere. He can guard multiple different
positions. That was it. Didn't see us going on a 19-game streak, but I really
thought at that Monmouth game, that we're going to be just fine.  
  
Q. Yeah, two questions. First, can you talk about sort of appreciation
that you have, sort of a game caught up to Coach Carril's -- co-opted a lot of
Coach Carril's principles how to play the game, first. And secondly, I heard
you quoted your experience of going against Butler teams, how that influenced
you to maybe -- my sense is, be more flowing, a little less rigid on run this
play, and that play?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Go ahead?  
MITCH HENDERSON: I'll answer the second one first. We played Butler at Butler.
When they went to the final game with Gordon Hayward as a sophomore and those
guy, and then we played in the second year -- I'm sorry. He was a freshman and
then we played them the second year, the first time we went to the final game,
and we got rolled both times at Northwestern, I mean I thought we did.  
  
I remember they were on everything we were doing. This had happened a couple
times. In fact, it happened to us in the second round of the NCAA Tournament
when we played Michigan State and I felt like -- and this was just me -- if we
were going to prepare to beat the very best teams on our schedule, that we
needed to be a little less guardable, less predictable, more flowing. And that
started really with recruiting. And it -- this wasn't like an overnight
decision. It happened with the players that were arriving.  
  
And I think that Myles Stephens is kind of an example of that, a very
versatile two-way player that's made a major impact. When you see them, you're
not going to say he looks just like every single Princeton basketball player
I've ever seen. Locally and within the league, we fought the stigma of
Princeton offense. It's gone for us. Nationally people are going to find out
that we don't play like that.  
  
The principles -- which answers the first part of the question -- good
spacing, good players, and take good shots. We don't have an aversion to the
three-point line. We're taking them. A lot of people like to point out we take
a lot of them. I guess we do, and we want to see it go in. It's a valuable
shot in this game especially when you can go inside and out. I think it
stretches the defense. And when you put five guys on the floor that make a
shot, everybody is playing with a pick-and-pop five or a four, including Notre
Dame, and it's very hard to guard. We've been playing like that for ever.  
  
Q. Mitch every student-athlete is dealing with some academic pressures,
challenges right now. What about the fact that some of your players are going
through mid-terms right now and what are the challenges that they face, and
also, how much added workload was put on your players, given the fact that you
have to play in the Ivy League inaugural tournament?  
MITCH HENDERSON: It was another extra -- it was an extra week where normally
you could be relaxing, potentially, and balancing your week. But we play
Fridays, Saturdays, in our league. And we talked right in the spring, really,
with the returning players, and then in the fall we meet, and the seniors and
the juniors walk through their schedule and how they balance it. In fact,
Steve Cook is one of the best guys at balancing his schedule and he goes
through his planner on Sunday nights and he says this is how I do it. The
freshmen sit there and their jaws drops down. I can't believe this -- you've
got a minute schedule, instead of taking a 45-minute lunch it's a half-hour
lunch. I don't think you can to that until you we walk through it yourself.  
  
This is normal for us. I think we have close to 20 mid-terms this week between
the team. This morning, I got down -- we have two rooms in the hotel and one
room is for studying. Half the team was in there at 8:00 a.m. This is what we
do. And when they get out here, we always talk to them about be where you are.
So, when we walk out there, we're going to be flying around. And then when we
go back to the hotel, we study.  
  
Q. Mitch, how difficult is Bonzie Colson as a match up, not just for you
but to for anyone out there?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. He's a very underrated player. I worked with Craig
Robinson a long time at Northwestern. Craig was a terrific player at
Princeton. I always teased Craig, he had, from the feet to the hips, he was,
like, 7 feet tall, and then he had sort of a -- he was -- that's how Bonzie
is. He's proportioned in a way that makes him very difficult to guard and if
you've played, you can kind of understand that. He presents a lot of problems
for everyone that guards him because he's shifty. People say it's an old-man
game. We have a player and Spencer Weisz, people describe as playing older. I
think it's just great basketball. He's terrific at kind of every part of the
game, great rebounder, he picks-and-pops. We're going to have to guard him
with multiple different guys.  
  
We've had success in our league, there's multiple teams that played with a
very skilled five. With that said, we haven't seen anybody like him. We know
it's a challenge. We're ready for it.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you have a lot of mature players and I'm sure Devin
Cannady fits right into that category. What's your level of concern with the
emotions he might be facing playing against his home town team that he knows
those players, Demetrius Jackson used to be a teammate and I don't believe
Notre Dame offered him a scholarship?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. That -- I think a year ago, I would have been -- had
maybe a high level of concern, but Devin's grown so much with the loss of the
two seniors in a leadership position, and he's going to have to maintain a
level head. You know, there's always a game within the game and Devin has --
he's a light bulb of a kid. He comes into the gym and I always tell everybody,
right before he takes the floor, he says Mishawaka, as loud as he can, which
is where he went to high school and it's right next to Notre Dame.  
  
I think whatever you need to use to get motivated, I think you should use it.
Devin, he doesn't need much.  
  
Q. It's actually Mishawaka Marian?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Mishawaka Marian. Yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you can talk about who, which teams both
past and present, starting probably with the Princeton teams of Pete Carril,
but not ending there, inspire you guys' offense which tends to be more free-
flowing which frankly remind me of some NBA teams than college teams?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Good. I'll go with an NBA comparison. You were going to say
the Warriors?  
  
Q. Whatever you say?  
MITCH HENDERSON: I'm sort of repeating myself, probably, but we start off with
round three, and three guys playing together, one guy being kind of a post.
So, we've played that this way for a long time, but Coach Kittles who is on
staff, called it the modern game. This is the modern game. When he was playing
in the NBA in the 2000s, they were running some of the Princeton stuff, we've
modernized it, and we've just moved it away from the basket a little bit more.
We've had great centers, true five centers.  
  
And with this team, we're a little bit more on the perimeter, but we're
playing through posts. Spencer is a post, Myles is a post. Pete Miller. Will
Gladson comes in as a bigger post. And I think we've found ways to highlight
the strengths of the group. Draymond Green, I coached against Draymond when I
was an assistant when he was at Michigan State. He didn't take a lot of
threes, but he's developed and become a great passer. A lot of guys at
Princeton will say, I didn't know I was a great passer, and then you graduate
with a ton of assists.  
  
We ask them all of the time, what do you see, what do you see? Don't you see
that? You got to work on that part of your brain. I think that's as much as
what it is as anything else, is learning how to adjust your thinking.  
  
That's a rhetorical question, usually, I don't want them to answer it. What do
you see? I know you thought you saw it. This is what you're supposed to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach? Okay, Princeton tips off at 12:15
against Notre Dame. A reminder that Andrew Boarders right here in front is the
sports information director at Princeton and he can help you with any other
questions that you might have. Coach, good luck tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Wisconsin student-athletes, far right, to
my far right. Ethan Happ, Nigel Hayes, and Bronson Koenig. Gentlemen, welcome
to Buffalo. We'll go ahead and take questions, please raise your hand. We'll
get a microphone so our student-athletes know who we're talking to.  
  
Q. Nigel, you heard them introduce you as student-athletes. What does
being a student mean you to?  
NIGEL HAYES: That we just participate in school, yeah. I don't know. It's just
-- it's funny, but it's a term, so --  
  
Q. Bronson, you guys have obviously been seeded far better in past
tournaments. How much does that make a difference to you, you guys, coming
into this tournament. Is this something you feel like you need to prove you're
incorrectly seeded coming into this one?  
BRONSON KOENIG: No, sir. I feel as a program, we've always been kind of
underestimated. It doesn't really matter to us. It's nothing new. We are just
looking to go, get a win, play our game.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, the Big Ten seedings weren't great coming into
this tournament. I know it's about Wisconsin and going as far as you guys can
go, but do you take some -- I don't know, does it piss you off a little bit
that the Big Ten gets seeds like they got?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, I guess no. But at the same time, like we want the Big Ten
to do well. A lot of people from the outside said the Big Ten wasn't very
good, but really, it was just that there wasn't a lot of disparity from top to
bottom, so -- there's a lot of good teams. It's not just that -- it's just
that we didn't have one or two dominant teams throughout the Big Ten.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else?  
  
Q. For Ethan and Nigel, when you look at -- when you guys looked at
Virginia Tech and saw they don't have a lot of big guys, do you guys instantly
think, okay, this is going to be a fun game for us. We're going to pound it
inside, good luck trying to stop us. When you guys have a good inside game
like that, does it make you lick your chops when you see a game against a
smaller team?  
NIGEL HAYES: No. Not especially after you watch film. They have not as big
guys as us, but they shoot the three extremely well, and three is worth more
than two. They also are a good team which is why they're in the Tournament,
and the type of defense they play make it difficult where it's not just one-
on-one, where Ethan and I can take advantage of one of their smaller guys.  
  
So it's going to be a challenge. And the same way that you perceive they're
mismatched guarding us, they probably feel the same way. We have to go chase
them around the arc.  
  
Q. Ethan, do they compare -- did Virginia Tech compare to anybody you've
seen this year? Is there somebody you can sort of -- look at film of, and get
an idea what you're going to see?  
ETHAN HAPP: Not a team that has that many weapons, that shoot the ball that
well. But I guess the team that we just played, Michigan, is one that's kind
of identical in some of the stuff they run. Obviously having one through four
being able to shoot the three really well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you guys are clicking in games like the
Big Ten semifinals versus some of the losses you had later in the year, what's
the difference? What's clicking for you as opposed to winning, like when you
have some losses?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah. I think the difference is, just playing together,
playing as one unit, and having fun doing it. There's definitely a disparity
in games that, you know, where we lose compared to the ones that we win. We're
not sharing the ball, the ball is not popping around as much, we're not
playing inside, outside, which has kind of been our strength and our staple
all year, and allowing our defense to lead into our offense. That's the things
that we do in order to be successful.  
  
Q. Nigel, you guys are as tournament-tested a team as there is. What do
you think experience means in this tournament especially?  
NIGEL HAYES: I think it helps deal with the distractions that come with this.
It helps to deal with keeping your emotions in check. For instance, we have
the know Trice on our team, Bronson is our starting point good. Trice will be
filling his shoes once he's departed, so Bronson can share with him how to
deal with all the attention that comes with this, how to deal with your
emotions, how to go out there and and just play. I'm sure he'll be extremely
nervous for his first game in the tournament. It's a big deal.  
  
So we'll try to share that experience, that knowledge, and that comfort with
the rest of us knowing that we're here, we'll can fun, but at the same time,
we need to focus because we know we have a job to do.  
  
Q. As mentioned, you're one of the most tournament-tested teams. How is
each year fun and how is this year different from previous years?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, this year's fun, just because it's -- personally, it's
with a group of seniors I'm definitely going to miss next year. And I don't
want it to be my last game with them tomorrow, or even this week, so we want
to continue to play. And we have a lot of fun off the court as well, so that's
what makes it a special team. But I think that Nigel was on the money when he
said that us being in the tournament before, and those guys being in so many
other years definitely helps us with the emotional part of it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what makes Wisconsin such a good defensive
team overall and then why is maybe three-point deep, it's not a strong suit
compared to other parts of the defense?  
NIGEL HAYES: We practice defense all of the time. We do defense all of the
time, all of the time. That's what we do in practice, is practice defense. So
you're good at what you do often. Sometimes we get away from that in games and
those usually result in losses for us, so if we can get back to those
principles we worked on, we should be pretty good.  
  
And as far as the three-point percentage defensively not being that good, just
got to be better on our close-outs and contests. Got to get the toughs twos
that we want. Obviously the three is the most efficient shot to take, so we
need to definitely eliminate that against a team we're going to play tomorrow
that shoots 40% or higher from three as a team.  
  
Q. Ethan, where do you feel you've taken the most growth in your game
from freshman year to sophomore year? Where do you see the most improvement?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, I just feel like I'm getting more familiar with the game
itself. I mean, if you saw, at the beginning of last year, I was not very
good, and then I slowly got better with the more game experience I had. And
now having more game experience into this year, I think just having time on
the court, not only playing with my teammates, but also just seeing things,
what to do and what not to do. I mean, I think overall, I'm just trying to
take my game one step at a time to the next level, but we still got a long way
to go.  
  
Q. Okay. I want to recognize Patrick Herb who is over here on --
Patrick's here, the Wisconsin athletic communications director. He can help
you in any other needs you have with Wisconsin. That being said, thank you for
your time today. Good luck tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard. Coach, welcome
to Buffalo. Let's get started with questions at this time. Would you please
raise your hand? We'll get a microphone you to. And go ahead and get started.
Start right here.  
  
Q. This team has been to many tournaments, obviously. Have you noticed
anything different this time about how players are embracing it?  
GREG GARD: No. I don't think so. I mean, obviously, everybody that's in our
program has been to tournaments every year. I think that's something that we
constantly remind them of and make sure they don't take it for granted. To be
a program that's gone to 19 straight NCAA Tournaments is an astonishing
accomplishment. It's obviously a tribute to the players and coaches that have
been here before us.  
  
But that's one thing specifically with our younger guys that they understand
that it takes a lot of work to get here. But I haven't noticed anything
different. They've gone about the process the same way. I think they
appreciate where we're at, and this is a reward for having a really good
regular season.  
  
Q. Greg, Ethan was talking earlier about a comparison between Virginia
Tech and somebody you guys have already seen. He mentioned Michigan just
because of the number of shooters that Tech has and it's similar to what you
saw with Michigan. Is that a fair assessment and given that, is it a tough
match-up for you because you guys have struggled defending from the perimeter
at times?  
GREG GARD: I think it's a tough match-up because they're a good team.
Regardless of match-up, I think, when you get to this point in time in the
year, if you're still playing, consider yourself fortunate. Most likely your
opponent is going to be really good too. As I've said many times, all of the
average to bad teams are on spring break right now, so I think comparatively,
I don't know if there's anybody -- maybe some personnel things here and there.
Seth Allen reminds me a little about Derrick Walton from Michigan, just how he
controls the ball in ball screen situations and those type of things. But
we're probably built a little differently in most regards than a lot of teams
we've played. I'd have to go back through the non-conference and look at some
teams there.  
  
Buzz has done a heck of a job there in three years with how they share the
ball, the way they can spread the floor with obviously a lot of shooters.
That's going to put a stress on anybody regardless of any comparison or who
you've played in the past. We'll have to obviously be extremely sharp in terms
of rotations and things tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You obviously coached against Buzz a number of times when he was at
Marquette. How aware were you back then of his coaching quirks and oddities
that he built his representation on?  
GREG GARD: He's like Rain Man?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
GREG GARD: I knew back that in 2002. Did you talk to Buzz earlier in the week,
too? I just was with him for a little bit at our coaches meeting.  
  
But 2002, I'm a first-year assistant in Wisconsin and we're playing in a
tournament in Hawaii. Buzz at the time was at Colorado State as an assistant.
We got together in my hotel room to share scouting reports. They were going to
play LSU, we were going to playing Hawaii, so we were exchanging, third day in
the tournament, some notes and stuff. Just the questions he asked, and the
numbers he was pulling out of the air, you could tell he's was very
inquisitive, and very detail-oriented. I gave him a couple of those looks like
what the heck are you talking about?  
  
But obviously, 15, 16 years later, look where we're both at. I knew then --
not knowing really who he was. That was the first time I met him. Then
obviously years later, he ends up at Marquette, and then on to here -- or to
Virginia Tech. So, he was sweeping floors at JUCOs in Texas when I was
sweeping floors at junior highs in Wisconsin. So, he's had to work his way up.
He's had to do it the hard way. He hasn't had anything handed to him. I have
an appreciation for that because I think there's some similarity there's with
my career trek and the places you've coached at and embraced and loved. I know
he would say the same things about the places he's been at that are obscure
and nobody really knows they exist.  
  
You have an appreciation for that when you develop or come through those
ranks. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Buzz for how he's gone about
his career, and the places he's gone to and who he's coached with, and how
he's stuck with it and kept grinding. So, his number analytics are sometimes
over my head when he's pulling out those numbers.  
  
Q. And there's obviously a large disparity in tournament experience
between these two rosters. Do you see that play out at all on the court when
the game's happening or is it really being able to hand all of the outside
stuff?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I think you get to this point in time in the year. Experience
may have been a bigger thing back in November. Now we're through this point.
They've played through a rigorous conference schedule. We have too. We've both
seen tournament environments, so I think you can kind of throw that out.
They've got some guys that have some experience in game environments. I think
sometimes that's overblown because we've already played 30-some games each.  
  
It will be a matter of who does what they've done well all year better for the
40 minutes all night. They'll do the things they try to do and have been
successful at all year, and we'll try to counter with what we've been good at
all year.  
  
Q. In terms of what you've been good at all year, with the size
advantage you have against Virginia Tech, you just kind of lick your chops and
say let's pound the ball inside and see if we can take advantage of the size,
and try to get them into foul trouble?  
GREG GARD: They utilize what they do pretty well, in terms of their reaction
in the gaps and their ability to put pressure on the post. And they defend --
they throw some different defenses at you, mix some zone combinations in with
their man, some switching, and they will trap in the post here and there.  
  
So we try to attack in terms of, there's a plan going into it, but also, we
have to adjust to what is available, and that's why we like multi-dimensional
players that can play inside, outside, and do a variety of things, and try to
be a real balanced team and not be one aspect of the game or scoring
dependent. We always like to touch the post. That's been a constant, a
mainstay in our program for a long time. And that may be post players, it may
be via cuts, it may be via dribble attack. And Buzz's term is "paint touches,"
and ours is very similar in terms of we want to get the ball to that high
percentage area as much as we can.  
  
Q. Greg, even the Big Ten Tournament your bench came through the couple,
first two nights and last night didn't score. What do you think is the reason
for that inconsistency?  
GREG GARD: I think each game is a little different in terms of opportunities
that present themselves. The second day in the Big Ten Tournament we played
with a lead, so I was able to play a little deeper and intentionally give
those main guys a little more of a break. When you have a 25-point lead,
you're more likely to be able to play some guys down the stretch. I think,
that game maybe went to that a little bit more. I had to look at who could
take advantage of opportunities. Match-ups is one thing. Michigan, I just
didn't feel we got into enough of a rhythm to go a whole lot deeper on the
bench. I wanted to give our upper classman the best chance to try to get back
and get caught up and win that thing.  
  
So, it's a game-by-game decision in terms of who and how much. A lot of it is
personnel-driven. Basically what I'm seeing on the floor. And obviously, I
think Saturday's game, even to some extent Friday's game, because we had a
lead there, that I could be a little more flexible with guys I'm putting on
the floor.  
  
Q. Greg, as good as you guys have been on defense this year, three-point
defense maybe not as much of a forte. Why is that and what do you have to do
better in that regard against Virginia Tech perhaps?  
GREG GARD: I think one thing that kind of gets lost in the shuffle here is our
percentage at times gets higher, than maybe we would like it to be, but also
if you look at our attempts, they usually are the fewest. I think we give up
the second fewest threes in the Big Ten, second to Michigan. I look at it,
there's two ways to look at it. You look at percentage and how many threes
they're giving up. We try to run people off the line and minimize the
attempts. Probably I look at that more than what is the percentage that we're
giving up, and different teams play it different ways. We don't extend quite
as much so that allows -- sometimes we can compress things a bit more, and
sometimes that allows us to have a higher percentage shot against you, try to
take away other parts of the offense's ability.  
  
So I know our percentage -- I know where it ranks, but I also look at the
attempts given and there's a counterbalance to that either way.  
  
Q. Aside from the tournament itself, what does it mean for you, being
from Wisconsin, climbing up through the ranks from Wisconsin, different
schools, just personally, what does it mean for you, you know, being able to
lead the Badgers to another tournament?  
GREG GARD: Well, obviously you take great pride in it, because when I was from
zero to 23 or 24, the Badgers were never in the NCAA Tournament, so to come
through that span of your lifetime and never see Wisconsin in an NCAA
Tournament, it obviously has a special meaning right now. My kids know no
different. I have a 15, 13 and 8-year-old and they've never seen an NCAA
Tournament without Wisconsin in it. Having as you mentioned grown up in the
state, and coached at three different schools, my last time in Buffalo was
1995, Platteville played in the Final Four and won a National Championship
here at Buffalo State. That was -- when Buffalo came up on Sunday, that's
right where my mind went to was '95 and the last time I was here.  
  
So, you have those kind of memories and connections and relationships in the
state. I think when you are leading your home state school, there's an extra
sense of pride in that. Obviously, I know we represent the state and Badger
fans and alumni across the country. But obviously, those in the state, it's a
little extra special to it, because I'm one of them. I sat in that seat or
watched it on TV or whatever for a lot of years and have witnessed how far the
program has grown over that time.  
  
Q. Greg, what do you see from your guys when you're clicking like you
were in the Big Ten semis, versus some much the losses you had later in the
year. What's the difference for you when you watch the game on TV or on film
itself?  
GREG GARD: Well, the ball moves. That's pretty obvious. The ball had moved
pretty well. I thought it moved well on Saturday. Not quite as well on Sunday.
We went through a little stretch where Koenig was banged up and missed a game.
I think that impacted us offensively when you have a player like that that's
not in rhythm or in sync, it has a tendency to trickle down to other guys.  
  
But all of our better teams have had very good spacing, ball movement, have
different guys that can score from different areas, being able to stretch the
floor a little bit with bigs that can shoot the ball. That rhythm that we got
into over the last three, four games is something we'll try to replicate
offensively. Maybe not as much with last Sunday's game, but a lot of that also
had to do with Michigan. I thought they did some really good things to us, and
obviously, offensively, they were hitting on all cylinders so we were playing
catch-up most of the game.  
  
Just try to get in rhythm. Share the ball, take care of the ball. The ball
moves pretty well. We don't over-dribble when we're in rhythm. And at times
we're out, we over-dribble and pound it too much. So, try to stay away from
that and more of the other.  
  
Q. What do you remember about Buffalo from that Buffalo State tournament
and what do you notice about the city this time?  
GREG GARD: Well, there wasn't this much snow here, I know that. And I remember
the gym being orange. He confirmed that back stage that it's orange and black.
We played Steve Alford's Manchester team. At that point in time it the first
time two undefeated teams had met for a National Championship. They came in
31-0, we came in 30-0. So, we took the team to an Italian restaurant which I
find out now is out of business. Because I chatted with Coach Ryan, or traded
messages over the week when it was announced we're coming here. He said hey
take the team to, I think it's Carmine's. That's what we decided the name was
now, but we found out it's out of business. But it was obviously great
memories, because my second year coaching, we win a National Championship. I
mean, got spoiled pretty quickly. It was a good time. Seems like a hundred
years ago but it was fun.  
  
Q. Greg, free-throw shooting not a strong suit for you guys. How much
does that concern you going up to a Virginia Tech team where Buzz tries to go
out of points to the line?  
GREG GARD: Them trying to get points at the line and us shooting free throws
are two opposite things though. They don't foul very much and we try not to
foul much each. Specifically, the free throws have been two guys and they
ironically are the two guys that get there the most, Hayes and Happ. They both
have been working on it all year. Hopefully we've seen some progression in a
positive way, in the last week, more in game environments. They've been okay
during the year in the practice environment. It's been the game environment
where we haven't been able to capitalize on it.  
  
So, mainly, I want to make sure we're getting there, although I know they
don't foul a whole lot and don't put teams at the line a whole lot and they
try to get there a good bit. You look at -- you analyze numbers going back to
the lady behind you's question, about Buzz's analytics, you look at free-throw
attempts and those type of things. Numbers are similar in terms of the amount
of times they try to get there. Albeit, it's different, maybe a different
method to do it, but still trying to get the same result of making more free
throws than the opponent attempts.  
  
Speaking of '95, that team made 200 more free throws than the opponent
attempted which may be a record. Hence, why they went 31-0. They were pretty
good at getting to the line and converting there. So, yeah, that's just what
we're -- we'll try to get there as hopefully as we can. Hopefully Ethan and
Nigel can get in a rhythm and get some confidence going in a live environment.  
  
Q. Coach, we wish you best of luck in the late game tomorrow against
Virginia Tech.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Nathan Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33043)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We are joined the Bucknell university head coach Nathan
Davis. Coach, welcome to Buffalo. Glad you're here safely. Getting ready to
play West Virginia in our second game tomorrow. Go ahead and raise your hand
if you have questions for Coach Davis at this time. We'll get a microphone you
to.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. When you took over this program, could you talk maybe
about the junior class, and was there a buy-in period and what you've been
able to do and seen them maybe grow in these two years?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Well, I think I was very fortunate. Typically you don't take
over a program that's in such great shape. What Coach Paulsen had done prior
to me getting there, we had a group of guys that wanted to be good and were
expecting to win and wanted to be coach. I think the junior class has been a
big part of why we've had success. I think their buy-in and belief in what
we're doing kind of brought everyone one else along with them.  
  
They've been completely about the team winning. They haven't worried about
individual success, people that got it, when your best guys are doing that,
it's hard for anyone else to do anything different.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the match-ups and
how you think your team matches up with West Virginia?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Do I have to? No, I think that obviously, they're a very
talented team. Coach Huggins is a Hall of Fame type coach for a reason because
he does a great job. His guys really compete at a high level. They play hard.
They're unselfish, they're relentless at both ends of the floor. We have our
work cut out for us. I have a lot of confidence in our guys' ability and what
we're capable of doing. And we're going to go out there and give them
everything we have.  
  
It's certainly going to be a challenge. They're very long and athletic. We
can't simulate the way they play with the guys we have. We've done the best we
can, but there will be an adjustment period as the game gets started and we
get used to the length in athleticism. But I think that when all is said and
done, we'll be to compete at a pretty high level.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a couple of common opponents. Do you go back and watch
those films as part of your scout, and what did you -- it did you see the
press early when scouting them originally, Mount St. Mary's and such?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We look to some of those, but we looked more at some of the
recent games and then more of some of the mid-majors they play later in the
year to see what they did differently against some of those teams. Obviously,
Jamion Christian at Mount St. Marys is a good friend of mine. We worked at
Bucknell together and have know each other a long and have talked to each
other about it. But at the same time, that was a long time ago. They've
adjusted and developed as the years went on, and they're doing some things a
little differently. We focused more on the recent stuff than what we were
doing back in November.  
  
Q. Along those lines, when you're -- West Virginia's first in turnovers.
How do you go about planning, or trying to get your guys ready for a team that
has that kind of pressure and that kind of defense?  
NATHAN DAVIS: There's a lot of sleepless nights. No. I think that -- again, we
don't have the same saga, that we can simulate what they're doing. We can kind
of show them and watch a lot of film and try to get them to understand our
concepts, but some of it, there's just no way for us to simulate it. So it
will be on the fly, when they get in those games.  
  
The good thing is, we play a lot of good teams with good size and good
athleticism. So our guys should have a good feel for what that's like. West
Virginia plays a lot different than a lot of other teams. Really outside of a
couple teams we played in the last couple years, they're very different in
style of play from what some other teams are. So there's going to be an
adjustment period. I think we've got bright guys. I think they've got a good
idea about what to expect and we'll go out there and do the best we can.  
  
Q. Coach, from Sunday until now is obviously not a lot of prep time. Can
you change anything to really take advantage of things that you see on film,
like, say, attacking the press or attacking their defense, or do you really
have to stick a lot more to your core principles?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think that throughout the year, we've been fortunate -- we've
seen a lot of different styles of play. So, we've had to deal with the press.
We've had to deal with half court, we've dealt with zone. We've seen it all.
It's more of just trying to refine it or make slight adjustments based on what
we think is going to be different. You said you don't have time to go back and
reinvent the wheel. It's about taking what we do and what we do well to trying
to adjust and take advantage of some opportunities.  
  
Q. I guess along the same line of questioning, what is it about a Bob
Huggins' team that is renowned for its pressure defense, but the way they're
scoring, what added dimension does the -- you know, and challenge does this
team present?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think you say Coach Huggins is not good, he's great at his
job. So they're well-prepared. They are disciplined. They really compete at a
high level, so you've got to understand it's going to be about you competing
at that same level or at your best for 40 minutes. And that's what we're
trying to do all year. It's really nothing new we're trying to do, but it's
definitely going to be a big part of what is going on.  
  
Q. Couple questions. One, West Virginia is obviously a team that got
upset in the first round last year, so I'm just kind of wondering, did you
even look at that game or bring it up to your players? Is it a factor a year
later at all on number two. The three-point shot how much of an equalizer can
it be for tomorrow?  
NATHAN DAVIS: First of all, we know from experience that what happened last
year doesn't matter this year. We got upset in the first round of our league
tournament as the No. 1 seed last year. That has little impact, if any, impact
on what happens this year. I don't think their experience lat year will have
much impact what happens tomorrow.  
  
Three-point shot is one of those things that can be an equalizer, but it's
about getting good ones. We don't want to chuck them up to just chuck them up.
We want to make sure we're getting them inside out and our feet are set. We
have guys that are capable of making shots from a lot of different areas. As
long as they're good ones.  
  
And that's part of the big challenge with they way they play, not just not
turning it over, but playing at a pace you're comfortable with, so when you
get those shots you're in a position to knock them down.  
  
Q. Okay. Not seeing any other questions, Coach, we appreciate your time.
Good luck tomorrow against West Virginia?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Thank you.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are joined by student-athletes from Mount St. Mary's,
right to left. Elijah Long, Junior Robinson, Chris Wray. It's been quite a
long 48 hours. We'll open up to questions for these gentlemen right now.  
  
Q. Chris, can you describe what that moment was like when you grabbed
that ball at the end of the game last night?  
CHRIS WRAY: I think the word was necessary. It was necessary. Like we talked
about, in moments like that, especially in March, if a team gets a hand on the
ball, more times than not, it actually goes in. A heave, a throw, anything, so
it was just necessary to get the ball.  
  
Q. For those of us who have not seen a lot of Mount St. Mary's
basketball, for any of the three of you, how would you describe the way you
play and what was the key to your success in the tournament run and last
night?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I think we just cause a lot of chaos on the court. We play
really fast, really hectic. We take a lot of threes and defend the three well.
So our success is just playing, being able to play together, and our love for
the game.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: Definitely, a little word that Coach always says is "mayhem," and
it's like a controlled chaos, and it's just trying to turn the ball -- turn
the other team over a lot. Just fast breaks, a lot of fast breaks, alley-oop
dunks, and just being able to play off each other's energy.  
  
Q. Just for any of you guys, what have the last 24 to 48 hours been like
from playing, you know, a thrilling game in the NCAA Tournament to traveling
here and getting ready to face the overall top seed?  
CHRIS WRAY: As far as traveling, we've done this in the non-conference. We had
a long, three-week trip, so as far as the traveling part, we're used to it. We
just try to keep the same mentality of one game at a time, regardless of what
game it is, whether it's conference, nonconference, tournament, and now NCAA
Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Junior?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Like he said, we had that three-week trip where we played I
don't know how many games in how many days. But -- so we're used to it. It was
pretty hectic. It was kind of fun, too. Now we get to come and play another
game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Junior, you talked about it's kind of controlled chaos. How does that
style fit your style of play?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Just really fast. I mean, we don't really play -- we play
controlled, but we play really fast and sometimes too fast. But we just find a
way to stay -- keep our control and stay calm.  
  
Q. Does it suit your personal style, though?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Oh, yeah, it does. I like playing fast. I like a lot of
threes, I like dunks, and we do a lot of that. So it fits my style perfectly.  
  
Q. Junior, I guess you've had your share of doubters in your career.
What have people said since you've come on the scene now, and obviously, are a
pretty good player. What have you thought about all of the doubting you've
received over your career and how have you handled that mentally?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I've embraced it. It's kind of like a chip on my shoulder to
prove people wrong that height really doesn't matter. It's about the heart
that you have and the passion that you played the game with. I mean, each
game, I'm going to probably be the shortest player on the court. Actually, I'm
going to be the shortest player on the court.  
  
So, I just have to come out -- I just come out and play my hardest and play
with the heart that I have for the love of the game and for the love of my
brothers.  
  
Q. Just wondering, I mean, it's not just playing a one seed, but, you
know, like many people, I'm wondering if you guys were actually watching last
year that championship game and Nova winning it and knowing what it's like
from then to now and knowing you're playing in the NCAA Tournament.  
ELIJAH LONG: Yeah. I think someone asked a similar question yesterday about
that. And I don't think any of us on the team would have guessed that we're
going to play Villanova, you know what I mean? But it is March Madness. It's a
humbling experience, but then again, they're just human beings just like us.
We're just going to go out there and play.  
  
The one thing that they do well on a consistent basis is play hard. I don't
think they ever take a possession off defensively or offensively, so we've
just got to match that intensity and you never know what could happen at the
end.  
  
Q. Quick question for Eli. Eli, you are the first Canadian player in
Mount St. Mary's history, and here we are playing in Buffalo where you get to
play so close to home. What is that like for you?  
ELIJAH LONG: It's funny because I put in a group for tickets and there's
supposed to be 26 of my family members come up, but I didn't get all those
tickets. I only have nine, so only nine people can come up. But other than
that, though, it's amazing, because my parents don't get to see me to play in
person a lot. They're always in Canada. Sometimes they can't cross the border
or they're just busy. So when moments like this come along, and I can play an
hour away from my house, it's surreal. I thank God for it. God always has a
plan, so, it's a humbling experience.  
  
Q. For Junior, Muggsy Bogues talked a lot about watching you last night
and being really impressed with what he saw. Has you heard any of his comments
and how neat is that to kind of put yourself on the national stage a little
bit and to get some of that recognition?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Well, I haven't heard that. That's the first I heard it, so
thanks for telling me. It's an honor, because he's a Hall-of-Famer. It's a
great feeling to be recognized just because I'm short and doing things that
nobody thought I could do.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up for Elijah. You talked a little bit about growing up
just an hour from here. Did you ever make trips to Buffalo as a kid or
anything like that?  
ELIJAH LONG: Yeah. I had -- one of my basically family friends, he played for
a Buffalo team in New York, so I made trips up there to see him. Other than
that, the only time I travelled to Buffalo is to get airports, because they're
cheap, the flights are cheap. I would drive here, past the border to catch a
flight, to go to either my high school or back to the Mount.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys always talked about being locked in. Did you get a
chance to enjoy the win or straight to ill Nova and being knock locked in and
ready to play tomorrow?  
CHRIS WRAY: I mean, we definitely get a chance to enjoy it. We talked about
this, and we're just enjoying the whole ride as a whole. You have to take in
everything for each experience. I feel for us to enjoy it and look back at
later on, we have to focus at what we have at hand. You don't want to look
back at it to say you celebrated too early when you have a lot more in you.  
  
Q. What are you guys most excited about or looking forward to when you
play against Villanova tomorrow night?  
THE MODERATOR: Pardon me?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Any of us can answer?  
  
Q. What are you most excited about or looking forward to?  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody in particular?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I think it's going to be a hard-fought game. We're go
together make it a grind-it-out game. We have to come out and try to compete
with them at the highest level that we can compete at.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: One thing I'm looking forward to is to see, not only about what's
going to happen tomorrow, but what we're going to have in the future for next
year, you know? It's going to battle-test us and get us ready for not only
tomorrow, but in the future for next year, whatever that is. Because that's a
great team, so, I think it's preparing us now for, you know, not only the
weeks ahead of us but months, and probably hopefully years ahead of us for the
team that we have now.  
  
Q. For anybody, did any of you see video or anything of Kris Jenkins
winning shot last year and have you had a chance to watch him on TV this year,
knowing that Jenkins is back and Josh Hart who's a National Player of the Year
candidate is also on their team?  
CHRIS WRAY: I'm pretty sure everybody watched the game. I mean I was -- I'm
pretty hyped about it. I just love basketball all together, just watching the
game, seeing Marcus Paige make that shot before, and then seeing that, it's
good for the game of basketball. Overall, I can't really say I watched too
many of the games this year, because I've been focusing on what we've been
doing. We have done our scouting, in preparation for the game.  
  
Q. For any of the guys, 16 has never beaten a 1. I'm sure you know that.
Do you have a mentality? Hey, why not us?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I mean, records are meant to be broken, and we have the
confidence going into this game, that if we take care of things the way we're
supposed to and handle ourselves in the manner that we can, why not?  
  
CHRIS WRAY: I just want to state, everything to gain and nothing to lose.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Not seeing any, guys, good luck, first
game tonight against Villanova. Appreciate you being here. Thank you. Oh, I
wanted to introduce Mark Vandegrift, athletic communications, Mount St.
Mary's. He can assist you with any other needs you have with their team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mount St. Mary's head coach, Jamion Christian.
Coach, congratulations on a first-round win. Welcome to Buffalo. Great to have
you here. We'll go ahead and open up for questions at this time. We'll get
started right in the center here.  
  
Q. Jamion, you're facing the second very fast turnaround for the week.
Can you talk about the turnaround, having a day to prepare for it?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: First of all, I think our travel couldn't have been more
smooth getting here. Buffalo, everything was great for us when we got here.
We're excited for the opportunity to be here. When you're playing great games
like this in great environments, your enthusiasm has to carry you. We've had
an enthusiastic bunch, an enthusiastic group all season long. So the first
thing is we're really excited about being here.  
  
There are always a lot challenges in every opponent you're going to play.
Villanova is an excellent team. They've been excellent program for 50 years.
They've been really good and they've been on this stage more often than us.
The biggest challenge starts with their personnel, just the professionalism
that they live with every single day. We've got to do a great job of making
sure we understand their personnel really well. Just understanding, we have to
go out and be us, play our game. There's five guys on the floor. Ball's going
to jump up. The team that plays the best on any given day has an opportunity
to win.  
  
Q. Are you able to play freely now, as a 16-seed going against the one?
Is all of the pressure off of you?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I don't really acknowledge pressure. I think pressure is
what you put on yourself every single day. We've tried to do a great job of
doing that in practice every single day. So I don't know if that really exists
in our world. You know, we're going to go play freely because that's how we
play.  
  
I have such a great belief in the guys we have on our roster. We've challenged
ourselves to the highest levels we could this season playing six NCAA
Tournament teams, playing on the road against some of the very best. You have
to believe at some point that your preparation has you ready for the moment.  
  
Q. How different does this feel being here now doing, this as opposed to
that First Four, and do you feel like this is a different level, getting
here?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: You know, no. I think it's a tournament setting. I think the
NCAA does a great job making sure they're positioning teams to feel as
comfortable as possible, and with the short turnaround we had before, I think
we're really well-prepared for what we need to do. We had a short turnaround
for the University of New Orleans, and we've got an even shorter turnaround
for Villanova. So I think we feel pretty good on the stage where we're
sitting.  
  
Q. Coach. Jim Phelan is a native Philadelphian, coached at Mount St.
Mary's for many years. Did you play for him first of all?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I did. I played for Coach for three years.  
  
Q. What did you learn from him and how have you applied his teachings to
your coaching style now?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I think the first thing I learned is you've got to have
really good players and good guards. I believe he was there for 49 years, but
I forced him into retirement. Let's make sure you have good players that
allows you to be a really good coach. One thing Coach Phalen was always great
with is he always gave his guards a ton of freedom. Every day we came into
practice and did very similar things. But it was all about being free and
allowing the guys to play with a lot of confidence.  
  
Hopefully one day we can go watch our team play, they see his resemblance on
our teams because I think our team really try to play that way. We try to take
outside shots when they're there. We try to play unselfish when the moment
calls for it and we try to play really stingy defenses. I think when you see
-- if anyone remember's Coach Phelan's teams playing, 830 victories, his teams
did those things really well.  
  
Q. You preach being locked in. How long did you let the guys enjoy last
night's win and when did sort of the focus become all about Villanova?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: We've got just an amazing group of guys. We're excited for
the country to see these guys get on this stage and perform. They really
enjoyed it in the locker room and they were excited about the opportunity in
the locker room. But about ten minutes being in there, they started settling
in and asking questions about Villanova and started eagerly asking questions
about when they can watch film and start preparing.  
  
They set a goal for themselves. They'll continue to stay focused and locked in
to try and achieve that goal. Our group is different. They enjoyed it for
about ten minutes, I would say, and they really reset pretty quickly and are
ready for the next challenge.  
  
Q. Junior Robinson hit big shots last night. He got that neat note about
him being the shortest player in the NCAA right now. What should the country
know about him and what makes him special as a person, as a player, that type
of thing?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I don't think he's one of the shortest guys. I think he's
one of the best guards and people really got a chance to notice that. Our back
court is exceptional with Elijah Long and Junior Robinson. I think people are
really going to start to get a chance to see two of these guys play together
in a fashion that you don't get a chance to see very often.  
  
Elijah got in foul trouble last night so was not able to fully be out there
the entire time. I think these two guys in the back court can be as good as
anyone. And on any given night, they can play with anyone. Junior has a
tremendous heart, has a tremendous passion for winning, tremendous passion for
his teammates. His spontaneity allows him the chance to make big plays and
he's done that for us not just this year but in the years past.  
  
What the country needs to know about him is he's got incredible heart, he's
got incredible passion, and he's going to try to attack every moment out
there. They are really going to really enjoy watching him play.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could talk about your style of play offensively, and
then your style of play defensively in terms of man-to-man zone, just to learn
a little bit more about what you guys do at both ends?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Yeah. We're going to play -- on the defense we're going to
play predominantly man-to-man. We have some zone stuff in there. But I just
feel like real men play man-to-man defense. We're going to play man-to-man,
and if something happens miraculous and we have to go to a zone, we will. But
we're going to do a great job as we can to just try to stay man-to-man. We've
done a great job of that all season long against many opponents.  
  
Even in nonconference against that tough schedule, our man-to-man defense was
very good. Iowa State went below one point per possession and they're one of
the best offensive teams in the country. I have a lot of confidence in our
team defensively.  
  
Offensively we're going to try to spread you out. We play a couple different
styles. We'll play two post guys some with the opportunity to ball screen you
and throw the ball to the low post and attack from there. But predominantly
the game we'll play with four guards out, very similar to Villanova. We're
going to space the floor our. We're going to shoot 24 to 25 threes a night. We
shot those at 36% this past year which is a pretty high percentage. We going
to try to space you out and make outside shots.  
  
That's going to open the floor for Elijah Long and Junior Robinson to get to
the rim. If they're able to do that, and we're able to make about 15 threes
tomorrow night, it will be a good day.  
  
Q. In follow-up to that, what would you say overall are the two, three,
biggest strengths to the ball club and what areas have you struggled most with
an area that needed to get better as the year involved much?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Our versatility, I think, on our roster. We have a lot of
guys that can guard a lot of different positions and a lot of guys that can
handle. A lot of times we're able to put defense in tough predicaments on
offense because Chris Wray played point guard in high school so essentially
he's a third or fourth ball handler on the floor for us, who can make plays
and decisions for us.  
  
That's one of the biggest trends is our versatility. Again a lot of guys that
can shoot the ball from the outside and a lot of guys that can get the ball to
the right guys. Defensively, I think what we had to work on most was really
just learning how to play with physicality, just being able to rebound the
basketball. We're still a very young team. That kind of comes and goes with
young teams, but we've done a good job of that as of late, over the last
month, being able to rebound the basketball and finding enough ways to make
some tough plays.  
  
Q. Two questions. One, what is the biggest concern about Villanova and,
number two, did you ever feel at the beginning of the season you have a shot
at the defending National Champ?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Biggest concern, really, Villanova, just how well they play.
They are as connected as a program, not just a team, as I've ever seen.
Everything they do from practice to the game carries over. They just do a
tremendous job of playing together and carrying over the things that they work
on, and that's always a big struggle for a coach is trying to get his team to
be able to do that.  
  
Coach Wright did an unbelievable job of getting that group of guys there to
buy into what he's trying to do, and he's been able to do that great with
those guys. What was the second question?  
  
Q. Having a chance at National Championship?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: It's always a tremendous opportunity. That's one of the
biggest things. When that ball goes up tomorrow, it won't matter if they're
National Champions or not. That's the reality of it. The team that puts
together the best game plan and the team that follows it best will have the
best opportunity to win. They've done that 30-plus times this year. That's the
challenge that it is.  
  
Tomorrow is a new day. The ball will go up. We'll have an opportunity to play
against one of the best. We will consider ourselves one of the best. There's
65, 64 teams left in the tournament. 64 teams still have a chance to win a
national title. I would consider our team as good as any.  
  
Q. Coach Christian, I know that many of these Villanova players come
from the D.C./Baltimore area. That's the predominant area you recruit from as
well. You knew them on the recruiting trail before they were Wildcats. What
was it like facing guys that you've seen grow not only in your own program but
within theirs?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Josh Hart and Kris Jenkins, I had a chance to watch these
guys play for a long, long time just being in the D.C. area. Josh I know a
little better than Kris. Josh, I had a chance to watch him really grow up from
a person getting adjusted at Sidwell Friends School to the person he is now as
one of the best players in the country. One thing that's really exciting for
me -- I've always known him to be one of the best people I've ever had a
chance to recruit and get to know.  
  
One of the best things to me being a guy from a distance is getting a chance
to watch the country get to know him and what an amazing person he is. He's a
guy that's really created his own destiny on this thing. He not only worked on
his game, but he's worked on himself personally and he's really turned himself
into an unbelievable person. I'm looking forward to continue to root for him
after this, but tomorrow we're obviously going to be on different sides of the
coin.  
  
Q. You mentioned your nonconference schedule pretty challenging, how
does that prepare you for tomorrow night?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Well, we're going to play against a team that's complete on
all ends. When we played that nonconference schedule we had to do that,
playing six teams in the NCAA Tournament, I think eight teams that were in
there in their championship games and then a Texas Arlington team that lost in
their semi-final.  
  
I feel like to be at your best, you have to challenge yourself against the
best. You have to look in the mirror and see where you're weakest at against
the very best. If you do that against anyone else, you're kind of short-
changing us. So I think it helps us to understand what we need to do. I think
the fact we've been in a lot of games is a big strength for us. Understanding
the level of physicality, understanding the level of execution you've got to
have, understanding how fast you've got to get back in transition, because
those all change depending on the level that you're at. I think that's the big
strength of our team, just having -- the fact that we've had to do it time and
time again and we've got experience doing it.  
  
Q. What does this mean for you, this tournament. What does it mean for
you in the program and how is the program going to be able succeed and
capitalize on being part of the field?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: We got a tremendous basketball tradition here at Mount St.
Mary's. As mentioned before, Coach Jim Phalen coached here for 49 years. He is
in the College Basketball Hall of Fame, made it to 30 wins. We're all
continuing on a legacy that's pretty large.  
  
I always consider our tradition way more like Carolina and Kentucky because
it's an older tradition. It's been around for a long time. A lot of home games
are filled with people who came to Mount games as children and now their
children come, so on and so forth. So you don't see that in many places around
the country. A lot of places have new traditions.  
  
We have a old tradition that expects our basketball program to be good and
loves to support our basketball program. It starts there, and I think moving
forward, anytime you have a chance to play on the biggest stage against the
best teams, you get a chance to show how much progress your program is making,
and tomorrow is an opportunity to show how much progress we've made since the
last time we were here in 2008 when they played North Carolina.  
  
So that's going to be exciting for us, and we'll be able to continue on with
the great tradition we have, partly because we've got great players in our
program now, and continue to recruit well and and this can only help us
continue to recruit well and bring in quality guys that can make our product
better.  
  
Q. Having already been on the big stage last night, how does that help
you go nothing tomorrow night?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I feel like settling down is important in any tournament
setting. I think that's really important to be able to do. It's just being
able to -- to understand like the bounce of the ball is a little bit
different, the neutral site is a little bit different. We should be pretty
comfortable with that. The only issue, really, is that Villanova has all of
those guys back basically from last year, and they played pretty well in the
last tournament. So they're going to be pretty settled as well.  
  
I looks for two teams here -- usually you have a lot of turnovers early in the
game. I think both teams will be pretty settled in pretty early on. I look for
it to be a pretty competitive team throughout.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other question. All right, Coach, congratulations on
getting here, and good luck tomorrow.  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Thanks so much.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, everybody, welcome to the Key Bank Center in
Buffalo, New York for the second round of the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We have with us student-athletes from Princeton, from the far side, Devin
Cannady, Steven Cook, Myles Stephens, and Spencer Weisz. Please silence your
cell phones if you have them with you, we would ask that you raise your hand.
We'll get a microphone to you, please wait for the microphone to get you to.  
  
Please state your name and your affiliation. If you could, please direct your
questions to a specific student-athletes. That's helpful and you are allowed
one follow-up question after your original question if you have one.  
  
With that being said, we'll go ahead and get started. Please raise your hand
if you have a question for Princeton student-athletes.  
  
Q. Devin, just your thoughts on going up against your hometown team, and
how close you were to playing against your former teammate, Demetrius
Jackson.  
DEVIN CANNADY: First off, it's an honor to be here and represent the Ivy
League. I know my teammates and I are really excited to play and for me,
especially, I'm looking forward to playing against some of my friends, you
know, V.J. Beachem and I have a close relationship. I play summer basketball
with these guys, so, I live right down the road. So it will be interesting. It
will be really fun for me.  
  
Q. What are some of your emotions? Is this a -- because of the set-up
and who you're playing, is there a little bit more emotion involved with it?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yeah. I think there is. But, you know, when we get on the court
tomorrow, there's going to be high emotions, but my teammates and I are going
to be looking forward to tipping off and playing some good basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Which of you guys have mid-terms that you have to take today? You do,
Spencer?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I do, at 4:30.  
  
Q. What's your schedule like today? Can you describe in terms of -- are
you rushing to study hall after practice?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Focus is on the game. You only go to the NCAA Tournament so
many times in your life. While there will be studying done, most of the
studying will be done of Notre Dame and their scouting report and what the
coaches are giving us and focusing on executing tomorrow at 12:15.  
  
Q. What can you tell me about Professor Gene Grossman?  
SPENCER WEISZ: He's unbelievable. Unbelievable adviser to all of us. Always
wanting to help. Unbelievable person as well.  
  
Q. This is also for Spencer, kind of a follow-up on the mid-term thing,
how much more difficult or challenging has it been, given the fact that they
-- you know, you're coming off the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, and how
much of a juggling act has it been given that fact?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Certainly it's tough, but at the end of the day, that's what we
signed up for. Coming to Princeton University, we know we have to balance
academics as well as athletics. Certainly the stage has risen a bit, but,
nonetheless, we've been balancing both our whole lives, and this is no
different.  
  
Q. Simple question, Spencer, what is the mid-term in?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Business Leadership.  
  
Q. And are you prepared?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Hopefully. We'll see later today.  
  
Q. So, most of you guys, I'm sure, are familiar with snow. Have you ever
seen anything like this? It's like a blizzard outside.  
THE MODERATOR: Myles, you want to take it?  
  
MYLES STEPHENS: We got here Monday night and it was snowing, and we woke up
this morning and it was still snowing, and it hasn't stopped since. I've been
telling the guys on the bus, I can't believe we're driving on these roads that
aren't being plowed. I guess they just don't care here. The drivers must be
really good. But I think it's crazy. I mean, we're here, and we're here to
play basketball, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Lots of practice?  
  
MYLES STEPHENS: Lots of practice and driving.  
  
STEVEN COOK: Devin and I are from the midwest, so we're used to this. Maybe
the Jersey folks are less used to it. But yeah, we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Spencer, you said you had a mid-term. How many more of your teammates
also have them?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I'm sure everyone does. We're in the middle of mid-term week,
so whether we're getting proctored today, sometime earlier this week, I'm sure
we're all swamped. Nonetheless the focus is tomorrow at 12:15.  
  
Q. Do any of you other fellows have tests going on this week?  
MYLES STEPHENS: I had a mid-term today. I got it rescheduled until after the
game, so I still have some studying to do. But focusing on the game, first and
foremost.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on the difficulty of studying for two different
types of tests, game and academically?  
MYLES STEPHENS: I'm going to echo what Spencer said. We signed up for this and
we've been doing this for a while. We know what we have to do on and off the
court. I think we -- at this point in the season, and in our career, we've
become pretty good at juggling academics and athletics, so it's just like
another day on the job. I guess the stage is a little bigger, but that's what
we do, so --  
  
Q. This is for Devin. Now you're half a year removed from your trip to
Tanzania, what was the impact of you on that trip and what -- is there some
things you miss about it, food or something else like that?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yeah. It was a very special trip. I was blessed to have the
opportunity to go over there and do two semesters of studying and prepare
myself. The whole reason for me going was to lighten my schedule for my
sophomore spring. The goal at the beginning of the year was make this
tournament, and so -- in terms of mid-terms, I have a little lighter load. And
looking back, that was the start of it, so, I had some really -- I had a
really good opportunity to meet some amazing people in Tanzania.  
  
One of my friends was actually the national team captain, Merji Mujicat
(phonetic). He is in the States right now. He wished me good luck. I have a
lot of support to people back there reaching out to me on Instagram. Being
able to touch a lot of their lives through basketball and my time over there.
The food was great. It was really cheap compared to what we have in the
States. I miss that, but there are some good relationships I've built, and I'm
looking forward to going back sometime in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Princeton student-athletes?  
  
Q. You know, for any one of you, maybe Spencer, just what can you -- how
would you characterize Coach's offensive philosophy, because a lot is made of
the Princeton, quote, unquote, offense, which isn't really what it was, but
what can you say about some principles about his offensive philosophy.  
SPENCER WEISZ: Versatile. Everyone in the offense needs to be able to dribble,
shoot, pass. It's part of the player, I guess, that Princeton looks for
nowadays, but nonetheless, it's less read and react. It's really just playing.  
  
You know, we're always going up and down during practice, getting after it,
but as much as people want to talk about our offense, it's really been our
defense that's carried us all year. Offense is -- has been there for quite
some time, but our defense was lacking. This year we really stepped up on our
defensive end, and that's a big reason why we're here today. We're playing the
game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else want to talk about what you are doing offensively?  
  
STEVEN COOK: Yeah. I think it's definitely a lot less structured than it was
in the past. When you think of the Princeton offense, you think of sort of
rigid structured decisions. You go back-door when this happens and you come
around other times. The thing that we really appreciate is Coach is giving us
a lot of freedom in the offense, just sort of read and react and do what we
want when we see something on the court, and I think that's really benefited
us this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. If not, Princeton will be tipping
off against Notre Dame 12:15 tomorrow. Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck
tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Stephen Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33044)

### [Zach Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33045)

### [Nana Foulland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33046)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We are joined by Bucknell University student-athletes.
From right to left. Stephen Brown, Nana Foulland and Zach Thomas. Same rules
apply. Please silence your cell phones. Raise your hand if you have a
question, we'll get a microphone you to. Please wait for the mike to get
there.  
  
Please give your name and your affiliation and if possible, please direct your
question to which student-athletes you would like to answer. We'll go ahead
and get started and we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. Hi, guys. I guess first of all, welcome to Buffalo. And just
obviously the snow here has been a story. I just wonder if you guys -- how
your trip was here and your travel here and what that process was like for you
guys?  
ZACH THOMAS: It was good. Took us a little longer than normal obviously, but
we had a nice little police escort going for us, so, you know, we got here
safely and it was good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else want to add to that?  
  
STEPHEN BROWN: Not really.  
  
Q. I know you're used to snow, so it's nothing new.  
ZACH THOMAS: We got a lot down in Lewisburg too. We avoided a little more
actually coming up here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go in the back there.  
  
Q. Stephen, have you faced anyone this year, pressures like you've seen,
what West Virginia does on film, and do you adjust anything, in the way that
you play, or do you anticipate that when you're going to be seeing them
tomorrow?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. I mean, early on in the year, we played a couple teams
that pressured, played Manhattan. Mount St. Mary's who also pressured a little
bit and a couple in in our league pressured here and there.  
  
Then what we do with that, guys get open, make outlets, just being smart with
the ball, looking for outlets and the coaches do a really good job of
preparing us. Just looking at film, looking at different options that other
teams have done successfully against a team that also pressures. So, going
into it, I think, we're really prepared for what they have for us, knowing
about their pressure, and also experiencing pressure early on this season, I
think also helps, too.  
  
Q. What's the biggest progression you think you've made as a team this
year, starting the beginning of the season until now?  
STEPHEN BROWN: I think the biggest progression for us this year has been
defensively. Since our class has been here, we kind of struggled defensively
in the half court. I think we did a really good job focusing on the defensive
end, helping out, and we have Nana inside, both Nana and Zach inside. Huge
presence in communicating. I think all of the guys did a really good job of
knowing their roles and knowing their spots, and the coaches have done a
really good job of helping us, figuring out what to do on defense, and, you
know, just being more scrappy, I think, this year. And, you know, just
guarding our guy, guarding our ball, guarding ball screens, so we done a
really good job on that, focusing on that, and it really helped us in the
season.  
  
Q. Question for Nana. I'm just kind of wondering, just from doing some
research, you seemed like you're a guy that kind of progressed late in high
school, kind of came on late, and then your game has obviously continued to
progress at Bucknell, and, you know, winning Player of the Year, Defensive
Player of the Year. I wonder if you can kind of talk about your progression
and how you've helped into the player that you have at Bucknell?  
NANA FOULLAND: Well, in high school, I was playing behind Donovon Jack, who
went to Penn State, played with Penn State. And I didn't get a lot of time,
because I was playing behind him, and also my game wasn't as well-developed
yet. I just kept working hard, and eventually I was able to play my junior and
senior year of high school, and I was able to get scholarship offers. And
Bucknell being one of the, of course, I committed here and just kept work
ethic. Didn't want to waiver, so just kept working hard, working hard, and I
guess here I am now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Reminding you're allowed to one follow-up question as well.  
  
Q. Yeah, for Nana and Zach. Just wondering what you're expecting from
West Virginia, West Virginia's defense? What are you expecting? Are you
expecting it to be rough or what?  
ZACH THOMAS: Yeah, I mean, we know that they love to press. They force the
most turnovers in the country. We know that. We also know they have big guys
that are strong and physical inside, which is -- playing bigger teams like
this is not the same as when we play league play. Our nonconference schedule I
think prepared us for that.  
  
So, you know, we know it's going to be a physical game, but we've been
practicing all week, preparing for it, and hopefully that will help us out and
come game time, we'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nana, anything to add?  
  
NANA FOULLAND: No. I agree with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Always a good answer. Other questions for Bucknell student-
athletes? Okay. Not seeing any more, I will remind you that Jon Terry is the
sports information director, right over here on my left, your right, who is
here and can help you with any other need you have for Bucknell. Gentlemen,
appreciate your time, best of luck tomorrow against West Virginia. And
Bucknell head coach Nathan Davis will be up at 12:20.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Before we get started with head coach Mike Brey, I want to note
Alan Wasielewski from Notre Dame the sports information staff is here to help
you with any other needs you have with Notre Dame student-athletes or coaches.
Before we take questions we'll have an opening statement.  
  
MIKE BREY: I love Lake effect. I live in Lake effect in South Bend. This is no
different than a January game, January night, in South Bend, Indiana. But it
never gets old. Just thrilled to be part of the Tournament. I think we got
some rest since playing the night shift in Brooklyn and excited to play a very
good Princeton team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Brey?  
  
Q. Mike, could you just give us a brief recap of where Bonzie is with
the -- Bonzie Colson with the injury?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah. He's much better, Tim. We had some swelling on Saturday and
Sunday -- Sunday and Monday, I should say, and it's come down a lot. He's made
great progress, doing a little bit more every day. You know, I think by noon
tomorrow, he's one of those guys, he's such a warrior, that you tape him, you
give him a couple Advil, and cut him loose.  
  
Q. What's your greatest concern or concerns with Princeton?  
MIKE BREY: Well, they're so efficient offensively, I think the three-point
line is your major concern, you know? 45 percent of their shots are from the
arc, and they're really efficient, can really shoot it from out there. Chasing
people off the arc. Now, that's something we've been pretty good at this year,
taking away the arc and getting out. I think we're third or fourth in the ACC
in three-point field-goal percentage defense. But I think that's a key and
then keeping them off the foul line.  
  
Q. Yeah, Coach, two questions on Matt Farrell. People have compared his
demeanor to Bobby Hurley's demeanor. Could you speak to that? Secondly, I read
where Hurley called you during the recruiting process. What was behind that.
Why did he call? Was it a Jersey thing? His dad or what?  
MIKE BREY: Well, the demeanor and the edge are the same. It's that I-95, New
Jersey edge that both of them have. Actually, obviously, I know Bobby well,
recruited him. He tried to recruit him for her at U.B., I believe, at the time
and knew him and called me, actually the day I was going down to watch him. He
said Coach, I usually don't get involved. He said, I just love him. He kind of
made a comment, he remind he's of myself. I said, well this evaluation is now
over, I know what to do. I think he's better than Hurley because he shoots it
better. He shoots it better than Hurley.  
  
Q. Better overall?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. He's not First Team All American?  
MIKE BREY: I think he's a better player than Hurley, because he shoots it
better.  
  
Q. In some ways, do you feel Bonzie kind of epitomizes your whole
program? I was asking, you guys always fly under the radar. You fly under the
radar. Bonzie flies under the radar. Are you all one and the same?  
MIKE BREY: We must need to hire a new marketing department. Why are we always
flying under the radar? We've pretty darn good. Bonz has been that undersized
guy that when he was being recruited, no one was sure, is he going to be big
enough? Is he productive enough? He probably does epitomize who we've been.
Harangody was in that line. You covered him closely when we were in the Big
East. We had a lot of guys like that. Bonz, he's a good front cover guy for
that.  
  
Q. I know you said you're familiar with Lake-effect snow, but you also
have a connection to Buffalo with your son playing football at U.B.?  
MIKE BREY: Big time.  
  
Q. How much time did you spend here and what was your are experience
like?  
MIKE BREY: I still have an open bar tab at the Marriott Amherst. I'm going to
have to clear that from 2008. 2008 MAC champs, baby. My son had a fabulous
experience at U.B. They won the MAC. As much -- as many big games and exciting
games as I've been part of -- and tomorrow will be one -- there's nothing like
watching your son play and watching him play a MAC championship in Ford Field
back in 2008. He gave us the scouting report on the steakhouse last night, but
a lot of great memories here at Buffalo and of U.B.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, he just got a job in a high school in North Carolina.
What's that like for you?  
MIKE BREY: He's a head coach now. He's saying he's all fired up. They're ready
to go. They're moving to Charlotte. He did the college thing; he's going to do
the high school thing. I'm kind of his agent. He would be pretty good back at
U.B. someday. He'd be pretty good in about six or seven years back at U.B.
Let's talk U.B. football, not basketball. Let's talk MAC champs 2008.  
  
Q. I was wondering and watching tape on Princeton, if you see a little
bit of yourself?  
MIKE BREY: Absolutely. Absolutely. One thing I said to our guys right after
the selection show, I said, it's like guarding ourselves every day. You know?
They don't turn it over; we don't turn it over. They don't miss free throws;
we don't miss free throws. They can shoot it from the arc, and they know how
to play and know who they are. It's very, very similar. A coach very familiar
with them said to me, they're smart and they're tough, like you. And it really
is. And again, they've gotten away from just the pure Princeton offense.
They're flowing a little bit more, which is how we played at Notre Dame. They
still have Princeton tendencies, but they are a little more -- they are not
married to the predictable movement every time down.  
  
Two very similar basketball teams, efficient and smart and know who they are
and old. But here's the difference. Now I know why Mitch Henderson looks so
dang healthy. He hasn't lost since December 22nd. I mean, that's really good
for your blood pressure in this business. He has not lost since December. What
is that like? You go through two months and you don't lose? Must be nice.  
  
Q. You talked a little about this Sunday night after the selection, but
going back to the Princeton offense, I mean, it used to be like way back in
the day, it would be like playing a real unusual team, but now, I mean, it's
sort of -- everybody sort of coopted a little bit the spacing and shooting.
Could you comment on that, and do they have more back-cuts still than other
teams?  
MIKE BREY: They still cut. They still really go without it in back-cut. I
think the tendencies are all there, that's drilled into you in the Princeton
stuff, and these kids ran pure Princeton as young guys. I think it's really
interesting and brilliant what Mitch has done to get away from it, just, you
know, that structure every possession, and open the floor up a little bit and
play. And, you know, that's kind of how we built our program. If you recruit
high basketball IQ guys, you can give them some freedom to play and I think
Mitch has done a fabulous job. I also think he's one of the bright young
coaches in our profession. He's really gifted.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Brey? If not, Coach, good luck
tomorrow.  
  
MIKE BREY: Who are we? Remember that cheer?  
  
THE MODERATOR: U.B.  
  
MIKE BREY: I remember that cheer, baby whoo hoo!

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

### [Steve Vasturia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28640)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Now joined by Notre Dame student-athletes to my far
right, senior, V.J. Beachem; senior, Matt Farrell, and senior, Steve Vasturia.
Same rules apply. We'll get a microphone to ask these gentlemen your
questions. We'll go ahead and open for questions now.  
  
Q. If I could trouble all of you guys, actually. Every year this team
gets here and every year everyone seems a little surprised. I think Coach Brey
flies way under the radar as a coach of prominence. Why do you think that is
and what do you think he does for this program?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think it start off with the fact that lot of people think of
Notre Dame as a football school. And then secondly, playing in the ACC, you
hear about a lot of coaches in ACC. Coach Brey has done, not only the last few
years, but throughout his entire time at the University of Notre Dame, he's
been probably the most successful coach in the state of Indiana by far. A lot
of things that he's done really fly under the radar, because we were in the
Big East and now being in the ACC.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. I think it speaks volumes of the culture that he's been
able to build at Notre Dame, and the guys that he's been able to recruit and
guys that we've had in the past. I think he's done an incredible job just
getting wins, and then playing well in big games. He's just a very fun guy to
play for, creates a good environment for us and we just have a lot of fun
playing for him.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Agree with both what they said. Coach does a great job getting
guys who buy in to what he's teaching. We always have seniors and juniors
playing a lot of minute, us three have been fortunate enough to play behind
some really good players and learn from them. I believe Coach Brey has done an
unbelievable job and is one of the best coaches in the country. And I think
we've just got to continue to keep winning, and he'll get some of that credit.  
  
Q. This is for everyone. Obviously, Princeton is on your mind now, but
just looking ahead, I know, having the defending champs staring down at you on
the other side, any extra excitement of the possibility of getting to face
them early on in this?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think right now, obviously, you know, we know the way this
tournament works. Our focus is on Princeton. You really don't want to look
past that. They are a really good team and we're going to have to play really
well for 40 minutes on both ends of the floor to move on.  
  
Q. You just kind of talked about it and this is for anybody. 12-5,
historically, there is an upset in the tournament seems like every year. How
do you make sure you're not on the wrong side of that upset and you don't move
forward and took ahead like Tom just asked?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think the number one thing is treating every opponent with
respect regardless of our seed or their seed or anything like that. You know,
I think a lot of people were talking about our seed on Sunday when it came
out, as far as the 12-5 match-up. But behind closed doors, we aren't worried
about that at all. We just want to go out there and play our game regardless
of who we're playing against regardless, when it is, and wherever it is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Question for Steve. You mentioned the whole idea of ACC and how it's
so strong. You guys have that four-game losing streak there in the middle. How
do you keep things in perspective when you're playing in such a tough
conference like that?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I think I mentioned before, we have a lot of older guys
who have been through a long conference season, and, you know, playing in the
ACC, you're going to face some adversity. We got off to a great start. We won
our first five games, but the way the league is, you're going to run into some
bumps along the way. And I think the great thing about this team, you know,
the guys up here, and Bonzie and the other guys who play, we never lost
confidence. We knew we had to kind of keep plugging, and after that losing
streak, we had a home game, and once we got a win, we kind of got it rolling
from there. So just never losing confidence. I think that starts with Coach
Brey and the way he keeps us ready, allows us to play loose, and all we
needed, I think, was one win to get back on track.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our any more questions for Notre Dame
student-athletes before moving on? Not seeing any. Guys good luck tomorrow.
With the early tip-off, 12:15. Appreciate your time and good luck tomorrow.
We'll have Coach Brey up here at 1:05.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 72, Arkansas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel very fortunate. I even told Mike that we were awfully
lucky. I think we were. I thought the moon and the stars weren't aligned
properly, the shot clock was winding down and they make a 3 over a good
defense.  
  
But inside the four-minute TV timeout, I think, it was 3:47 to play, I told
our guys we hadn't won one like this all year long. That would be great for
us. We've got to be tough. It's gotta be with our brain and our heart both.
We've gotta get stops and we've got to get shots.  
  
And Joel got fouled when it was 55-60 and made two free throws, cut it 55-62
and then we got a stop. And then we come down and C.B. McGrath, one of my
assistants, had made a suggestion earlier, and I'd remembered what he said. So
when we had a stoppage of play for something I told him, next time we run
secondary -- run secondary break slip, and that's when Isaiah got the basket
made it 65-64.  
  
Then we get a stop down there and Isaiah gets fouled, and goes to the free-
throw line with a 1-1 and makes two big free throws. And then we get another
stop and we come down and I thought Joel got fouled. I'm sure Mike thought
that Joel fouled. But he throws -- gets it up on the board and Kennedy tips it
in, and that gave us 3 and then we got another stop, and I think Isaiah made a
couple of free throws again to make it five.  
  
We had some fouls to waste. The last play of the game, we were actually trying
to foul when we came up with the steal when Justin got the layup there.  
  
But two things enter my mind. One, what I just talked about, is how tough and
how focused we were to go 12-0. And I don't mind saying, too, we were awfully
lucky. But I thought we were very unluckily there in a stretch. But to go 12-0
-- and the other thing is the little rascal over there.  
  
I wasn't sure when I went to bed last night that he would play today. And the
first thing I thought of when I woke up this morning was wondering how he
felt. You can look at his stat sheet. It doesn't look great when you're
2-for-13, but he's a tough little nut out there today and helped us in every
way possible. The ball didn't go in the basket for him. But I thought he was
something.  
  
And Kennedy with 11 rebounds, and I think -- that said in the locker room that
gave him over a thousand rebounds for a career, can't say anything negative
about anybody on my team. I love the way they competed and feels awfully nice
right now. And I don't mind saying I feel a little lucky. Every now and then I
knock in a long putt, too.  
  
Q. Kennedy, would you ask Coach Williams --  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm doing this for a reason. Seriously. I've known you a
hundred years, but think of this; they're sweaty and smelly. They need to get
in there and shower. I'm not showering. I'll remember your question, too.  
  
Q. Joel, you talked a lot about getting back to the championship game
getting redemption. During a large stretch of that second half where it looked
like you guys might not get out of here, what clicked in those last four
minutes, especially defensively? What changed this game?  
JOEL BERRY II: Well, you know when Coach is talking, I try to do my best to
try to remember what he says. And I remember, if I'm not mistaken, we had our
scout and our meeting room. He told us what we're going to do is we're going
to get a stop and then we're going to go down and score, and get a stop and go
down and score, and we're going to get a stop and go down and score.  
  
That's what we did that last three minutes. We went 12-0 and that's exactly
what he said. And I just told my teammates to believe, and believe that we
were going to win the game. That's why I got it tattooed on the inside of my
arm, that's what you gotta do is believe. Coach said the same thing. That's
what we did the last four minutes.  
  
Sometimes you need games like that. And that's what Coach said -- we haven't
had a game like that in a while. Now we know that we can win a game when we're
down five, with three minutes to go.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, Daryl Macon obviously was big off the bench, 19
points, then he cramped up. What did you think of his play? When he had to
leave there for several minutes how do you think that impacted Arkansas?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think he did a great job getting his shot off. I know he drew
a couple fouls from the 3-point line, and kind of got him going. And Coach
mentioned he had scored like 10 points in three and a half minutes or
something like that.  
  
So he was definitely one of the guys we wanted to contain the best way we
could. And when he got out of the game I think they kind of didn't have that
3-point threat, I guess, you could say. Because he does great creating the
shot like that. So I think together for us as Carolina, we came together at
the end of the game, and we really did a great job of getting stops.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Just picking up what he said, we just did a great job at the
end of defending. He came back in. And I think we did a good job of containing
him. One time he came off a ball screen and Kennedy got up, and just had a
hand up. And he ended up shooting an air ball.  
  
So I think towards the end we dug in and we knew that he was hot and that he
was capable of hitting the 3. So we just tried to take away that. And the
easiest thing is just deny him the ball, to not let him get it. And I think we
did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Either of you guys, the last 2:56, I think, it was you guys went on a
12-0 run. It appeared that happened at the same time that the Tar Heel fans in
the crowd woke up. Did you feel any extra energy from the crowd in the last
three minutes of the game?  
JOEL BERRY II: Our crowd got into it, but it's because we changed our play,
and they saw us digging in on the defensive end. They were just behind us.
They've done a great job of supporting us this year. Even though we're in
South Carolina, you know, they all came out. And I think once they saw us
digging in on the defensive end and playing better, I mean, they got involved.  
  
I mean, it's hard to get involved when the team's not playing well. So, like
Coach said, we played better and they got involved and it helped us out and it
pushed us through.  
  
Q. Either of the players, Coach used the word fortune and lucky a few
times. Do you guys feel fortunate and lucky to still be alive?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I definitely think we feel blessed because of how hard we
worked. I think Coach pushes us every day in practice, especially on the
defensive end to get better and better each time. And we have a drill. I mean,
86-80, we're down three points and you gotta find a way to -- yeah, three
minutes and you're down six. What did I say?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: You said 86-80, down three. He's better in math than that.
It's 86-80, we're down with three minutes to play.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: So I think that's what definitely came into play today and we
did a tremendous job of remembering the things that we do in practice to
capitalize on those opportunities.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: The last seven possessions we scored six times. The last seven
possessions they didn't score. So that's some toughness there, too. I'll still
say I feel lucky. But you know what? Luck is -- what's that old saying --
preparation meets opportunity. And the guys stepped up and made some plays
too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have anything to add to that?  
  
JOEL BERRY II: No ma'am.  
  
Q. Joel, just a quick question here. The last few games have not been
your best shooting performances of the season. Are you thinking about doing
anything differently in preparation for the Sweet 16?  
JOEL BERRY II: Definitely not. I mean, sometimes the ball doesn't go in.
Sometimes it does. And I felt like I started out the game, I mean, I hit two
3s in the first half but it just wasn't falling for me. But way back early in
the season when I had that bad game at Miami, you know, Coach told me, don't
let the ball going in dictate how you're playing.  
  
So I just tried to help my team out in different ways. I mean, I had assists.
I was trying to dig in on the defensive end, and I just took that lesson and I
just, I learned from it. And that's what I'm trying to do.  
  
And it helped us today. I mean, it just wasn't falling for me, but I felt like
for myself I helped my team out in a different way.  
  
Q. The two players, your defense changed dramatically in the last four
minutes. Is it the fact of looking at the scoreboard saying, hey, this doesn't
change our season any? How do you explain the defense going from what it was
for large sections of that game to the way you played in the last three and a
half minutes?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think we just dictated what we wanted them to do instead of
letting them attack us and doing what they want them to do. I think in those
three minutes we forced them into bad shots. The shot clock got down late. And
they just took bad shots.  
  
And, I mean, we're capable of playing great defense like that. But sometimes
we just take plays off. But this isn't the time to do that. But that last
three or four minutes we did a good job of just digging in and just realizing,
you know, winner stays and the loser goes home.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Do I have anything to add? No, ma'am, I do not. (Laughter).  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Isn't life great when you win?  
  
Q. Kennedy and Joel, can you both describe whatever that was that, Joel,
it was your shot, and then Kennedy's tip-in that was key there, late?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think Joel showed a great deal of savvy for trying to get the
ball to the goal, because he knew me and Isaiah would be on the offensive
glass. I just so happened to be in the right position. And Coach always tells
us, when the shot goes up to try to get in front of the defender and you have
an easier rebound. So that's what I did. And the ball just fell in my hands.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, it was a horrible shot on my part, but I just tried my
best to get it up on the backboard and just so happened Kennedy was there to
make up for it, so I've got to thank him for that.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Joel said he meant to pass it that way. They didn't give him
the assist, though.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Roy, Theo was saying in the locker room that the team learned that it
can win this type of game and hadn't been in a game like that where it needed
to do that. What are those lessons that you learn from your team when you win
a game like that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think it gives you confidence, first. I think it also
teaches you to play every single possession. I told them don't look at the
score, just play every possession. Let's get the best shot we can get. Let's
get a stop on the defensive end and let's do it again.  
  
And I did, I pushed a little bit. I was a little fired up about being
involved. You lose yourself in the game. There's so much time to play. And,
again, I think it was 3:47, you guys may have a play-by-play, I think it was
3:47 on the clock when we had the timeout. But I think you gain so much from
that because the more you focus, the more you concentrate, the harder you
play, good things are going to happen to you.  
  
And then, again, we got good shots except for that one possession. And we work
on tips every other practice. We've done it 46 times this year because we've
had 92 practices.  
  
And Kennedy could have caught it with both hands. It would have made me feel a
heck of a lot better if he hadn't just tipped it with his left hand but it
went in.  
  
Q. We hear a lot about Joel Berry and Justin Jackson and their
leadership on this team. But Kennedy Meeks has come up big. Can you talk about
his leadership and his role on this squad as a leader and senior?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Kennedy does see the big picture. He's very, very bright. I
was very upset with him at half because he had all kinds of shots around the
basket and he was hurrying his shot like he was being intimidated, missing the
easy ones around. So and I jumped him a little bit at that time.  
  
But I thought he did do a better job and was much better defensively for us in
the second half, particularly the last three or four minutes. But when you
think about it having over a thousand rebounds in your career, he's been a
big-time player for us for a long time.  
  
Q. I was wondering what you thought of Macon's play. I guess he cramped
up and had to leave for several minutes. Maybe how you think that impacted the
game when he had to go out?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The guys said it well. He was hurting us. He made ten points
in three possessions. He made the 3 right in front of me. He got fouled
because we didn't get him picked up. We had a mistake on the matchups. Then
Kennedy fouled him and he made three. And then Kennedy didn't get up to him
and he made three. So he scored ten points on three possessions.  
  
So we talked at halftime, he had 12 points but we gave 10 of them on three
possessions. We needed to get up to him, and you can't allow somebody to jump
up and shoot it in your face. And you can't foul if a guy is shooting a
3-point shot.  
  
I noticed he was out at that point. I didn't know he was cramping up or
anything like that. But I think that -- early I think he made two or three
baskets, the first four or five minutes of the second half, too. So late he
didn't make much. And that was probably because of his legs.  
  
And for us I can't worry about somebody else's problems, because I was worried
about Joel Berry going 2-for-13 because he didn't have his legs under him
either. But it was big for us that he got hurt.  
  
Q. In the first half you shot 43 percent from the 3 and second 14.3
percent. What led to that change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Neither one of them are very good. 4-for-10 is not what we say
-- if we could do that and make it 8-for-20, I'd take it. But you've got to
credit Arkansas' defense. I think they were the dominating factor until the
last four minutes of the game. To me I think their defense was stronger than
their offense. They got us rushing shots.  
  
We had a couple of wide open there. I thought Justin missed a wide-open one
from the corner. Then they go down and make a 3 immediately. So we missed some
but we made some too. As a matter of fact I was looking, it says that Nate
Britt was 0-for-2. I thought he made a 3 from the far corner, but I guess it
was a 2.  
  
Q. The defense the last three and a half minutes, what did you see as
kind of what changed your defense? Was it just because you guys finally
realized the season was on the line?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No we were more active. We did a better job of screen on the
ball. The big guy was getting up there. We did a better job getting over the
screen. Mike knows this better than I do because I don't coach his team. Maybe
they got a little conservative and then when the shot clock's winding down,
then all of a sudden the shots get to be more difficult.  
  
And we did have -- I don't think anybody had a wide-open shot in the last four
minutes. Every shot they took was challenged. I thought they went to the
monitor to see if we had partially blocked that when it went out, but Kennedy
said he didn't touch it and it went out. Okay. Guys, thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 88, Duke - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
COACH MARTIN: Unbelievably proud of my guys. You know, they put up with me,
which is not easy to do. And they've become mentally tough, as mentally tough
can be. For us to be able to play against a team like Duke and play so well on
the big stage says a lot about the character of our team.  
  
I've got unbelievable respect for Duke, for Coach K, for how they play, for
what he's done for the game. I've told him this in private: He impacted a
young high school coach who was the son of Cuban immigrants to want to do this
for a career. And it's an unbelievable moment for me personally. But so proud
of these guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you could each take a turn, as it got down to the final minutes,
did you ever allow yourself to think that you were moving on or was it just
about the next possession, next play?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Next play. The game still wasn't over. As long as there's
time is still on the clock the game is not over. We play to the 00:00. The
whole time as the time was winding down was to finish the game, one possession
at a time, just finish the game and make our free throws.  
  
DUANE NOTICE: Like Sindarius said, with the time on the clock felt like an
eternity was going by. We wanted to make sure we stuck to our principles and
we kept our composure. The coaches did a good job to make sure our emotions
didn't get too high.  
  
CHRIS SILVA: Like Sindarius and Duane said, when the game was going on, if the
clock wasn't over, the game wasn't over. So we was focusing on making our free
throws and following the game play.  
  
Q. Sindarius, what changed after going, like, shooting, like, 2-out-
of-22 to the end of the first half, and then score points 65 in the second
half? What clicked for you guys?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We just made shots. Got the ball inside. Chris did a
great job of just posting up and we just fed him. And he played good for us
the second half. Chris was the difference in the second half. He showed up big
time for us.  
  
Q. Sindarius, the other night you set up here and talked about how much
it meant just to win a game in this tournament for this program and this
university. Now that you're going to the Sweet 16, how does that advance what
you guys want to do with this program?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We're not satisfied with just winning one game or this
game. We're in it; why not win it? Why not us? We feel like we can compete
with anybody in the country.  
  
And the goal is not just to win one game or, you know, just to win two games,
the goal is always to win it all. If you win it, why not win it all? And
that's our ultimate goal.  
  
Q. Duane, what can you say about the pressure that you guys put on them?
18 turnovers, I think, and did you see them getting rattled by that?  
DUANE NOTICE: That's just something that we've been doing all year. Playing
under our coach, he does a great job, tremendous job making sure we understand
that defense is our focal point.  
  
And we don't want to let our foot off the gas. When it comes to our defense,
we want to make sure we get into people and pressure them. So when our
defensive intensity is up, it translates to the offensive end.  
  
Q. Chris, can you talk about your second half? Sindarius said he thought
you were the difference. What was the second half like for you? What was
different for you in the second half?  
CHRIS SILVA: Like Sindarius said, I was just posting up. They fed me the ball.
I was making the move and attacking the basket. I was posting up. They did a
great job finding me and giving me the ball, and I was just making a play to
the basket.  
  
Q. Sindarius and Duane, could you both talk about what Felder has given
you the last two games, what he's been contributing?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: He's big. He has the heart of a giant. He doesn't care
who we're playing. He doesn't care how big the guy is, whatever the guy, the
athlete, the guy have or nothing, he just have a heart that he won't stop. He
won't stop. He won't back down for nobody. And for him to be a freshman and to
give us that spark off the bench is tremendous. And he plays a big part of our
team.  
  
DUANE NOTICE: Like Sindarius said, Ra is a guy, he's very confident. He's
electric. It's kind of radiating through the team when he's confident we're
all confident. It's big for him to come into these big stages as a freshman
and play on both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Sindarius, do you guys have to convince yourselves you could win this
game? What was the mindset to get into a positive frame of mind when people
were saying you couldn't win, couldn't win?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We wasn't paying no attention. The whole time we felt
like we can win. The only people that mattered is the people in our circle,
the people that's at practice with us, the people that's been with us from the
jump. They've seen us grind, that's been through everything we've been through
in the season.  
  
Those are the only people that matter, that's the coaches and us players. We
just try to stay with each other and focus with what we have, and nobody else
really matters.  
  
Q. When the brackets first came out, you guys are now advancing, when
the brackets came out everybody was talking about Duke and Villanova regional
at the Garden. A few teams crashed that party. How do you feel about being one
of those teams?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It's big. We are just having fun. We was just happy to be
in the tournament. It didn't matter who we played or anything. We just
celebrate -- we're enjoying the moment and just going out and giving it our
all every game and controlling what we're controlling. And it's our defense
and everything else. Didn't matter who we played. We're just going out and
competing and giving everybody our best shot.  
  
Q. Sindarius, how easy or difficult will it be to try to keep this even-
keeled approach going to the next round, going to the garden to play Baylor?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It's going to be hard. It's one more thing we can to add
on the list that the school hasn't done. But we'll be all right. The coaching
staff is going to do a good job of keeping us level headed, keeping our
composure down and keeping us focused on the task at hand.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Martin.  
  
Q. Coach, Rakym had such a big impact in today's game. And his season
numbers, he had some good games but obviously didn't put up numbers like this.
Why did you trust him so much in tonight's game, and what kind of season has
he had overall?  
COACH MARTIN: For a freshman point guard, he's been phenomenal. He's been a
spark off the bench for us all year. We've won games because he comes in there
and he's aggressive and, like the guys said, he's fearless of the moment. He
loves the big stage.  
  
I needed a New York City point guard. I like New York City guards. That's why
I went and found Rakym. We're lucky he has family in our state. This was his
dream school. Recruiting him might be the easiest recruiting job I've ever
been a part of, the easiest.  
  
And he's become like a son to us, the coaches. He's like a little brother to
Sindarius and PJ. You learn a lot about your freshmen the way your seniors
helped them. Our seniors go out of their way to help him. And it's been like
that from day one. So I know our seniors respect him. I know I respect him. He
gets a little immature on us sometimes, but he's a freshman. Heck, when I was
18, I wouldn't be able to handle the moment the way he does, so a lot of
credit to him.  
  
Q. You said it was the easiest recruitment you had why was that?  
COACH MARTIN: It was his dream school. I had one phone call. Committed without
visiting. Unbelievable. Some of these guys you recruit them for three years
and you don't get them. One phone call. That's all it took. And he wanted to
come. I said, whoa, relax I've gotta do a little legwork here.  
  
And he was in from our first conversation. And that's why he's so committed to
what he's doing. In his heart, he wanted to be a Gamecock. There was no
questions asked. And that's why he is so committed and so proud to be playing
at the school that he dreamt of playing growing up.  
  
Q. In the last 10 minutes or so how much did the last five years have
you thought about it and how much you fought to get to this point?  
COACH MARTIN: A lot. A lot. We've got an unbelievable group of seniors. Those
three guys are phenomenal. When they were freshmen -- Bruce Ellington is a
great leader. He wasn't around. And he was with us for like two weeks. And
then declared for the draft, which I told him he had to do.  
  
And no one was there to help those guys. And they had teammates that didn't
want to deal with the difficult practices and they didn't want to deal with
structure and discipline. Didn't believe in what we were trying to convince
them that we can become. Those three guys stood tall every single day.  
  
And that's why I'm not surprised that we played the way we did in the second
half. Those three guys, think about it, a lot of you guys ask me questions
during the year if I was going to sit Duane Notice. You guys happy I didn't
sit him?  
  
Q. Not to put a damper on your game, but this tournament was moved from
North Carolina because of HB2. And as a lot of fans and some players were
entering the arena, they were met with Confederate flags. I wanted to know
what your thoughts on that?  
COACH MARTIN: It's unfortunate, but it's America. And you think we all agree
on everything? Our state is united. Our state believes in peace and harmony.
That's why this event is being held in our state right now. Our state's
progressive. Our state has incredible people that's about moving forward.  
  
But it's America. We have freedoms. People have freedoms to do whatever they
want to do with themselves and their property. It is what it is.  
  
There's things out there that I don't like. But I can't force people to do
what I want them to do. All I know is this unbelievable university and state
has taken in a son of Cuban immigrants that's married to a Jamaican woman, has
mixed kids, and they've treated me like I'm one of their own from day one.  
  
I wouldn't want to coach in any other state or on any other group of people,
for any other bosses than the ones I've got. Our alums, our community is a
beautiful, beautiful place. It's a united state. Unfortunately things like
that happen but we live in the United States of America. And we don't all
agree on things.  
  
Q. You guys shot 71 percent from the floor in the second half, 4-of-5 on
3s, 90-something percent from the line. Where did that kind of offensive
fluidity come from? Have you seen that a lot in practice? Could you see that
kind of shooting?  
COACH MARTIN: You know, you're asking the question so I'm not coming down on
you. I'm tired of answering as to why we don't shoot more. I'm tired of
answering that question. We wouldn't be in the Sweet 16 if we were a bad
offensive team.  
  
Now, do we shoot 71 percent, what did we shoot, 71 for a half? No, nobody
does. But that's why they call this thing March Madness. I was extremely happy
at halftime. I told our guys, someone's gotta have courage and make shots.  
  
Today we settled for some 3s that we didn't need to settle for. We did today.
Yesterday we didn't. Today we did. We stopped that. And we got production from
our big guys at the rim, which then made their defense collapse and allowed us
to then get better looks.  
  
Then, again, we don't shoot -- was it the Alabama game that we were 3-for-30
or something in the one half? Like 71 percent is an abnormality? 3-for-30 is
an abnormality. We're somewhere in there. We're better on defense but we're a
good defensive team. And we play better on offense. That's why we're playing
next week. If not we wouldn't be in this tournament to start with.  
  
Q. Not to go back about your offense again, but you scored seven baskets
in the first half. But you held them to eight. Are you going to the locker
room thinking we've got the tempo and we've got a way we can guard them that
can give us a chance here?  
COACH MARTIN: Our guys were very, very nervous. This is a new platform. It's
the first time in the history of our university that we're going to the Sweet
16. Our guys were nervous to start the game. They were a little too -- I was
nervous for our guys to start the game.  
  
Once the half started to settle down, I was happy with how we were defending.
I thought we shot some quick 3s that we didn't need to shoot. Unlike
yesterday, yesterday I thought we shot good 3s. Today that was not part of
what we were trying to do.  
  
I think at halftime -- we're very positive. You can't have these kids that
have been through what they've been through for four years to build this
program, and go in at halftime and doubt in who they are. We were very
positive at halftime, like we are 99 percent of the time.  
  
And they responded. They came out. We attacked the paint. Duane Notice drove
the ball, got it to the rim. PJ made some shots. And then Ra Felder jumped up
and made that 3, and that made everybody feel better. And Duane makes one and
Sin makes one and everybody felt better.  
  
But at the end of the day, in the second half we didn't pull the trigger on
the 3s and we attacked the rim. And we as coaches kept telling the players,
they're in a little bit of foul trouble; they're attack the rim. They're in
foul trouble.  
  
And I gotta say, you guys have asked about Chris Silva, second half. I'm
harder on Chris Silva than anyone on our team because he can be so good and
he's just learning the game. He played like a grown man in the second half,
not like a little sophomore but a grown man. And a lot of respect for Chris
the way he accepts coaching every single day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jayson Tatum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32867)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 88, Duke - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The very first thing, I want to congratulate Frank and his
team. They played a heck of a game. You know, it's the toughest defense we've
played against all year. Very physical, actually the most physical game we've
been in all year. But that's how hard they play and I thought our kids played
hard, too.  
  
And they played better. But not harder. And I'm proud of my guys. I've loved
-- I've absolutely loved coaching this group. I've never had a year like this.
With all the injuries, with everything, but never a problem with attitude.
These kids have really grown in to be men.  
  
And I wish I could coach them more. I'm glad they became champions last week.
And they were a close-knit group. And they did a hell of a job for us. So I'm
proud of them. I'm just disappointed that we couldn't go further.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Grayson, obviously you guys came into the season with high
expectations, and it hasn't been easy. But what was going through your mind in
the final five minutes there; you guys had so many comebacks in Brooklyn, what
was your mentality there?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I felt like we could come back all the way to the very end of
the game. We've done it so many times before. And so I know all it took was a
few shots and a few stops. But South Carolina, they did a great job of
knocking down their free throws down the stretch. And they kept the game away
from us. And, you know, they didn't turn it over. So it made it tough to come
back.  
  
Q. Grayson, did you guys feel like at halftime that maybe you'd missed
an opportunity because they had shot so poorly and yet it was still a single
digit game?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: We thought we played good defense in the first half. But they
did, too. They're a very good defensive team. So it's not an easy task to
score on them. And that's what allowed them to keep the game closer in the
first half. And that's what really opened it up in the second half for them,
too, is their defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the second half, was it South Carolina making shots, or did you
feel like you guys weren't contesting enough of them?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I thought we were playing our butts off. And it was a real,
we got worn down. It's the most physical game we've been in all year. And then
we were in a lot of foul trouble. So you just try and patch up, put -- I wish
we had some of that tape that doesn't let water into the boat.  
  
And just trying to do anything you can, because the game, the game was very
complex in the second half with the fouls. Again, they had fouls too. I'm just
saying we've played about seven guys and so you're juggling a little bit, just
juggling a little bit.  
  
Q. There's a lot of red eyes in the locker room. What do you say in the
locker room after a stunner like that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Before you were able to come in there, I told them I love
these guys. I'm proud of them. I'm disappointed that we didn't win tonight.
But at the end of the season I want my guys to either be crying because we've
lost or crying because we've just won.  
  
And it shows that if you're not doing one of those, that means you never
really became a team. It was never really that important. And for these guys,
they were a really good team. This is one of the most proud teams for me
because all the stuff.  
  
You all keep talking about expectations. I mean, look, a lot of these kids
were just hurt at the start of the year and whatever. And they never used it
as an excuse. And they became close. And so I just told them -- I told them I
love them and I'm proud of them. I wish I could keep coaching them this year.
But that's not going to happen.  
  
Q. What makes South Carolina so tough defensively? And I guess just what
did they do to you guys on that end that was so hard to deal with?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, first of all, they're well-coached. And they not only
are good technique-wise, but they add heart. They add toughness. They add all
the intangibles that go with great technique. And then they're all committed
to it. And they played it at a high level, and the game was a very physical
game. And they adapted well to it, and we adapted okay to it. Not as well as I
would like.  
  
But they're a terrific defensive team. Frank does a great job with his team.
And whoever he brought in, they're committed to playing that end of the court.
And because of their depth and their age, they're a little bit older, they put
it out there. It's tough to play against, obviously. Tonight it was tough to
play against. And we tried and came close, but we weren't good enough.  
  
One last thing, I'd like to thank the organizing committee, the people of
Greenville for hosting it. It was, wherever you went, people were pleasant.
They were proud to have the NCAA Tournament here. All the volunteers, everyone
greeted you with a smile. They were terrific. And we're very appreciative of
that. And just to say thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

### [Manuale Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33000)

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 72, Arkansas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: We came to dance, not to do the one step. We wanted to bust up
some brackets here today. Close -- you don't get -- close don't get it done.
But congratulations to North Carolina. They made the plays they had to. They
got to the free-throw line an awful lot of times.  
  
But at the end of the day, I just thought they made more plays than we did. I
thought we had some bad-decision making going down the stretch. And you can
credit that to their defense, but you can also credit it to our guys just
making the wrong decision.  
  
I just thought we ran out of time. Heck of a ballgame. Again, a lot of people
had us even dead and buried in this game here. But these guys here, they're
hurting right now and they're hurting for the right reason. They came in here
to win and move on in the NCAA Tournament. We're disappointed in that.  
  
But I'm so proud of these guys and what they've done this year. Even as we've
come to the conclusion of some of our guys' careers -- Moses, Dusty Hannahs
and of course Manuale Watkins. Those guys have meant a whole lot to our
program. These two guys here, they've been here -- for the two times we've
been in the tournament to play North Carolina. It was a distinct difference
than it was the last time we played. It was a big-time difference.  
  
So congratulations to them. And, but I'm telling these guys here -- Daryl, the
whole team -- I'm real proud of these guys and what they came out and
accomplished this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Daryl, looked like you were cramping up. What was the problem and how
frustrating was that because you obviously had it going? Then you had to sit
out for a while. I assume you weren't 100 percent when you came back in?  
DARYL MACON: It happens. I don't know how I started cramping. It just
happened. I wish I was out there helping my team win. It hurts losing like
this, but it is what it is.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: He played hard. That's why. He played hard. He left his heart
out on the floor. I think that's what causes cramping. We saw a lot of our
guys, they left it out on the floor.  
  
Q. All three guys, you had them 65-60. Did you think you've got them?
And what did you think happened those last about three and a half minutes that
turned it?  
MANUALE WATKINS: I don't think we thought we had them. We just didn't execute
on offense down the stretch. We turned the ball over a few times. And, I mean,
like I said, we just really didn't execute when we had the lead and we made
it, kind of played on our heels a little bit instead of attacking and trying
to score. We just didn't execute down the stretch, and that's on us.  
  
Q. If the other guys can talk about that, too. And Daryl, when you came
back in, you got the ball but they were just swarming you. How tough a
possession was that with about a minute something left? And if Moses could
talk about the end of the game, too.  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Just like Coach said, we didn't execute at the end of the game
and we didn't get some stops that we needed. That's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Daryl, you came back in, but they just swarmed you. You had to kind
of heave up a 3 there with the shot clock running down. What was that
possession like? Obviously a tough deal.  
DARYL MACON: I just dribbled the ball and the shot clock ran down. And I just
had to jack something up just to get it out of my hands. We didn't come out
and execute that possession as well as we have been doing the entire game. So
we have those type of plays. And I just had to get it out of my hands, so I
shot it.  
  
Q. Was Carolina's defense, was their intensity different the last four
minutes of the game? Seemed like they kind of realized their season was there
on the line there late.  
DARYL MACON: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. Do you think Carolina's defense changed the last four, five minutes
of the game? Seemed like they picked up the intensity, were doing things
differently.  
DARYL MACON: No.  
  
MANUALE WATKINS: I mean, I just think it was on us. They're a great team. And
their backs were against the wall. They made the plays to win the game.
They're a 1 seed. They showed it.  
  
But I just think it was we didn't execute. And I mean that's that. We had the
game. We just didn't make the right plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Six minutes to go or so in the first half you guys were down by 14 or
15 points, I believe. And as Coach indicated, a few people I think were
writing you off at that point. What kind of adjustments did you make midstream
there to kind of get back into it and make a game of it?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: We've been down before. We've been down several times during
the season. We've been down the row, 15 in a row, 12 in a row.  
  
So it doesn't matter. The way we play, we're going to get stops and we're
going to score. I feel like that's what happened. Coach put some people out
there that had some energy and we got in our press and we got some steals. And
we had a run. We get some stops and we're going to score. And that's what we
did.  
  
MANUALE WATKINS: Like Mo said, we started playing our brand of basketball. We
got down 16 or whatever it was, and we got some energy guys in there and
started playing real Razorback basketball, real Hog basketball. That's what
got us in the game. We went to what we've been doing all year. We never panic
when we get down.  
  
Q. Manny, two-parter, I thought Beard played his best game in a long
time and Bailey played a lot of minutes. Can you comment on each one of those
guys' contributions tonight?  
MANUALE WATKINS: They came to play. Big stage, they weren't scared, obviously.
They came, gave it all they had, played hard. And I mean that's all you can
say. They just played hard and they're ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Mike, if Daryl doesn't cramp up, do you think that there's a
different outcome? And how much did that impact you guys when he had to come
out there at crunch time?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he played so hard, he just cramped up. That means it's
gotta be somebody else to step up for us. Should've, could've, would've, you
could say it all you want to. But we had some guys out there that could have
made the plays. And unfortunately we didn't make them.  
  
Q. I'm guessing you probably notice that you didn't get in the bonus
during the game.  
COACH ANDERSON: We shot eight free throws. I noticed that. And I don't know if
North Carolina plays good defense, they don't play great defense. They had
three fouls. And we're an attacking team. We were attacking. There were some
opportunities where we were in the fastbreak mode we were attacking, getting
to the basket. But it was called that way and of course our guys gotta play
through that.  
  
Q. Okay. So you did get that far, I kind of figured you would, but what
was your view of the Joel Berry play that ended up with Kennedy Meeks tipping
the ball in?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought he ran over one of our guys. If he didn't, he
traveled. I thought he did the one-step. I couldn't hardly see it.  
  
But I know we had a guy that was in place there. And he tipped it in. I think
that gave them a 3-point lead. I thought we played great defense at that time.  
  
That wasn't the difference in the game. I just thought we had some bad
turnovers at the wrong time or we didn't get a good shot.  
  
And as you said, we didn't even get to the free-throw line -- we weren't even
in 1-1. We had three fouls. And the first one was probably caused in the first
minute of the second half.  
  
So there's a lot of things you can look back and say that. But at the end of
the day they survived and they advanced.  
  
Q. Could you first talk about how you thought Beard played and maybe he
helped with Daryl down a little bit. And then you played Adrio Bailey a lot of
minutes. What went into that? He seemed like he handled it pretty well.  
COACH ANDERSON: Those two guys came in -- and I think somebody was talking
about what took place in that first half, we were down 14.  
  
We put some energy guys in there who were focusing on the defense and really
just disrupting. And we got our fastbreak going and deflecting passes. And all
of a sudden the game sped up, and that's more to our liking. And Adrio was a
part of that.  
  
So we started him off the second half as well. But I thought Beard looked like
the old Beard that helped us out there after leading, calming guys down,
making big plays, just getting dirty. I thought we got dirty. It's just
unfortunate we didn't pull it off.  
  
Q. I guess just you had a great season, tough ending, how would you sum
up the season and maybe look ahead a little bit?  
COACH ANDERSON: It's kind of hard to sum it up right now. I'm really kind of
pissed, no -- I'm kind of not necessarily ticked off, but it's just one of
those things, you had something in your hand and you let it get away.  
  
But I thought these guys gave me everything they had. I mean, when you think
about -- they had a special year. When you're talking about seven guys who
have never donned a Razorback uniform, to come in, mesh in with five or six
guys who were holdovers from last year and to win 26 games, I think the
second-most in the last 20-some-odd years.  
  
And not only that, took probably one of the top teams in the country, led them
for the most part in a game in the NCAA Tournament to go to the Sweet 16.
Playing good basketball.  
  
I thought our defense -- offensively we probably weren't in sync. But I
thought our defense in the second half in this game was outstanding, even the
first half.  
  
We had North Carolina on their heels for the most part. But they did what an
experienced team do: They made the plays going down the stretch.  
  
When you look at our team, we did some of the things that an inexperienced
team does in this format. Because you've got to remember, this is a one-and-
done. It's over with. It's different pressure than the SEC Tournament or a
regular season game.  
  
But these guys here, I'll tell you what, they're a special group. I think the
Razorback Nation, and even the nation got a chance to see them. Because a lot
of people didn't even think we had a chance to come here.  
  
But I beg to differ. I know my guys. I know me. I like to win. So I'm proud of
them for coming out and really just leaving it all on the floor. It was an up-
and-down game. But we just came up a little short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
