# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Donte DiVincenzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32854)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Villanova - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova University head coach, Jay Wright, as well
as Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart. We'll open with a statement.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Great college basketball game. Just fun to be a part of it, and
give Wisconsin a lot of credit. They played a great game. I'm proud of our
guys. We played tough, battled. These were what NCAA Tournament games come
down to. Down the stretch, they made two great offensive plays, two great
defensive stops, and that was the difference in the game.  
  
We knew it was going to be a tough game because we have so much respect for
them and they deserved it. They got it but we played hard, too. I was proud of
our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Donte as well as Josh.  
  
Q. Josh, on the last offensive play for you guys, was that inbound
supposed to go to Jalen, and what did you see after you received the inbounds
play?  
JOSH HART: Yeah. We wanted to get the ball to Jalen and go down to the half
court and run a play. You know, they picked us up full court, and we couldn't
get it to him, passed it to me, and we went into a ball screen. But Wisconsin
made a heck of a defensive play.  
  
Q. Josh, the accomplishments of the senior class are going to live
forever. Obviously it's hard to look back at that right now in this moment,
but just the idea that you guys aren't going to be on the court together as a
group, how difficult is that to sort of accept or process right now?  
JOSH HART: I'm always going to be with my brothers. I'm not going to be there
on the court making plays with them, but I'm going to be talking to them all
of the time, texting them, face-Timing them. They're my brothers for life
regardless what happened this year. We're close on and off the court, and that
bond is never going to be broken, so that is what it is. But I guarantee, you
know, I'm going to be closer to them to the day I die.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for how student-athletes?  
  
Q. Yeah, for Josh, just you're down there, you're behind, sort of five,
six, seven minutes into the second half and it seemed like you guys just
started getting downhill. Can you talk about getting that lead by -- I mean,
was it a kind of conscious effort. I know that's what you do, but get it to
the rim more and you kept scoring that way?  
JOSH HART: We always want to be aggressive. We always want to try to get into
the paint. And for a good couple minutes, we were doing that, and we were able
to get it in the lane, either make a lay-up, or get fouled. So, give them all
the credit. They're a heck of a team. They made great adjustments. That's what
it is, but we just tried to be aggressive, really.  
  
Q. For Donte, you guys went up 57-50. Did you feel at that point like
the intensity level dropped because that's -- it seemed like maybe you had
things in control at that point but then they were able to make the
comeback?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I don't think the intensity dropped for us. I think we were
intense on defense the whole game. They just made a heck of a play down the
stretch. Their shots went in. Offensively, we executed and so did they. They
went on a little run, but I don't think the intensity dropped at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Donte, Josh, thanks for your time. Appreciate it. And we'll
open for questions for Coach Wright.  
  
Q. Jay, kind of the same question I asked Josh. It's always difficult at
this moment, but the perspective of the senior class that you're losing,
pretty remarkable run that they had, winningest all-time, I think. And for you
to accept that you're not going to have those guys in your gym as well?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. Three of the -- Josh and Kris and Darryl are three of the
greatest Villanova basketball players of all time. Their class is going to go
down as the most successful class in Villanova history. But what we take pride
in at Villanova even more is all three of them will graduate on time, all
three of them, on the court, good times, bad times, always conducted
themselves extremely well, represented Villanova well. Off the court, big part
of our student body, great Villanovans. To be that successful on the court and
really represent the University like they do, is something special. We told
our younger guys that that's what you want to be. That's what you want to be
as a Villanova basketball player. You want to be like Kris and Josh and
Darryl.  
  
Q. Jay, same question I asked Josh about you're playing on the last
play, what did they do to just bottle up Jalen. I guess you were trying to get
it in to him?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. It's simple for us. If they let us get it to Jalen, we're
going to run a play. If they don't, we're going to get it to Josh or Donte and
run a middle ball screen. Josh got -- down two, we got all of the way to the
rim, and that's what you want to do. You want to be aggressive going at the
rim and try to score and get fouled. They made a great defensive play.  
  
Q. And also, when it was 57-50, you guys only had one basket after that,
and five points in the last five and change. What did they do to just bottle
you up and try to keep you from scoring?  
JAY WRIGHT: The game -- from 57-50 the game really got shortened. They had a
couple of possessions where they got an offensive rebound. They had another
possession where the shot clock went down to zero, and then there was a foul
called at the shot clock, so they got a whole other possession. So there
weren't that many possessions.  
  
We just had a couple -- I think that's what the game came down to. We had a
couple empty possessions at the end, and they had two great possessions, the
one by Nigel Hayes driving the baseline, and that one baseline out of bounds
when Koenig hit the three was huge. That's what close games come down to.
We've been on the other end of that a lot. And when another team steps up and
makes those plays and two great players like Koenig and Hayes make those
plays, you got to give them credit.  
  
Q. Two years ago, No. 1 seed, lost in the same round. We look at a
three-year window, you've won the championship but you were also eliminated in
the second round twice. You talk about how difficult this tournament is,
knowing first hand the highs and lows of it all?  
JAY WRIGHT: First, there should be nothing negative about this tournament.
This is the greatest, I think, sporting event in our country. You know, just
being in it, I say this every year to our team. I say this every year at
Villanova, we can't take it for granted. It's so special to be a part of it.
Every time you win and you get a chance to advance, cherish it. You're playing
the best teams in the country. You're going to come down to games like this,
you know? We had a game like this against Kansas last year and we came out of
the good side of it. We had a game like this against N.C. State last year, and
we had a shot to win it and we missed it.  
  
To me, there's no dishonor in losing in this tournament but I do know that --
and we've lived through it. You are judged by how you play in this tournament
and that's the reality of it. So, you have to accept it.  
  
Q. Could you just sort of comment on Koenig's performance and their
ability to get him the ball and get him decent looks?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I thought the biggest play was when he came off that
baseline out-of-bounds and hit a three. That's a breakdown on our part, but
it's also great execution on their part, you know? You know they're going to
them based on out-of-bounds and he set his man up as -- he goes out opposite,
sometimes, sometimes he comes out the same side. And he set his man up like
he's was going out opposite, and he beat us on it. And that was a big play.  
  
And we had shut that down all during the game, but again that's where you got
to give them credit. It's great execution, great job, great coaching job, and
that's how you win and lose these close games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great senior class.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you, guys.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 83, Notre Dame - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by victorious West Virginia University head coach, Bob
Huggins, and student-athletes Jevon Carter, Daxter Miles, Jr., and Tarik
Phillip.  
  
Congratulations, guys, on advancing to the Sweet 16. We're going to go right
to questions for the student-athletes and then we'll release them and have
questions for Coach Huggins after that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this back court that you guys form and what you
thought about in the beginning of the year and what you showed today?  
JEVON CARTER: All year we've been telling ourselves that we got the best group
of guards in the country, and we truly believe that. So, when it's time for us
to play, we go out there and give it our all. Sometimes it worked. But we
going to put forth 100 percent and we're going to live and die with it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other comments on that?  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: He pretty much said it all. We believe that we put in a lot of
work in the summertime. We came in believing that we were a tough group of
guards, and we just got to go out and show it.  
  
Q. Just wondering how important was you guys getting off to that huge
start right off the bat and smacking them in the mouth right away. How much
did that do for your confidence and what did it do to get you in the game?  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: It was great flow from the start, and we've been having
some really good practices leading up to the tournament. I don't know, man,
that was just great flow on both sides, offense and defense.  
  
JEVON CARTER: I wouldn't say it's a confidence booster because whoever steps
on the court, we feel like we can beat them. We just got hot early and we just
kept going from there.  
  
Q. Jevon, obviously, you guys are known, especially in the back court,
for your defense, but today your offense was impressive as well. Do you guys
carry a little bit of a chip on your shoulder because you don't get as much
attention for that as you deserve?  
JEVON CARTER: Definitely. We keep that chip on our shoulder. A wise man once
said, remember where you come from, and we always keep that in the back of our
mind. All three of us up here, it wasn't an easy path to get here to West
Virginia. We had to grind it out every step of the way, and when we get on the
court, that gives us a chance to show it prove that other schools missed out
on us.  
  
Q. To jump on what Dana just said, Tarik, if you could talk about that,
you just said big chip. It's almost like there's a notion out there that you
guys can't play offense, but you have some good, really good shooters, on this
team.  
TARIK PHILLIP: Yeah. We do. First couple years here, they thought of us as
defensive players, you know? But Coach, the coaching staff instilled a lot of
confidence in us and helped us develop our offensive game and we became pretty
good offensive players.  
  
Q. Daxter, for you to start, and I guess Jevon, Tarik, you can follow
up. They were known as a team that didn't turn it over a whole lot. You got
ten the first half and sort of set the tone. Did you feel your press was good
against them no matter how good they are normally handling such pressure?  
DAXTER MILES, JR.: The Irish, that's a great program, you know, great coach.
Today, like I said, it was a great flow, defensively and offensively. I think
all five guys was on the same page early into the game. That gave us extra
confidence leading -- you know, as the game went on and we just took it from
there.  
  
Q. Guys, did you feel out there that they were wearing down the -- you
know, bringing in a bunch of people? Did you feel that they were starting to
wear down?  
JEVON CARTER: Yeah, definitely. That's what we pride ourselves on. We go 11,
12, deep, 13 sometimes, and other teams only play six, seven, eight people.
So, we was always told that our 15 is better than their 15, so we get into
that bench, that's a bonus for us.  
  
Q. Any of you guys can answer this because you all were on the
perimeter. Were you surprised how much room that you had on the perimeter,
whether or not they respected your outside game enough?  
JEVON CARTER: Yeah. I guess you can say that. We just play, man. We knew they
was small, trying to get inside to our bigs a lot, play inside out. And we
knew they was going to have a hard time guarding us.  
  
Q. So, Tarik, do you guys ever get tired of hearing about foul shooting?
Obviously, again tonight, like yesterday, you guys were really good at the
line to seal it there?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Coaches always said turnovers and free throws is going to
determine ball games with us. So when we go to the line, we just got to step
up, man up, and hit free throws.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks very much for your time. Congratulations.
We'll now open up for questions for Coach Huggins. Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering, I know you expected this from the back
court, even before the season, but is this the best you've seen of the total
back court all year?  
BOB HUGGINS: There was a sportswriter in West Virginia who put a poll out: Are
we top 20, are we top 50, are we top 100? And I shared that with our guys, and
our guys goes, top 100. And we used that as kind of a source of motivation.
Did I know they were that good? I know this, they put an enormous amount of
time in. They're in the practice facility 12 months out of the year and, you
know, it's great when you don't have to kind of tell people to go in there.
They go in there.  
  
And you can see -- I mean Tarik came in not a very good shooter. He's a pretty
good shooter now. J.C. came in and was not real consistent. He's pretty
consistent now. And I think, you know, Nate, Elijah's put a lot of time in, a
lot more time than what he once did. So they deserve a lot of credit for it.
They want to get better. They want to get better and they want to win. They
get tired of people talking down about them, honestly.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.  
  
Q. After the first two days of the tournament, the prevailing fan
sentiment about the tournament is there haven't been a lot of big upsets. I'm
sure in this case you're pleased with that. I wonder if you can speak
generally from someone who's been involved in so many tournaments how
important it feels this year and how important that is to a good tournament?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think the TV people would tell you, if they're honest, they'd
rather have West Virginia and Notre Dame than they would a smaller school,
because the numbers are going to be better. I mean that's pretty much a fact.
I mean, you have an upset, so they have to play it and they play it and they
play it, and then they have a meeting on Monday and they say, what the hell
just happened? I mean, that's the reality of it all. So, does it make it a
better tournament? I don't know. I don't know if it does or it doesn't.  
  
Q. You guys take obviously so much pride in your defense. Do you ever
quietly kind of laugh to yourself because you know what this team can do
offensively when there's so much attention paid to the defensive side. This
team's really good offensively.  
BOB HUGGINS: We just today broke the school record for points in a season, and
we're averaging 82 a game. I did the pre-game radio show and Tony said, you
know, there's people saying that you can't score with them. And I said, we're
averaging 82 a game. Now, there's days, honestly, I don't know how we get to
82, but somehow we do. And our guys play so hard, I think it forces other
people to play harder, but I think it also -- people aren't used to playing at
the pace that we play at.  
  
Q. Coach, just your ball movement. What can you say about your ball
movement? You had some stretches nine straight possessions scored. First half,
you have seven of eight and eight of nine. What did you think of that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank God. Because we threw it away four straight times to start
the second half, which we're prone to do as well. When we stay in our stuff,
when we get -- our whole deal with them has been do what you can do. Don't try
to be something you're not. And, you know, we've got post guys now that have
turned into really good post guys because they don't go in and shoot three-
pointers for 20 minutes before practice. They actually go in and work on
shooting jump hooks. And that's been a process; quite frankly, it's been a
process.  
  
Q. And then just your defensive plan against them. I mean, to start the
game, both teams were missing, so there wasn't -- you didn't have a ton of
makes real early where you could put the press on, but it seemed like you
didn't throw the full weight of the half-court traps at them as much as maybe
you did against Bucknell. Thoughts on that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we just wanted to wear them down. We wanted to make them
work really hard at advancing the ball. They shoot the ball so well, it's --
you know, if you trap them and you don't do a good job or you don't make the
right rotation, they're going to make shots. And so we were a little bit
concerned about that. I didn't want to turn them loose. I thought against
Bucknell we did a horrible job of stopping the ball, and so they constantly
were attacking the rim and I didn't want Notre Dame to attack the rim. I
wanted them, quite frankly, to shoot threes, rather than turn them loose in
the pressure.  
  
So that's what we do. We try to make people play the way that kind of the way
we want them to play. It's hard. Mike's a great coach. He's not a good coach,
he's a great coach. And to do what he's done is just phenomenal, and I've got
just a world of respect for him as a coach and as a person.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Coach.  
BOB HUGGINS: Thank you.  
  
Q. In the first game, kind of to piggy-back off this question, you gave
up, I believe 45% from the three-point line, and you did also early in this
game. In the second half you only gave up 30 percent their behind the arc. Did
you credit the traps for that like you were talking about. I know you said you
wanted to shoot threes and were missing them?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. That's probably a better question to ask them. I
don't know. I thought in the first half we didn't really -- we didn't contest
as well as we did in the second half but, you know, I don't know. People tell
me that it would -- it's just the constant having to work hard to get the ball
up the floor, work hard to get open, kind of takes people's legs. But that's a
question really better asked to them than me.  
  
I have a hard enough time trying to figure out what these three knuckleheads
up here were doing rather than worry about what Notre Dame was thinking. I
struggled at figuring out what they're doing, you know?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: Can I say this? Listen. I love Buffalo. I came here in '93, World
University Games, we won. Played Canisius in '07, and we won. Came here in
2010, and we won too. And we just won two now. I love Buffalo. Anytime you
want to invite us to come back, we'll come back. Thank you.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Villanova - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Wisconsin head coach, Greg Gard, as well as
student-athletes, Ethan Happ. Vitto Brown, Nigel Hayes, and Bronson Koenig.  
  
GREG GARD: Obviously, extremely excited beyond -- I don't know if I can put it
into words how happy I am for these guys and their teammates in the locker
room. Just an unbelievable, gutty performance against a terrific team.  
  
You know, we didn't play perfectly, but we played well enough, and we had
enough perseverance to be able to get things done in the amount of time we
had. Just so excited and proud of these guys because they've had to battle
through a lot this year as we've worked and grown through the season together.
So, I'll leave it up to those guys.  
  
Q. Nigel, could you take us through the go-ahead basket and kind of what
you saw during that play?  
NIGEL HAYES: Coach drew up a -- it's kind of a play we run all of the time,
just a side isolation. If you will. Ethan set a screen to try to give me a
little traffic to try to baseline. Went down there to -- I didn't know what
move I was actually going to do before I caught the ball. Just went, did a
fake spin, got to my left hand and fortunately the lay-up went in for us.  
  
Q. Like a wrestling term, you showed intestinal fortitude late. Could
you give us a window, what was the conversation with like 3 seconds to go.  
NIGEL HAYES: Three seconds to go?  
  
Q. It was 3.4. When you guys were up.  
NIGEL HAYES: Did he make his free throw? It was, one, don't foul; Ethan and I
don't foul. And if he makes the flow, try to get them to catch the ball going
towards our basket so we don't give up a Hail Mary because they won a
championship on a shot similar. So we didn't want to give up anything like
that.  
  
Yeah, we wanted to have some composure. We played a really great team, great
team. It took a great effort from us, and we're just proud of ourselves for
getting the job done.  
  
Q. Could you describe the anxiety of sitting on the bench with four
fouls and being able to come back eight of ten shots and get the lead back?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah. I felt terrible, to say the least, when I got my fourth
foul and I was just sitting on the bench trying to be a coach from the bench
and help all our guys out. I knew that's not how my career was going to end. I
knew that when coach gave me the opportunity to get back in there, I was going
to make something happen. So I'm just glad we pulled it out.  
  
Q. For the seniors, a couple Arizona games, Xavier last year, Kentucky,
now this. Lots of us have never been in the situation where we're on the court
in a high-stakes game and figure out how to win. Tell us what it feels like
and if there's something you guys know that we don't know about what it
takes.  
NIGEL HAYES: I think a lot of those games, probably -- excuse me. Correction.  
  
All of those games we've been the underdog. You have all types of your ranking
systems, statistic, analytics guys that they put. The thing is with all those
algorithms, they can't calculate heart, will to win, toughness, desire. They
can't put that into a formula to come out with a percentage chance to win, and
that's the things that we have. The things that we've grown with. We've seen
the older guys, they've had that.  
  
Our best example is Traevon. When we got here, we watched Trae make clutch
shot after clutch shot. Frank did the same thing, and now we're stepping into
their shoes and we're trying to continue.  
  
Q. For Nigel and Ethan, you guys struggled down the stretch last year in
Philadelphia, and ended up turning the ball over to lead to your defeat. How
have you guys, or how have you grown since that loss in Philly especially
against late game situations to pull out with a late win today.  
NIGEL HAYES: Honestly, we've grown a lot. First game, we had eight turnovers,
maybe. We've done a lot better job. Today we still -- we almost gave the game
away. Fortunately, thank the lucky stars, that that wasn't an intentional foul
on me. I did make a play for the ball. I'm glad the ref saw that, but if that
goes intentional foul, he makes those two, they get the ball back, we could
have been talking about a great career that we've had.  
  
Q. Bronson a follow-up to the one earlier. You talked about how tough it
was being on the bench. How proud of you are those guys that were out there
for those eight minutes that kept this game?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I was very proud of them. I think that's something we've done
really well recently. When somebody gets in foul trouble or someone is not
playing well, we've done a lot better of job picking each other up and trying
to stay positive the whole game. At times it does get a little impossible to
do that. We just stick together.  
  
Q. For Ethan, can you describe that defensive sequence, at the end you
got Josh Hart, potential Player of the Year, coming toward you and you stand
your ground and force the turnover. What did you see there?  
ETHAN HAPP: Nigel had him. Nigel picked up and they screened him, so we ended
up switching it. I know he likes to go left and spin back, but he just stuck
to his left hand the whole time and then Vitto came over with great help and I
walled him up and Vitto came over and got the almost tie-up, but ended up
blocking it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Vitto, your thoughts?  
  
VITTO BROWN: Yeah. The way some of the calls were going, we weren't sure if
there would have been a foul in the end and so Ethan did a great job keeping
his hands back and kind of taking the ambiguity out of so they wouldn't call
that foul and then I figured he wasn't paying attention to me, so I I kind of
reached in there and had to hold it strong because DiVincenzo was coming
strong to rip from me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last one for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You were joking yesterday, Bronson made all of the spectacular shots.
Did you figure it was your time?  
NIGEL HAYES: No, he did. We were down three. I was dribbling around the court
aimlessly, and I threw it out to him and he hit the shot. His shot made was
the reason we were able to get the tie and made a couple other big shots late
at the shot clock. I just made a lay-up. Lay-ups are easy. He made the tough
jump shots.  
  
Q. That was an easy reverse?  
NIGEL HAYES: No, I actually thought I missed it. I felt I threw it a little
too hard. Luckily it went in for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, guys. Good luck, moving on.  
  
We'll go ahead and open up questions for Coach Gard. We'll start right down
from here.  
  
Q. There's no formula when to put a guy back in with four fouls. How can
you decide when is the right time to get Bronson back in there?  
GREG GARD: Well, the assistants couldn't decide either. One wanted him to go
back in at 7 minutes. The other said no. I never got Krabbenhoft's vote. I
decided to wait. We were within 7 at that point in time at the eight-minute
media; I think it was 57-50. It wasn't going to get much further and I was
going to have to go back to him.  
  
So once we got to the five-minute mark, I think Trice had struggled with the
previous possession. I said all right it's time to go. Obviously, the kid came
in and played well. There's no set formula. You have to go on gut instinct.
The odds of where you're at, scoring time, how the flow of the game is going,
things like that.  
  
Q. Just taking a quick scroll through my time line walking down here, a
lot of the chatter is about you guys doing the eight seed and getting
selections right or wrong. Do you even care where you were seeded?  
GREG GARD: No. Seeds don't matter. I said that all along. These teams are so
good. At this point, you got 68. I know there's some playing games and things
like that and some automatic qualifiers that they have in the 16 seeds and
things like that. But having been in this long enough, having been a 1, having
been a 2, having been a 12, you know, you just got to go play. Like I said,
there's so much parity, and teams are so good when you get to this time of
year, you just have to lace them up and not worry about that. That's the
approach we've taken.  
  
I told these guys I don't care where we're seeded. We have to win six games.
Let's start with these two this weekend.  
  
Q. Coach, getting back to the question asked of Bronson. How much
anxiety was there when he was out of the game with four fouls, knowing how he
changed the game as he did?  
GREG GARD: As long as we can stay within striking distance, I have a lot of
confidence in my freshman point guard, D'Mitrik Trice. I thought other guys
picked us up too. Pritzi gave some us good minutes. Even though he didn't
score, Iverson was active and did some good things for us.  
  
The bench scoring goes 24-3 in their favor. But I thought we got quality
minutes from guys and were able to stay within striking distance or have the
lead in the first half, and then you got to kind of pick your time. It
happens. It's happened all year.  
  
We've got to deal with somebody at some point in time. You like to avoid it.
But when it does happen, you have a plan and trust the people you prepared to
step in and help us out.  
  
Q. Their last possession, did you assume the ball was going to go to
Hart the entire time?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. Either Hart or Bronson, just what we had seen on film.
They've made so many last second game-winning plays. Going through the film,
just the games of theirs, you look at the tight games and down the stretch how
many game-winning plays they've made. And predominantly it had been in those
two guys' hands or those two guys were somehow involved. Hart hits a big
offensive rebound against Virginia, did he tip one in? If it was him or got it
there late.  
  
But those two guys typically either have the ball in their hands or are
somehow involved in trying to make a play for them.  
  
Q. All right, coach. The question is, your second half defense, Hart and
Brunson were taking it to the rim strong and scoring to get the 57-50 lead and
then you started getting stops. Your assessment of what happened?  
GREG GARD: Well, we got better. We got better at the point of attack of trying
to stop some guys. I thought we got -- we allowed too much of an angle to the
rim at times. And also, you got to give credit where credit's due. Those two
guys are two terrific players. I've watched -- what are they 32-4 -- so 35
games, going through quite a few of them and watching them go downhill on a
lot of people and get the ball in the paint.  
  
I watched Bronson in high school, and know what type of guard he is. And Josh
Hart is a terrific player, too. That's how they played all year. There's been
a lot teams having a hard time keeping them out of the paint, and we were able
to shore it up enough down the stretch to be able to catch them and hang on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any other questions, coach, congrats.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Steve Vasturia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28640)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 83, Notre Dame - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're joined by Notre Dame head coach, Mike Brey, as well
as V.J. Beachem and Steve Vasturia. Open up with a statement from Coach Brey.  
  
MIKE BREY: I thought our start really hurt us. We were in a 10-0 hole. You're
kind of digging out against them the whole day. It was hard to get over it.
Their style of play is hard to deal with. It wore on us at times. Even though
we only turned it over 14 times, four in the second half, it probably caused
us to miss some of those open looks. You're going to have to make some open
looks after you get it out of the trap, and we probably couldn't make enough
of them.  
  
But they're really good. They're really good. They got the look. They can play
for a while. Bob's done an unbelievable job, like reinventing with full-court
pressure. It's brilliant and really a unique preparation to try and deal with
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now for V.J. and Steve only at this time.  
  
Q. For V.J., just offensively, it seemed like a struggle for you
tonight. Just anything in particular that you can point to that gave you
difficulty? Was it what they were doing defensively or was it more your own
thing?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think, you know, my teammates did a great job of finding me
open shots like they usually do. You know today I just wasn't able to knock
them down. You know, of course, they wear you down a little bit. Maybe that's
why some of them were short, but I just didn't knock them down tonight.  
  
Q. Steve, for you, and I guess V.J. as well, in terms of their defense,
obviously their press gets the note. But is it just speeding you up as well as
forcing turnovers that causes you problems?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I think that's the goal of the press. They obviously
want to turn you over. If not, they want to get you out of your rhythm.
Besides our start, I thought we did a pretty good job. We got a bunch of good
looks, Matt, T.J., Greg. We did a good job getting the ball across half court.
Like Coach said, you have to knock down open shots once you get it across half
court, and we didn't make enough of those today.  
  
Q. Steve, did they shock you at all after the start? After that first
series at the beginning, it was a pretty even game. Did the pressure do
something to you guys that took you a while to adjust?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I don't think it shocked us. If you look at those first four,
five possessions, we got really good looks at the basket, we just didn't knock
them down. And those are shots we usually make and we expect to make those
shots. I think that's part of the reason they got off to such a good start and
that's why we were in a little bit of a hole.  
  
Q. Was their offense a bit of a surprise? They're sometimes hot and cold
from the perimeter. Was their ability to hit outside shots a little bit of a
surprise to you?  
V.J. BEACHEM: We know they wanted to bang it inside. They did a decent job of
that. As far as knocking down shots, they really knocked down some big-time
shots especially in the first half, kind of keeping us at bay when we were
trying to make our runs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Notre Dame student-athletes? Steve,
V.J., congratulations on a good season. Go ahead with questions for Coach Brey
at this time.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned in your introduction there about the slow start
and you fall behind 10-0. What do you point to for the reason for that?  
MIKE BREY: It's like Steve said, the shots we got were pretty good ones. We
had a little runner in the lane, V.J. with a ten-footer on the baseline. I
don't know. I think we were awake and ready to play. I don't think we weren't
turning the ball over at that time to give them the 10-0 lead. I think it was,
you know, missing some stuff.  
  
We may have been shocked we were so open because we were really prepared for
them to be after us, and they were. You know, we had our spurts of turning the
ball over, but 14 against them is -- that's a pretty good day, only four in
the second half. But you got to make -- you know, you got to make a few over
the top of it. And your question, I thought -- I mean, I didn't expect them to
shoot it from outside as well. I thought we could play a little more zone and
make them make more threes, and they made every big three-point shot, and
Carter is a big-time winner. What a stud guard he is. He's fabulous. He's just
a veteran winner in college basketball.  
  
Q. I was interested, you said that how Bob kind of reinvented the book.
How is it different? How did he reinvent this?  
MIKE BREY: This is the first -- we played West Virginia a bunch back in the
old Big East days. Bob and I were actually talking about how we missed those
days, but they were not a full-court pressure team then. They played a little
bit of the 1-3-1 you saw, but they were still grinding you, and posting you,
and pounding you on offense.  
  
But I think going into a new league, I thought it's a brilliant move by Bob,
who's a brilliant coach obviously, to put together a style of play that
everybody really has to adjust to in league play.  
  
Q. Obviously you know him. What is it about -- what is his brilliance?  
MIKE BREY: I mean, this guy's been winning for a long time at a lot of places.
He is just a good old basketball coach. He loves practice, he loves to go in
and talk Xs and Os. He is one of those guys that just loved talking hoops. And
they've got a great culture about their program now, and they found a heck of
a niche in the Big 12. I feel for them. I don't know how they fly three hours
to every road game. It's unbelievable that they have to do that, but yet there
they are, playing in the Big 12 championship.  
  
The one thing about West Virginia that's the same, when we played them back
this the Big East and more so today, they got men. They have men. They have
old dudes, and staying old is a good thing in college basketball. They're a
little older than us today.  
  
Q. It seemed, for every time you guys started to chip away at the lead
they had a counter-punch for you. Can you talk about the frustration of that,
just as you seemed to get momentum?  
MIKE BREY: It does break your spirit. I've got a really mentally tough group,
but that was a real mental test today. Because any time we thought we'd get
this thing to four or get it to two possessions, somebody hit a big three or
they got a putback. It's really spirit-breaking after a while, and it does
wear on our group.  
  
I give our guys credit. We kept fighting, but eventually that really is --
that does a lot of psychological damage, and we hadn't been in one of in a
while. We hadn't been in one of those where we were digging out of a hole and
trying to come back. We really hadn't been in one in a while.  
  
Q. The decision to leave Bonzie in when he picked up his fourth foul.
Explain what went into that thinking on a day offensively you were having a
tough time getting a lot of guys going and he was really doing a lot for
you?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah. I don't think you're saving him for the stretch run. The
stretch run was a whole second half, trying to dig out of a hole. Quite
frankly, the staff and I talked, if he fouled out, I think we would have
played five guards and maybe tried to make some shots. But he's smart. He's a
veteran guy. He did a good job not fouling. He was unbelievable today.  
  
Some of our other guys didn't make some stuff. Again, he puts the team on his
back and he's not 100 percent. That ankle is bothering him. That's one of the
great performances, just trying to carry a team on a bad wheel. Yeah, there's
no such thing as taking them out with four because we're either going to get
it now or we're going to get beat by 20.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Thank you. Great season.

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We've joined now by Villanova student-athletes, Jalen
Brunson and Josh Hart. Congrats on advancing to tomorrow. You guys will be
playing Wisconsin in the second game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Josh, after watching the film of last night's game, obviously you had
to be happy with the second half. First half, can you put your finger on just
what was going on with you guys?  
JOSH HART: No. No. We haven't really watched the film of that. And right now,
we can't. We've got to focus on Wisconsin, so whatever happened, happened.
We've got to play better. We're not dwelling on that, we just got to know what
we got to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh, the thing that you and Wisconsin have in common, you have a lot
of veteran players. Can you talk about just the experience you gained, just
staying in school all these years? What has it done for you?  
JOSH HART: You know, it gave me a lot of insight into the college basketball
game. You see so many different defenses, able to read certain things better.
You're not as anxious or nervous during big games or tough situations. You
know, that really helps you just be collected the whole game. That's really
it. It's always good to have that experience.  
  
You know, Jalen, who is only a sophomore, who -- Coach always calls him an old
soul. So having him out there, then you have Darryl, Kris, myself, Mikal, who
is into the end of his second year, guys who are experienced, who played in
the tournament last year, who played in the National Championship game, guys
just aren't rattled.  
  
Q. Villanova has a history of graduating its kids, four-year kids, Kyle
is the only classmate that ever left early. When you finished last season, was
it a difficult decision for you? I know you put your name and tested the
waters in the draft. What was the ultimate decision and what did it come down
to?  
JOSH HART: It just came down to the best situation for my family and myself,
and that was the biggest thing. Anyone that knows me knows that the first
thing and my main priority, I want to take care of my parents. That's the
biggest thing with me. And I knew I had that chance last year, and if I did
leave, teams said they would take me and it wasn't where I wanted to be.  
  
So it wasn't just -- I didn't want to just get there and take care of my
parents for a year or two. I wanted to have a long career in the league, and
I'm going to take care of them for the rest of their lives. That was
ultimately the decision for me. So when I got all of that information, and I
just sat down and thought about it, it was an easy decision.  
  
Q. Jalen, why does your coach call you an old soul?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I just -- I think just Coach, me and Coach felt like we've had
a bond these past couple years, and I felt like we've connected since the day
he started recruiting me. So when -- just going back to those days, we were
always talking, we were always on the same page and the same mindset, so I
think that's why he considers me an old soul.  
  
Q. Jalen, Wisconsin hit 13 threes last night and Koenig hit eight. Just
wondering how you're planning to control the arc there and make sure they
doesn't break loose for three?  
JALEN BRUNSON: We definitely have to find Koenig, he's a great shooter, but
they're a great shooting team. They're real balanced. They have a great post
game, great perimeter shooters, and we're just going to go out there and play
Villanova basketball and defend hard and rebound the ball and really just play
together.  
  
Q. Josh, what does concern you most about Wisconsin and how dangerous
are they as an 8?  
JOSH HART: Very dangerous. You see how well-balanced they are. I think that's
the biggest thing. If a team is just all post game, and you're able to kind of
shut down their post game, then at times, you can kind of have an easier
route. But with them, they're so well-balanced, with having Nigel down there,
then you have Brunson, and Showalter out there shooting threes, so the balance
of that team is going to be a challenge.  
  
Again, like I said, we have to go out there and play Villanova basketball for
40 minutes, defend the rebound, and just play our butt off, and see where that
gets us.  
  
Q. Kris has been struggling with his shot recently. What kind of
supporting role do you play when you have a teammate that's lost his way a
little bit. Are you supportive, tell him to keep shooting or do you kind of
stay away from him?  
JOSH HART: Tell him to shoot. I tell him if I pass you the ball, and you're
open, one, two, step and let it fly. That's what he does. He's a great
shooter. When you're a great shooter, you don't worry about slumps. And he's a
great shooter, and I just know his mindset. Every one that he's going to shoot
is going to go in. As a great shooter, you don't worry about the ones you
miss, you have a short-term memory. And that's how he is. Just tell him to
keep shooting.  
  
Q. Obviously, you win this last year. Was there like an aha moment, a
moment of clarity at any point, whether it be the offseason or early this year
where you're like, you know what? I want to do this again.  
JOSH HART: April 5th, you know, that's the first time I thought about it, then
went the whole -- the testing-the-water process. I told Coach on the 24th or
25th of May. That's when I had the aha moment. I say I want to do this again.
So, that's something we've been working towards since the summer, and
something that we got to continue to work on, and we've got to keep being
coachable and being better.  
  
To answer that question, May 25th, when I took my name out of the draft, I had
that aha moment, I want to do it again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jalen, how about you?  
  
JALEN BRUNSON: Probably the same thing. I definitely didn't have the process
you did last year. But I just think that we definitely have some key pieces
coming back next year. We definitely have a group of young guys that are still
hungry and still wanting to get better. I mean, that's definitely in the back
of my mind, winning another National Championship. But we want to take care of
business, so I just focus on our next game. That's what we did last year in
the tournament. We just focus on one game at a time and eventually got there.  
  
Q. Josh, Wisconsin has a reputation as a defensive-oriented team. What
kind of challenges does that defense present? Does it remind you of anybody
that you played?  
JOSH HART: A team like Seton Hall, a Butler, a very tough, physical defensive-
minded team and we know that. We know that's how they play. We've just got to
be aggressive. We can't second-guess ourselves or get in and not try to -- get
in the paint or break down the defense and not try to score. We got to be
aggressive, play Villanova basketball, and let that take care of itself.  
  
You know, when you get this late in the tournament, no one's playing that it's
an easy win. Every one is a tough team. We know that, we know they're going to
make runs, and, we've got to play Villanova basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for either Josh or Jalen?  
  
Q. Watching the game yesterday with you guys on the floor, there seems
to be, like, you can almost kind of communicate just by looking at each other.
Talk about sort of the closeness amongst you guys as a team. Of all of the
teams I saw here this weekend, you guys sort of work together as one of the
best.  
JOSH HART: Yeah. That's just how close we are. You know, we're close on the
court, we're close off the court. And that really translates to us playing.
Now, I don't know how many times Jalen would just look at me and I just know
exactly what he's trying to get to me. So, that just shows how close we are,
and shows that we don't care about our individual success. We want each other
to have success. That's really about it. So, when you have guys you just
genuinely love, and you're just connected with on a different level, you know
what each other is trying to say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Josh, Jalen, thanks for your time. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova coach, Jay Wright.  
  
Q. Wisconsin's won more games in the tournament than any other team in
the last four years. They've beaten 2's, they've beaten 1's. Looks like the
worst 8 you can run into right now. How are you and your team approaching that
in?  
JAY WRIGHT: I agree with you exactly. I agree with you 100 percent. They are a
great 8 seed. Everywhere in this tournament, teams that know how to win. Mount
St. Mary's last night, they had a great plan. They knew how to win the game.
We just look at it like next game. We love playing great teams, we really do,
and we look forward to it.  
  
Q. You guys played kind of a shaky game against Seton Hall in the Big
East tournament, responded with a great game against Creighton. Shaky game
last night. What is it about your guys that they seem to respond after less
than stellar performances with some of your better performances of the year?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think the guys are just coachable, and humble enough to look at
their performance and be honest about where they've got to improve as opposed
to making excuses, or blowing it off, like, you know, it doesn't matter. Our
guys looked at the last game, and I think -- I hope you'll see a better
performance tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Jay, several of your players mentioned Butler as a comparison to
Wisconsin. How do you view that comparison and how troubling is that given
what Butler was able to do to you guys this year?  
JAY WRIGHT: They are similar in a lot of ways with their pack-line defense,
their physicality. And Butler shoots threes better than people know. Wisconsin
shoots them really well as we all saw last night. It's a very similar type of
game, and it's going to be a struggle. And I actually think Wisconsin's
bigger, even bigger, than Butler, so probably even tougher. But let's hope we
learn from those games.  
  
Q. Jay, Happ presents a unique set of challenges for a big with his
skill set, not something you see every day, not something you practice against
every day or work against. Tell me about the challenge you see for your guys,
specifically with Happ. They've got good bigs, him specifically.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. He's got the best hands of any player of his size we've
played against, and also the best feet. So, individually, if you took the best
feet or the best hands, he's got them. And put them together in the same guy,
right, that's a really tough match-up, in that he could score in there, but he
passes extremely well out of there. And he can -- if he's got size, he can
score over you, and if you have size on him, he can score around you with his
ball handling. He's a great ball handler. He's a really tough match-up.  
  
And what really makes them good, is that he can score on you, and he can play
like a point guard and he can get Koenig and Showalter threes himself.  
  
Q. I was just in the locker room. I don't know who won, but you guys
were huddled around the phone, rooting for Seton Hall, their conference rival,
of course. I was wondering if you could speak a little about what kind of --
for fans and for people like you who are interested in it, what the NCAA
Tournament brings in terms of fan experience, especially compared to some
other sports events, especially compared to something like the NBA playoffs
which are same sport, but it's a kind of different feel?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I think what's unique about the NCAA Tournament, is that
everybody in the country feels a part of it, and everybody fills out their
bracket, and everybody kind of connects to a team or two, no matter who you
are. And then I think it's become almost a holiday, you know, an extended
holiday in our country. I think it's the best sporting event in our country in
terms of bringing our whole country together.  
  
And then you have the inside part of it, with the passionate fans connected to
their schools and following them on the ride, you know, in states and cities
that just take on the school even if it's not their school. I just think it's
one of the most unique and really the most entertaining sporting event in our
country.  
  
Q. Jay, Jalen was up here earlier and said that you referred to him as
an old soul. I was wondering what gave him that quality in your eyes?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's really mature for a 20-year-old. He's, sometimes I think,
more mature than me. During games, I can get more emotional and sometimes out
of control than he does, and he'll come to me and say we got this, Coach,
we're all right, Coach.  
  
He looks at every practice like a coach. He dissects everything we do, and he
looks at the game like an old-school guy, you know? Like one of those NBA guys
from the 1980s, just an intelligent skill-oriented game. I love all of that
about him.  
  
Q. And to follow up on that, is that why there's a trust level on your
part? He had two offensive fouls, I think, in the first half, but you didn't
go away from him. You were confident that he would make the right decision
when he got in the lane?  
JAY WRIGHT: Exactly. And last year, we started him out as a freshman on a
really experienced team because he acts like a guy that's been in four NCAA
Tournaments, even though he's only been in one. But he handles everything like
he's been here, you know, four times, and that's the old soul. He just acts
like a really experienced person.  
  
Q. Jay, Nigel Hayes has been on the big stage for a long time. You've
probably seen him for years. How do you think he's developed as his game has
developed? He seems to be playing quite well. What kind of match-up issue is
he?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. He's a nightmare matchup, and sometimes when you've been in
college basketball for four years, in the regular season, you know, you
realize at some point, okay, the NCAA Tournament is coming up. That's the big
show. And it kind of looks to me that's what he did. When the NCAA Tournament
hit, he's ready to go. In the Big Ten Tournament also.  
  
He's developed as a passer, decisionmaker, and shooter, you know? When he
first came in, he's kind of a rugged, aggressive guy, energy guy. Now, he's
just a complete basketball player. He can shoot it from three, he can drive
it, he passes it, he posts up. He's a great defender on the perimeter and the
post. It's pretty complete. It's pretty scary how I just described those two
guys and they are on the same team, right? It's a good team.  
  
Q. This time last year, Jay, you had to get out of this game to be a
success outwardly. What do you have to do in this game to be a success
outwardly?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question, Dana. Man, I don't know. Like, I think
there's varying opinions publicly on where -- probably this team would have to
get to the Final Four to be a -- you know, you're a one seed, you're supposed
to get to the Final Four, get out of your bracket. That's probably what we
have to be to be a success. And as you know, we accept that, we'll take it.
We're not going to define ourselves that way, but we do get it.  
  
Q. Jay, we all know Wisconsin is known for their defense and their
numbers always great. I mean, you guys' numbers aren't that much different
than theirs are. What do you feel about the way your defense played this year
and what is unique about how you play defense?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think we've gotten better towards the end of the year here, Joe.
I think in that Seton Hall game in the Big East tournament, our defense saved
us. We couldn't score. I think last night, second half, our defense saved us,
and we take pride in it. We play a lot differently defensively than Wisconsin,
and we take more chances. We trap more, we press more. We change up defenses
more. They are really, really solid and physical, and locked in, and it's
really different styles, it really is.  
  
But as you said, you look at the numbers, we're both trying to accomplish the
same thing. They rebound well, they hold their opponents to low percentage and
they try to take away threes.  
  
Q. Do you expect them tomorrow to be (inaudible).  
JAY WRIGHT: I do. I do. I wish it wouldn't be that way, but I think they're
going to be able to do that to us. I learned over the years you can try, but
against those real good teams, it usually doesn't work. You better figure out
how to play in their grind.  
  
Q. Wisconsin comes to mind as a team that can really shoot threes. A lot
of teams are, everybody is. Can you describe how that has evolved as a
strategy since you've been coaching minutes your days at Hofstra?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is. Defenses have really changed, and defensive concepts have
really changed since even I was an assistant coach, in that we were all so
help-oriented and protect the paint and don't give up easy baskets. And now
sometimes you give up an easy basket and say, thank God it wasn't a three. So
it is a completely different defensive philosophy, and the guys of our era
have had to adjust a lot.  
  
The younger head coaches, right now, are -- they came up that way. It's kind
of interesting to see some of the things they do, because they've come into
the game defending the three-point line.  
  
Q. Jay, I've just been asking all of the coaches, with the N.I.T.
experimenting with the four-quarter format, what's your opinion on that? Are
you in favor of the game moving that way? Why or why not?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, I don't know yet. I guess that would say I'm not in
favor yet, but I'm really interested in seeing how this works. Women's
basketball went this year for the first year and I didn't get to -- our
women's coach is a really bright guy, and he's a longtime coach. I want to
talk to him about that in the off season.  
  
But I am interested in it. I would like to see the game be the same
internationally, NBA, college. I would like to see it be the same game or as
close as possible.  
  
Q. You guys were in a dogfight yesterday at halftime and you came out in
a completely different gear. What was the message to your guys at halftime?
They obviously seemed to respond to it?  
JAY WRIGHT: For a good story, I would love to tell you I went in there and
ripped them, and they all came out fired up, but I really didn't. I just
sensed -- as I said earlier, we had a little nerves. I sensed we were a little
bit taken back by their speed and quickness, and they did a great -- you got
to give them credit, they did a great job of holding the ball until late in
the possession and then letting their little guards go and create plays, and
it was working.  
  
So, we didn't score until about 14 minutes to go in the first half. It was
only about seven or eight possessions. So they just had a great game plan. It
was working for a while. We had to stick to ours, and it eventually worked
out. That's really we did. I wish I could give you a better story.  
  
Q. When you look at Wisconsin film, they obviously play well through the
Big 10 Tournament and played well last night, but they struggled going into
the Big 10. What do you and your coaching staff focus on more? Where they
struggled two, three weeks ago or what they're doing now?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good question. That's an interesting question for all
coaches. We always look at the last game. Because we feel like coaches -- you
know, if they played well in the last game, they're going to do a lot of the
things they did before. If they didn't play well in the last game, they're
going to change some things.  
  
So, we spend a lot more time on the last game, but then we go back in
importance, less importance, the further they are from this game.  
  
Q. Jay, you spoke about this a little bit last night. Kris, and his
shooting. You said you've spoken to him about that and keep encouraging him to
keep firing away. How does he respond to that, what kind of feedback does he
give you in those exchanges?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's great, man. A lot of guys -- we have a term, shoot'em up,
sleep in the streets. Kris lives that better than anybody that we've ever had.
Scotty Reynolds was one of the best, and Kris is in that category. They just
-- they don't fear a 2 for 13 night. I've been asked a lot by a lot of people,
good basketball journalists, that I know were around for a long time say, what
about Kris, what about Kris, is he going to be okay? It doesn't bother him at
all. That's what I love about him. I want all of our guys to be like that.  
  
Sometimes the younger guys, if they have a couple -- miss a couple shots, they
don't want to take the next shot. And we don't want them to play that way. We
tell them, if we have you out there on the court, we have confidence in you to
shoot. Really, he's the least of my worries.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Q. Question for Elijah. Notre Dame's offensive style is kind of unique
to the fact that they don't really have a true post player and they're kind of
five out and away from the paint. What does that do for you as far as
defending -- drawing you away from the basket? Was that something that you
think you could handle tomorrow?  
ELIJAH MACON: Yeah. Definitely. I just feel like as a team, we're going to go
over what we have to do today, especially just figure out who we're going to
guard in the game today and that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. You said you have offensive system (inaudible).  
ELIJAH MACON: Definitely. Kind of compare them to Iowa State. They try to
spread the floor a lot. But we're going to go over our principles today and
take care of it.  
  
Q. For Nathan and Elijah, you're going up against bigger, taller guys
yesterday. Tomorrow you're going up against a post player that's shorter, like
you said, more athletic. If there's a difference in the way you played them
and approached them especially in the post?  
ELIJAH MACON: Definitely. I mean just knowing, he like to play off angles,
just knowing that you have to stay down, especially just guard him off ball
and basically try to keep him out of the paint as much as possible. That's
pretty much what I've seen from watching film so much.  
  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think it changes how we have to guard them as a team more
than individually. You know they're five out instead of having someone sitting
in the post. It will be a whole team effort.  
  
Q. For Jevon, Mike Brey said you had done some playing with Matt Farrell
this summer. Is that accurate?  
JEVON CARTER: Yes.  
  
Q. What did you see out of him and how has he developed as a point guard
now that he's had a full season under his belt?  
JEVON CARTER: Pretty much what everybody's been saying all season. He's pretty
aggressive. He can pass, he can score. He's a good point guard. It's just our
job to do a good job and stop him from being comfortable.  
  
Q. Tarik, for you, and Nate as well, especially seniors. You guys have
been involved in a lot of these NCAA Tournament games. Tarik you hit a game
winner a couple years ago, but does it feel different now that you're a
senior, and this run has taken on more importance?  
TARIK PHILLIP: It's a little different. Because, as you said, we've been here
before. Not one time, but two times, so we feel more composed.  
  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I'd say there a little bit more difference towards the end of
the game, when it's a little bit closer, and you're comfortable and you start
to realize, if you blow this one, then you're not going to have another
chance. So it kind of gives you a little bit more of drive to win.  
  
Q. They make the fewest turnovers in the country, I guess for Jevon,
anybody wants to answer this. Do you think it's going to be tougher to impose
your will?  
JEVON CARTER: I don't know. Every game is a challenge. If we come out and do
what we've got to do, the it's possible. We just got to play hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Elijah?  
  
ELIJAH MACON: Yeah. I feel like if we come out and do what we're supposed to
do, just do what all our coaches ask us to do and everything, I feel like
everything will take care of itself. And we just go out and play our game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for West Virginia student-athletes? If not,
gentlemen, appreciate your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by West Virginia head coach, Bob Huggins, who has
his team preparing to play Notre Dame in the first game at 12:10 tip-off.
We'll go straight to questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said after every post season game, you haven't been
happy with the way your team has played. How far away are you from a level
where you feel like you'll need to get to to win this next game?  
BOB HUGGINS: We've got to make shots. We've got to make shots. We've got to
make free throws, and we can't turn it over. I mean, if we do those things,
we're pretty good. If you don't do those things, you're not very good. But
that's just not us, that's everybody. I just really say that we didn't play
very well so you guys have something to write. I know how hard it is.  
  
Q. We can write about anything.  
BOB HUGGINS: And do. And do, by the way.  
  
Q. Coach, you obviously saw Notre Dame a lot in the Big East. Just some
of memories going against Mike Brey in the Big East tournament games, whatever
it might be?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we had some great games. We hard a hard time winning in
South Bend. They had a hard time winning in Morgantown. Fortunate enough to
beat them in the semi-finals of the Big East Tournament in 2010 in Morgantown.
And they had a three to win the game. Fortunately for us, not for them, it was
short and got banged around a little bit. Actually Da'Sean Butler, nobody
knows this, he ran over and hugged Wellington Smith who got the rebound. The
reason he went over and hugged him was because Da'Sean did not block out man
and he had a clear run at the goal and it just happened to bounce Wellington's
way, so they he ran over and hugged him, because he said he would never have
heard the end of it if this guy would have rebounded it and scored.  
  
Q. Bob, a lot of times it seems like Mike and his team fly a little
under the radar nationally. What as a coach, do you think of the job he's been
able to do at Notre Dame over the years?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think Mike's one of the better coaches in our game. You know,
Mike's a guy who can pretty much take anybody and make them pretty good. And,
you know, they didn't always play the way they're playing now. I think he does
a great job of adapting style of play to personnel. And they do a great job of
-- they've got great ball movement, they've got great spacing. They can score
it at the goal, which is kind of imperative in our game, to be able to figure
out a way to score it somehow.  
  
I was just telling them, our game's about numbers, you know? 1 on 0 is the
best number, and we are generally pretty good at those. Then, you know, 2 on
1, and 3 on 2, we're not quite as good at. When you're 5 on 5, it's hard to
score, so that's why everybody does all of the things they do, ball screens,
single-doubles, staggers, flairs, whatever, they've got to try to create a 5
on 4, so that you've got numbers. When you add the spacing that they do, they
have great spacing, that makes them a hard team to guard.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have obviously gone up against a lot of talented
point guards in the Big 12, Frank Mason, Devante Morris Morris, Jawan Evans.
Farrell from Notre Dame, where does he kind of compare with that group, and
how do you kind of see him and Jevon going up against each other tomorrow?
What do you think that could be like?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think he's different than those guys because he plays so
well off the ball. You were kind of talking about guys who were really, really
good with the ball, and not that he's not good with the ball, but he can play
off the ball as well as he can play on the ball, which I think those other
guys kind of grew up with the ball in their hands and really play with the
ball in their hands. They're the guys that get in the seam, and create
numbers, where he's a guy who, a lot of times, comes down, gives it up and
he's the guy who's coming off the screens, and setting screens, and trying to
create numbers for his team.  
  
Q. Yesterday, first half, I think it was about four or five straight
times you guys converted on baseline in plays. I know you see it every day,
but what's it take to get to a point where your team's executing at that
level, and how important is that in these games here in March?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I'm like everybody else in our business. When, you know,
somebody runs something against us, that it's hard for us to guard and they
score, I steal it. And everything we run is something that I got from somebody
else that. You know, you might tweak it a little bit, but we've been running
the same thing for ten years at West Virginia, and we just keep scoring. So,
obviously, Nolan Richardson was pretty damn smart.  
  
Q. Just given how well they handle the ball and limit turnovers, is this
a bad match-up for you?  
BOB HUGGINS: They don't let us pick. I mean, if you're asking me, would we
have picked them, absolutely not. I don't know if it is or it isn't. I guess
that's why you play. We're going to try to do the same thing to them that they
do to us. We're going to try to create numbers in the half court, and we're
going to try to take transition when it's there. I don't know whether is or it
isn't. Probably about 2:00 tomorrow, I'll have an answer for you.  
  
Q. Bob, do you miss the Big East?  
BOB HUGGINS: Who doesn't miss New York? Who doesn't miss the Garden? Sure, you
miss the Garden. But, the Big 12's been great for us. And we're playing in --
it's been the best RPI league in the country for the last four or five years.
There's been great players. You look at -- the coaching in that league is
terrific, and there's no bottom. And the reality is for as great as the Big
East was, there was a bottom. There were nine or ten teams that were really
good and then there were about five or six that weren't so good.  
  
And, you know, you looked at the schedule. You talked about, you know, match-
ups. Those are the ones you kind of said these are the ones that we really
need to get because these are gettable, and the Big 12 doesn't have that.
Oklahoma State today takes Michigan to the wire, and they're really good, and
they lost their first six league games. I mean, think about that. If that's
the bottom, our bottom's pretty good. Then they ended up not being on the
bottom, obviously.  
  
But coaches in our league are just -- that's the worrisome thing. Every time
you look down there -- honestly, sometimes I'd look down there and think,
well, if it gets really good, I might be a little smarter than that guy down
there. I'm looking down there in the Big 12. I don't see anybody I'm smarter
than.  
  
Q. When your players were up here earlier, it was a bit of a somber mood
for some young men that won yesterday. Taking the emotion out of the game, is
that important, as like a key to victory, or do you encourage sort of the
highs and lows?  
BOB HUGGINS: I was in the locker room with them. They weren't very somber in
there. It's a long year, you know? It's a long year and you can't get too
excited about the highs, and you can't get too down about the lows. And, you
know, I think probably the appropriate thing to do is to keep an even keel.
But, I mean, if you don't play with a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm,
the way we play, you get exposed.  
  
We've got to cover a whole lot more ground than everybody else does, because
we're playing the length of the floor when everybody else is playing a half
court. So, energy and enthusiasm are incredibly important us to. They're just
probably saving it. Tricking you is what they're doing. See, they tricked you.  
  
Q. Bob, I was just curious about your thoughts on the N.I.T. going to
four quarters. Is that something you would like to see, experimenting with it
this year. Is that something you would like to see the game go toward? Just
what are your general thought on that format?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think we ought to stop having our Rules Committee in Palm
Springs. I think because they just feel this need to make changes to justify
them being there, and what's wrong with our game? I mean, I don't know what's
wrong with our game. Why do we need four quarters? I think everybody plays
four quarters in high school, and they can't wait to get into college and play
halves. But that's just me. But I do think we ought to move the -- we ought to
have them here in Buffalo in February.  
  
Q. Coach, have you figured out Lamont yet? He hit a lot of shots in the
Texas game then obviously he hit a lot of shots for you yesterday. Is it youth
or obviously a bad match-up?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think he started rushing things a little bit, quite frankly.
You know, people are bigger, stronger and faster, you know? And they get to
the ball a lot faster, and I think he just started rushing things. When he
slowed down, then he started making shots again. But that's the same with
everybody. I mean, nobody consistently makes hurried shots.  
  
Q. Other questions for Coach Huggins?  
BOB HUGGINS: As a side note, I think the other thing about the Rules
Committee, you have to have somebody on it over 6 foot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else about Rules Committee, or --  
  
BOB HUGGINS: I have a lot of things about the Rules Committee.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I thought you might. We have a little bit of time. That's why I
was wondering.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: No. I think I already got myself in enough trouble.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll call this it then. Thanks, Coach.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Nigel Hayes, Bronson Koenig and Zak
Showalter. Congratulations on advancing, playing Villanova in the second game
tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. You guys, over the last -- you're a senior, you've been on teams that
have beaten a couple number one seeds. What is it about this program that
allows you to really rise up in these moments?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I'm not really sure, to be honest, I know that ever since me
and Nigel came in as freshman we've been a resilient team. We don't get
rattled when we're down. Kind of like Villanova, just play with a lot of
poise. That comes from having a lot of confidence in ourselves, and us as a
team.  
  
Q. You are the leading scorer in this tournament. You might have some
insight.  
NIGEL HAYES: Has to do with our preparation. Our coaches do an extremely good
job of scouting, but we also do a good job of trying to sticking to the
fundamentals and do the little things. That's what gives you championships. Of
course, there's going to be plays made and he's the poster child for making
spectacular plays, but there's also a lot of the little plays that you don't
see, which is what Showy's responsible for. So, Bronson gets all of the
attention, and Showy is the one in the background doing all of the diving,
playing great defense for, and when you put all that together on one team, and
we're all playing together, playing for one another, you can do special
things.  
  
Q. Nigel, through all of this tournament experience through the last
four year, what is the most valuable lesson you guys have learned?  
NIGEL HAYES: How to remain cool, calm, and collected during moments of either
low points in the game or high points, knowing that you may get up, but it may
not be over yet. You still have game left to play, and even if another team
goes on a run or you get down on that again there's more time left. You can
come back, and we've seen both sides of it. Going back to our first time in
the tournament, really, when we played Oregon and Milwaukee, we were on pace
to lose by 20-plus, and you know, we kept our composure and we were able to
fight back and win.  
  
Q. This is for all of you. What was -- what were the emotions like on
senior night in Wisconsin, and what has the experience of being in school all
these years meant to all of you?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: I think it was a very special night for all of us. Obviously
this group of four seniors has been in a lot of big games in our career, and
really got a lot from Wisconsin. So, I think we -- it was a big night.
Especially, we want to get a big win going into tournament play and it started
turning our season around a little bit.  
  
BRONSON KOENIG: I think at that point we had lost maybe five or six games or
so, and having our final game at home against a really good Minnesota team, we
knew that that could really propel us forward going on in to the Big Ten
Tournament and just kind of used that as -- just kind of used that going
forward into March and April, hopefully.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nigel?  
  
NIGEL HAYES: It was extremely emotional, not that everyone was in tears or
anything, but just knowing it's an end to something that's been very, very
good to you. You've made some great memories there, even with the wins and
losses, the connections that you made with people, the experiences that we'd
had, we're extremely appreciative. Fortunately for us, we've had a lot more
wins than losses, so it's been pretty good. Knowing that that's an end of a
chapter in our life, obviously you don't want to see it move on, but it has
to.  
  
So now we're just trying to change that focus from that, use all of that
experience and all of that time we've had and try to do something special in
our last year.  
  
Q. It's a life lesson. Those four years, not everybody stays in school
four years. What did it do for you just being at Wisconsin those four years?  
NIGEL HAYES: Just changed as a person, able to mature on and off the court.
Able to develop yourself again, not necessarily just basketball-wise but also
as a person, you change, your beliefs, thought processes, things that go on in
your everyday life. You're also able to make new connections with people, able
to actually play school. He likes to call us student-athletes a lot. All of us
will be graduating, so you do a lot of great things. That's the beauty of
staying in school.  
  
Q. Nigel, Coach Wright said you had a look of a senior that doesn't want
your career to end. You're working on string of three straight double-doubles
here. What's going on that you were able to step it up more than usual in this
last little stretch?  
NIGEL HAYES: Just that sense of urgency that you have. Again, I've been
fortunate with Bronson and Showy to have been on some teams with older guys,
and we've been fortunate enough to make some long runs. Once you see that run
end, you know the look on the guys' faces, the faces in the jerseys in the two
years, the pain that you can hear. I saw that at a young age, and I want to
make sure I do everything in my power to not let that happen.  
  
I even mentioned to the guys having to being willing to die for the
opportunity to play in a National Championship. I know it may sound extreme,
but I'd rather go out there in the game and give everything I have. You can't
move with a win, then coming out of there feeling a little better with a loss
because a loss will feel a millions times worse than the amount of pain that
you can do with a win.  
  
Q. Zak, Kris with the tight turn, you guys talked about what you wanted
to shore up from last night. How do you balance what you want to do better
than yesterday and getting ready for the No. 1 overall seed?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: Yeah, we went over -- Nigel just talked about our scouting
reports and our coaches and getting us prepared for these games. This morning
slept in a little, got a good scouting report in from Coach Moore and just
handling ball screens and stuff like that a little better. I don't want to get
into too many details about what our plan is. That's why I think we have
success is we pay attention to details and stuff like that. So I think that
will help us and we'll be ready to go on Saturday.  
  
Q. Zak, we were talking before, two of the losses were to Butler, a team
that plays somewhat similar to you guys, tough on defense, grinds it out on
offense a little bit. Is that encouraging to you guys or do you not even
consider that and play your own game?  
ZAK SHOWALTER: It's encouraging. I don't think you want to read into it too
much. I think we'll play our style of play no matter who is standing on the
other side. I think Villanova is a team that sits similar to us, and they've
been in big games before, and they know what it's like to play in these
situations. So, it's going to be a heck of a game on Saturday, and I'm excited
for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by University of Wisconsin head coach, Greg
Gard. Coach, first, congrats on advancing to play Villanova. I guess whatever
congratulations you can get to play the No. 1 seed.  
  
GREG GARD: Great parting gift.  
  
Q. Several Villanova players mentioned Butler as comparison to you guys,
Butler beat them twice during the year. I was wondering if you had a chance to
see either of those games or see Butler and if there's any comparison there as
well?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I've watched Butler play them. Obviously, comparatively wise,
we haven't played Butler in a few years, so I think there's probably some
comparisons. I think there's also some comparisons between us and Villanova,
specifically defensively. Just watching them, how physical they are, how they
do a great job of playing a team-oriented defense. Really low to the ball
pretty well, and defensively they're very impressive. Everybody talks about
what Hart and Jenkins and Brunson do offensively and how they run the show.
Defensively they're very good as well.  
  
I think that's where you draw some comparisons, whether it's Butler, Notre
Dame, another team that's here, just how they play so well together.  
  
Q. Greg, I asked a few coaches this, and your program fits the bill as
well. In the era of one-and-done, when players stick at schools such as
yourself, is that more a formula for repeat champion looking at Villanova when
you've got that experience? Do you think things changing a little bit?  
GREG GARD: I think the experience definitely helps. You can look at the other
side and see teams that have won and done that with one-and-done players. I
think we're probably both in similar boats from a standpoint that we have guys
that stay for the majority of their time, maybe not all of the time, but for
the most part.  
  
And you have two programs that develop pretty well, and they get better as
time goes on. And you usually look at their roster, and I went through it last
night or early this morning, when I got back to the hotel, and I saw a lot of
RSs in front of names meaning redshirt. I'm going to go back and research that
even deeper because that's always been a big part of our program is when we
can redshirt guys and play with older guys. That's helped in our consistency,
and I'm sure Jay would say the same thing in terms of him sustaining what he's
done there. When you can have older guys for the most part on the floor, I
think that really helps.  
  
Q. How have you seen the development of how teams have chosen to defend
Happ as he's developed as a player. He brings such unique skill set with
elusiveness down there. I guess you try to deny and then you've seen a lot of
doubles to make him get rid of the two. Do you anticipate some of that from
Villanova and how has he handled getting that much attention, that he wasn't
getting maybe earlier in his career?  
GREG GARD: Well, he's gotten better in terms of handling double-teams over the
last month, six weeks. He struggled with it early, I think. And then as he
improved in terms of handling that, we also didn't take advantage of it on the
back side, whether it was back-side threes, we miss a lot of wide open shots
earlier in the year when that first became a scheme against us. And then,
secondly, we also missed the opportunity to throw it back in on the back side
of the -- or, the back side of the defense.  
  
So, he's obviously gotten better, but also the guys around him have gotten
better at taking advantage of what's there. We've tweaked some things. We've
drilled a lot of things to try to help him through that. So, he's probably
seen about every conceivable thing you can do with five guys on the floor in
terms of where the traps are coming from, whether it's the bottom, whether
it's the top, whether it's the same side wing, whether it's been post to post.  
  
It's just a matter of making decisions, being strong with the ball, not
panicking, and he's had to grow through it. And we'll continue to work with
it, and we work it about every week. But it's also, in large part, due to the
play around him, too. If guys can help him out, and not put him on an island
and change sides of the floor. And then when you make shots against it, that's
the ultimate goal to try to make teams pay for committing an extra guy towards
him.  
  
Q. You mentioned it the other day, but can you elaborate a little bit
about what you remember about your experience winning a national title here in
1995 in Buffalo?  
GREG GARD: Well, I'm in my second year of college coaching. I'm still an
undergrad student at UW Platteville. We get beat in the Sweet 16 the year
before, and then we come back and go undefeated. So, I got spoiled right off
the bat in terms of thinking it was always going to be like that, how easy it
was to march to a Final Four and have an undefeated team.  
  
But the experience here in Buffalo was terrific. Obviously there I am at 24 at
the time, and you have that type of an experience. And I think what those
experiences at Plattville taught me and Coach Ryan was always talking to me
about this, is that divisions didn't matter. Don't get caught up in the Roman
numeral behind the school or what division you're in. The experiences we can
have at Division III were maybe not the same stage as Division I, but the
experiences for the student-athlete and the excitement and the drama and
euphoria with it, those were great, great memories.  
  
And obviously, to Buffalo, the National Championship here, prior to the two we
won at Salem in '98 and '99, those are vivid memories for me, and that was
kind of where it all started in terms of my college coaching.  
  
Q. Do you ever look back when you're on this grand stage and think back
to it started for you on that smaller stage?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. And I think that helps keep this in perspective. That it's
still a game. They're still young men out there trying to play really well.
There's so much attention given to it from the outside that it's -- you keep
reminding yourself what it was like then, what an innocent experience it was
for those guys back in '95.  
  
And I actually talked to one of the players that was on the team two nights
ago, Saul Phillips who is now the coach at Ohio University, and he was a
senior on that team in '95. Just remembering back to how we rushed the floor,
that whole journey through the year, going undefeated, just the innocence of
what it's like. And I was close to their age. Those guys are 22, 23, and I'm
24, still finishing up my undergrad. It puts it in perspective, what the
experience is like for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Greg, Nigel is working on a string of two straight double-doubles
here. Is this just a senior feeling the end of his career coming on and
wanting to prolong it? Has he made some changes in his game or maybe have you
made some changes in how you're using him?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think it's probably all three. I think he's attacked the
paint a little more ferociously, gotten better at trying to play around the
rim a little bit more, and I think that's been a year-long process. We've done
a few things schematically a little differently over the last three weeks or
so to try to maybe emphasize it even more, take advantage of what they were
doing with Happ specifically. But I also think it's -- I've said it several
times, seniors hear the clock ticking. They see the sands going through the
hourglass knowing there's not much time left regardless of how we finish it
out. It's coming to an end pretty soon.  
  
I would say a combination of all three. But probably, number one, he
understands what time of year it is. And, number two, he's made a conscious
effort to take advantage of what his advantage is, and that's basically
playing 15 feet and in, and using his skill set to try to create those match-
ups or getting defenses caught in some of those match-up advantages.  
  
Q. When the team was struggling late in the season, they were pressing
and it was against teams that maybe they were favored against. The national
perception tomorrow night is you guys are playing a Villanova team that you're
not supposed to beat. Does that help the guys to go out there and play maybe
more relaxed, get it all out there, nothing to lose?  
GREG GARD: Well, I don't know. I think once the ball goes up, guys just play.
And I think sometimes there's more made of that type of scenario, in terms of
who's loose, who the pressure's on, who's favored. That, I think is really
irrelevant in players' minds. Once that ball goes up, like I said, all of that
gets flushed out, and you just play for the 40 minutes. And I think during our
stretch, I don't know so much if we pressed as we played some teams that have
played very well against us. We were not in sync specifically offensively.
Some of that was due to Koenig being hobbled a little bit, and that put us out
of sync. Even when he came back, we weren't quite as in sync was we were the
last couple weeks.  
  
It's a combination of things. I don't want to discredit the other teams'
efforts and what they did, and we also saw teams fighting for post season
appearances. We went to Michigan State when they needed to win. We were
playing Iowa when they were still trying to fight for their post season lives.
I think Northwestern, same example. So I don't want to discredit what the
other teams did and how well they played against us, but I also don't want to
put all the light on that our guys were feeling pressure. Hey, we didn't play
well specifically offensively, and, you know, we got back to being more in
sync and that's helped us.  
  
Q. I just want to get some of your thoughts. What are your impressions
when you watched Villanova in that classic National Championship game last
year and do you, as a program, do you see that in a different lens having been
in a National Championship game?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. What I see in Villanova is a championship-program-type
swagger, and I've seen it in our guys, too, just from the benefits of being in
two Final Fours. They understand what it's about and what you have to go
through and also that air of confidence that borders on arrogance. I mean,
without being arrogant, you watch Villanova walk on the floor and they are
very confident, led by Jalen Brunson, who has always been a championship level
guard. Even when he was back at Illinois in Stevenson High School, he had the
air about him then.  
  
And Hart carries that same type of presence about him. You look at that and
I've see it in our guys too. I think it's embedded in both programs. What was
the other part of your question?  
  
Q. Do you watch a National Championship game differently, having been in
one?  
GREG GARD: Not really. I probably watch it less, you know? Having been there
and knowing that you -- like I said, I don't get caught up in a lot of the
pomp and circumstance around it. I just lock in on the game itself, and try to
watch that more so than all of the fanfare around it. Having been there,
usually get to that time of year, your tank's pretty well empty, so you're
trying to recharge and get ready for what's next.  
  
So, obviously Villanova had a heck of a year last year. They've had a
phenomenal year this year. I think last year helped them springboard into this
year, even though they lost a few guys. But those guys that have returned
really carried the mantle pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did you expect to get from Khalil last night and how
much of that carries over with your bench tomorrow?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't know where he was going to be at
emotionally. He seemed like he was okay when I talked to him over the couple
days, but Khalil is also a tough read. He hides his emotions pretty well for
the most part. He would be a very good poker player because he doesn't let you
know a whole lot of what's going through his mind. But I thought he was
terrific last night. He was a huge boost for us. He was very active. We missed
him against Michigan in the championship game, there's no doubt, specifically
defensively. He had played very well at Ann Arbor, a couple weeks prior, three
weeks prior. So that void was evident on tape, and it was even more evident
when he came back to practice last week what he added back to us.  
  
I'm just happy for him because he's been through so much hurt and sorrow, not
only with his cousins, but also what he's going through with his dad. I know
he's still working to try to get through that, and rightfully so. I know how
it's been for me at 46, losing my dad a year and a half ago, and for somebody
to go through it when you're still in high school, I can only imagine how
painful that's been for him and then to add that on top of it. It's a lot for
a young person to handle. So I'm happy for him because he needed something
positive. He was definitely very positive for us last night.  
  
Q. Greg, I was just ask every coach today with the N.I.T. experimenting
with the four-quarter format, I was just curious what your thoughts were on
that. Would you like to see the game move that why, why or why not in?  
GREG GARD: I've watched very little of the N.I.T. I watched a couple of the
teams that are in it from our league. A little bit of Indiana, a little bit
Illinois, a little Iowa. I don't know exactly the impact it's had. I know from
talking to high school coaches in the state of Wisconsin and Minnesota, we
just went to halves in the last handful of years, and the high school coaches
do not want to go back to quarters. They really like the flow of the game in
the halves and the way it's set up right now. So, just judging from what their
feedback has been in both states, Minnesota's had it a little bit longer than
Wisconsin, it's been a positive move for the game in that regard. And I
probably, unless data or information tells me otherwise, I would probably be
in favor of keeping it how it is. And I've always been, if it's not broke, why
are we tinkering with it? I think there's probably some other things in the
game we can continue to work on, rather than worrying about changing to
quarters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Appreciate. Good luck tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Q. Matt, the other day, Mike Brey said that you were better than Bobby
Hurley. I kind of chuckled even just now. What was your response to that? How
do you take that praise?  
MATT FARRELL: It's kind of crazy to hear for me. The Hurleys are unbelievable
coaches. He's an unbelievable coach. He was an unbelievable player. So, I take
it as a huge compliment. I don't know if he's right, but I'll obviously strive
to try to be better than him or try to be even as good as him. He was an
unbelievable player and he's an unbelievable couch now. It's just Coach Brey
kind of relaying the relationship me and him have, so I'll take it as a huge
compliment.  
  
Q. And this is for you, Matt. How have you made the adjustment to being
a starter this season, and the fact that you've been efficient with the ball?
What have you kept in mind this year as you've helped lead this team to this
point?  
MATT FARRELL: Just maintaining the same confidence that I played with when I
first got my start in the NCAA Tournament last year. Just playing the same way
I do, sticking to what I know, and then playing with these guys around me
really helps. You know, playing with the guys that I really want to play for,
and I think that makes a huge difference. We got guys that want to play for
each other, and they make me better on the floor. And just the culture of this
program, you know? It kind of all worked out. It was all good vibes going
forward. So I'm just maintaining that confidence and trusting the system and
trusting the guys around me.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, Matt, as well as you played especially during that
one stretch in the middle of the second half yesterday with the steal, the
feed and the three-point basket, you were visibly disappointed as you were
walking off the floor. After I guess, you know, missing a couple of shots
there in the final 25 seconds, how do you use that to fuel yourself moving
forward? You guys won, and maybe you weren't at your best in some ways.  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. Personally, I feel like I got to be better down the
stretch. Take that hard. I got to make that free throw, and I got to make
better decisions down there. I don't think I was upset because we won. I'll
always be happy we won. These guys picked me up, doing that all year. We do
that for each other. But just use that as motivation, try to get better the
next day. That's the good thing about basketball. There's always another game
as long as you keep winning.  
  
Q. Two questions. One, it's kind of assumed that today's college players
are inpatient when it comes to playing time. I'm kind of wondering, how did
you find the patience to stick it out with Grant and Jackson in front of you
when you first got to school. And question number two, what have you seen with
West Virginia's Jevon Carter, and what do you think the matchup of battling
point guards will play tomorrow?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. I think, as I mentioned before, the culture. Guys in the
past haven't been able to play right away in this program. They wait their
turn. And fortunately for me, I was able to develop a good relationship with
Demetrius, so he was always in my ear telling me to keep working hard. As I
said before, it's hard to do that. Anybody that's been in that situation, not
playing, it's a hard thing to grasp every day. Like I said before, these guys
around me, being around them every day, that really does help. It's just a
matter of being patient, like you said, and keep working hard. If you do the
right thing, you'll getting an opportunity. I got my opportunity and I just
tried to do what I do and I try to play.  
  
As for West Virginia, we know what they do. It's going to be a fun game. It's
going to be fast-paced. Their guards are really good. Their bigs are really
good. So it's going to be another fun game in March.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how much has the a chronic conversation about what you
aren't, because of your size, fueled you for the entirety of your career?  
BONZIE COLSON: I'll just say being motivated, being motivated to do what I can
do to help us succeed as possible. Trying to lead by example on and off the
court, and, just use, what they say, as motivation. Our team, we're focused in
on what we can do and how we can be better. I think that's something that is
within our program. We don't really worry about what other people say. We lock
in and we know what we can do to win games.  
  
Q. Is there anyone that helped you believe that it doesn't matter what
mold you fit, you can just play?  
BONZIE COLSON: I think growing up, my father was a huge example of always be
there for me and just motivating me to be the best player possible. Then
coming here and having the great coaching staff, having great brothers and
teammates who just push me to be the best player I can be. And learning from
guys, former leaders, former captains, of how to lead on and off the court is
something that has really helped me to be a good captain and leader.  
  
Q. Maybe we'll start with Steve on the match-up. The number one
turnover-forcing team in the nation. What do you see?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. They do a great job of forcing people to get out of
their comfort zone. I think their defense creates and turns it to their
offense, and that's something that they're really known for. I think the way
we play, we do a great job handling the ball, give credit to Matty and our
guards to make great decisions. So for us I think for us the challenge is just
going to be making sure, making the right decisions and not rushing. I think
that's something we've been very good at all season long, so just taking our
time, making the right decision, and I think we'll be able to get some good
shots.  
  
Q. And, Matt, you're going to be in the middle of that. Have you ever
faced a defense like this?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, you know, we've kind of compared them to Florida State a
little bit. Being in the passing lanes, contesting full-court pressure. I
think there's is a little more difference, a little more havoc, I would say,
or reckless, you got guys everywhere. So, we just need to stay poised with the
ball. We need guys to be receivers. Everybody that's on the floor needs to be
a receiver. We need to be strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Bonzie, if you can comment. What allows you guys -- I mean, one team
made 40 turnovers. You haven't made 40 turnovers in the last six games
combined. What do you think allows you guys to have so few turnovers?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I just think within our program, that's something that we
like to do. We like to not turn over the ball, be strong with the ball, and I
think playing teams like Florida State and Louisville has really helped us
prepare for games like this, where they press. They deny the perimeter. I
think playing those ACC games really helped us to play the games like this.  
  
Q. Steve, what lessons as a team do you feel like you guys have taken
away from the Elite Eight runs the last two years, and personally how do you
feel, if at all, your mental approach has changed this being your senior
year?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think obviously the last two years, having that experience
has helped us a lot. I think you saw yesterday first round, close game, we
were pretty poised. We've been in those situations before, and I think those
two losses in the Elite Eight drives this team, especially since the end of
last year. The three who are up here, and the guys in the locker room knows
what it felt like to lose, and that's kind of pushed us this year to try to
take it a step further, and I think we just have to continue to take it one
game at a time.  
  
Q. Inaudible question.  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy it and soak up all the
experience of the NCAA Tournament. I've been lucky to be here the past three
years. Coach Brey always talks about not to take it for granted. Not everybody
has an opportunity to play in the tournament. We've had a couple good runs.
It's been a great season. We've had a lot of huge wins. I just want to
continue to play as long as I can, and that starts with tomorrow and trying to
get to the next round.  
  
Q. Matt, how would you describe Thursday's crowd in terms of Irish
support?  
MATT FARRELL: We love our fans. We feel like we got the best fans. Crowd
starting piling up, I think in the second half, a lot of Princeton, a lot of
West Virginia people, so I'm sure a lot of people seemed to be pulling for the
upset. But we love our crowds. They always travel well. They're always really
supportive, and there's been a couple games where we played in Greensboro for
the ACC Tournament and the whole place was blue, and we have our little spot
behind the bench and they're just as loud. So we appreciate everything they
do. They know that, we know that, that we appreciate it.  
  
Q. Bonzie, how typical of a comment is it, a team like Notre Dame,
sometimes it's like the Yankees fans, seemingly everywhere all over the
country. How common is that when you go play road games and neutral side games
when there's a large Irish contingency?  
BONZIE COLSON: Like Matt said we love the fans. We feed off the fans' energy
during the game. It's great when we're coming, getting ready for the game,
heading to the bus, and the band's playing our fight song, and the fans are
cheering and clapping. I think that gets us motivated and gives us a lot
energy to play well. We play for our family, we play for the fans, for the
University. So it just helps us play with that edge.  
  
Q. I was just in your locker room. There's a TV in there and guess what
it's tuned into. I'm wondering amidst all of your preparation for the games
themselves, if you're also able to be fans of March Madness and if it's like
us, like most of the people watching, if it's a cool annual event to you guys
beyond the fact that you obviously get to play in it?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. This is something we've all been watching our whole
lives. We've got a lot of friends from many teams, friends that we've grown up
playing in this game. We're texting each other, we talking about the games,
seeing when they play, trying to tune in. This is a great culture for our
basketball, just watching games. We're way into it, watching different
experiences, learning from the game. I think it's something that really helps
us bring the culture together.  
  
MATT FARRELL: I think it's all part of being in the tournament and that
experience. You get to watch these other games. You get to see all these crazy
games, the buzzer beaters, stuff like that. Like Bonzie said, a lot of us have
friends out here playing, too. We're always talking and seeing how they're
doing. It's a fun atmosphere. We do have the loosest coach in America. We got
TVs on, we just hang out and have a good time.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on that for Bonzie, well, all of you, what
impressions do you have of the tournament so far? Are there common themes?
What struck you when you watched these games?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I think all of the games are great. Just tuning in,
walking in, watching them. Enjoying the game and not taking them for granted.
The game's been fun. Hasn't really been any upsets, I don't think. Just paying
attention, watching the games.  
  
Q. What do you get out of it, Matt?  
MATT FARRELL: It's a tournament of champions. It's obviously really fun to
watch. Every team in this tournament is capable of winning games. It's a fun
time. It's a time for basketball fans to just really enjoy, and just sit down
and watch it. I think it's the greatest sporting event that we have. It's a
lot of fun to watch.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I would just say the one thing from watching yesterday,
is every single game is a close game. You're not going to see many blow-outs
in this tournament. Like Matt said, every team has had a heck of a regular
season. They probably won their league, and they are all coming down to the
wire. I know yesterday they played early, so we got to watch pretty much the
rest of the games for the day, which was cool. And just to see guys hitting
big shots, making plays, and especially the guys in our conference who we've
played against all season long. And watching them go against other
conferences, I think it's pretty fun.  
  
Q. First, happy St. Patrick's Day you to guys. I was wondering Bonzie if
you could talk about the matchup with West Virginia, first of all as a team
and secondly individually how you think of them.  
BONZIE COLSON: They're a team that's defensively oriented. They press the
whole game. They defend. They have some three-point shooters, have drivers. So
it's going to be a fun game, and I think going over their scout, we played
teams like that who can really defend and can really deny up to the perimeter.
So I think playing in the ACC has really helped us.  
  
Myself, just sticking with what I do, trying to be the best rebounder I can
out there, grabbing all the rebounds, just playing within myself, staying in
character, and motivating my teammates as best I can so they get to do things
they want to do as well.  
  
Q. Steve, the fact that it is St. Patrick's Day and you guys are the
Fighting Irish. Is there anything that you guys do that's special to celebrate
the day or anything like that?  
STEVE VASTURIA: No, not so far, I don't think. Maybe if we get a win and go
back to South Bend and enjoy St. Patrick's Day there. But nothing -- just try
to enjoy the holiday.  
  
Q. Inaudible question.  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. You could say that.  
  
Q. Matt, I wonder if you could expand on the loosest coach in America?
What makes Mike so loose?  
MATT FARRELL: How about this? He comes into the locker room right after he
gets off the court and puts on a green hoodie and said he has to get into St.
Patrick's mode for the media. We've got a game tomorrow, we got to the Sweet
16 game, and this guy is worried about what he's wearing for the media.  
  
It's an atmosphere and he creates an environment, where you're having fun and
you've got guys that want to win and want to play for each other and the
coaches, and I think that's really powerful.  
  
Q. What's your experience been like in Buffalo? Granted, there's a large
number of Irish fans here. This is a big St. Patrick's Day city. Have you guys
had any weird experiences with Buffalonians coming up to you, and whether it's
words of encouragement and what not, Bonzie?  
BONZIE COLSON: There's a lot of snow here. There was a lot of snow, so I think
it's kind of similar to South Bend, a lot of snow on the ground. But, I mean,
fans have been great here. We're enjoying it, not taking it for granted. We're
going to the hotel. There's cookies, there's snacks for us. We feel like we're
home. We're just having fun. We're enjoying it, and we're having a good time.  
  
Q. Have you guys done anything fun, Steve?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. We went out to eat the first night we were here,
probably one of the best steaks and lobster bisque that I ever had. It was
SEAR?  
  
BONZIE COLSON: SEAR?  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah, it was really good. I think we're going to go grab some
food tonight. Yeah, just trying to take it all in and enjoy the town.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach, Mike Brey.  
  
Q. Mike, well, you obviously did come out with a green pullover and
happy St. Patrick's Day. What is the feeling today, being it's St. Patrick's
Day?  
MIKE BREY: Well, can we make this quick? I'm the honorary grand marshal of the
parade in an hour. If I can get out of here, I've got to kiss babies, and wave
to people. The float I'm on, they say, is awesome. I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. No. St. Patrick's Day?  
MIKE BREY: No. It's awesome. There's always a little buzz around our
University and our place on St. Patrick's Day. There's no question about it.
And figured I would break out the festive green for it, you know? I'll say
this, St. Patrick's Day is great when you're still alive in the NCAA
Tournament. It sucks when you're not.  
  
Q. It was a stretch yesterday in the first half where you guys converted
coming out of time-outs on three or four and got what you wanted. There were a
lot of experienced teams in America. Not everyone could execute to that level.
Two parter. What's it like to have that ace and what's it take to get to that
point to get guys to do that?  
MIKE BREY: I think you have to have high basketball I.Q. guys and experience
and veterans, and we're an older group, and we're an older group that has won
together and we've won together in this tournament. So, I think the
concentration and focus level in Brooklyn was fabulous. And yesterday, even
though it was not pretty offensively for us, I thought we were very locked in.
But we did get some good stuff, especially post-ups for Bonzie out of time-
outs. We thought that was really good.  
  
You know, again, this group has played together a lot now, and they know who
they are. I give them a lot of credit that they kind of figure it out in our
motion, and it's not maybe a specific play all of the time.  
  
Q. Matt just termed you loosest coach in America. I'm wondering if
earlier in your career, if anybody referred to you as that or is that
something you aged into?  
MIKE BREY: I think I was a little more uptight when I got to South Bend in
2000 because I was trying not to get fired. You're trying to survive and build
it. Even though -- I would say this inwardly, I was more uptight. I think I
always tried to be loose with our guys and not get them uptight. Of course,
when you're a little more established, you can really be loose. I have tenure
now at Notre Dame, so I'm really loose.  
  
Q. Similar -- we have a rare confluence tomorrow of two coaches who
don't wear ties facing each other. I think we know a lot of the back story
behind Coach Huggins' decision there. But you got to do it differently because
you actually are dressed quite slickly, but without a tie. I know in the past
you had another way of dressing as well. I wonder if you can take us through
that and your current thinking?  
MIKE BREY: Maybe I was the one that got the turtleneck popular. That was my
look. And when I got to Notre Dame the first, I said did you really think that
through? I said I was in America East. It's a bus league. You wear a
sweatshirt on a bus, when you beat Boston University and you bus six hours.  
  
So it was comfortable and I stayed with it until my daughter said Dad, that's
got to go. That's out. That's got to go. But there's no way I can put the tie
on. You're right. Bob and I were kidding at the meeting and said, we run into
each other, two guys not wearing ties. I don't know how the NCAA feels about
that, the whole decorum rule, if we'll get a fine, or whatever.  
  
Q. Question about the Irish fan base here in Buffalo, did it feel like a
neutral site at all yesterday for you?  
MIKE BREY: No, it didn't. I think this town is a good N.D. town. Over 17
years, I've run into people from here that are big N.D. fans, whether alums or
subway alums. I hope they can get out of jail by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow to come to
our game, because they're rolling today, I can tell you that much. Matter of
fact, we have some extra bail money just to make sure we can get them out. We
know what happens with the Irish on a day like today.  
  
Now, there's no question in the second half yesterday, it felt like a road
game. You know, West Virginia fans, Princeton fans are certainly -- Bucknell
fans certainly cheering for Princeton, and that was kind of a road atmosphere
in the ACC we had to escape. I think we'll be well-represented tomorrow,
though.  
  
Q. With your son going to school around these parts has he told you how
Buffalo does St. Patrick's Day parades whatnot?  
MIKE BREY: He did a little bit, but the waitress helping us this morning, I
said Is it big here? And she went on for ten minutes how it's unbelievable.
I'm sure starting today, the bar's open at noon, and we're off and running.  
  
Q. Mike, in an era when so many players are leaving early, I wonder if
Villanova and even you if you would ever within a national championship,
programs like yours with your experience are more equipped to repeat?  
MIKE BREY: I think they are. Jay and I's program as you know is kind of built
the same way with guys that grow up into the program and get older and aren't
necessarily McDonald's All-Americans. I think it's a huge advantage. I think
what it's done -- through the Big East and the ACC, we've been very consistent
because we've never been too young. We've had guys growing up, we've had -- I
call it the junior year light bulb go on, Zach Auguste, V.J. Beachem, guys
that are with us for two years, Matt Farrell, you throw them in there, and
then as juniors they're really ready to deliver for you.  
  
I tell young catches when you get the job, get old and stay old. Can you get a
rhythm to your roster whether you're redshirting, taking transfers, which
we've done, to stay older really helps.  
  
Q. Mike you've got a long history from West Virginia from years gone
guy. Just some of your memory, good, bad. You've had a lot of success in those
runs.  
MIKE BREY: We've had great games with West Virginia. This is bringing back a
lot of Big East memories all afternoon and last night. I'm thinking about our
game certainly against John Beilein, and since Bob has been there. I guess my
memory is, how hard the Mountaineer crowd is on us down there. It is one of
the most brutal -- I have heard some of the most unbelievable stuff. What I'll
do is turn to my assistant and say God, that was a good one. He really ripped
me on that one. No.  
  
It's been unbelievable down there. Great games, great battles. The last game I
remember, we had that two seed with Ben Hansbrough, we go down there and West
Virginia beat us. Jerry West's son is a walk-on. He throws him in the game, he
bangs down a three across from our bench, and I said we ain't winning today.
Jerry hits a three, let's go home, get ready for the next one. Just great
match-ups, Pittsnogle, ball screen, stepping back and shooting the three,
Butler, you know, through the years. We played a lot of great games, a lot of
great memories.  
  
Q. That was obviously interesting the other day when you compared Matt
with Bobby Hurley. I was kind of wondering what have you seen with southwest
Virginia's Jevon Carter and how do you see the match-up with him and Matt
tomorrow.  
MIKE BREY: Matt Farrell is not better than Jerry West. Okay? I just want to be
clear on that. I think it's a gray match-up and they played on an All Star
team this summer, th East Coast All Stars. They know each other. They were in
Italy. They are buddies and went after each other in practice. It's a big
matchup.  
  
Carter is a heck of a guard and he's a winner. Big shot taker, heck of a
defender. That's a great match-up and the point.  
  
Q. It seems like the players are so phenomenal in shooting threes these
days, how has that evolved since you started coaching?  
MIKE BREY: It's an amazing weapon now and almost all of us really use it. You
know, I guess a great example is you have a three on two fast break. God, we
were drilled as young players, you got to get a lay -up. Now guys spot up and
fire and there's not even a second thought. I don't ever see a coach yell
that's a bad shot if it's the right guy shooting it.  
  
It's an amazing weapon. It's one that we use offensively, and it's one that we
worry about defensively. Certainly yesterday was an example of that. How can
we limit guys, you know, of making threes again? Our three-point line defense
is something we talk about and it's been probably our best this year. That's
why it's helped us.  
  
Q. Another unrelated question. You have a very solid fan in the governor
of New Jersey, where does that go back from?  
MIKE BREY: Delaware. He's a Delaware grad. Chris Christie is a Delaware grad.
When he got the job he was just an attorney. Big hoops guy and was real
supportive of my program. Now his daughter is at N.D. and is a manager for us.
We were great friends when I was in Newark, Delaware, and he was a hoops fan
lawyer from New Jersey. He knows more about my team than some of my staff. The
guy's unbelievably plugged into our stuff, so love having him around.  
  
Q. Steve and V.J. both gave you a lot of credit for saying they are both
kind of soft-spoken kids in their freshman and sophomore year, saying you were
really instrumental helping them open up. I wonder if you can talk about what
you saw from them from that standpoint when they were young and how they kind
of matured?  
MIKE BREY: They were really quiet guys and we had good vocal old guys when
they were young and I think what's helped them, too, is seeing some of the
older guys that have come before them. They saw Jerian Grant and Pat
Connaughton lead one heck of a team two years ago. That's the best example
ever. Nothing I can tell them is going to get them more ready to lead than
seeing that.  
  
Then they saw Demetrius Jackson and Zach Auguste do a job that maybe I didn't
expect they could do, being vocal and verbal. So they had come out of their
shell. You add Bonzie and Matt Farrell to that, and it's been a nice chemistry
of voices leading our team.  
  
Q. We've made a lot all season long about the idea of a quick
turnaround, getting prepared for the Mountaineers, and that pressure defense.
What has it been like for you guys from the scout with your assistants, to now
this 48 hours leading up to tip-off to face a bit of an unorthodox style?  
MIKE BREY: I think we tried to compare them to Florida State which we played
three times, playing, 11, 12 guys, getting up and getting into you. The game
in Tallahassee we lost. We turned it over 18 times. We did not take care of
the basketball. The other two times we did. We tried to make a comparison and
get back to that kind of prep. I don't want to over-coach it. We have press
offense that you work on back in October. You don't want to overanalyze it too
much. We need guys to be receivers. I think we can prepare in a day.  
  
I've got really pretty sharp guys and high basketball I.Q. guy, so I think our
thing is, you know, when we get through it, are we looking to attack? Are we
looking to run offense, and then we have to change defenses on them. We can't
play man-to-man the whole game. We got to make them play against something
different to kind of maybe change their rhythm, since they change your rhythm
with full-court pressure.  
  
Q. Speaking of rhythm. They say they want to speed up opposing teams. Is
that a mental thing, physical thing, how do you keep your guys from getting
caught up in it?  
MIKE BREY: We're not the fastest. If you look at our pace, we have been kind
of a situational running team. I think what we do is we've gotten to do a good
job when we don't have numbers in transition, we kind of back that thing out
and make you guard us for a while. And we're going to have to be disciplined
with that. Now that's easier said than done because they're really good in the
half court. They face guarding you, they just run and trap you there. So,
finding the rhythm in this game, I think, is going to gee a feeling-out
process us tomorrow in the first half.  
  
Q. Are you going to sleep easier tonight because you got Matt? Because
if you got an inexperienced point guard they'll chew that guy into much?  
MIKE BREY: There's no question. Matt, Steve Vasturia, Gibbs, Rex Pflueger, our
big guys. Bonzie can bring the ball up a little bit. We don't turn the ball
over much. It's a team that doesn't turn the ball over. I think we're first or
second or third in the nation against a team that turns people over. So
something's got to give. We're going to kick it around a little more than
usual, but we have to be great tomorrow overall to win.  
  
Q. Mike, this is almost a follow-up on Matt. I think you may have raised
at least some eyebrows here in comparing Matt to Bobby yesterday --  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. \-- or two days ago, I'm sorry. What gives you that confidence that
he is that type of a player and what do you make of the adjustment that he's
made in going from where he was a year ago to where he is now?  
MIKE BREY: You know, my comparison is skill set, not honor, skill set, period.
And I think his ability to play fearlessly and make plays off the ball screen,
which he's had to do all year, and then his ability, to score and make shots,
makes him unbelievably valuable to us. He shoots it and he shoots it deep. He
can make the runner in the lane. He can get to the hole with his speed and get
fouled. He's pretty much automatic from the foul line.  
  
So that why I made the comparison, but also that's why we got a chance to get
to the second weekend. We lose Grant and Jackson, two guards to the NBA, the
big question mark was who's going to handle the ball for us. And for him to do
what he's done, I mean it's just a great story. Really a neat story and glad
he's coming back for another year, I think.  
  
Q. Obviously, last night, being a high point of the season for you guys,
can you look back and think, you know, the lowest point of the season for you
and your team and what you guys did to kind of fight through that?  
MIKE BREY: We lost five out of six in the ACC and the fifth was at North
Carolina. Remember that game that was postponed because the water in Chapel
Hill was so -- everything was screwed up. We played great. We made a comeback,
lost to Carolina there. That was five out of six, and we were six and five in
the league, coming home to play Wake Forest. We kind of had to make our stand
against Wake, and we did. We played very nervous in the first half because we
knew how much was on the line to get going again, then we beat Florida State
on that Saturday, and we've been on a pretty good run ever since. Again, when
you have maturity and older guys and their demeanor is kind of like that, you
can handle five out of six without panic.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Donte DiVincenzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32854)

### [Jalen Brunson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30875)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Mount St. Mary's - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright and student-athletes,
Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo. Gentlemen, congrats on advancing to the
winner of the Wisconsin game. Same format. We'll have Coach open with a
statement.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: I just want to compliment Jamion and his team. They were just
great. They really outplayed us. We just, at the end, had more size and some
more talented players that just made plays. But they were better prepared,
Jamion had them better prepared than I did, and they played better. We just
had bigger, better athletes, but they were a great team. I thought they were
the better team tonight. And they deserve a lot of credit, a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Donte, is @DonteDiVincenzo your actual Twitter account?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Yes, it is. But I don't have Twitter anymore.  
  
Q. But you only have, like, 4500 followers?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: Yes, it is. I don't have it anymore.  
  
Q. I know a couple months ago, Coach Wright dared to compare you with
your star player, and a lot of people are like, oh, really? But you had a bit
of a break-out performance tonight. How is it happening for you especially,
first half, when there was some turbulence?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: My job off the bench is just to bring energy, focus on
defending and rebounding. The offense came tonight after just pushing it on
offense, after getting a rebound. So if I just focus on that, all of the
offense will come.  
  
Q. Can you maybe talk -- describe how rebounding is a part of your game
because you come into the game averaging only three and a half, but you have
eight by halftime. And how significant do you think that was to getting the
team kick-started?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I mean, we didn't come out the first half with energy off
the start, and, I mean, we have some great rebounders on our team. All of us
can rebound the ball. I mean, throughout the year, you see us, some guys have
eight, nine, rebounds a game. But tonight, I just -- my guy was going back, I
was free to go to the rim and chase down the ball, and I just had a knack for
the ball tonight.  
  
Q. For Jalen, could you put your finger on why you guys got off to such
a slow start and were there any nerves involved?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I just -- Mount St. Mary's is a great team. We were watching
them. We knew going into the game that they have the ability to play the way
they did. I mean, they came out shooting the ball, sharing the ball and just
playing with great energy. And, I mean, you got to give them credit. We just
got to come out and play harder. Just got to give them credit about that.  
  
Q. Jalen, also, for you, you guys live a lot on the three-point line,
and when you come out slow like you did in that first half, particularly Kris,
not to single him out, but he got some really good looks. What's your mindset
in terms of how are we going to make up for what we're not doing?  
JALEN BRUNSON: We've got to make up on the defensive end. We got to make sure
we're defending and rebounding. I think when Donte came in off the bench he
did a great job sparking us with some energy and defensive rebounds. It felt
like he was getting every rebound out there and gave us a little bit of
energy. When we're not making shots, we can't really focus on that. We have to
focus on defending and rebounding on our possession. There are going to nights
like tonight where we don't make shots, like in the first half, so we've just
got to focus on defense.  
  
Q. Last time this year you were hurt. What were your emotions like
coming into this game to participate and play this year?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I mean, it's a big stage, my first time being in an NCAA
Tournament. But my mindset was just our next game. It was our biggest game
because it was our next game. My energy went towards my teammates. I wasn't
focused on anything on the outside, and I think it showed tonight.  
  
Q. What did you absorb last year from watching on the bench.  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: The leadership from Ryan and Daniel. When things got rough,
they got us together and they really calmed us down. Grinnell wasn't playing,
but you could can see we were just all together out there, all five guys on
the court.  
  
Q. Jalen, it seemed like tonight you made a concerted effort to take
your guy inside and get shots closer to the basket. Was that something you
were trying to do?  
JALEN BRUNSON: I think like Coach said, we had a little bit of height
advantage and athleticism. I was just trying to make the right play at the
right time. When I got in the lane, I just felt like I could shore up my
defenders and when I got that close, I just ended up shooting it.  
  
Q. Last question, I guess, Donte, has to be asked, the two missed dunks.
What happened there?  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I don't know. The first one I took off too far, I guess. The
second one, I don't know what happened. I just didn't get a lot of lift. I
tried to get it back off the steal.  
  
Q. Was that one of those situations, the second one you were thinking I
the got to make up for the last one.  
DONTE DIVINCENZO: I wasn't really worried about that. It's something that goes
through your head after that second missed dunk.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tried to get you out of here, Donte before that one.  
  
Q. Hey, Jay, a follow-up to that question about the two dunks. Obviously
Donte had a great game. Is that one of the things you let him know about or,
after missing the dunks you kind of let it slide?  
JAY WRIGHT: I have no problem with that at all, none. Like you said, he made
two great defensive plays to get out there and he just took off. He's one of
our best dunkers. He took off too far on the first one and probably on the
second one, he should have gone off one foot. I think he heard the crowd as he
was going. They were kind of laughing and I think he slowed up and said I'll
go off two feet, which he did didn't have to do. It's one of those things a
freshman does. I won't say a word about that. I'm so proud about how he
rebounded and how he defended.  
  
Q. I noticed during one of the time-outs in the first half you got a
little animated with one of the refs. Do you care to share that
conversation?  
JAY WRIGHT: I do remember getting animated. I get animated on a lot of things.
I couldn't remember which one that was. You get frustrated when your team is
not playing the way you like them to and the other team is actually playing
better. Sometimes at that time you think it's a call. You always go back and
watch the film and find out it wasn't the call, it was your team. But, you
know, you'd think I'd be better at that after all these years but no.  
  
Q. Jay, your team prides itself on energy and playing as a team, and
that really wasn't present in the first half. What do you think was missing?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, Dana, I honestly don't know. I really thought after
-- this is our 35th game. I didn't think we were capable of that. I thought we
were capable of coming out and, you know, missing some shots, coming out and
making some mistakes. But the level of energy we started the game with, I just
didn't think we were capable of that. I'm in a little bit of shock myself.  
  
I do have to say, when you play a really quick team like Mount St. Mary's,
that's coming off the game, too, like, they came in the game with great
energy, great confidence. I think that's a credit to Jamion and his staff,
that they were right from the start. And we tried to have our guys ready.
That's on me, too. We didn't. I honestly don't have an answer. If I came up
with something, I would be BS'ing you.  
  
Q. I appreciate you didn't. Could it be the pressure? You don't know how
they'll handle pressure of a repeat until they walk into it. Could that be a
factor?  
JAY WRIGHT: It could be. You guys asked me a number of times, you dealt with
all season having to repeat as Big East Champions, and all this, how does that
affect you? I know now that it's over, how is this going to affect you? I
don't know. We'll see. Maybe that was a part of it. It surprises me if it was.
I know they were fired up to play. I do think some of it was Mount St. Mary's.
I really do. I think those three guards are smaller and quicker than any
guards we played against. It gave us trouble. We had a hard time early. We
adjusted to their speed and quickness. I think that was part of it.  
  
Q. You mentioned you felt Mount St. Mary's outplayed you. You said you
had to do a better job and everything. You seemed pretty animated at the end
of the game talking to Jenkins and Brunson on the bench a minute. What are you
saying and how kind of annoyed are you by what happened here tonight?  
JAY WRIGHT: I'm not annoyed. As I said to Dana, I really am shocked. I really
am. Again, not how well Mount St. Mary's played, just that we didn't start the
game with energy. We always do; you know? And I really don't have time to
figure it out. We've got to get on to the winner of this game, and that's the
beauty of this tournament. The beauty of the tournament is, if this was the
season, I'd say all right, we got to address this right now. I got to say we
got to forget about it and we got to get ready for the winner of this game.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up on that, 48 hours from now, you're going to be
playing again. If you play like you did in the first half tonight, can you
survive that?  
JAY WRIGHT: No. No. And I think they know that, you know? But that's still not
an excuse for not coming to play. But again it's on all of us. It's on our
leadership. It's on me. That's just part of it, man. We're lucky to advance.
We're lucky, and I think we'll put it behind us and I think we'll get ready.
We'll get ready for the winner of this game.  
  
Q. Jay, just before the game, I saw you were talking to your alma mater
in the locker room of picture service. Can you tell us what you said to your
alma mater?  
JAY WRIGHT: I just told them all of us are really proud of them. I have a
bunch of Bucknell guys I play basketball with, and we have a text thread that
we all stay on and follow the games. We always follow them. I thought they had
a great season and I thought they played great against West Virginia. West
Virginia is good, man. They're good and so is Bucknell.  
  
Q. Jay, Josh Hart didn't have his biggest statistical game. He really
did settle things down for you when you put him back in in at the end of the
first half and then the second half. Was he a settling presence?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. Even at the end of the first half, we never had a
lead. He had a big play. We put him in at the end of the first half with two
fouls which was a shaky decision. Because when you play a smaller team like
that, when a bigger body hits them, they go flying, and it looks like a
charge. We were afraid on that drive he could pick up his third foul and it
worked out for us. But he, in the second half was fresh, played really well,
played defensively well. We posted him up some. He's a huge part of what we
do. Him getting two quick fouls made the difference in the first half, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you, guys.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 86, Bucknell - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by West Virginia University head coach, Bob Huggins, as
well as student-athletes, Nathan Adrian, Esa Ahmad, and Tarik Phillip. Game
time Saturday, time to be announced, Coach decided to forego opening
statements. We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nathan, how far have you come as a rebounder this season?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I've come a long way. We lost a lot of rebounding with John and
Devin last year, so I knew someone had to step up and go get those, and I feel
I've done a decent job at it.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: I agree.  
  
ESA AHMAD: Me, too.  
  
Q. Nate, obviously last year at this time it didn't go so well for you
in this game. How much was it on your mind personally, not as a team?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Personally, it was on my mind a little bit through our
practice. We didn't have great practices last year, but this year I thought we
prepared a little better. We've got to play a little better defense, but we'll
fix it.  
  
Q. Esa, obviously you've had back issues in the last month or so. You
looked like you were pretty good today. Did you feel healthy? Was there a
bounce there? Did you say I have to take responsibility on my shoulders?  
ESA AHMAD: My back felt great out there, got a couple rebounds, and I just
tried to cut. My teammates found me and got the win, so --  
  
Q. For both Tarik and Esa, obviously the foul shooting difficulties you
had at times especially at Kansas is well-known. Tonight, two of you
especially went to line at clutch moments and hit shots. Does any of the past
come back to you in those moments? Do you think about it at all?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Coach has been telling us for the longest while that turnovers
and free throws are going to be the death of us, so if we limit turnovers and
make free throws, you got a great chance of winning.  
  
Q. Nate or anybody else. Nate, you mentioned your defense needs to get
better. What were you guys maybe able to do to stem Bucknell's tide, and what
do you want to do better Saturday?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think switching on one-three-one today helped us a lot, kind
of slowing down their drive a little bit. That's an effort thing. Between now
and Saturday, we have to get our heads right and play defense like we know how
to.  
  
Q. Nate, can you just describe the play when were you on -- you scrapped
for a loose ball, you were on your back, nice feed for a dunk there. It all
happened so fast. I don't even know how you saw that.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Me either. Just kind of what we do. We see a ball on the
ground, we get on the ground, we got to go get it. We have to get every 50/50
ball for us to win. I just grabbed it, try to get my head up, and look for the
first open guy.  
  
Q. Nate, could you talk about, and Tarik, too, maybe, what did Bucknell
do that proved bothersome to you guys the most? I mean, what they were doing
tonight?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: They got their ball to their big man often, and he was very
efficient, so I thought he played extremely well. Him and a few others played
extremely well. They were tough to guard, so -- Kimbal had five threes, I
heard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations guys. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Okay. We'll open it up for questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Now, how much pressure is on Nathan as a Morgantown native for this
setting of the NCAA Tournament?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't think very much. He had a cyst in his wrist, his shooting
wrist, his right wrist, his sophomore year and didn't shoot the ball very
well, which nobody would have, and didn't tell anybody about it until the
conference tournament. And I think he -- you know, people expected, you know,
more, or making shots, and they had no idea he was hurt. I had no idea he was
hurt. And he's banged up now, but he just -- you know, he fights through
things. He's a great competitor and a great person.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, could you talk about the play he made on the
base diving and making the pass on his back, and then also his disruptiveness
at the head of the press and half-court as well?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we weren't very good today in pressure. He and J.C. were
pretty good. The rest of our guys kind of called it off way too early. Nate
makes plays like that every day, so when he makes a play like that that other
people maybe think is a great play, we see him do it every day. So I don't
think anybody thought it was anything out of the ordinary.  
  
Q. First, Bob, just a couple questions. First, what did you think was
most troublesome that Bucknell was doing and, second, could you comment on
Tarik and what he did today?  
BOB HUGGINS: What Bucknell did was make shots. They don't always, you know,
nobody does, always make shots that well. McKenzie's 5 for 7 from three and
Steven Brown hit some big threes. Seemed like every time we started to get
away from them a little bit, they made a three. And like the guys said,
Foulland is really a good player. He's a really good player in any league.
He's athletic, and not just at the offensive end, he changed so many shots. He
really disrupted us, I think, offensively, with the shot-blocking ability.  
  
Q. How about Tarik, Coach?  
BOB HUGGINS: That's what Tarik does. You know, Tarik went from being a poor
free-throw shooter, and he's really put a lot of time in. I think he had a
streak of maybe 28, 29 in a row, and then he missed a couple and then he's
back on another streak. But Tarik puts an enormous amount of time in. And he's
actually listened better. He's actually listened when we talk to him about how
he could improve his shot.  
  
Q. Bob, obviously offensive rebounds are always a big part of your game
but tonight, did you know you sort of had to dominate in that area?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I thought we had a chance to, because, you know, Esa's
getting back to being Esa. And when you got a 6'7", 6'8" guy playing against
6'2", 6'3" guys, you ought to have an advantage. And I thought he was good,
Nate's always good. Elijah has just gotten better and better. We have to get
our guards to do a better job. But I thought those three guys were pretty
good. We miss enough shots, you know, there's enough to go around.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. Congratulations, see you tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 60, Princeton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Princeton University head coach, Mitch Henderson,
Devin Cannady, Steven Cook, and Spencer Weisz. We'll open with a statement and
open up to questions for student-athletes.  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: First, congratulations to Notre Dame. We had a shot. We
weren't that sharp tonight. Really, for us, it was such an enjoyable team to
coach, and I have to thank our seniors in particular, Steve and Spencer, for
their leadership. We lost two guys early in the season. Right now, this one
hurts. When you're in the locker room afterwards, it feels -- it's really hard
to say the proper thank you, because it feels like good-bye.  
  
But we're here because of these guys, and they made us a championship team
again, and we're thankful for that, and that they represented both Princeton
basketball and Princeton University in a first-class way, and I'm proud of
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, we'll take question just for Devin, Steven
and Spencer. Raise your and and we'll come across the aisle.  
  
Q. Devin on that last shot, did it feel good coming out of your hand,
and did you think it had a chance to go in?  
DEVIN CANNADY: I thought the shot was going in.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the plays you made down the stretch and with an
11-point lead. About 8 minutes to go, what was your mind set being able to get
back in the game.  
STEVEN COOK: You know, in a situation like that, you're trying to do
everything you can and claw back. I thought we really weren't sharp for the
majority of the game. We've been playing a lot better for the majority of the
year, and at the end, we started to get back to our old ways and get some
stops and make some shots, but, you know, sometimes you fall short.  
  
Q. Spencer, for you guys to shoot 8 for 31 from three and still be in
this game with a chance to win in this game. What did you have to do well to
sort of stay close?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Just bring toughness. I think it showed in the first half. They
definitely out-toughed us on everything, offensive rebounds, just getting
loose balls. Then the second half, we kind of adjusted and we asked ourselves,
what do we want to make of this game? We came out, clawed back, and it all
started, you know, on the defensive end for us. We didn't hit as many shots as
we would have liked, but we gave ourselves a shot at the end.  
  
Q. For Steve and Spencer, just perspective on the run here, this year in
the final season.  
STEVEN COOK: What was the question?  
  
Q. Ending your career with a run like in this season.  
STEVEN COOK: You know, I think this year has been amazing for us. You know,
accomplishing 16-0 in the Ivy League. You know, sort of getting the program
back to the NCAA Tournament, back to winning ways, and accomplishing
everything we set out to do. It's been an amazing season, and I've done it
with people I consider my family. And, you know, it's emotional for it to come
to an end, but I'm going to cherish everything I put into it, everything that
came up, because I put everything into this program, and into these four
years.  
  
SPENCER WEISZ: I'm just so proud of the team we became. Early on, we had rough
matches certainly, guys went down. People stepped up, goals changed,
nonetheless, we were committed to our goals and it showed. We had a great run.
We hadn't lost in a while. I'm sure people might -- it hurts for us right now,
certainly, and, you know, you want to go out with a win and a deep tournament
run, but nonetheless, we gave it our all, proud of the guys. It's been an
unbelievable year. It's been an unbelievable four years, and we couldn't have
asked for anything more.  
  
Q. Devin, you told us you thought the shot was going in. Can you take us
through the play, getting the ball, what your thoughts were?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yes. They missed the free throw. He came down the floor, I kind
of sent him a brush screen and both of the guys went with him. I got my feet
set, ball came in my shot pocket. I looked at the rim, and when the ball left
my hand, I thought it was good. It didn't go in and that's what happens when
you take those shots. It either does or doesn't. In this case it didn't and
the rest is --  
  
Q. For any of you three guy, last few years, the Ivy has really
increased its successes playing against three, fours and fives in the NCAA
tournament. How much of the gap now do you guys think you cut into to?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I think it shows. Every year, when the brackets come out, I'm
sure people are always looking at the Ivy League, who's representing and what
match-up they have, because at the end of the day, we feel we feel we can
compete with anyone. It's a testament to our league, testament to the players.
I'm looking forward to the growth of the league, and, hopefully, its
recognition. I think the Ivy League tournament certainly helps get us on a
national stage right before Selection show. There's a bright future, I think,
ahead for the Ivy League in general.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Devin, Steven, Spencer, thank you for your time. Congrats on a
great season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take follow-up questions for Coach Henderson at this
time. Right down here, front left here.  
  
A. Coach, the final shot by Devin at the end, what did you see from your
perspective and what did you see out of Notre Dame and the ability to defend
three-point shots?  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: I thought that shot's gone in an awful lot for us, Devin's
shot. It was a great look for us. I think we tried to get to the rim, but I
thought Notre Dame, they're smart, they're tough. They don't really put
anybody on the floor that doesn't have a ton of experience. And I thought that
was the story of the game, was they had a lot more experience in this moment,
and it showed. And we got -- this team has been punched in the face a little
bit throughout the course of the season, but they always respond. I've been on
teams where that doesn't happen. They did a great job but I was pleased with
the chances that we had.  
  
Q. Seems like your defense sparked late. Talk about the late run and
impact of the defense?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. Finally, right, Bill? We got going defensively and a
team that doesn't turn the ball over, they still only had six turnovers. They
do a really good job. You watch them on tape and it's a patient slow team. In
the game, it's even slower. It forces you to get out of your comfort zone, and
it really challenges all of the principles that you have defensively.  
  
I thought we settled in. We didn't play a great game offensively, but I
thought we really gave ourselves a chance to win the game on the defensive end
during that run.  
  
Q. Where do you see the Ivies now in the national landscape? The league
itself has really grown up and really re-established itself the last five or
six years, winning games, being competitive against good teams. Do you only
see that improving?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yes, yes. You know, there's Ivy League people here in the
room, and if you ask all of the coaches in the league, the answer to that
question is, you know, this comes as no surprise to all of us. Recruiting --
it starts with recruiting, and the message that these kids are hearing and
understanding is, why wouldn't I go to a high-level institution and further
myself in all parts of my life and take that opportunity and then play on the
national stage, too.  
  
Because that's what these guys are doing. And we sell that. It's not for
everybody. But we sell it, and then they get here and I think they commit to
playing team basketball. All of the teams in the league, the coaching, it's
team. What you see now is a product of three, four months of having to run
through the league. It's not the least bit surprising to me that we're here
and the talent level in the league is very high, an the coaching is very high.
So, we had a really good shot today. I felt good about it.  
  
Q. Going back to their perimeter defense, they were 5 for 17 in the
first half from three. That's maybe more, a lot of threes. Did you think --
what do you think you needed to do? Did you need to go to the rim a little
more, did you --  
MITCH HENDERSON: I thought we were a little impatient. But the looks we got
were good. 10 of those 17 were wide open, and just didn't go in. It went in on
Wednesday, and they went in this morning, and they didn't go in during the
game.  
  
And then people have had the same plan against us for a while. Like I said, we
haven't lost in a long time. This game looks very similar to some of the games
we've had recently and we've been able to get through it. I thought Colson
really changed things for us. Two fouls towards the end of the game hurt us,
they really hurt.  
  
Q. Mitch, considering some of that you just said about the shots not
going in and being open, do you sense this was a little bit of a missed
opportunity today?  
MITCH HENDERSON: You know, that may be, but that sort of smacks of being
bitter, and I want to give recognition to this group. We're here because of
them, and I'm so proud of the way that they responded and gave ourselves
chances to win. That's all you can ask for. So, no, we'll talk -- this will
hurt, but then we're going to get together and celebrate what the season was.  
  
Q. In the first half, Notre Dame shot five threes, in the second half,
they shot 11. Was there an effort to make them shoot more three-pointers?
Because their percentage did drop. Is that part of your defensive scheme?  
MITCH HENDERSON: We were hopeful. It's a little bit like looking in the
mirror. They made a lot of threes and shot them well. Our objective was try to
get them to put it on the floor. I thought we were double-teaming Colson, and
they kicked it to Farrell and he made two threes. And we've had a lot of
success with our double-teams and that hurt. We made an adjustment, and it got
us a little less aggressive. Those are key. Those still have to go in, and
they went in, and that changed the course of the game, I think.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about your seniors, but could you just
go a little bit more into detail about what it's been like to see them grow
through this process at Princeton?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. They looked just like my freshman did four years ago.
What you see now is a responsibility, and, you know, the one thing that's wild
is once they figure it out and they are exactly where you want them, they
graduate.  
  
I'm going to miss them all so much, and in particular, these two guys. Spencer
has allowed us to play a certain way, and we're very difficult to guard. And
then Steve, we were just in the locker room, and some of his teammates were
saying some incredible things about him. He truly makes you want to be a
better person when you're around him. He's academic All American, our first
since 1998, and he certainly deserves every bit of that recognition.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a terrific season.  
  
MITCH HENDERSON: Thanks, guys.

### [Nigel Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26720)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 84, Virginia Tech - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Wisconsin head coach, Greg Gard, and student-athletes
Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig. Congratulations, guys, on a victory that
advances you on to play Villanova Saturday night. We're waiting on game times.
Hope to have them to you before we're done this evening. We'll open with Coach
Gard making an opening statement.  
  
GREG GARD: Thank you. Obviously extremely happy for our guys, really proud of
how they battled. Virginia Tech's -- Buzz has got a heck of a team. Knew that
obviously, and not surprised watching them on film and preparing for them. We
knew, obviously when you get to this time of the year, they're all good. And
we were able to do just enough and make enough shots, get to the foul line
enough, specifically in the second half, to be able to hold them off and get
enough stops there at the end to seal it up.  
  
Like I said, I'm happy for these two guys to my right and the other 15 guys in
the locker room. A heck of a team effort.  
  
Q. Several times they cut it to one in the second half, and you would
come right back and hit a three. I was just wondering, were you looking for
your shot in those moments or did it just sort of work out that way?  
BRONSON KOENIG: You can definitely say I was looking for my shot. It's
something I take pride in, being a senior point guard, is making plays in
critical moments. And I knew when they kept cutting it to one that I was going
to have to make some type of play, so I was just trying to be as aggressive as
possible.  
  
Q. Bronson, were you just feeling it today? Were there certain things
you were able to take advantage of with their defense? How do you explain this
is the game where you broke a school record with eight three-pointers?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I was feeling it a little bit. I don't think I shot all that
well, to be honest, looking at my numbers. But I knew the way they were going
to play defense with the switching and everything like that, and going back to
zone, and back and forth, that I was going to be able to get some open looks
if I just kept moving them. My teammates did a good job of both screening and
passing me the ball. Like I said before, searching for it and just trying to
stay on the attack.  
  
Q. Bronson, how big of a lift was it to stay within -- stay up by a
point the entire time?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I mean, we just try to battle every single possession, and
their guards are really good, especially off that ball screen. So we were
trying to do the best we could to keep them in front and, I mean, that's
something we'll look back on and need to improve moving forward. But, yeah,
being up one and our guys hitting their free throws was huge for us and just
making big plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Nigel, how much do you feel like your just general tournament
experience that -- you guys have been here all four years with Virginia Tech.
How do you feel that paid off for you down the stretch.  
NIGEL HAYES: I think it definitely helped a lot for us to have the older guys
that we have and have been through some of the runs we've had in the
tournament. I think it showed with Bronson the way he responded to each time
they went on a run. Each time they hit a bit shot, he responded with a big
shot and that's something that you need. Although this another game, it's in
tournament, so the emotion is higher, energy is higher, guys are playing more
up tight. And I think when you have that experience, you're able to relax a
little more and you can go out and break school records.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. For the guy, your defense, what do you think worked for you and what
was your game plan that worked for you?  
NIGEL HAYES: Our defense, it wasn't good at all today. I'm sure he'll be up
all night with clenched fists watching film at how poor we were. We didn't do
well guarding their ball screens at all. We gave up a lot of paint touches, a
lot of and-ones and finishes. We fouled three-point shooters two or three
times, which is definitely a cardinal sin in any program. We didn't do well
with dribble penetration, which again was one of the key things we wanted to
take care of. We know they can drive and kick extremely well, so we were
fortunate that -- you know, we needed a score record-breaking performance in
order to beat them. They're a really good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any other questions, Bronson, Nigel,
congratulations. We'll see you here tomorrow. Further questions for Coach
Gard.  
  
Q. To go on the 10-1, I think it was run, in the last two minutes there,
is that more you guys and your experience in those type of games, or was it
rigid attack fading a little bit you see from their offense?  
GREG GARD: I thought we got the ball in some pretty high percentage areas. We
wanted to make sure, we tried to touch the post when we could. We shot quite a
few free throws down the stretch, too, so it's part of it. I don't know. I've
only coached one team, so I can't judge in terms of what they are going
through. I thought we had guys make key plays at key times, and that's what
you have to have at this time of year if you want to continue to advance.
Different people have to step up at different times. We're able to get enough
stops at the end to be able to come back and answer and get a little
separation.  
  
Q. You've obviously seen Bronson a lot. Where did tonight rank from what
you've seen?  
GREG GARD: Well, I can probably remember his two turnovers or whatever he had.
Oh, he had one. Okay? You know, he's -- I've known him since he was a freshman
in high school, recruited him for three years before he committed to us. So
I've seen him do a lot of things. Watched him win two state championships. I
watched him four years here with us. He's a heck of a player.  
  
He did a very good job without the ball tonight. He played more without the
ball than he did with the ball for the most part because of what we wanted to
run against what they were doing defensively. So, he found spots. As he
mentioned teammates did a good job of screening and finding him, and I don't
know if it's his best shooting performance. Obviously it sets a record, but he
had 17 attempts to do it, too. But he's a good player. There's no doubt about
that. He's the school's all-time leader in three-point shooting. It's pretty
obvious. He's been fun to coach.  
  
Q. Greg, what do you make of what, you know, Bronson said in taking
ownership as being a senior point guard and saying, you know, I needed to
respond when the time came especially when they were, you know, inching within
-- to respond to three-point basketball scoring?  
GREG GARD: He's done that throughout the year. He's hit big shots for us. He
hit a big shot -- everybody remembers the shot against Xavier last year that
he hit to send us to the Sweet 16. He has a tendency to obviously have the
ball in his hands, so the opportunities go up. That's usually where you put
your -- at the end of the game, you want the ball in your point guard's hands,
whether it's him shooting or making plays for others. And he was
opportunistic, and he hit obviously timely shots when we needed it. Like I
said, teammates found him, too. It wasn't always him making a play with the
ball. It was some inside out, touching the post, throwing it back out and him
relocating and finding open spots. So he gets the credit for knocking down
shots, but other guys had hands in helping that happen.  
  
Q. And just as a follow-up, I know the point guard, the mentality, to
have that confidence and to be able to deliver it, what does it say about
somebody like him?  
GREG GARD: Well, he's gone through games where he's gone one for eight or one
for nine, too. So the biggest thing about shooters, they have to have a short
memory when things aren't going well. We've gone through -- I think he went
one for ten when we were at Madison Square Garden against Rutgers this year.
He came over to the bench and said what's wrong. I said keep shooting. You've
got to keep shooting when you're a shooter of his level. Because eventually
you going to get one to go and it start to snowball. You can't lose confidence
when you're a player like that.  
  
Q. Nigel mentioned the cardinal sin of fouling somebody while taking a
three-point shot. Justin Bibbs had eight points on two four-point plays. I
don't know how rare that is?  
GREG GARD: In two out-of-bounds plays we went over specifically in practice
for two days.  
  
Q. Where is that on the aggravation scale?  
GREG GARD: Well, here's the thing. They shoot the three so well, and maybe we
made too big of a deal as a staff about taking away their threes, that we had
them hyper-alert to them shooting threes specifically off out-of-bounds plays
or anywhere. I'll look through the tape to see why we gave up so much dribble
penetration. Some of it we weren't as compressed and compact defensively as we
normally are, knowing that they had so many shooters on the floor. We were a
little more spread. They do that to you, too. They did it throughout the year
to teams in the league as I went through films.  
  
So the first one Bronson runs right into Bibbs, and the second one Iverson
runs right into him. They need to take a better route, but also we need to do
a better job taking away the action to that. And the scout team running is one
thing, when you go against a team that's done it all year, and has the timing
down of that. Late we made an adjustment and jumped it from the guy taking the
ball out of bounds to take it away. But we have to be smarter in terms of not
-- you don't foul three-point shooters whether it's an out-of-bounds play or
not.  
  
So, we'll look at the tape, I'm sure, and see if Villanova runs any of those
same type of plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not seeing any more questions, Coach, congratulate you again,
see you back here again tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
West Virginia - 86, Bucknell - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Joined now by Bucknell head coach, Nathan Davis, as well
as Stephen Brown, Kimbal Mackenzie, and Zach Thomas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to have an opening statement from Coach Davis
before we take questions for our student-athletes only. Coach?  
  
NATHAN DAVIS: First off, let me congratulate Coach Huggins and his team. They
had an outstanding season. They have an outstanding team. We knew it was going
to be very difficult to win the game. We felt like if we played well, we'd
have a chance and we certainly did. I thought our guys showed tremendous
character falling behind, 27-15 or maybe 27-12. To find a way to not get down
on each other, to fight back, to get it to a three-point game there in the
second half. They showed the heart of a champion. Unfortunately I don't get to
coach this same group again, but I'm looking forward to getting back at it
with the guys coming back next year.  
  
It's going to hurt for a little while, as it should, because we're competitive
guys, these are competitive guys. But we'll move on and hopefully we'll get
better from this.  
  
Q. For any of you the players, you can all answer this. Offensive
rebounding for West Virginia, they're getting three-point shots, but got it
back on offensive rebound again. Did you know that was going to be an issue
coming in and how difficult was it coming into the game?  
STEPHEN BROWN: We knew coming in that offensive rebounding was part of their
game plan. Our goal was limit them to one shot only, to get the rebound, and
get out from beating the press, but down the stretch, you saw that they got a
lot of second-chance opportunities after their misses, and then that kind of
hurt us. Going in we knew that that was going to be part of the game plan,
too.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, I saw Jay Wright just came into the locker room.
If you wouldn't mind sharing what he had to say and what that means coming in
and talking to you guys.  
KIMBAL MACKENZIE: He just told us to keep our heads up. Part of being a
warrior is losing sometimes and we've got to learn how to lose just as we
learn how to win. We're very fortunate to have him in the locker room, giving
us a couple words. He told us to keep our heads up and keep fighting.  
  
Q. When you have the coach who is the defending National Champ, what
does that mean for him to say those things to you guys?  
ZACH THOMAS: It's an honor. He definitely sees we're a talented ball club.
It's his alma mater. He's proud of us. It means a lot.  
  
Q. Just, you know, you practiced against it, you watched tape of it, you
scouted it. What did you think of the fierceness of their pressure?  
STEPHEN BROWN: I mean, came in and came in with what we expected. It was our
first time facing the press. Once we saw we could get the ball in and get it
up the court, it was nothing new to us. Coach said going into the game, we've
faced press before, but the biggest thing for us was second-chance
opportunities. Once we got the rebound and got it out in transition, it was
easy to beat the press. But out of bounds, under, on the sidelines, it was
tough for us at times. But we were able to fight back, as you saw, and broke
it a lot of times.  
  
Q. And two follow-ups to that. It seemed you really did a good job of
not being tentative, really going after it. Can you talk about how important
that was or what you thought about doing that?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Coach kept telling us after beating the press, we're going to
keep attacking. Kimbal hitting threes in the corner and Nana catching it on
the post. Once you broke the press, our goal was get a shot off it, any
opportunity, whether it was a jump shot or something inside. So I think we did
a good job of breaking the press and looking for the open guy and just taking
what was given to us.  
  
Q. How unusual, when you get it out of the back court, they got Adrian
at the pad up there, 1-3-1 and then they got two 6'8 " guys on the wings
trying to push you out. It's obviously not something you're going to see too
often. How good do you think that is, and how did you manage it?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. We decided to use what we had to our advantage. I mean,
they're big, long, athletic, but I mean, we have speed. So, I mean, just
looking at the outlets or if we can beat them coming out to just go around and
then beat the press. I mean, other guys did a good job of getting open and
providing outlets for the guys in the back court. Despite their length and
stuff, we just looked for the right reads and just kept attacking it.  
  
Q. When it was 27-12 in the first half, what were you guys saying to
yourselves to frankly just stay in the ball game?  
KIMBAL MACKENZIE: You know, this year, we've been down a couple times. We've
been down big, and we know we're a mentally tough team who is able to fight
back. We have a lot of weapons and we didn't panic. We just, you know, tried
to win every possession, one possession at a time. And we looked up a couple
minutes later, and we were back in the game.  
  
So, we were in that situation before. As I said, we're a pretty mentally tough
group, so we were able to fight back.  
  
Q. For Stephen. The vast majority of you will be back next year. What do
you think might help you guys as a program moving toward?  
ZACH THOMAS: I feel like we know -- if we do get back here next year, we know
what to expect. Everything was new to us, nearly everything. We know what to
expect and we know the caliber of the teams we're going to play, especially
West Virginia today. So, I think we are more well-prepared, and we just have
to, you know, do some of the same things to get us ready.  
  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. I mean it was a great experience for a group such as us.
Just using this as fuel to come back next year and, from beginning to end to
just fight every single game and every single practice. Now that we have a
goal to come back, and get a win in the first round, I think we can use this
and it's much of a confidence boost for all of the guys returning back next
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Great, Stephen, Kimbal, Nana. Thanks for your time.  
  
Q. Nathan, what do you make of the perseverance that your team showed
today out there given the fact that you overcame several double-digit
deficits?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Well, I think that's been the story of our season. We've played
a really challenging nonconference schedule. Our league is always a challenge.
You're in those situations throughout the year, and you don't get to play in
this tournament unless you're a champion, and you can't be a champion without
buying able to persevere through bad times. They're going to happen in every
game, happen in every season, and the team -- the teams that usually handle
the situation the best are the ones that end up being most successful.  
  
I think all year long our guys have done an unbelievable job supporting each
other and picking each other up when they're down, not giving up on things and
fighting through to grow from it. That's a big difference from a year with us.
In a lot of respects, we've really grown in that respect.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously a press gets a lot of note. You handled that fairly
well. Was there offensive rebounding when you went into the game as big of a
concern. Do you think you did what you could against it?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We didn't win, so, we could have done better. Going into the
game, whenever you play them, first off, Coach Huggins is really good. There's
a reason he's a Hall of Fame level guy. They're very disciplined. They play
with purpose. They are extremely tough. They are physical. They don't let you
take possessions off, and that's a credit to him and his staff and the kids,
the way they play.  
  
Going in we knew the first you need to handle with them is you need to be able
to get quality shots. That starts by handling the press. The second part is
offensively, they're going to be significantly bigger than we are. They're
going to be more athletic, and we have to do a better job of keeping them off
the boards.  
  
I thought for the most part with rebounding was, when you're 6'3" or 6'4" and
you're going against a guy who's 6'8", and they run in the lane and jump, that
matters. We weren't going to make enough contact away from the basket to
negate their size some. We were trying. I thought we were fighting, but we
weren't doing as well as we could have. Give them credit for being relentless
at that end and not quitting on plays. In a lot of ways, that was the
difference in the game.  
  
Q. So they average 20.4 turnovers forced a game which led the nation.
And you made 14 or 15. Did you have a number in mind that you said, well,
hopefully we live with this?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We look at every game. I don't typically go by a total number of
turnovers. Just more we look at turnover percentage per possession. I haven't
actually seen the number of possessions we had in the game, but we like to be
around 15 or 16 percent, which is really low. If you're really getting in at
18, 19 percent you're doing a pretty good job.  
  
Our big thing was, look, we are going to turn it over some. Everybody turns it
over some on them. It's as much about us, when we have an opportunity to make
a play being able to make it. Whether it's to get a lay-up, get a good shot.
We didn't want to end up in a situation where we did break it, and then part
of what it is, is it gets you rushed, and all of a sudden you end up throwing
some balls out of bounds when guys are open, fumbling a ball out of bounds,
rushing a lay-up, those type of things. As much as not turning it over, I
think what gave us a chance is our guys did a really good job of taking
advantage when they did break it and not getting to the point where they're
playing too fast and we couldn't finish plays.  
  
Q. Then 27-12, what did you say to your team and what were you thinking
at that point?  
NATHAN DAVIS: They're not watching. What I said was probably a little
different than what I was thinking. I mean, like I said, we've been in that
situation before. You're going to have games where you fall behind. You just
got to keep playing. We're talking about how any game, but especially an NCAA
game, with the length of the time-outs, the intensity and all of that, it's a
long game. And 15 points looks like a lot, but it's really five possessions,
five or six possessions. So if we can put together a string where we're
winning a couple more possessions every time down or every few minutes that
we're losing, next thing you know we're back in the game.  
  
I was thinking I hope we can stop giving them easy baskets and turning it over
and give ourselves a chance. It was early. There was still over ten minutes
left in the first half, there was 30 minutes left to be played. We had a lot
of time left to make it up and again, give our guys credit for having the
mental toughness to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, similar question to what I asked the players. You know you
have the vast majority of this rotation back next year. What do you hope the
guys that were here this year took away from this experience?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think that first thing is you can never take for granted what
you've accomplished. I don't think having everyone back next year means a
whole lot if we don't continue to improve. Now, saying that, I would like to
think what we'll understand, even more so than having not been before, is how
hard it is to get here and the amount of time you've got to put in and the
dedication you got to have to your teammates, yourself, and the rest of the
guys; to be the best you can be and to give everything you have for the team.  
  
You're not going to win a conference championship, you're not going to get a
chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. You're not going to be a good enough
team to advance if you have any other thing on your mind when you're in the
team setting of doing the best you can for everyone else around you. And
understanding that it's really hard, and there's going to be ups and downs.
And as much as you can handle, as well as you deal with the good times, you
have to be able to respond to the bad times. That's one of the great things
about our players and Bucknell kids in general is they mature and learn to
handle those things.  
  
We've got a lot of work cut out for us if we want to get back here and
hopefully do better next year. But I think they'll understand that it's about
understanding how hard it is and embracing it and being able to go after it
again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congrats on a great season.  
  
NATHAN DAVIS: Thank you.

### [Junior Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33010)

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Villanova - 76, Mount St. Mary's - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Mount St. Mary's head coach, Jamion Christian. We'll
open with a statement from Coach Christian.  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: First of all, just congratulations to Villanova. This is a
tremendous program, one of the best programs I think we've played against. I
think when we look back historically at what they've been able to do over the
last two years, I think we'll be able to understand what a good program they
are. They obviously have the opportunity to march on. They outplayed us today.  
  
But I'm really proud of our group, and I use that word "proud" because they
were tremendous in their ability to execute our game plan and just really give
this number one team a big scare there in the first half. We've got a lot of
things we can work on and improve, but we're expecting to learn from this
experience like we've done time and time again and have an opportunity to
improve on it.  
  
Q. Elijah, what were you thinking at halftime?  
ELIJAH LONG: Like Coach said, I was proud of the guys and myself, how we came
out. But Villanova is a great team, so we couldn't let up. It wasn't obviously
the end of the game. So we had to reset and try to do the same thing we did
the first half in the second half, and unfortunately that's not what we did.
But I'm proud of my guys for coming out the first half like that.  
  
Q. Miles, I know the result wasn't what you wanted but you went over to
the fan section and saluted each other. What did that mean?  
MILES WILSON: The fan base has been really strong for us, and for them to come
out to Buffalo and show support is amazing. We were 1-11 at the beginning of
the season, and nobody believed in us. Our fans and our family and our
community were so supportive. They stayed with us the whole time. That was
big.  
  
Q. Junior, you guys haven't backed down from anyone all season. Was that
the attitude that you brought on to the court tonight that you weren't going
to back down or flinch especially after you played two nights ago?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Yeah. I mean, I feel like we shouldn't have to back down from
anyone, after putting on a jersey, they play the game the same way we do.
There's no in backing down. Just come out and play hard and try to attack them
any way we can.  
  
Q. Elijah, you mentioned what the mood was at halftime. When it was up
10-2, what were you guys thinking?  
ELIJAH LONG: You're talking about the beginning of the game? Honestly, we
thought they were going to try to come in and punch us in the face right away.
That obviously wasn't the case. We had how many stops?  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Ten stops.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: Ten stops in a row. That was a great momentum swing for us when
we were up 10-2. I honestly didn't look at the clock until two minutes -- a
minute toward halftime. I didn't look at the clock. I didn't know what the
score was. I just knew we were playing good.  
  
Other than that, I was very proud. I was excited, you know, that this might be
a good game, we could get this win but unfortunately we didn't.  
  
Q. For Elijah as well. Do you guys feel like you almost squandered an
opportunity in some ways, too. They were really cold in the first half and
your shooting wasn't as good as it was on other nights. Do you feel you could
have built an even bigger lead at points?  
ELIJAH LONG: Oh, definitely. I feel like first half, we were doing well,
swinging the ball, getting easy buckets. But I think second half, I don't
think we were settling because we wanted to shoot a lot of threes, but I just
think the ball wasn't falling for us. I think half the shots went in for us
three. And the other players on the team, like Greg, Alexander, if half the
shots went in, it would have been a close game. The result might have been
different. It might have not, but it would have been a close game for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Not seeing any, gentlemen,
congratulations. Follow up questions now for Coach Christian.  
  
Q. Jamion, what do you think tonight's performance says about your
program?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I think everyone got a glimpse of how good we can be. That
was really a really well-played first half. It was at the tempo we wanted. I
thought we really dominated the pace of the game in that first half. It was
exactly where we wanted it to be, and so I think it shows that when you have a
program, no matter your seed, and you have guys committed to a plan and a high
level of enthusiasm to execute that plan, that anything is possible.  
  
So I think in one regard it shows how good we can be. On the other regard it
shows how much work we have to do to continue to get better and move our
program forward.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half, you had a moment to yourself before you
jogged off to the locker room. You kind of gave a chagrinned look. You looked
up at the scoreboard. Could you tell me what was going through your head at
that point? I kind of know.  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I felt like we should have been winning the game. I felt
like we really played a good half. I felt we were just right there. In one
way, I was really so inspired by our group's defensive effort, but I felt like
we really squandered an opportunity to finish that half and go into the half
up one, which would have been huge for us, momentum-wise. We talked about
getting a stop in the time-out. They got to the front of the rim and shot the
ball at the block. That was my thinking.  
  
Typically I'm a real positive person. I looked up at it and I though I wonder
how many 16 seeds have taken a one to being down one in a half. We're in
pretty elite company right here. Let me settle my troops in the locker room
and make sure we come out with some fire.  
  
Q. How did the schedule you played earlier in the season prepare your
team for this game, and did that factor into how competitive you were at the
start of the game?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: No question. I thought the schedule prepared us for
everything that was going to happen here. One thing we're trying to do as a
program is we're trying to learn from the mistakes we made before. Being able
to look at our team and to say you've played six NCAA Tournament teams. We've
play three or four teams that won their conference tournament that are elite
teams in this country definitely gave us a big benefit, and to also look at
them and say what do we need to do better in those games?  
  
That's was a tough stretch of games playing there, and the guys would say we
have to get back to transition defense. We have to have a focus on that. We've
got to rebound the ball. It's always more powerful when it comes from them
than when it comes from me. Trying to create a program where they have that
ownership is extremely important. And so that schedule allowed us to have
extreme ownership in a lot of different areas. I thought it definitely helped
us compete out there today against one of the best.  
  
Q. Not many teams over the last few years have been able to frustrate
Villanova like you guys did in that opening stretch. What specifically do you
think you were doing so well at that point, and what's going through your mind
when you're watching Josh Hart air ball floater?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Yeah. One of the things watching on film, when they get out
and play in transition, they all get going and I think you saw that in the
second half. We wanted to honestly come out there and control the tempo. One
thing when see on film, if you make shots against Villanova, they're going to
walk the ball up the floor. They're going to take shots under ten, and that's
going to give you the opportunity to set your defense and get stops.  
  
Some people might say Villanova didn't play their best in the first half. On
the contrary, I thought we controlled the tempo and played very well. And
there's another team on the other side of that that dominated that pace and
that tempo, made them have to take one shot and get out.  
  
Q. Jamion, are you aware Jay Wright said you out-coached him and the
team that played better tonight might not have been the winning team?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: That's very flattering. Jay Wright is one of those guys I
look up to. If you're a young guy coaching, you have a lot of admiration for
those who have done the job and done it well for a long time, especially when
you dress as well as Jay does.  
  
I don't know if I out-coached him tonight. I know his team outplayed our team.
I look at it as we're all a team, we're all a family. I didn't find enough
ways to give our guys the advantage. He certainly did that. He made a ton of
adjustments playing small some, playing big some. A lot of credit to him.  
  
I'm going to take from this game a lot of things I need to get better at, so
when we have an opportunity to get back here that we have more tricks up our
sleeve to make sure we move on to the next round.  
  
Q. You know, a 16 seed has never beaten a No. 1 seed. Mount St. Mary's
has been a 16 seed, I think four times. Do you think that will ever happen or
what will it take for a 16 seed to come in and win this game?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: What's crazy about me, I wanted the 16 seed. I really wanted
that. My team will tell you that. I think when you sign up to come to a good
program, you sign up to do something that's never been done before, and you
sign up to do it with the best of your ability and a ton of enthusiasm. I was
enthusiastic about it. I know where we are in Mount St. Mary's and NEC.
There's a great possibility we'll be a 15 or 16. I think it takes an
enthusiastic bunch, we have that. It takes a team that's going to make outside
shots. We have that. A team that's going to have some ball handling at the
four, five spot. We have that.  
  
And most importantly, it's going to take a team that has a defensive mindset
that can do that for a full 40 minutes. It's going to happen. The distance
between 1 and 16, as you saw tonight is closing down. They may have had bigger
bodies than us, they may have made some shots over top of us. But the heart of
athletes and the heart of teams is getting better and better. The gap is
really closing.  
  
It didn't happen here tonight. It might not happen here in this tournament,
but I'd like to think we're starting a trend with what we did there in the
first half.  
  
Q. I saw you share an embrace with Josh Hart. What was that moment like
what did you say to each other?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I love Josh, Josh and Kris. I love those guys. I would be
lying to you if I didn't say last year I was rooting for them and through the
tournament. I just love those guys. I told Josh I'm so proud of the man he's
become. I get a chance now -- I've known Josh since he was about 15 years old.
I remember the first day at Sidwell Friends High School. Now I get a chance to
see him do his interviews and see people react to him. I'm so proud of the
person he's become because I know his story.  
  
I'm disappointed that we lost today, but I just love those guys so much, that
I'm rooting for them. They don't have a bigger fan. Josh knows that, he knows
if he ever needs anything in this life, he always has my phone number, he can
always call me. I'm really proud of him and the person he's become. I think
that's what college athletics is about. It's about helping them grow up and
become all that they can become. Jay Wright has done a great job with that
with Josh.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Bonzie Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28617)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 60, Princeton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from Coach Brey.  
  
MIKE BREY: First game in the tournament. Got everybody ready, gave everybody a
show. We know what we're supposed to do. I'm thrilled about our defense to
keep them under 40% and really guard the arc. I think they're 8 for 31. That's
how we were going to escape and we did escape. They're really good, but we've
been in a lot of games like that, where game situations, having to make a big
defensive stop, having to get a bucket, get it to the right guy, getting a
ball in bounds to win a game. We've been there, really proud that we're still
alive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for Bonzie and Matt.  
  
Q. For Bonzie and Matt, you guys typically are, you know, a prolific
three-point shooting team. Today it looked like you guys were really working
to the inside, getting to the lane. Is that something you were specifically
planning on coming into the game, or is that something that was happening as
the game was developing?  
BONZIE COLSON: I would say it happened as the game developed. We tried to
attack them with the three in the post. That's the way we play, we can post
up, we can play five all cutters and ball screen roll. We saw some mismatches
and tried to attack the best we can.  
  
MATT FARRELL: I think we made adjustments in the second half trying to get
Bonzie down there. That really helped us getting him in the lane and getting
deep position. He's really tough to guard down there. It's just about making
adjustments. I don't know if we shot the ball very well, but, like I said,
it's about making adjustments and we did what we had to do to get out of there
with a win.  
  
Q. For both players, can you just describe the emotions of that last
minute or so?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I mean, it was something we've been through. We've been
through a lot of those game situations. We've worked on it since summertime.
So we walked in, and we knew what we had to do. They had big shots, but we
stayed composed. We stayed locked in on defense and then on the offense end,
we was still in our movement. They're a good team, they have a lot of good
movement, but we talked and we communicated. I think that was something that
got us the win.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, I think we're a very confident group when it comes down to
game situations. We've been a lot in the past, especially in the conference
that we play in. We got a lot of guys that are poised. Like I said, we're
confident in game situations.  
  
Q. Obviously, a game like this, first round, there's fans from all four
teams there. Notre Dame well-represented. At the same time, especially second
half, Princeton going on a run, did you feel at all the crowd was against you,
that maybe some of the neutral fans would be thinking hey, it's fun to see the
little guys win.  
BONZIE COLSON: I'm sure you see that with all teams. Princeton was a great
team. They guarded us well. They played on the offensive end, but we just
stayed with what we do. It was a good game. No matter how we looked, we got
the win. That's all that matters.  
  
MATT FARRELL: We've played in some tough environments before. Try not to pay
attention to that. We knew they were going to go on a run. Talented offensive
team. So we just had to stick with it. Once they went on that run, we made a
couple adjustments, but we try to stay focused on the game and try to stay
focused on what we do.  
  
Q. Could we talk perimeter defense? They're one of the most efficient,
effective perimeter teams in the country. Just what was your focus and what
went so well?  
MATT FARRELL: Just running them off the three-point line. We didn't want to
get them going from behind the arc and we did a good enough job to do that.
They're lethal from behind there. We had to do that and we had to rebound. We
thought we had an advantage on that end, so we did both of those things.  
  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. I think their movement on the offensive end is really
different than what we've seen, a lot of back doors. They have a lot of three-
point shooters, so we wanted to run them off the three, create gaps and I
think that really helped us get some stops and rebounds as well.  
  
Q. Matt, last year you were in the starting lineup for the first time.
Now a year later, had a tremendous junior season. How much different does it
feel being up there right now?  
MATT FARRELL: I think it's the same. Having fun, having fun with the guys I've
been with. It's the same. March is crazy. We just saw that, but I think it's
the same confidence. It's the same mindset. I think it's a lot of fun to be
here, especially with the guys around me, so, kind of the same mindset, just
do whatever it takes to get the W.  
  
Q. This has already been asked. Bonzie, the ankle, how it felt today and
if it hindered you in any way?  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah. My ankle's good. I'm ready to play again. It's fine. I'm
going to ice it up. I'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Bonzie, Matt, congratulations. Thanks for your time. See you
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Same for you, Coach. Perimeter defense, they had some open looks but
not that many?  
MIKE BREY: You know, to force them into 8 for 31 is a heck of a job by us. And
it's probably why we won the game. We even blocked a couple. We got out. I
thought our sense of urgency, switching stuff, getting out on shooters, was a
key. And, again, I'm really thrilled, because this team is a good -- this
group's a good defensive group. And we had to win it playing defense. Because
we weren't in a great flow offensively. Some guys didn't shoot it as well as
they'd liked, but we continued to guard. That's where we're pretty mature. We
understand if our -- maybe different than some of my other teams. When we're
not scoring it doesn't affect us on the defensive end.  
  
Q. With Bonzie, he clearly doesn't want anybody to think he's injured,
but is he 100 percent, and also, what does it mean in a match-up of similar
teams perimeter games to have a guy like him with his inside ability?  
MIKE BREY: He's certainly the difference. We were able to post him more. We
really don't post him as much against ACC teams. He's outdribbling,
exchanging, and shooting 15-footers and then sneaks into the post off a ball
screen roll. But we were just throwing that darn thing in there. Looked like
the Harongody days. Just chuck it in there and see what happens.  
  
He's sore, he's a warrior, he played through some soreness. The great thing
about the NCAA Tournament, you've got a day in between to really get that
thing right again. And this time of year, you're playing on adrenaline
anyways.  
  
Q. You have a player that creates a foul but still gets dinged in the
head, gets six stitches I've heard?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Talk about the resilience there and the fact of physicality and
injury and all of that?  
MIKE BREY: I'm a big karma guy. Bonz is banged up a little bit. We used a lot
of energy in Brooklyn and Pflueger gets dinged and is bleeding. I thought,
God, I don't know about today. Is today going to be a weird day?  
  
He's a tough kid. We glued him up. We would have stitched any other of our
guys, but since he's from L.A., and he's into Hollywood, we didn't want to
mess his face up, so we glued his head up because he could be a movie star
someday. But he's been tough as nails, and to come back -- I actually said to
my staff, he was back in, and I said Is he right? Is he giving us anything?
And he hit the baseline jump shot and I turned around an said I guess he's
okay. He really defends. That attention to detail, chasing shooters off the
arc, he's fabulous about that.  
  
Q. Mike, last year you started him this year at this point in the
tournament. Now a year later, how much have you seen his confidence grow?  
MIKE BREY: He's at the controls of this program. He's been that way since the
summer. What helped him get confident early in the season, was that we did
start him in the NCAA Tournament. So when we went to Brooklyn and won the
Legends Classic, that was a great coming-out party, but he felt good, and that
made us all believe and believe in him.  
  
Q. You guys have been pulling NCAA Tournament wins kind of out of the
fire for the past three seasons now, and you've had a ton of close games this
season as well. What about your guys, when they're clicking, kind of makes
them able to survive those late runs or is there an X factor?  
MIKE BREY: We've had an unbelievable run in close games. I think we're 18-3 in
our last 21 overtime games. That shouldn't happen. The law of averages. But
we've been in so many of them, we really believe, and I think in this
tournament, this nucleus of guys, just feel like as this thing was getting
close, well, that's what we did all last year. We just stole wins to get to
the Elite Eight.  
  
And it's very similar to two years ago, the Northeastern game, you know? A
tough one, you escape, and maybe can get on a run. Our guys have really
believe that, because they've experienced it, which is huge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach, congratulations. See you tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
Wisconsin - 84, Virginia Tech - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Virginia Tech head coach, Buzz Williams, as well as
Seth Allen, Zach LeDay. We'll open right up with questions for our student-
athletes. At this time, please raise a hand we'll get a microphone you to.  
  
Q. Seth, they made 13 threes and their point guard obviously had eight
of them. Was that just them being very hot or was there anything defensively
that you think you guys could have done better defending the three?  
SETH ALLEN: I think we talked about their three-point shooting, especially
Bronson. A lot of it came off of offensive rebounds, some off of us trying to
dig in the post. They did get hot. I think he hit like three or four in a row
at one point. But we just had to do a better job running them off the line.
But we were really focusing on trying to pack it in and trying to play tighter
defensively.  
  
Q. Zach, you guys were able to cut your deficit to one point on five
different occasions in the second half, but never able to tie it or take the
lead when you had a chance. Just how frustrating was it that you were able to
battle almost all of the way back but never quite get there to even the game
up?  
ZACH LEDAY: I just know I had a couple opportunities. That's just my fault.
I've got to be better as a leader and make them shots. You really don't think
about that, you're thinking about getting stops and playing as hard as you
can. We weren't really thinking about the score. I know I wasn't looking at
the score for a second. I was just out there playing as hard as I could for my
teammates.  
  
Q. Seth, in the first half we saw you limping. Seemed like something was
going on with the foot or anything. What was your physical condition
tonight?  
SETH ALLEN: I kind of got beat up a little bit, but I was fine in the second
half.  
  
Q. Seth, you guys were 7 of 17 from three. Was their three-point defense
tough? Did they give you hard looks, tough looks?  
SETH ALLEN: I don't know. I'd say that they got some really -- they're a
really good defensive team. Some of the looks, we didn't touch the paint. We
executed out of bounds under pretty well. The threes we did get were all from
paint touches. A lot of those were -- we shot a lot of threes late. I remember
I shot two in the second half that was late. But 7 for 17 -- what percent is
that? 41? So, that's okay.  
  
Q. Obviously, it's tough after a loss, but is there any room for both of
you guys for pride right now, whether in each other or in the rest of your
teammates or in Buzz?  
ZACH LEDAY: We went out there, we fought as hard as we could. I guess at the
end of the day, they made more winning plays than us, but we're going to have
pride no matter what. We went out there and played as hard as we could and we
gave it our all. We just came up short.  
  
Q. Seth, why did you want to come over and give Zach a hug when he fell
down?  
SETH ALLEN: Because Zach's like my brother. We came in together and this is
the last game we play together in college, so I just wanted to tell him I love
him and that's it.  
  
Q. For each of you, you helped turn this program around in the three
years in Blacksburg. How will you remember your time in Blacksburg overall and
this special season? How will you remember it?  
ZACH LEDAY: This year, specifically, I was just really focused. I wasn't
really focused on my time. To be honest, I wasn't thinking about my time in
Blacksburg or anything. I was just thinking about basketball. Every day, all
day, how I can get better. How I can get better with my team and help us win.
At the end of the day, we fought as hard as we could. I literally dedicated my
whole life to this program this season this past year. I don't have any
regrets. I wish we could have won. I'm really mad that we didn't win. But at
the end of day, these are my brothers for life, and Coach Buzz is like a
father to me. I'm thankful I was able to come here and glad we got to this
point.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Same here. I enjoyed my time here. Like Zach said, this season we
made a deal with each other. We didn't get on any social media. We just stayed
in our house. We just went to the gym and shot, and we tried to be the best
leaders we could and follow Coach Buzz because he's one of the best leaders
we've ever seen or the best leader. And we were just trying to fight every
night. It's hard to change a program around. You have to be an everyday
digging person. You can't take any days off even when you're beat up.  
  
That was always our mentality. We knew that it wasn't going to be easy, and we
just wanted to just follow Coach Buzz and coaching staff's lead and just try
to play and work as hard as we could when the cameras weren't up on our face.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seth, Zach, congratulations on the season.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Thank you, guys. Thanks, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Williams at this time.  
  
Q. Buzz, with as little depth as you had, and you knew Seth was hurting,
Justin Bibbs said that he saw, at least during halftime, at points during the
second half where he was grimacing. Did you have a discussion at any point
during the half, I need you right now, there's nobody else I can rely on right
thousand?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No. We didn't discuss it. He knew, our team knew. He has really
bad turf toe. Our team doctor was here. Obviously he played less minutes than
normal. But that's part of it. We've obviously endured a short roster all year
long, and an even shorter roster since Chris's injury. Hate that it happened
to Seth in what ended up being his last game, not just for Seth but the
importance that Seth brings to the other six guys that he plays with. But
that's not why we lost. But it was a part of the story for sure.  
  
Q. Buzz, did they do certain things keeping you from having one of those
10, 12 three-point games that you have?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No, I mean this appropriately. I think with what has transpired
over the last nine games with each passing game, the scouting report has
skewed towards that. If you're shooting -- we were shooting 51% as a team from
the field over the last nine games. 47%, I think, from three. So, I think
teams are focused on -- we're playing for the most part multiple guys on the
floor that can shoot it from three. So, they're a great defensive team, and I
would say that that was a part of their plan going into the game.  
  
Q. Buzz, last year, Seth and Zach both said that the N.I.T. tournament
was a jumping-off point for you guys for wanting to have a good start. How do
you view this game and experience in getting back here for the first time in a
decade as a jumping off not just this year but for years to come?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: The thing I mentioned, obviously it's emotional any time you
come to the end. Our last game, postgame locker room, this is my tenth year as
a head coach. It's always been the same, and the one thing that I said
different tonight than I said last year, to answer your question, is, as
emotional as you are, it's important that you go back to the hotel, and write
down all of the things that you learned. Good things, bad things, basketball-
specific things, person things, student things. Because in order to use this
as an opportunity for growth, you can't wait until after the Final Four.
Because that's what typical kids do.  
  
And I think what we've asked of our staff and asked of a very young roster,
and in some ways a very depleted roster for various reasons, we've asked them
to be men in so many respects, and so I think this, all of this, all that
comes with this, is an opportunity to learn. And I think the best way to learn
is to flush it all out of your heart and your soul and your brain and make
sure that you have something that you can go back to. And just because of my
relationship with those guys, and I don't say that in an arrogant way, I think
they'll heed that advice, because I think it's important. I'll do it. I've
always done it. There's a lot to learn from all of this and you have to
dissect it in the right way.  
  
Q. Buzz, you got a lot of pieces coming back next year. How much will
you and this program and this team miss those two seniors that just left?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I don't -- you probably know this. I'm in the bottom percentile
in saying hello. And whatever percentile you think I am in that regard, I'm
worse in saying good-bye. I don't say hello to my wife when she calls me; I
don't say good-bye to my wife. That's the way I've always been and that's why
I'm perceived, sometimes, I think in the wrong way. Man, I'll miss those kids.  
  
Figuratively, those guys have carried a lot of water since they've been here,
and for whatever reason, they have never resisted anything that I've asked of
them. And not because they're good players, they're really, really good kids.
And what they've been able to help us establish in a very, very short tenure,
way faster than I believe we've been given credit for, I owe them for life,
and my children owe them, and our staff owes them, and those other kids on our
team owe them, and we're so thankful.  
  
Q. I know you're not real big on negative thinking, but even for a
second, do you allow yourself to think about, what if I had Chris, what if I
had Kerry, what if I had even Johnny. These guys that can give you more
minutes and especially bigs?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, no. I think the reason why is the pace of this is just so
fast, you know? And when you excel and give yourself time to go, well, if we
did this and if we had that, this could have happened, for whatever reason, my
whole career, there's some lemons, let's make lemonade. An you know why Zach
and Seth are so good? It's because they didn't have any other choice.  
  
And if you look at our staff, really and truly, the only guy whose resume
looks like they belong is our trainer. You know, he's got all of those
initials after his name. We send him all over the country to all of those
conferences. But I think one of the things that I admire so much about our
guys, they never paused either. Overtime game against UVA, you were there, the
next morning Chris gets the MRI. That afternoon, the doctor comes to the
office and we Face-Time his parents, but then we have to leave immediately
after that to travel to Pitt, and part of it is because of the pace of
everything.  
  
But part of it is as a leader, I'm inspired that the fabric of how we go about
things is, what's next? And that's a quote-shirt, but they believe it, and I
believe it, too. And I think that they've been such an example of that. You
know, the thing that I'm disappointed, Chris was Player of the Year in
Virginia. He was a part of our first four recruiting class. I hate it for him
that he didn't get to experience this in uniform, you know? I made the
decision on K., Kerry, and called his dad, after the win at Michigan, and I
said, in my heart, I don't think I would play my son, but I want to be honest
with you, if I played your son, we would win two more games, and those two
games could decide which tournament we play in. And he goes, Buzz, you need to
play him. And I go, I know. As a coach, I need to play him, but in my heart, I
can't.  
  
And Pig -- Tyrie -- he's really good, and the things that he's been through in
the last seven months, I've never seen in my 23 years as a college coach,
ever. And what Tom Gabbard has done for Pig, I've never seen an administrator
fight for. And Devin Wilson, he says to me, after the spring football game,
Coach, what do you think I ought to do? I said, well, the only way I can
answer that is, I think if I could tell my children that I played college
football and college basketball at the highest level possible, I think I'd do
that. Toughest guy on the roster. Best defender on the roster.  
  
And I knew when he said I'm playing football, I knew that meant he wouldn't
play basketball this year. And I think that you have to make decisions
individually, but those decisions have to be sustainable collectively. And I
think, like Berman said, of all of the guys that are returning, on paper, it
will be the highest number of the years of experience at Virginia Tech. This
group had seven years of experience at Virginia Tech, and we played 33 games
with the last one being here. It's pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Coach.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Just indulge me for a minute. Because we have some new media
members here for the afternoon session, reminder to please silence your cell
phones. When you have a question, please raise your hand. Give your name and
your affiliation, we'll get a microphone to you. Please wait until we get a
microphone there. You are allowed one follow-up question as well. That being
said, welcome to Buffalo and welcome Villanova student-athletes, Josh Hart,
Kris Jenkins, and Darryl Reynolds from my right to left. Welcome back to
Buffalo.  
  
Q. Josh, a year ago this time, you were sitting up there and nobody
thought you were getting out of this weekend. Now everybody thinks you're
going to be repeat champions. So, which is tougher?  
JOSH HART: I think the -- that's a tough one. There was a big monkey on our
back with the first weekend thing. It was kind of weird this year not having
to answer that question that I answered the last three years. But, you know,
it is what it is. Both of them are challenging. We just know we've got to be
focused and ready to play come tomorrow.  
  
Q. I guess maybe then you don't know the answer to this, but if you are
lucky enough to continue to go forward, do you think the second part of this
will become more difficult, the repeat thing?  
JOSH HART: I think the hype will be a little bit more. You know, if we're
lucky enough to advance far into the tournament, so the hype will be a little
bit more. So that will be something -- surrounding us will be a distraction,
and we just got to focus on each other and really fall into that distraction.
We just got to focus on playing basketball for 40 minutes. If we do that,
we'll take the outcome.  
  
Q. For Kris and Josh. Last year, did you enjoy the moment coming in and
this year now being seniors, and coming off what you came off last year. Are
you enjoying and embracing the moment more than you did last year?  
JOSH HART: I think it was harder last year to embrace it, just with, you know,
like I said, just -- not the pressure, but just everything that came around
with the first-round exit or the first weekend exit, the last couple of years,
so that was kind of hard to embrace. Because we knew, no matter how we played,
that first game, we knew we were going to have to -- if we won that one, we
knew we were going to have to answer that question, and we knew that was going
to be the big story and everything, the next couple of days.  
  
So and now, it's hard to do it now because we have questions about repeating.
So, you know, you can't really embrace it too much. Obviously, it's a blessing
being able to be here, this isn't a privilege. But that's why we got to just
rely on each other and focus on each other, and don't focus on anything else.
We have to embrace the time we have together at the end. That's really the
only thing we can really embrace.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Just like Josh said, just take it one day at a time, one game at
a time. We really enjoy being around each other, and we're looking forward to
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Josh and Kris, you got -- the last time you guys were in this
building was your freshman year against UConn with a shot to go to the Garden.
How much is that game and what happened that year, is it still a little bit of
a motivation when you get to this time of the year?  
JOSH HART: Yeah, we -- I remember that one vividly. Shabazz, that UConn team,
they were tough and talented, but we try not to think about that too much now.
Obviously, you know, we knew we were playing Buffalo. That was the first
thing. When we heard Buffalo, we were like, we went there freshman year. We
had a tough game against UConn there.  
  
But now, we don't really think about it. I think the only time we thought
about it was the first time we heard we were probably going to be going to
Buffalo. And it was like, oh, Buffalo.  
  
Q. Kris or Josh or both, how much do you think that the perception of
your team and your coach has changed? I mean, you win a National Championship,
and it's no longer this team can't win, same with your coach. Can you take me
through that a little bit, that now this guy, he was a good coach before but
somehow one win makes him better.  
JOSH HART: I got to answer every one? There's one -- the blessing about Coach
and this program is nothing ever really changes. I think that's the biggest
thing. No matter if you're coming off a National Championship year or we were
coming off for that 13-19 year. Nothing in this program ever changes. The core
values are still the same. The commitment to our core values is still the
same, so I think the only thing that might have changed is, you know, his
drilling in those core values a little bit more.  
  
Last year was amazing just in terms of everyone buying in, and we saw what can
happen if we buy into Villanova basketball. That's something that Coach told
us after it happened, you guys thought I was crazy about our core values now,
but that's the one thing about us. Nothing ever changes. We didn't -- never
talked about repeating this whole year. It was just about committing ourselves
to Villanova basketball, buying in and being the best team we can be at the
end of the year.  
  
Q. Kris, is there any downside at all in making one of the most iconic
shots in the history of college basketball?  
KRIS JENKINS: Is there any downside? Yeah. After I made the shot, there was a
lot of downside, you know, just focus on what else we have to do.  
  
Q. Is there any one amusing thing that's happened to you, though, just
because of the shot, people coming up to you or anything like that?  
KRIS JENKINS: Nah.  
  
JOSH HART: They come up to him everywhere.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: That's it.  
  
Q. Josh, how do you avoid complacency, or being satisfied when you've
won it all?  
JOSH HART: It starts with our coach, and it starts with us three and then
trickles on down. Coach is continuing to get on us, especially us three
seniors, and we got, at max, I think six games left, you know, possibly in our
career. And Coach isn't like, okay, let them go. We've had some successful
years. Let them just kind of do what we do. He's getting on us and he's
continuing to coach us, even at the end of our career. So we're doing that,
we're being coachable, and we're listening to everything he says. And it goes
from us and it trickles on down.  
  
When those younger guys see the seniors in their last go-around, their last
couple weeks left of their college career, still allowing themselves to be
coached, that forces them to do it. They're great guys and they're going to
follow our lead, but we know it starts with us three.  
  
Q. I know you guys don't talk about repeat, but, I mean, you have to
think about it at some level. Do you allow yourself to even process -- you get
that in your head? Because you know what you're going for.  
DARRYL REYNOLDS: Obviously, we would like to repeat. I think every team in
this tournament wants to win the tournament. There isn't a team that wouldn't
want to win. Just like before, like we dealt with it in years past, you can't
look too far behind or too far forward, because you end up tripping on what
you're doing right now.  
  
Coach is trying to drive that home, just focusing on the present, focusing on
the next game. We can think about repeating and completely overlook the next
game, and you lose, and you don't even have a chance to make it to that point
to be able to repeat. So it's just something we've been doing the last couple
years just making sure we're focused on the next game, focused on what we can
control at the moment.  
  
Q. Kris, how many times have you relived that shot in your mind and
thought about it, and for you personally, was it tough to maybe find
motivation again this season, given that -- I mean, that's like the ultimate
dream for any player and you've already lived it.  
KRIS JENKINS: I don't even think about it or talk about it when I'm asked
about it. It wasn't hard for me, because I still have a lot that I want to
accomplish. I'm a part of this great team with these great guys and the guys
in the locker room. So when you have guys around you like that, it's easy to
refocus.  
  
Q. How much, for any of you guys, how much do you know about Mount St.
Mary's and the history of the 1-16 match-up?  
DARRYL REYNOLDS: Our freshman year, I think we played Mount St. Mary's at the
beginning of the year, so we got to see a little bit of their program at that
point.  
  
We watched the game yesterday. They are a talented team. I think every team at
this point is a talented, tough team, especially the team that won their
conference tournaments, stuff like that.  
  
They're a good team. They're a good team like every team in this tournament.
They play fast, they seem to play hard. They're disciplined in their coaching.
Obviously we know about the 1-16 match-up, the hype that's built around that.
We understood that coming into this. It's part of this tournament. It's just
one of those questions you're going to have to answer with this tournament.
It's nothing to be upset about, anything like that. You understand what it is
and you move forward. Sorry if I wasn't talking loud enough, I just realized I
could have leaned a little bit forward. I see him in the back, I'm sitting
here whispering, I'm sorry about that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You're coachable. Good work. Other questions for our Villanova
student-athletes?  
  
Q. For Josh, you mentioned having a memory of coming to Buffalo. You
guys have been here now since Monday. Do you guys sort of feel like -- and
you've gone through a Buffalo snowstorm. Do you feel like an honorary
Buffalonian at this point?  
JOSH HART: A little bit. I thought I'd get to see the sun. I hope that's not
what it's like up here all 365 days. I mean, I like the warm weather, so I
don't want to say go back home, because I think it's snowing in Philly, too.
We just got to tough it through the last couple weeks and put up with the
weather. So I guess you could say we feel like, Buffalonians, I think is what
you said.  
  
Q. You feel like Buffalonians, what have you been doing in your free
time. Obviously you have practice coming up and you've been watching the game
last night. Anything fun? Have you guys had any time to enjoy it?  
JOSH HART: Not really. We just relaxed. We all watched a movie. Was that
Monday night? Monday night, I think we got here. We watched a movie together.
That was really about it. I wish I could tell you we had, like, this epic
snowball fight and it was amazing. But no, not really. We've just been in our
rooms, just relaxing, taking our mind off the tournament, and just enjoying
each other's company.  
  
Q. All right. Not seeing any more questions, gentlemen, thanks for your
time. Good luck tomorrow.  
JOSH HART: Thank you.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Villanova head coach Jay Wright. Coach, welcome back
to Buffalo.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: This is a regular stop for you. I think once at Hofstra and
another time here.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: 2010. It is great to be back in Buffalo. I love western New York,
and I think our team is excited about this upcoming game. It's pretty cool to
watch a game together last night and watch our opponent in Mount St. Mary's,
who is a tough team. Great guards. And very tough kids on their team, so
should be a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: With that we'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Jay, Josh came in before and said that it's been tough to embrace and
enjoy an NCAA Tournament when you guys never got by the first weekend, and now
talking about repeat or whatever. Again, it's hard to do that. What would you
tell your players about enjoying the moment, especially your senior class who,
this is their last go-around?  
JAY WRIGHT: He said it's hard to enjoy it because of that?  
  
Q. Enjoy it and embrace it?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I think what he means is in terms of enjoying all the lead-
up and all of the hype, all that stuff, the open practices, and this media.
Because I think they want to enjoy the end results, that's what they want to
enjoy, and I think they understand that. I think they understand there's a
commitment that you have to have during this time as you're preparing and
playing games. And you can get to enjoy it on the weekend, if you get past the
second game, and then you start it all over again.  
  
Q. Jay, is this a little bit weird for you at all, when you come back
here knowing -- there's the Rochester angle. There's the Bucknell side. You
have been here before. You know this area, recruited here. I grew up with Rick
Wnuk, by the way, who you recruited. What's it like for you when you come back
here?  
JAY WRIGHT: A lot of -- we just had the meeting, the coaches' meeting and Mike
Brey is in there and Buzz Williams and Huggins. We've all -- it seems like
Hugs and Mike Brey and us have been in the shape spot, you know, for the last
three years. I don't know how that works. But coming back to western New York
is always cool. I have great memories about starting at University of
Rochester and recruiting a lot in the Buffalo area. Not got getting Wnuk, not
getting the Torgalskis. The only guys I didn't get from this area. Trying to
recruit Christian Laettner as a freshman not knowing he was going to be that
good.  
  
But I do like coming up here and Bucknell being here is really cool, too.
We're really proud of Nathan and those guys, so, yeah, a lot of connections
here, and we're enjoying it. Also the Anchor Bar and Duff's, we like that,
too.  
  
Q. Last year, one of the lines you used in Brooklyn a lot was that you
knew -- your team knew that you would be judged by whatever happened in the
NCAA Tournament, fairly or not. Do you still feel that way with this group
because you've kind of climbed that mountaintop or does it change at all?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's something that we discussed as a team. I just think in
general, you're defined by what you did in the NCAA Tournament as a college
player. If you're a team that's getting there every year, the team and you as
a player get defined that way, nationally, with fans, and that's okay. But we
don't define our guys that way within our program, and they don't -- I don't
think they define themselves that way, and we want to make sure of that.  
  
But it is the reality, you know? There could be a guy that, you know, doesn't
have a great career, but if he does something in the NCAA Tournament,
everybody remembers him forever and that's cool, too.  
  
Q. So, this time last year, Jay, you're sitting up there, nobody thought
you could get out of the first weekend. Now everybody wonders if you can
repeat. Is one more difficult than the other and the pressure you faced last
year is that at all applicable to the pressure you might face going forward?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't know if one is harder than the other, Dana, but they are
different. They are definitely different. There's, I would say, the same level
of pressure, but it's a different kind of pressure. In terms of being
applicable, it definitely is. I think -- you know, pressure is pressure, so
you want to embrace it and try to make -- allow it to make you better, and we
had a different kind of pressure last year. It was like that second-round
pressure was crazy.  
  
And this year, it is about repeating. You're a one seed, and so you're
supposed to win it if you're the one seed, right? It's all about how you
handle that, and I think having that pressure last year and having pressure
this year, I think makes it a little bit easier to handle.  
  
Q. On a lighter note, Coach Huggins earlier said that he used to be the
best-dressed coach, better than you. And obviously, he went a different way. I
guess on the flipside, I was going to ask you if you'd ever consider going
without a tie. We have another tieless coach here in Mike Brey. I was
wondering how important the tie is to the coaching and to the image?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, the reason that I dress that way, it's just been the
tradition, you know, in coaching, you wear a suit and tie. But Hugs is -- I
would like to do an article on the lines Hugs give me before the game when you
shake hands about your attire, his attire, your look, his look. It's great. It
could fill an article. He's got great lines. And Mike -- I remember Mike used
to go with the crew neck, he was the trend-setter on that. I think he and I
had a discussion one summer, I said, you've got to go with the open collar.
That's the next look. I don't know if he did it because of that, but I know we
had a discussion about that, it's important.  
  
I like -- I don't know. I like Hugs' look. When you wear a nice suit and
you're in the huddle and they're sweating on your suit. The guys are dripping
on top of you. I'm thinking why am I wearing this nice suit? But it's
tradition. We'll see, we'll see.  
  
Q. Jay, did you have to worry about this group being complacent or
satisfied, kind of the idea of, we won it all last year, maybe not having
necessarily the drive that they needed?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. I was really concerned about that coming into the
season. Obviously, I hadn't been a part of a National Championship team
before, so I really didn't know how to handle it. They hadn't. But I did talk
to a lot of coaches and everybody said to me, there's a definite hangover you
have to deal with. Don't deny it. Don't hide from it. It's going to be there,
and it really is. And we talked about it all year.  
  
I'm very proud of our three seniors, Josh, and Darryl, and Kris and how, at 20
years old, they are able to handle the maturity of getting past it, taking on
the next challenge, continuing to be humble and get better. Really proud of
them. I don't think I could have done that at 22. Our staff jokes about it all
of the time. If we could have done what Kris Jenkins did last year, we would
have been uncontrollable. And he was, all of them, very humble and coachable.
I'm really proud of them for that.  
  
Q. When do you think you shook that hangover if there was one?  
JAY WRIGHT: We discussed it. We came back -- we all went to the ESPYS in July,
which is kind of the end of the victory tour. It's the last event you go to
after the White House, and state capitol. We discussed it as a team. Because
we're going on a trip to Spain. Hey, this trip to Spain starts the next year.
That's over. We went to Spain. It was great. Because no one knew who we were,
they didn't know we were National Champions. It gave us a fresh start.  
  
But when we got to the baggage claim in Philadelphia and everyone saw we were
there, and they started coming up and taking pictures, it hit all of us, oh,
we're back in it. We're going to have to deal with this. We did get a fresh
start that trip to Spain. It was really helpful to us.  
  
Q. Jay, when you were in Rochester, some 30 years ago, grinding away and
hitting the recruiting trail --  
JAY WRIGHT: 30 years.  
  
Q. Is this where you pictured yourself --  
JAY WRIGHT: Ten years ago I thought it was. No, not at all. I would have been
happy if I could have been the guy to replace Mike Neer at Rochester at that
time. I was just so happy to be coaching. It seems crazy right now that you
get to coach at Villanova and you would have been happy. But you didn't know
any of this was possible. I was having so much fun and enjoying being a coach.
I loved the University of Rochester, Mike Neer was a great coach. I would
have. At that time, Mike Neer was God to me back then. I was like if I can
ever get to do that someday. That was my thought process.  
  
Q. Kind of a combination of the previous three questions both with your
dress -- I talked to your tailor today by the way, Gabriel?  
JAY WRIGHT: We've got to get him under control.  
  
Q. He's a funny way. Did you know that he coached his church league team
to second place 40 years ago?  
JAY WRIGHT: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. I'm sure you did. And the attention paid. Now you have people, I'm
calling your tailor. People are talk bug your suits. How has your life
changed, when you look at the tournament, you were criticized before for not
winning enough in the tournament and now all of a sudden you win one game, one
shot, and so much has changed, if you can take me through that?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, it hasn't really changed that much, just with the media
and -- you know, in basketball venues. That's about it. And in my household,
please. Trust me. I'm number 5 on that list there. I still take out the trash
and do everything I'm told to do. But it really hasn't -- except in situations
like this, when you talk with the media. But I think I'm the same guy. I think
in the program, we all try to stay the same. I talked about our players, you
know? We try to enjoy the journey that we're on.  
  
This is why we do what we do, to be a coach and to be with your players and to
be on a college campus and to be at practice, that's what we love and still
the biggest part of my life.  
  
Q. The perception has changed I guess?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Is that kind of a weird --  
JAY WRIGHT: I'm not as articulate as you guys. That's what I meant to say.  
  
Q. You don't know me real well. Is that a weird transformation to see
how others view you, gets altered, even though you wake up the same way?  
JAY WRIGHT: As I said, we were criticized a lot for losing in the second
round. I wasn't feeling bad about what we were doing. I actually felt really
good about what we were doing. I was disappointed when we lost that game, but
where our program was, our guys were graduating we were winning Big East
championships, our guys were giving their best effort. I felt really good
about what we were doing.  
  
When people were criticizing us if I was feeling good, but then when people
are praising us, I really shouldn't feel better. You just don't take it on one
side. That's really I why think -- I hope we haven't changed.  
  
Q. You spoke earlier about pressure, is there a unique type of pressure
that comes with a one seed and 1 versus 16 match-up?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I don't know if it's top seed but there's a 1-16 pressure.
We've felt it before. I told our team about, we were one seed and actually
Philly guys might -- I might be wrong on this. I count on our media for
details, but when we played Monmouth were we a 1?  
  
We played Monmouth in the Wells Fargo Center where we play our home games,
they we were a 16 seed and they made a run on us and the whole building turned
on us, and it was like a Monmouth home game in our arena. I was shocked. I had
never experienced that. We were number one seed and everyone was going for the
underdog. That's a crazy kind of pressure especially when you're on your home
court. You know those teams, they can get it going and they put game pressure
on you when you're a one seed. You got to be ready for it and got to overcome
that, too.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, on Kris, he was up here earlier and mentioned he
doesn't think about the shot unless he's asked about it. I find that to be
unbelievable. I don't think I'd ever stop thinking about it. Is that just his
personality that he's able to put it aside?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I think it's more his intelligence. He's a confident, cocky,
in a good way, kid. But we talked about it right after the season. And he's
real bright. He's really bright. When we talked about you still got a year
left, you want to get better, you got this for the rest of your life. He right
away internalizes that. I'm amazed -- I've watched for this. When the guys do
shooting drills at the end of practice or they're doing competitions, you
would think one time it would slip, I hit the big shot. I've never ever, ever
seen him mention it ever, and it's really impressive.  
  
Q. Jay, in an era now when players are kind of coming and going because
of one-and-done and things, do you think a program such as yours is more
equipped to repeat than others that perhaps would look more likely repeat
champions?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good -- I hope, I hope so. I hope our experience is
really valuable in this, you know? And usually what gives you a chance to
repeat is a lot of returning players, a lot of returning good players. When
Florida repeated that entire team came back to repeat. Our team didn't come
back to repeat and we lost two great seniors. But we do have -- I think the
key is the number of quality players returning, you know? And, as you say,
because of one-and-done, if you're going to lose a lot of those guys you're
not going to have the quality players returning. So I hope it is an advantage
for us.  
  
Q. We keep going back to the wardrobe. Windsor, double Windsor and is a
pocket square necessary?  
JAY WRIGHT: Straight Windsor. No. It's not always necessary. It depends on the
outfit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: TV guys asking that.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: You all good?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Thank you, guys. I want to
recognize Mike Sheridan, athletic director, who can help you with any of your
needs, thank you very much.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Zach Leday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24934)

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, now, joined the Virginia Tech student-athletes, Seth
Allen, Zach LeDay, gentlemen, welcome to Buffalo. Glad to have you here, we'll
open for questions at this time. Please raise your hand, we'll get a
microphone you to. If you please give your name and affiliation.  
  
Q. Guys, obviously, Wisconsin has got a lot of size. How worried are you
about having to deal with those guys in the paint, especially when you got a
team that's trying to avoid foul trouble?  
ZACH LEDAY: Just going to go out there and play as hard as possible. Every
team is bigger than us. It's not nothing new, we're going to play as hard as
possible, try to box out and get the rebound.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seth?  
  
SETH ALLEN: I agree with Zach. That's kind of been our Achilles heel all
season, so we're used to it. We just got to fight hard for rebounds and
position, and limit them to one shot.  
  
Q. Guys, what have you been doing since you got to Buffalo, with this
being your one and only NCAA Tournament experience of your career, how much
are you trying to soak everything in this week in Buffalo?  
SETH ALLEN: We've just been -- we practiced. We go and lift in the morning. We
eat, we watch a lot of film, we do homework. We chill together. I mean, it's
all snow outside, so we're not leaving the hotel for walks or golfing or
nothing, but we do a lot of things in the hotel, a lot of like team stuff.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Yeah. We just chill. We don't really do nothing that much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: No golf trip.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: No golfing in the snow. They have some snow -- snow people.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Angels?  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Yeah. Whatever.  
  
SETH ALLEN: Oh, we went to the Buffalo Bills facility.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: Oh, yeah, that was cool. Forgot about that.  
  
Q. Two of the last three games you blew second-half leads. What do you
take away from that and what are you going to change from the Wisconsin
game?  
SETH ALLEN: Would you say that again?  
  
Q. Two of the last three games you blew second half leads, Wake Forest
and Florida State. What do you take away from that going into the Wisconsin
game?  
SETH ALLEN: I think that we just got to just play our game, take it one
possession at a time. We can't get ahead of ourself, if we're up or down. We
got to just play by media time-outs, and try to win media time-outs. I think
that when we look ahead like for a whole game, we look ahead for a whole game
it's hard for us. So if we just break it down in little bits, it's easier for
us.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. What is it like as a former starter
coming off the bench and what do you think it has brought to your team having
you two come off the bench with all of the scores that you do?  
ZACH LEDAY: I say that it helps our team, because anybody can take any role,
and no one's entitled to start or anything like that. So just by playing that,
and seeing how hard you've got to work, it doesn't matter who starts, it's
whoever plays the hardest. And I feel like we give a big amount of energy
coming off the bench, and it gets other people's confidence up. I guess people
like starting, it doesn't really matter to us. We just want to come and play
as long as possible, and be in the game, affecting the game.  
  
SETH ALLEN: I think Coach Buzz always tells us to embrace whatever's in front
of us, whether it be a game, a role, anything. I think me and Zach did a great
job of just embracing our role coming off the bench. It's hard sometimes. Guys
are already getting past their first win, and we come in on our first win
trying to keep up with them. They're already loose. It's been tough sometimes,
but you just got to fight through it and keep going. We just try to play hard
off the bench and just bring energy and excitement to the game.  
  
Our teammates, they know all of us can start like any of us. We play seven,
eight guys, so, I mean, anybody, you could start -- we play a lot of guard, so
you could really just put anybody in there. So it doesn't really matter who
starts. It's about who finishes and who is on top at the end of the game. Each
team.  
  
Q. Seth, you said win the media time-outs. That sounds like a Buzz
thing, what do you mean by that?  
SETH ALLEN: Each game has ten media time-outs. Each four minutes, we just try
to win the four minutes. We call them like ATOs, like after time-outs. So,
when we come out of the time-outs, we try to win those possessions. There's
one possession for them and there's one possession for us, and that's what
counts towards an ATO.  
  
So when we talk about winning media time-outs -- so, if it's 16 minutes, and
me and Zach are coming in off the bench, when it hits 12 minutes, we want to
do better, get more stops before it gets 12 minutes, than the other team. So,
instead of it being like, before halftime, let's win, we try to break it into
media time-outs. Let's win this media time-out. Let's see good we can do this
media time-out.  
  
Q. So it's the time in between not necessarily being on the sideline?  
SETH ALLEN: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. We talked about what it meant to get to the tournament and you said
how hungry you are for more. Kind of a silly question, other than advancing,
what would a win mean just in terms of direction of the program and for you
guys in validation as well?  
ZACH LEDAY: I think it would be huge, just for everybody just to keep this run
going. It's been a special story. We don't play that many guys. We're small.
All of this stuff that's been rumored about us. It's really special, and we
just want to keep it going. We just want to play together as long as possible
and play as hard as possible for each other, and just be there for one
another. So, it would be really special to get wins in this tournament and
just keep on going, but we got to start off with this one.  
  
Q. You guys watched film of Wisconsin. What stands out about Ethan Happ
and Nigel Hayes, is this one of the better post games, two of the better
inside players you're going to be facing this year?  
ZACH LEDAY: I say they have very unique games. Happ likes to back you down and
get you under the basket. He's really good as pivoting and going different
ways. He's a good defender as well. Gets a lot of steals. He leads the team in
a lot of categories. Hayes is very versatile. He likes to do a lot. Bring the
ball up. He can rebound, shoot the mid range to three-pointers. He can get on
the glass. I say what's big for us is just keeping them off the glass,
contesting our shots, not falling for the moves, and just keeping them off the
glass. I think that we'll be fine if we do that.  
  
Q. When you watched the Wisconsin on film, do they remind you of anybody
you played with? Is it like playing Virginia, maybe or anybody you dealt with
before?  
SETH ALLEN: They're similar to Virginia. They're like a Big Ten version of
Virginia, kind of. Being that they play slower than most teams, they kind of
want to control and play at their own pace. Part of that is how they play.
Part of it is, like, the style of play they have. And they have, like, two
really good post men, so throwing it in and playing off the post takes
patience, and they want to guard you for long, so you can't take quick shots
against them.  
  
They're a really tough team, kind of similar to Virginia, except they play a
little bit more one-on-one ball than Virginia does. They throw it in in just
space and let him go to work whereas Virginia coming off down screens and just
try to lull you to sleep a lot.  
  
Q. Is this a -- because of their size and all that, is this a tough
match-up. You say oh, I think we'll shoot threes against these guys, it's not
going to be too bad? What is your assessment how tough a game this might be
for you or not?  
SETH ALLEN: I think we just got to go into it playing our game. Part of it,
you want to know what the other team does. You want to know how they play, but
you can't bend towards their style. You got to just enforce how we play. And
we play fast, we play hard, we play against each other, we play smart. So, I
think that's really what's most important going into tomorrow night. Are we
going to play like Virginia Tech or is Wisconsin going to control the pace,
and we're going to play it their style?  
  
Q. Everyone is obviously very excited on Sunday, when you guys got in.
What's been the mood of the team like since we last saw you on Sunday? What's
it been like at the hotel the last few days?  
THE MODERATOR: Everybody is looking at you, Zach.  
  
ZACH LEDAY: You know, we've just been going, going crazy, running up and down
the halls -- no, I'm playing. But everybody was very happy when we got in. We
wanted to see where we were going. We saw we was going to Buffalo and it was
snowing and stuff. That was cool. I'm from Texas, so I don't really see no
snow like that.  
  
After we found out where we got in, everybody was all business then.
Everybody's been watching film. Even the young boys been watching film, just
watching how Wisconsin plays. I think I watched six or seven other games. I
watched the Michigan game, like, three times in, like, the past two days. So,
I mean everybody is just watching film and just getting ready for the match-up
and just trying to get used to tendencies and stuff like that and trying to
get an advantage. That's important, trying to get an advantage on your
opponent in a short amount of time in a tournament like this. That's what
everybody has been doing. That's what I think, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Zach, Seth, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Joined now by Virginia Tech head coach, Buzz Williams. Coach, welcome to
Buffalo. Great to have your team here. Go ahead and open up with questions. If
you please raise your hand, we'll get a microphone you to. Please give your
name and affiliation before you ask the first question.  
  
Q. Hello, Buzz. I know you've had some days to look at Wisconsin. How do
you go about defending big guys like Happ and Hayes, especially for a team
that wants to avoid getting in foul trouble?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. It will be a constant stress for us. I don't know that we
have a simple answer, and I don't know if one answer is sufficient. I think
we'll have to do multiple things. Both of those guys are better than our guys.
Both of them can get you in foul trouble. Both of them are very good one-on-
one scorers. They have three really good one-on-one scorers, but within 15, 16
feet, both of those two guys are really good.  
  
Q. Buzz, you mentioned Sunday night that your job is kind of to get
these guys not to be satisfied with the participation trophy and want to hang
around a little while. Have you been satisfied with the level of focus that
they've had between having a little bit of fun and enjoying the experience and
dealing with the task at hand, or will you really have that answer until 9:40
tomorrow night?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I think the only way to judge it, Norm, is daily. I think
their concentration level has been superb. I don't want to be a task master as
a coach, relative to not being satisfied, while at the same time, this is a
memory of a lifetime for them. So, I hope that what I said didn't come across
in a negative way. But I also think that it is part of my job, part of my
role, to push them to be their absolute best. And that doesn't mean that we're
going to win every game.  
  
But since Sunday night, we had to abort our original travel plan because of
the weather. I thought they handled that well. We've become the most diverse
program ever, relative to altered travel plans, so they kind of thought it was
normal. But our two practices here, and our three film sessions thus far have
been outstanding. And I think that things change when you're playing games
after spring break, because guys understand the magnitude of what it is, even
if they haven't done it. As best they can, they understand that something
about this is different, and I think our guys have been really good.  
  
Q. I was just curious as to why you brought Zach and Seth off the bench,
what went into that decision, and, more importantly, what has it given you,
because us it must have given you something because you stuck with it?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, it started in the right way. We scrimmaged South Carolina
on the last Saturday of October, and in the first ten minutes, as you would
expect playing a team coached by Frank, Seth got hurt. So we then -- that was
on a Saturday. The Thursday before our second scrimmage, which was at George
Mason, Zach got an offensive rebound which is rare, and got hit in the head
and obviously, they're making movies about concussions now, and so he was out
for the next 14 days.  
  
Our first game was the second Friday in November. Seth was healthy by then.
Zach wasn't healthy by then. But both had missed a lot of practice, and so it
just started, as it would for anybody else. And I think what's happened is
Khadim, our freshman center, who starts, was forced into that role, and I
think he's handled it fairly well. And it's probably kept Zach out of more
foul trouble than we would have anticipated.  
  
For Seth, because he's a ball guard, he can play any position, so it -- we've
only suited up eight guys all year long, but the last eight games we've suited
up seven, so, there wasn't ever a lot of maneuverability, but over the last
eight games there's been zero maneuverability. And as it transpired, Tom, what
I mentioned to our team was, I think it was best for our team and it was right
in how it started, but as it evolved and morphed into something else, I
thought it was a great example of what I want our program to be and that's to
be selfless.  
  
So two red-shirt seniors, the two oldest kids on the team, you can argue the
two most productive players on the team, the only guys that would be
considered in some sort of stretch to get an All Conference vote of some sort,
and they're both coming off the bench. And in an unspoken way -- and you're
the only one that's ever had the sense to ask -- -I kind of like that I get to
answer it on this stage, because I think it speaks to the fabric of what we
want to be about.  
  
Q. On a lighter note, we had Coach Huggins in here earlier, and he was
talking about the origin of his game-day dress is he was sweating a lot in a
suit at halftime and decided I'm going to do what I'm going to do. Your
battles with this have been well-documented, and I was wondering if you ever
considered going that route?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Coach is a first ballot Hall-of-Famer. He'll be the next guy
that's in the Hall of Fame that's still employed as a coach. There's only
three of those left in our world, in college basketball, and he's one of them.
Coach can wear wherever he wants to wear. Where I'm from, the way I was
brought up, you should always tuck your shirt in, and you should always tie
your shoes, and if for some reason you ever get a job that requires a college
degree, it's the most respectful thing to start out in a tie. And so it's
partly, mostly, just because of how I was raised. And if I had as much equity,
and I never will, as Coach Hugs, I might get that company that sponsors him
with the pullover, I might do the same thing.  
  
Q. Buzz, you're dealing with a bunch of guys on your team that haven't
been in the NCAA Tournament, don't know what it's like. Wisconsin has two guys
in Koenig and Hayes that have played in 14 NCAA tournament games and 11 wins.
Is that a legitimate concern, or do you think that experience is overblown?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No. I don't think it's overblown at all. Four of five starters
in some capacity or another, have played in a Final Four, played in a National
Championship game, played in a Sweet 16. We have a roster full of guys who,
tomorrow night, that will be their first time ever playing on a court that has
an NCAA blue sticker on it. We can't compare to the job that Coach Ryan and
Coach Gar have done, nor the experience that their rosters has.  
  
I think when you look at how Wisconsin has played, what were they, 7-5 when
Greg took over? And then it went -- that was December 15th after Corpus
Christi, they were 7-5 and they ran it to 9-9, and then they end up in the
Sweet 16 and coach Alvarez has to hire him and they go to the Sweet 16. And
then they beat Syracuse, they beat Oklahoma, two Final Four teams from last
year, in nonconference play. They beat Georgetown. They beat Carolina, didn't
they? Played Carolina but lost, right. And then started 10-1 in nonconference
play.  
  
I mean, obviously, I've loved Coach Ryan forever and I've known Coach Gard
since 15 years ago, but I think the consistency of the program and what
they've meant, the Hokies, we're not even in that same sphere.  
  
Q. Buzz, we know you love your football coach?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: You have to introduce yourself, please. When I get fired, I'm
going to do that.  
  
Q. You have to wear a suit for that anyway?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I can wear a pullover.  
  
Q. Was it special for you to meet with Sean McDermott? We saw you got to
go to the Bills' facility and what did he tell you that particularly captured
your attention?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. I have way more football coaching friends than I do
basketball coaching friends, and for whatever reason, because of kind of how
those relationships started, I've been able to develop really sound
relationship us with multiple NFL guys. I love Coach McDermott's story, right?
He's 42 and he started in the lowest position you can in Philly for Andy Reid,
who's a first ballot Hall-of-Famer, and I thought it would be cool for our
guys to see an NFL facility. But the way that it all started, because I don't
have a personal relationship with Coach McDermott is, as a former manager,
I've always taken great pride in the managers that we have had within our
programs, and a former manager from Marquette is the assistant to the head
coach. It was the first person that Coach McDermott hired.  
  
And so we now have two guys in the NBA that are former managers, one guy in
Major League Baseball and one guy in the NFL, and all of them were awful as
managers, but I'm proud of what they've become as adults. So, that's how it
all started. It was really cool. I did not expect Coach McDermott to spend
time with our team but he said what you think he would have said with more
power and gusto because he's an NFL -- he's one of 32 guys in the world that
does what he does.  
  
Q. Buzz, having played Wisconsin when you were at Marquette all those
years, in preparing for this game, did that help, I guess? Are they pretty
much running the same stuff than they did under Beau?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: These two guys can probably answer that better. I do think that
it's helped. It was like the Cowboys and Redskins on Thanksgiving day every
time Marquette played Wisconsin. There are similarities in what they do, and
how they do it. I would say that their practice itineraries are somewhat
similar. There are also unique differences. Part of it is because of their
personnel. Part of it is probably what Greg is infusing into the program, that
is his own beliefs. Not that that would be negative to Coach Ryan, but there's
for sure similarities.  
  
Going back and looking at all of my notes and practice plans and all of that
stuff in the six times we've played them, I didn't do that at the start
because I didn't want that infiltrating my brain as I was studying them for
this year. But I looked at it all yesterday, and there are -- I showed our
players our practice plans, and see, I've already told you this, and, look, I
was saying that in 2012, too. So, there are for sure similarities.  
  
Q. Buzz, I don't need to tell you that you surprised a lot of people
when you left Marquette to take on this challenging rebuild. Here you are
years three, you're in the NCAA Tournament. Is that time line about what you
expected? Are you ahead of schedule?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah. I don't know. I've never been smart enough to answer that
question. Obviously it's been asked a lot. The first thing I would say,
Marquette completely changed my children's lives and forever I will be
grateful. They hired me -- I don't know many A.D.s and presidents that will
hire a head coach with a losing record, particularly a losing record after
only one season, particularly when they hire him, and it's eight months
removed from him resigning from that one-year losing record.  
  
So, I know it's been maybe said and described in different ways. I've -- in
the right way, I want to process it all, because I don't think that it's all
me. But all of the things that were written in both of your papers in the
Journal Sentinel, I have zero negative to say about anybody, or any day that I
was employed at Marquette, incredibly grateful.  
  
The next thing I would say specific to the time line, the time line as of
today is 1,090 days, if you were counting at home, and there's no way that you
can be an agent of change as a single person in an organization and think that
it will ever change. Dr. Sands had been there three months before I was hired,
Whit Babcock, our A.D. has been there two months before I was hired.
Selfishly, I liked that I was the first major sports hire because they want
that to work. But I think that in order to get to this point, in this league
that we've competed in -- we finished in last place in year one. That was the
fourth consecutive year that they had finished in last place, and multiple
media outlets said I committed career suicide.  
  
The thing was, I had a history of people saying that, because that's what had
happened when I resigned at New Orleans, and it's always -- not gratifying.
It's always another lesson for me that maybe what's written is not completely
always the truth. But what can be quantified, other than words, are the hearts
of people that care, and what's happened at Virginia Tech is just a lot of
people care. That's it.  
  
And the 13 NCAA Tournament games we played at Marquette before I was 40 years
old, that happened not because of me, not because of Jimmy Butler, Jae
Crowder, it's not that. It was a lot of people that cared. That's it. And I've
never looked at the job as, well, by this day, we'll be successful, or by this
day we'll be successful. This time last year, we were playing in the N.I.T.,
and I can't tell you how humbled I was by that. It was only the third time in
the history of the ACC that there had been an eight game improvement. In the
history of, in my opinion, one of the best leagues ever, that there had been
an eight game improvement. But it was the first time that that had happened
from the last-place team and we did it in our second year.  
  
This year's team we'll only suit up seven and we've made multiple decisions to
red-shirt guys because I believe it was right for their life not because we
were making a push to go to the NCAA Tournament. So, to be in this position,
I've never looked at it on a day basis. I've looked at it on, today, did we do
what was right to be sustainable for their lives in the long term? That's it.
And it's not me. It's not Seth Allen. He's average at best. He's not received
an All Conference vote. Zach LeDay, he's below average at best. He has
received one All Conference vote in two years.  
  
So there's 14 other head coaches, so that's 28 opportunities for a vote. He's
got one out of 28. So, you -- then how did it work? That's just a lot of
people doing a lot of work for the right reasons in the intent of their heart
is right.  
  
Q. Hey, Buzz. It's documented that you and Frank Beamer have a great
relationship. Have you talked to him since Sunday and has he given new any
advice going into this game?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I love coaches in general, particularly old coaches. Old people
seem to think I'm kind of like one of those wind-up toys. You just wind him up
and there he goes. Coach has been great to me from the very beginning. I met
Coach before my press conference at Virginia Tech, and since he's retired, I
would say our relationship has increased by 100 percent and that's because he
has nothing to do other than watch "Ellen" every day.  
  
So, I think that he just -- he's more aware of what's going on, and I've been
overly kind to him on purpose, because I want somebody to do that to me. If I
ever am able to get to that point -- what most people that are retired say, is
make sure that you spend more time with your family and love them the way
they're deserving of it. And the next thing is, enjoy the moment so because
it's so hard to get.  
  
Q. Do you have a second-half outfit in case you sweat through your suit
tomorrow?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I always do. I did it in year one and year two. What I tried to
do is incorporate vests, so that the sweating -- I mean this in the right way.
It's the silliest thing ever, right? When you get your car fixed, does the
mechanic sweat? You know, the guy that builds your house, the carpenter, I
think he sweats.  
  
And I know it's funny, and I know I'm not the best looking guy in the world,
but I'm just working real hard. That's it, you know? And I know it's turned
into such a -- it's beyond silly to me, to be honest. Semi-offensive, right?
All I want to do is help our guys as much as I can. If that means I sweat, who
cares. That's kind of the way I feel, so I just wear a vest so it doesn't
become viral on Twitter.  
  
Q. Buzz, you mentioned Sunday that playing Wisconsin is kind of like
playing Virginia. How has that maybe been beneficial to you guys this week
maybe in preparation?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, they would be the only team that we've played that's
similar in philosophy, relative to pace of play, relative to their defensive
thoughts. This Wisconsin team throws it inside much more than this Virginia
team, but that's personnel-specific. Last year, Virginia's team threw it
inside much more. This will be -- Wisconsin's played 34 games, and three of
their 34 games, they've had 70 possessions, three. This will be our 30 -- we
played 32 games, and we've had 15 games that have had 70 or more possessions.
The three games for Wisconsin that have had 70 possessions in it were all in
overtime. And so just that in and of itself is very UVA like.  
  
You know, when we played Virginia the second time, they were -- pace-of-play
relative-wise -- I don't say any of this to be negative -- they were the
second slowest team in the country. Well, we're not fast, but we're for sure,
not comfortable, let's play it real slow and walk it up. And so I think that
will be a lot of the game. At UVA they just destroyed us on the offensive
glass. When you're playing a team that's as slow as they are, when they get a
second opportunity, well you're just going to guard them for 30 more seconds.
And their offense helps their defense, right? A team that plays as slow as
they do, their defense is always going to be good, because on offense, they
hold the ball, sort of, if that's the right way of saying it.  
  
And so I just told our guys, it's -- UVA, they just happen to wear red, and
they have really good players that have experience this time of the year in
winning.  
  
Q. Bill Dyer is here from the athletic communications office of Virginia
Tech. He can assist you --  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Why don't we bring Dyer up and let them ask questions of Dyer.
You sweat too, Dyer.

Q. Hey, for any/all of you guys, as you may know, there are certain
advanced metrics, advanced analytics. They all rate you guys. Top 15, top 5
team in the country. Are you aware of that? Do you talk about it? Does it make
an impact on you?  
JEVON CARTER: I would say we're aware of it. We don't really pay too much
attention to it. We've still got to go out and play basketball, no matter what
anyone says, so it don't really mean anything.  
  
Q. Start with Nate, as you and Tarik as senior, is there a different
feel for this NCAA Tournament as there have been for the last couple?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. A little bit. We lose this time, I'm done forever. So
you've got to come in with a little bit of a different attitude than what you
did before. Still got to go out and play the same game, so we will.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: To take off what Nate said, same thing. It's our last go-
around, so we got to leave it all on the floor.  
  
Q. For Tarik and Jevon, kind of wondering the three-point shot for
Bucknell is a big part of their game, obviously a big part of their game plan
to try to even the game out tomorrow. Just wondered, how do you defined that?
What do you see from the three-point shooters?  
JEVON CARTER: It's like playing Iowa State. Iowa State's got a lot of
shooters, spread the court. They got a big man inside, so they go in a lot.
We're just going to play our game. We're going to do what we do, try to speed
them up, turn them over, make them uncomfortable and run them off the three.  
  
TARIK PHILLIP: We just got to locate shooters, know who you're guarding at
certain times. If you've got a shooter, you can't leave him too wide open, and
as he said, run them off the line.  
  
Q. For Tarik, how do you -- does anybody bring up the memories of what
happened last year in Brooklyn?  
TARIK PHILLIP: It's been brought up several times, but the taste is still in
our mouths, Coach's mouths, players' mouths. We don't try to dwell on it too
much, but it's still in the back of our mind that we lost in the first round
to a team we should have beat, so --  
  
Q. Elijah, their big, does he remind you of anybody? Looks like he's
good inside, has good touch with both hands. What do you think of him and who
does he remind you of?  
ELIJAH MACON: Just playing against guys like Jarrett Allen and Jonathan
Motley, just guys that like to get to their right shoulder a lot, just got to
be physical, keep them off the glass. Just take them out of the game and
everything will flow easier for us.  
  
Q. Can one of you guys give a little insight into what Huggins is like.
I mean, there's one thing when he's in practice and he's intense. In the game,
we see what you experience, then there's a different side to him.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. Hugs is a two-sided person. There's what people see and
what people perceive him to be and then what he actually is, and that's an
extremely loyal, kind-hearted guy, honestly. I mean, he cares about us more
than anyone I've ever known, any coach I've seen or been around. He's
definitely a different guy than what you think.  
  
Q. Elijah, can you answer that also and just explain a little bit the
contrast between him? What's it like dealing with him when he gets heated
up?  
ELIJAH MACON: I mean, kind of like a father figure, you know? Somebody, you
got to take him serious. I mean, he wants to win. Just a fire in his belly, he
just trying to put it inside of us. We're reading off of him, going off how he
feels. Like if he's mad, then we should be mad. If he's having a good day, the
we should have good day. I just feel like that's how it's been.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that Elijah, what's his mood right now? Is he
mad? Is he happy? What is his mood?  
ELIJAH MACON: I mean, just from me seeing and talking to him, he's been pretty
calm. Just trying to figure out the team, what we're going to do. We're trying
to figure out from scouting what we're going to do from the game. He's been
pretty calm from what I've seen, from what I've talked to him. Not knowing --
you know, not saying he's not mad. But he's real relaxed, just sit back and
watching.  
  
Q. What's the scare when he had the heart problem on the bench. How did
that go through the team and how did you react to that? It's only been like
three weeks ago.  
NATHAN ADRIAN: He's obviously had heart problems for a while now, but it's
something he's lived with. It's happened to him a couple times before. You
know, it's kind of scary whenever you don't really know what it is. All of us
are just walking back to the bench, and you turn back around and he's on the
ground. I don't know. Kind of fired us up and we played well for the rest of
the game, tried not to get him too mad at us anymore. Give him a little rest.  
  
Q. Tarik, you talked about after the Big 12 championship, you said
practices last year weren't what you wanted them to be leading up to the game.
How has it been dealing with travel and that sort of thing? What was the last
few days like leading up to this one maybe compared to a year ago?  
TARIK PHILLIP: Traveling ain't really been much of an issue for us. Practice,
there's been a lot of energy in practice. I feel like the players have been
more dialed in, locked in to knowing their scout, knowing their plays. There's
been a lot of energy in practice.  
  
Q. If I could ask similarly of Elijah, it seems this year, when you guys
are about to play a good game you feel it, and when you're about to play a bad
game, you know that too because of what happened in practice the days leading
up. What do you look for? What are the keys when you are readily as opposed to
when you're not?  
ELIJAH MACON: I just feel like if everybody is talking before the game, I just
feel like if it's too quiet before the game, nobody is like communicating with
each other, I feel like if we're not being goofy, if we're not being
ourselves, then I don't feel like we're ready to play. When I see everybody
relaxed, I feel we're ready to go out and compete. If everybody is too tense,
they're thinking about the game too much. If we're walking around and having
fun, and getting our warm-up, and everybody making shots, I feel that's when
we perform at our best.  
  
Q. Question for Nate. Nate, in your four years at WVU, obviously being
from Morgantown and having a good connection with WVU, you've kind of come a
long way. Not only in your game but the way people have perceived you. You
know, your senior year, you got guys in the student section, they got all the
headbands and stuff like that. It seems like people have really gravitated
toward you now as a senior. Can you just talk about how the progression has
gone for you when you first came in until now?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I think people just recognize the work you put in. That's not
just me, it's any senior that comes in here. They're going to be -- some of
the fanfares because they've been there for four years, and people know what
they've done for four years. I wouldn't say anything is really different, it's
just being around for that long.  
  
Q. Have you seen the kids with the --  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yes, I have.  
  
Q. Are they ours?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: I have no idea who they are.  
  
Q. Back to Huggins. He was there before, when you were a kid. So there
was some perception -- when you were coming out, was that a guy that you
absolutely -- just being from that area, you really, really wanted to play for
the guy, or was there any trepidation or what?  
NATHAN ADRIAN: Yeah. That was the guy I wanted to play for. That's the kind of
person I want to play for. I want to play for someone who cares enough to get
fired up like that. I want to play for somebody who's that competitive, who
wants to win that bad. I don't know why anyone would want to play for anyone
else.  
  
Q. When you guys play tomorrow, key for you, is it the press, hitting
shots? What is it that you see that makes you play well, what aspect?  
JEVON CARTER: That's hard to say. Every game is different. I can't tell you
whether it's been the offensive end or defensive end. I just go play,
honestly. So, it's not really what am I doing, it's what are we doing as a
team, you know? I can't win a game for us. We all got to do it together. So,
it's not just about me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. I want to recognize Bryan Messerly,
over here on the left from West Virginia from their athletic communications
office. He's here to assist you in any other way with West Virginia student-
athletes and coaches.  
  
Gentlemen, thank you for your time today. Best of luck tomorrow against
Bucknell. We'll be right up with Coach Huggins.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by head coach Bob Huggins, West Virginia
University. Coach, welcome to Buffalo. Good to see you again here. We'll go
ahead and open to questions. If you raise your hand we'll get a microphone you
to.  
  
Q. Bob, what fond memories do you have of Buffalo from maybe seven years
ago, if any?  
BOB HUGGINS: Winning. We played pretty well in here. Actually, this is the
third time. We came in and played Canisius my first year, and of course
advanced from here to Syracuse, and had the epic game with Kentucky and
Syracuse to go to the Final Four.  
  
Q. In contrast, is it nice to be starting in Buffalo, a place where
you're familiar with and had some success as opposed to maybe erase some
memories of Brooklyn last year?  
BOB HUGGINS: We always want to go somewhere that has good weather. So, you
know, we were excited to hear you're going to get 20 inches of snow. Now, this
is -- we're really comfortable here, and, you know, I think it's great to play
in the city, but it's -- you know, the traffic and those kind of things, you
spend more time almost planning on getting there and getting back, and not
being late and those kind of things than you do really kind of preparing for
the game. I really like Buffalo. I actually came up here and went fishing. How
about that? I bet no other coach here has been fishing.  
  
Q. Sabres coach.  
Q. No. That's never happened here. You're the first.  
BOB HUGGINS: It's near and dear to myself.  
  
Q. It's funny when you say that. When you were here, I found you to be
fun, and funny and charming. I remember having a conversation about best
places to go for chicken wings and stuff like that. It's kind of like in
contrast of maybe what the perception is when people watch you coach, when you
see the intense, fired up, competitive Bob Huggins, a different Bob Huggins.
Is there any contrast -- how do you explain the difference in there?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, you probably don't want people bothering you when you're
writing a story.  
  
Q. This is true.  
BOB HUGGINS: So, you know, I mean, people see me in the workplace, you know?
It's like I told some guy one time, he screamed at me the whole game, you
know, over the rail and all that. I told him, how would you like me to go to
your place of work and scream and yell at you. When you're frying those French
fries at McDonald's, would you want me screaming at you?  
  
Q. So, simple question, Bob, where did you go fishing and how did you
do? When was this?  
BOB HUGGINS: Lake Erie, and it was terrific. Wasn't it Lake Erie? Yeah. Lake
Erie. It was terrific. Great small mouth fishing. You only have to go out half
a mile, maybe, if that. It was great. Then the other guys in the other boat
caught a bunch of walleye. So it was fun.  
  
Q. Somebody caught a sheepshead?  
BOB HUGGINS: We had a guy with us, that's all he caught.  
  
Q. I have a non-fishing question for you. Jevon Carter, what makes him
such an effective defensive player?  
BOB HUGGINS: He's very competitive, I think, first and foremost. He's probably
our most competitive guy, and he's got great feet. He really can move his
feet, and he studies, you know? He's a guy that, if you would ask him
schematically, what people are going to try to do, he knows. So, he's a little
ahead of the game, I think, in that regard.  
  
Q. You're probably aware that there's several kind of more advanced
analytics that routinely, and not even just this year, have West Virginia
ranked higher than, you know, some of the more conventional rankings, top 5,
top-10 team. I'm wondering if you're aware of that. I'm guessing you are, but
also if that's something you talk to the team about or if it's anything you
take anything away from?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think more educated people generally go that way. They think
much higher of the Mountaineers than the normal people do, but, yeah, I'm
aware of it. You can't hardly not be aware of it with everything that's out
there today. I don't really talk to our guys about it. You know, I talked to
them about not turning the ball over and trying to create some turnovers. I
think that's more important for us.  
  
Q. Coach, long season, some bumps and bruises at the end. How are you
guys health-wise going into this?  
BOB HUGGINS: I think other than Nate, we're pretty good. Nate's pretty banged
up. Other than him, I think we're pretty good. He'll play through it. He's a
tough guy. He'll figure out a way.  
  
Q. Follow up to that. Do you find seniors like Nate, do they have a
different purpose in an NCAA Tournament game knowing it's one and done?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think a lot of our guys do after last year. I mean, I was
very honest about the fact that I didn't think our practices were very good
leading in a year ago. I didn't -- I thought we kind of took Stephen F. Austin
for granted, and they were a really good team. That was a terrible mistake.  
  
This year, we've been much, much better, but I think probably, to a large
degree, of having so many of those guys back that went through the experience
a year ago.  
  
Q. Just an offbeat question, if I may. Are they -- as a team like them,
in an era of one-and-done, more equipped than a team built with more seniors,
more veterans? Have things changed because of the era we're in?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. I think kids have changed, certainly. I mean, we're
in -- I think, more than anything, it's instant gratification. You know, I
think that's -- when you sit and play games all day instead of being on a
playground playing, it's because you want instant gratification.  
  
We just don't -- I don't think guys spend as much time working at their craft
as maybe they used to. And we're fortunate. We got some throwback guys. Jevon
Carter, he's a throwback. He's like one of the old guys that would just rather
spend time in the gym than get on Playstation.  
  
Q. Bob, do you have any kind of relationship with Jay Wright at all?  
BOB HUGGINS: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. What's it like? How would you describe your relationship with him?  
BOB HUGGINS: I've known Jay for a long, long time. I mean, I know I don't look
like it, but I've been in this business 40 years, so I know everybody. And we
were in the same league for a long time. You know, I think a great time for
coaches to get together is at the league meetings. We get to spend a lot of
time socially together, eat together, you know, hang out together, so, yeah, I
know Jay well.  
  
Q. You respect him, obviously, I assume, as a coach, as a dresser?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, you know, I keep telling him, if I'd lose a little bit of
weight, he'd be the second-best looking coach out there, but to this point, I
haven't been able to do that. I think he's a heck of a coach. We had just
great games when we were both in the Big East. I mean, if you go back and look
at the scores, there were numerous overtime games. And I thought that the play
he drew up when they scored the lay-up to beat Pitt was -- you know, it's kind
of like an old football play. It's kind of like the kick-off when everybody is
lateralling it, you know?  
  
Q. Bob, just looking at West Virginia's numbers, I mean, the defense is
there with steals and creating turnovers. Are you in any way surprised by how
much offense you guys are putting up in 82 points a game, and what might that
be a reflection of?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we get so many more shots. You know? I think the key for us
is getting more shots than our opposition, and, you know, the more shots we
get, the better off we're going to be. We need to create turnovers and we need
to rebound the ball. And if we do those things, we're going to get more shots
than our opposition.  
  
And then I think, you know, the other thing that we haven't done a very good
job of at times is make free throws. But at times, we have; at times, we've
been very good at the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Someone brought up your dress, and obviously, you've spoken in the
past about when you decided to stop wearing the suit. When you still did wear
the more conventional coaching outfit, did you wear a tie? Because I note that
Mike Brey is also a coach who does not wear a tie.  
BOB HUGGINS: Yeah. I used to wear a tie. I did the whole deal. I mean, I had
tie, vest, I mean the whole deal. Probably if you look at pictures of me and
Jay early, I was probably better looking back then. Probably dressed better
back then. I had been doing it longer, had more money. I just kind of -- do
you want to hear the whole story? The whole story is this. I had a suit and
tie on, and we're playing somebody, and I'm at Cincinnati, and I go in, and
I'm like I got to put something different on, because I had sweat all of the
way through my suit and my vest. They were heavy.  
  
So they brought me in a pullover, and I put it on and coached the second half
in a pullover, and I was walking in, my A.D. said, I just want to tell you
look really good in that pullover. That's what really coaches should wear. So
I started wearing one. Which was good until I got the new president, and the
A.D. denied saying I looked good in a pullover. So, be careful who you trust,
is the moral of that story.  
  
Q. Bob, how are you feeling these days after that scare from a couple
weeks ago?  
BOB HUGGINS: I feel great. I really do. I've been through a battery of tests,
and everything's good. I don't really want that defibrillator to go off again,
though. Because it -- I've never been kicked by a mule, but I could imagine
it's pretty much the same. But I feel good. I actually feel like I have more
energy now than I did at some other points in time in the season.  
  
Q. And how much -- you talked about the experience of last year. How
much more do you think that this team is more prepared, knowing what you went
through and maybe took the opponent for granted? Do you think that was a
learning experience going that this tournament and do you even need to bring
up Brooklyn?  
BOB HUGGINS: No. We really don't. Well, I guess if we -- if I think we're
starting to have a bad practice, I guess we bring it up a little bit. But, no,
I think a lot of people didn't think we would be near as good as we were
losing Devin Williams, you know, declared early, and Jaysean Paige who was an
All-League player for us. Those two in particular, I think a lot of people
didn't think we would be where we are today.  
  
It's a tribute to our guys, and our guys do work. I'll say that about them.
They do work. They do get in the gym, they have improved, and they're, for the
most part, fun to coach. I think they would probably tell you I'm fun to play
for most of the time and they're fun to coach most of the time, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: They did say that, actually.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: They did? I'm sure they did. I've got about 175 assistant coaches
out there that never worked for me to thank for that. Because they're all the
time telling people you can't play for him. He's too hard on you, this and
that. I thank those guys all of the time, because then I get guys that kind of
want to get coached. So those guys that think they're killing us are really
helping me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Huggins?  
  
Seeing none, Coach, thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Mitch Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27884)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined at this time by the head coach of Princeton,
Mitch Henderson. Same rules apply. Please raise your hand if you have a
question. Please give your name and affiliation and we'll go ahead and get
started with questions for Coach. Let's start up front here with John.  
  
Q. Hi, Mitch. Given your success that you had as a player at Princeton,
how much can you draw upon, you know, the upsets that you were part of, and
going into tomorrow's game, you know, where -- given where you're seeded?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Just a little. I think, that the preparation, when going into
the tournament game, is to remember that it's a game, and how you respond to
each moment throughout the course of the game. You've got to do your thing.
Coach Carril, I remember distinctly before we played UCLA, said, and he used
to say this all of the time, I'm preparing you to win the game.  
  
When the ball went out against UCLA, we all ran back on defense, all five of
us. We're not going to do that. I understood his point. This team understands
that as well. We're giving them every opportunity to win.  
  
Q. You know, you lost two key guys to injury this year, and a lot of
people didn't necessarily think you'd be sitting where you are, what did --
not just you do to kind of get everybody back together, but what did your
players do?  
MITCH HENDERSON: We had a meeting after we lost at home to St. Joe's. Pete
Miller, one of our seniors, said, one sentence, but to the group, we're going
to start guarding and we're going to win the Championship. And I've been in
meetings before where those words are said, and it doesn't ring as true. But
it was like -- it reverberated throughout all of us. We went up to Monmouth
and played a tough game. It was a very high-scoring game, and then our pace
slowed down. I think that was the key, one of the keys, for us.  
  
We played at Bucknell, and I think a really quality road win. I know they're
here. And the emergence of Myles and Devin for. Myles being a particularly
great two-way player, I think anywhere. He can guard multiple different
positions. That was it. Didn't see us going on a 19-game streak, but I really
thought at that Monmouth game, that we're going to be just fine.  
  
Q. Yeah, two questions. First, can you talk about sort of appreciation
that you have, sort of a game caught up to Coach Carril's -- co-opted a lot of
Coach Carril's principles how to play the game, first. And secondly, I heard
you quoted your experience of going against Butler teams, how that influenced
you to maybe -- my sense is, be more flowing, a little less rigid on run this
play, and that play?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Go ahead?  
MITCH HENDERSON: I'll answer the second one first. We played Butler at Butler.
When they went to the final game with Gordon Hayward as a sophomore and those
guy, and then we played in the second year -- I'm sorry. He was a freshman and
then we played them the second year, the first time we went to the final game,
and we got rolled both times at Northwestern, I mean I thought we did.  
  
I remember they were on everything we were doing. This had happened a couple
times. In fact, it happened to us in the second round of the NCAA Tournament
when we played Michigan State and I felt like -- and this was just me -- if we
were going to prepare to beat the very best teams on our schedule, that we
needed to be a little less guardable, less predictable, more flowing. And that
started really with recruiting. And it -- this wasn't like an overnight
decision. It happened with the players that were arriving.  
  
And I think that Myles Stephens is kind of an example of that, a very
versatile two-way player that's made a major impact. When you see them, you're
not going to say he looks just like every single Princeton basketball player
I've ever seen. Locally and within the league, we fought the stigma of
Princeton offense. It's gone for us. Nationally people are going to find out
that we don't play like that.  
  
The principles -- which answers the first part of the question -- good
spacing, good players, and take good shots. We don't have an aversion to the
three-point line. We're taking them. A lot of people like to point out we take
a lot of them. I guess we do, and we want to see it go in. It's a valuable
shot in this game especially when you can go inside and out. I think it
stretches the defense. And when you put five guys on the floor that make a
shot, everybody is playing with a pick-and-pop five or a four, including Notre
Dame, and it's very hard to guard. We've been playing like that for ever.  
  
Q. Mitch every student-athlete is dealing with some academic pressures,
challenges right now. What about the fact that some of your players are going
through mid-terms right now and what are the challenges that they face, and
also, how much added workload was put on your players, given the fact that you
have to play in the Ivy League inaugural tournament?  
MITCH HENDERSON: It was another extra -- it was an extra week where normally
you could be relaxing, potentially, and balancing your week. But we play
Fridays, Saturdays, in our league. And we talked right in the spring, really,
with the returning players, and then in the fall we meet, and the seniors and
the juniors walk through their schedule and how they balance it. In fact,
Steve Cook is one of the best guys at balancing his schedule and he goes
through his planner on Sunday nights and he says this is how I do it. The
freshmen sit there and their jaws drops down. I can't believe this -- you've
got a minute schedule, instead of taking a 45-minute lunch it's a half-hour
lunch. I don't think you can to that until you we walk through it yourself.  
  
This is normal for us. I think we have close to 20 mid-terms this week between
the team. This morning, I got down -- we have two rooms in the hotel and one
room is for studying. Half the team was in there at 8:00 a.m. This is what we
do. And when they get out here, we always talk to them about be where you are.
So, when we walk out there, we're going to be flying around. And then when we
go back to the hotel, we study.  
  
Q. Mitch, how difficult is Bonzie Colson as a match up, not just for you
but to for anyone out there?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. He's a very underrated player. I worked with Craig
Robinson a long time at Northwestern. Craig was a terrific player at
Princeton. I always teased Craig, he had, from the feet to the hips, he was,
like, 7 feet tall, and then he had sort of a -- he was -- that's how Bonzie
is. He's proportioned in a way that makes him very difficult to guard and if
you've played, you can kind of understand that. He presents a lot of problems
for everyone that guards him because he's shifty. People say it's an old-man
game. We have a player and Spencer Weisz, people describe as playing older. I
think it's just great basketball. He's terrific at kind of every part of the
game, great rebounder, he picks-and-pops. We're going to have to guard him
with multiple different guys.  
  
We've had success in our league, there's multiple teams that played with a
very skilled five. With that said, we haven't seen anybody like him. We know
it's a challenge. We're ready for it.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you have a lot of mature players and I'm sure Devin
Cannady fits right into that category. What's your level of concern with the
emotions he might be facing playing against his home town team that he knows
those players, Demetrius Jackson used to be a teammate and I don't believe
Notre Dame offered him a scholarship?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Yeah. That -- I think a year ago, I would have been -- had
maybe a high level of concern, but Devin's grown so much with the loss of the
two seniors in a leadership position, and he's going to have to maintain a
level head. You know, there's always a game within the game and Devin has --
he's a light bulb of a kid. He comes into the gym and I always tell everybody,
right before he takes the floor, he says Mishawaka, as loud as he can, which
is where he went to high school and it's right next to Notre Dame.  
  
I think whatever you need to use to get motivated, I think you should use it.
Devin, he doesn't need much.  
  
Q. It's actually Mishawaka Marian?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Mishawaka Marian. Yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you can talk about who, which teams both
past and present, starting probably with the Princeton teams of Pete Carril,
but not ending there, inspire you guys' offense which tends to be more free-
flowing which frankly remind me of some NBA teams than college teams?  
MITCH HENDERSON: Good. I'll go with an NBA comparison. You were going to say
the Warriors?  
  
Q. Whatever you say?  
MITCH HENDERSON: I'm sort of repeating myself, probably, but we start off with
round three, and three guys playing together, one guy being kind of a post.
So, we've played that this way for a long time, but Coach Kittles who is on
staff, called it the modern game. This is the modern game. When he was playing
in the NBA in the 2000s, they were running some of the Princeton stuff, we've
modernized it, and we've just moved it away from the basket a little bit more.
We've had great centers, true five centers.  
  
And with this team, we're a little bit more on the perimeter, but we're
playing through posts. Spencer is a post, Myles is a post. Pete Miller. Will
Gladson comes in as a bigger post. And I think we've found ways to highlight
the strengths of the group. Draymond Green, I coached against Draymond when I
was an assistant when he was at Michigan State. He didn't take a lot of
threes, but he's developed and become a great passer. A lot of guys at
Princeton will say, I didn't know I was a great passer, and then you graduate
with a ton of assists.  
  
We ask them all of the time, what do you see, what do you see? Don't you see
that? You got to work on that part of your brain. I think that's as much as
what it is as anything else, is learning how to adjust your thinking.  
  
That's a rhetorical question, usually, I don't want them to answer it. What do
you see? I know you thought you saw it. This is what you're supposed to see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach? Okay, Princeton tips off at 12:15
against Notre Dame. A reminder that Andrew Boarders right here in front is the
sports information director at Princeton and he can help you with any other
questions that you might have. Coach, good luck tomorrow.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined by Wisconsin student-athletes, far right, to
my far right. Ethan Happ, Nigel Hayes, and Bronson Koenig. Gentlemen, welcome
to Buffalo. We'll go ahead and take questions, please raise your hand. We'll
get a microphone so our student-athletes know who we're talking to.  
  
Q. Nigel, you heard them introduce you as student-athletes. What does
being a student mean you to?  
NIGEL HAYES: That we just participate in school, yeah. I don't know. It's just
-- it's funny, but it's a term, so --  
  
Q. Bronson, you guys have obviously been seeded far better in past
tournaments. How much does that make a difference to you, you guys, coming
into this tournament. Is this something you feel like you need to prove you're
incorrectly seeded coming into this one?  
BRONSON KOENIG: No, sir. I feel as a program, we've always been kind of
underestimated. It doesn't really matter to us. It's nothing new. We are just
looking to go, get a win, play our game.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, the Big Ten seedings weren't great coming into
this tournament. I know it's about Wisconsin and going as far as you guys can
go, but do you take some -- I don't know, does it piss you off a little bit
that the Big Ten gets seeds like they got?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, I guess no. But at the same time, like we want the Big Ten
to do well. A lot of people from the outside said the Big Ten wasn't very
good, but really, it was just that there wasn't a lot of disparity from top to
bottom, so -- there's a lot of good teams. It's not just that -- it's just
that we didn't have one or two dominant teams throughout the Big Ten.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else?  
  
Q. For Ethan and Nigel, when you look at -- when you guys looked at
Virginia Tech and saw they don't have a lot of big guys, do you guys instantly
think, okay, this is going to be a fun game for us. We're going to pound it
inside, good luck trying to stop us. When you guys have a good inside game
like that, does it make you lick your chops when you see a game against a
smaller team?  
NIGEL HAYES: No. Not especially after you watch film. They have not as big
guys as us, but they shoot the three extremely well, and three is worth more
than two. They also are a good team which is why they're in the Tournament,
and the type of defense they play make it difficult where it's not just one-
on-one, where Ethan and I can take advantage of one of their smaller guys.  
  
So it's going to be a challenge. And the same way that you perceive they're
mismatched guarding us, they probably feel the same way. We have to go chase
them around the arc.  
  
Q. Ethan, do they compare -- did Virginia Tech compare to anybody you've
seen this year? Is there somebody you can sort of -- look at film of, and get
an idea what you're going to see?  
ETHAN HAPP: Not a team that has that many weapons, that shoot the ball that
well. But I guess the team that we just played, Michigan, is one that's kind
of identical in some of the stuff they run. Obviously having one through four
being able to shoot the three really well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you guys are clicking in games like the
Big Ten semifinals versus some of the losses you had later in the year, what's
the difference? What's clicking for you as opposed to winning, like when you
have some losses?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah. I think the difference is, just playing together,
playing as one unit, and having fun doing it. There's definitely a disparity
in games that, you know, where we lose compared to the ones that we win. We're
not sharing the ball, the ball is not popping around as much, we're not
playing inside, outside, which has kind of been our strength and our staple
all year, and allowing our defense to lead into our offense. That's the things
that we do in order to be successful.  
  
Q. Nigel, you guys are as tournament-tested a team as there is. What do
you think experience means in this tournament especially?  
NIGEL HAYES: I think it helps deal with the distractions that come with this.
It helps to deal with keeping your emotions in check. For instance, we have
the know Trice on our team, Bronson is our starting point good. Trice will be
filling his shoes once he's departed, so Bronson can share with him how to
deal with all the attention that comes with this, how to deal with your
emotions, how to go out there and and just play. I'm sure he'll be extremely
nervous for his first game in the tournament. It's a big deal.  
  
So we'll try to share that experience, that knowledge, and that comfort with
the rest of us knowing that we're here, we'll can fun, but at the same time,
we need to focus because we know we have a job to do.  
  
Q. As mentioned, you're one of the most tournament-tested teams. How is
each year fun and how is this year different from previous years?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, this year's fun, just because it's -- personally, it's
with a group of seniors I'm definitely going to miss next year. And I don't
want it to be my last game with them tomorrow, or even this week, so we want
to continue to play. And we have a lot of fun off the court as well, so that's
what makes it a special team. But I think that Nigel was on the money when he
said that us being in the tournament before, and those guys being in so many
other years definitely helps us with the emotional part of it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what makes Wisconsin such a good defensive
team overall and then why is maybe three-point deep, it's not a strong suit
compared to other parts of the defense?  
NIGEL HAYES: We practice defense all of the time. We do defense all of the
time, all of the time. That's what we do in practice, is practice defense. So
you're good at what you do often. Sometimes we get away from that in games and
those usually result in losses for us, so if we can get back to those
principles we worked on, we should be pretty good.  
  
And as far as the three-point percentage defensively not being that good, just
got to be better on our close-outs and contests. Got to get the toughs twos
that we want. Obviously the three is the most efficient shot to take, so we
need to definitely eliminate that against a team we're going to play tomorrow
that shoots 40% or higher from three as a team.  
  
Q. Ethan, where do you feel you've taken the most growth in your game
from freshman year to sophomore year? Where do you see the most improvement?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, I just feel like I'm getting more familiar with the game
itself. I mean, if you saw, at the beginning of last year, I was not very
good, and then I slowly got better with the more game experience I had. And
now having more game experience into this year, I think just having time on
the court, not only playing with my teammates, but also just seeing things,
what to do and what not to do. I mean, I think overall, I'm just trying to
take my game one step at a time to the next level, but we still got a long way
to go.  
  
Q. Okay. I want to recognize Patrick Herb who is over here on --
Patrick's here, the Wisconsin athletic communications director. He can help
you in any other needs you have with Wisconsin. That being said, thank you for
your time today. Good luck tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard. Coach, welcome
to Buffalo. Let's get started with questions at this time. Would you please
raise your hand? We'll get a microphone you to. And go ahead and get started.
Start right here.  
  
Q. This team has been to many tournaments, obviously. Have you noticed
anything different this time about how players are embracing it?  
GREG GARD: No. I don't think so. I mean, obviously, everybody that's in our
program has been to tournaments every year. I think that's something that we
constantly remind them of and make sure they don't take it for granted. To be
a program that's gone to 19 straight NCAA Tournaments is an astonishing
accomplishment. It's obviously a tribute to the players and coaches that have
been here before us.  
  
But that's one thing specifically with our younger guys that they understand
that it takes a lot of work to get here. But I haven't noticed anything
different. They've gone about the process the same way. I think they
appreciate where we're at, and this is a reward for having a really good
regular season.  
  
Q. Greg, Ethan was talking earlier about a comparison between Virginia
Tech and somebody you guys have already seen. He mentioned Michigan just
because of the number of shooters that Tech has and it's similar to what you
saw with Michigan. Is that a fair assessment and given that, is it a tough
match-up for you because you guys have struggled defending from the perimeter
at times?  
GREG GARD: I think it's a tough match-up because they're a good team.
Regardless of match-up, I think, when you get to this point in time in the
year, if you're still playing, consider yourself fortunate. Most likely your
opponent is going to be really good too. As I've said many times, all of the
average to bad teams are on spring break right now, so I think comparatively,
I don't know if there's anybody -- maybe some personnel things here and there.
Seth Allen reminds me a little about Derrick Walton from Michigan, just how he
controls the ball in ball screen situations and those type of things. But
we're probably built a little differently in most regards than a lot of teams
we've played. I'd have to go back through the non-conference and look at some
teams there.  
  
Buzz has done a heck of a job there in three years with how they share the
ball, the way they can spread the floor with obviously a lot of shooters.
That's going to put a stress on anybody regardless of any comparison or who
you've played in the past. We'll have to obviously be extremely sharp in terms
of rotations and things tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You obviously coached against Buzz a number of times when he was at
Marquette. How aware were you back then of his coaching quirks and oddities
that he built his representation on?  
GREG GARD: He's like Rain Man?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
GREG GARD: I knew back that in 2002. Did you talk to Buzz earlier in the week,
too? I just was with him for a little bit at our coaches meeting.  
  
But 2002, I'm a first-year assistant in Wisconsin and we're playing in a
tournament in Hawaii. Buzz at the time was at Colorado State as an assistant.
We got together in my hotel room to share scouting reports. They were going to
play LSU, we were going to playing Hawaii, so we were exchanging, third day in
the tournament, some notes and stuff. Just the questions he asked, and the
numbers he was pulling out of the air, you could tell he's was very
inquisitive, and very detail-oriented. I gave him a couple of those looks like
what the heck are you talking about?  
  
But obviously, 15, 16 years later, look where we're both at. I knew then --
not knowing really who he was. That was the first time I met him. Then
obviously years later, he ends up at Marquette, and then on to here -- or to
Virginia Tech. So, he was sweeping floors at JUCOs in Texas when I was
sweeping floors at junior highs in Wisconsin. So, he's had to work his way up.
He's had to do it the hard way. He hasn't had anything handed to him. I have
an appreciation for that because I think there's some similarity there's with
my career trek and the places you've coached at and embraced and loved. I know
he would say the same things about the places he's been at that are obscure
and nobody really knows they exist.  
  
You have an appreciation for that when you develop or come through those
ranks. Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Buzz for how he's gone about
his career, and the places he's gone to and who he's coached with, and how
he's stuck with it and kept grinding. So, his number analytics are sometimes
over my head when he's pulling out those numbers.  
  
Q. And there's obviously a large disparity in tournament experience
between these two rosters. Do you see that play out at all on the court when
the game's happening or is it really being able to hand all of the outside
stuff?  
GREG GARD: Yeah. I think you get to this point in time in the year. Experience
may have been a bigger thing back in November. Now we're through this point.
They've played through a rigorous conference schedule. We have too. We've both
seen tournament environments, so I think you can kind of throw that out.
They've got some guys that have some experience in game environments. I think
sometimes that's overblown because we've already played 30-some games each.  
  
It will be a matter of who does what they've done well all year better for the
40 minutes all night. They'll do the things they try to do and have been
successful at all year, and we'll try to counter with what we've been good at
all year.  
  
Q. In terms of what you've been good at all year, with the size
advantage you have against Virginia Tech, you just kind of lick your chops and
say let's pound the ball inside and see if we can take advantage of the size,
and try to get them into foul trouble?  
GREG GARD: They utilize what they do pretty well, in terms of their reaction
in the gaps and their ability to put pressure on the post. And they defend --
they throw some different defenses at you, mix some zone combinations in with
their man, some switching, and they will trap in the post here and there.  
  
So we try to attack in terms of, there's a plan going into it, but also, we
have to adjust to what is available, and that's why we like multi-dimensional
players that can play inside, outside, and do a variety of things, and try to
be a real balanced team and not be one aspect of the game or scoring
dependent. We always like to touch the post. That's been a constant, a
mainstay in our program for a long time. And that may be post players, it may
be via cuts, it may be via dribble attack. And Buzz's term is "paint touches,"
and ours is very similar in terms of we want to get the ball to that high
percentage area as much as we can.  
  
Q. Greg, even the Big Ten Tournament your bench came through the couple,
first two nights and last night didn't score. What do you think is the reason
for that inconsistency?  
GREG GARD: I think each game is a little different in terms of opportunities
that present themselves. The second day in the Big Ten Tournament we played
with a lead, so I was able to play a little deeper and intentionally give
those main guys a little more of a break. When you have a 25-point lead,
you're more likely to be able to play some guys down the stretch. I think,
that game maybe went to that a little bit more. I had to look at who could
take advantage of opportunities. Match-ups is one thing. Michigan, I just
didn't feel we got into enough of a rhythm to go a whole lot deeper on the
bench. I wanted to give our upper classman the best chance to try to get back
and get caught up and win that thing.  
  
So, it's a game-by-game decision in terms of who and how much. A lot of it is
personnel-driven. Basically what I'm seeing on the floor. And obviously, I
think Saturday's game, even to some extent Friday's game, because we had a
lead there, that I could be a little more flexible with guys I'm putting on
the floor.  
  
Q. Greg, as good as you guys have been on defense this year, three-point
defense maybe not as much of a forte. Why is that and what do you have to do
better in that regard against Virginia Tech perhaps?  
GREG GARD: I think one thing that kind of gets lost in the shuffle here is our
percentage at times gets higher, than maybe we would like it to be, but also
if you look at our attempts, they usually are the fewest. I think we give up
the second fewest threes in the Big Ten, second to Michigan. I look at it,
there's two ways to look at it. You look at percentage and how many threes
they're giving up. We try to run people off the line and minimize the
attempts. Probably I look at that more than what is the percentage that we're
giving up, and different teams play it different ways. We don't extend quite
as much so that allows -- sometimes we can compress things a bit more, and
sometimes that allows us to have a higher percentage shot against you, try to
take away other parts of the offense's ability.  
  
So I know our percentage -- I know where it ranks, but I also look at the
attempts given and there's a counterbalance to that either way.  
  
Q. Aside from the tournament itself, what does it mean for you, being
from Wisconsin, climbing up through the ranks from Wisconsin, different
schools, just personally, what does it mean for you, you know, being able to
lead the Badgers to another tournament?  
GREG GARD: Well, obviously you take great pride in it, because when I was from
zero to 23 or 24, the Badgers were never in the NCAA Tournament, so to come
through that span of your lifetime and never see Wisconsin in an NCAA
Tournament, it obviously has a special meaning right now. My kids know no
different. I have a 15, 13 and 8-year-old and they've never seen an NCAA
Tournament without Wisconsin in it. Having as you mentioned grown up in the
state, and coached at three different schools, my last time in Buffalo was
1995, Platteville played in the Final Four and won a National Championship
here at Buffalo State. That was -- when Buffalo came up on Sunday, that's
right where my mind went to was '95 and the last time I was here.  
  
So, you have those kind of memories and connections and relationships in the
state. I think when you are leading your home state school, there's an extra
sense of pride in that. Obviously, I know we represent the state and Badger
fans and alumni across the country. But obviously, those in the state, it's a
little extra special to it, because I'm one of them. I sat in that seat or
watched it on TV or whatever for a lot of years and have witnessed how far the
program has grown over that time.  
  
Q. Greg, what do you see from your guys when you're clicking like you
were in the Big Ten semis, versus some much the losses you had later in the
year. What's the difference for you when you watch the game on TV or on film
itself?  
GREG GARD: Well, the ball moves. That's pretty obvious. The ball had moved
pretty well. I thought it moved well on Saturday. Not quite as well on Sunday.
We went through a little stretch where Koenig was banged up and missed a game.
I think that impacted us offensively when you have a player like that that's
not in rhythm or in sync, it has a tendency to trickle down to other guys.  
  
But all of our better teams have had very good spacing, ball movement, have
different guys that can score from different areas, being able to stretch the
floor a little bit with bigs that can shoot the ball. That rhythm that we got
into over the last three, four games is something we'll try to replicate
offensively. Maybe not as much with last Sunday's game, but a lot of that also
had to do with Michigan. I thought they did some really good things to us, and
obviously, offensively, they were hitting on all cylinders so we were playing
catch-up most of the game.  
  
Just try to get in rhythm. Share the ball, take care of the ball. The ball
moves pretty well. We don't over-dribble when we're in rhythm. And at times
we're out, we over-dribble and pound it too much. So, try to stay away from
that and more of the other.  
  
Q. What do you remember about Buffalo from that Buffalo State tournament
and what do you notice about the city this time?  
GREG GARD: Well, there wasn't this much snow here, I know that. And I remember
the gym being orange. He confirmed that back stage that it's orange and black.
We played Steve Alford's Manchester team. At that point in time it the first
time two undefeated teams had met for a National Championship. They came in
31-0, we came in 30-0. So, we took the team to an Italian restaurant which I
find out now is out of business. Because I chatted with Coach Ryan, or traded
messages over the week when it was announced we're coming here. He said hey
take the team to, I think it's Carmine's. That's what we decided the name was
now, but we found out it's out of business. But it was obviously great
memories, because my second year coaching, we win a National Championship. I
mean, got spoiled pretty quickly. It was a good time. Seems like a hundred
years ago but it was fun.  
  
Q. Greg, free-throw shooting not a strong suit for you guys. How much
does that concern you going up to a Virginia Tech team where Buzz tries to go
out of points to the line?  
GREG GARD: Them trying to get points at the line and us shooting free throws
are two opposite things though. They don't foul very much and we try not to
foul much each. Specifically, the free throws have been two guys and they
ironically are the two guys that get there the most, Hayes and Happ. They both
have been working on it all year. Hopefully we've seen some progression in a
positive way, in the last week, more in game environments. They've been okay
during the year in the practice environment. It's been the game environment
where we haven't been able to capitalize on it.  
  
So, mainly, I want to make sure we're getting there, although I know they
don't foul a whole lot and don't put teams at the line a whole lot and they
try to get there a good bit. You look at -- you analyze numbers going back to
the lady behind you's question, about Buzz's analytics, you look at free-throw
attempts and those type of things. Numbers are similar in terms of the amount
of times they try to get there. Albeit, it's different, maybe a different
method to do it, but still trying to get the same result of making more free
throws than the opponent attempts.  
  
Speaking of '95, that team made 200 more free throws than the opponent
attempted which may be a record. Hence, why they went 31-0. They were pretty
good at getting to the line and converting there. So, yeah, that's just what
we're -- we'll try to get there as hopefully as we can. Hopefully Ethan and
Nigel can get in a rhythm and get some confidence going in a live environment.  
  
Q. Coach, we wish you best of luck in the late game tomorrow against
Virginia Tech.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Nathan Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33043)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We are joined the Bucknell university head coach Nathan
Davis. Coach, welcome to Buffalo. Glad you're here safely. Getting ready to
play West Virginia in our second game tomorrow. Go ahead and raise your hand
if you have questions for Coach Davis at this time. We'll get a microphone you
to.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. When you took over this program, could you talk maybe
about the junior class, and was there a buy-in period and what you've been
able to do and seen them maybe grow in these two years?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Well, I think I was very fortunate. Typically you don't take
over a program that's in such great shape. What Coach Paulsen had done prior
to me getting there, we had a group of guys that wanted to be good and were
expecting to win and wanted to be coach. I think the junior class has been a
big part of why we've had success. I think their buy-in and belief in what
we're doing kind of brought everyone one else along with them.  
  
They've been completely about the team winning. They haven't worried about
individual success, people that got it, when your best guys are doing that,
it's hard for anyone else to do anything different.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the match-ups and
how you think your team matches up with West Virginia?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Do I have to? No, I think that obviously, they're a very
talented team. Coach Huggins is a Hall of Fame type coach for a reason because
he does a great job. His guys really compete at a high level. They play hard.
They're unselfish, they're relentless at both ends of the floor. We have our
work cut out for us. I have a lot of confidence in our guys' ability and what
we're capable of doing. And we're going to go out there and give them
everything we have.  
  
It's certainly going to be a challenge. They're very long and athletic. We
can't simulate the way they play with the guys we have. We've done the best we
can, but there will be an adjustment period as the game gets started and we
get used to the length in athleticism. But I think that when all is said and
done, we'll be to compete at a pretty high level.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a couple of common opponents. Do you go back and watch
those films as part of your scout, and what did you -- it did you see the
press early when scouting them originally, Mount St. Mary's and such?  
NATHAN DAVIS: We look to some of those, but we looked more at some of the
recent games and then more of some of the mid-majors they play later in the
year to see what they did differently against some of those teams. Obviously,
Jamion Christian at Mount St. Marys is a good friend of mine. We worked at
Bucknell together and have know each other a long and have talked to each
other about it. But at the same time, that was a long time ago. They've
adjusted and developed as the years went on, and they're doing some things a
little differently. We focused more on the recent stuff than what we were
doing back in November.  
  
Q. Along those lines, when you're -- West Virginia's first in turnovers.
How do you go about planning, or trying to get your guys ready for a team that
has that kind of pressure and that kind of defense?  
NATHAN DAVIS: There's a lot of sleepless nights. No. I think that -- again, we
don't have the same saga, that we can simulate what they're doing. We can kind
of show them and watch a lot of film and try to get them to understand our
concepts, but some of it, there's just no way for us to simulate it. So it
will be on the fly, when they get in those games.  
  
The good thing is, we play a lot of good teams with good size and good
athleticism. So our guys should have a good feel for what that's like. West
Virginia plays a lot different than a lot of other teams. Really outside of a
couple teams we played in the last couple years, they're very different in
style of play from what some other teams are. So there's going to be an
adjustment period. I think we've got bright guys. I think they've got a good
idea about what to expect and we'll go out there and do the best we can.  
  
Q. Coach, from Sunday until now is obviously not a lot of prep time. Can
you change anything to really take advantage of things that you see on film,
like, say, attacking the press or attacking their defense, or do you really
have to stick a lot more to your core principles?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think that throughout the year, we've been fortunate -- we've
seen a lot of different styles of play. So, we've had to deal with the press.
We've had to deal with half court, we've dealt with zone. We've seen it all.
It's more of just trying to refine it or make slight adjustments based on what
we think is going to be different. You said you don't have time to go back and
reinvent the wheel. It's about taking what we do and what we do well to trying
to adjust and take advantage of some opportunities.  
  
Q. I guess along the same line of questioning, what is it about a Bob
Huggins' team that is renowned for its pressure defense, but the way they're
scoring, what added dimension does the -- you know, and challenge does this
team present?  
NATHAN DAVIS: I think you say Coach Huggins is not good, he's great at his
job. So they're well-prepared. They are disciplined. They really compete at a
high level, so you've got to understand it's going to be about you competing
at that same level or at your best for 40 minutes. And that's what we're
trying to do all year. It's really nothing new we're trying to do, but it's
definitely going to be a big part of what is going on.  
  
Q. Couple questions. One, West Virginia is obviously a team that got
upset in the first round last year, so I'm just kind of wondering, did you
even look at that game or bring it up to your players? Is it a factor a year
later at all on number two. The three-point shot how much of an equalizer can
it be for tomorrow?  
NATHAN DAVIS: First of all, we know from experience that what happened last
year doesn't matter this year. We got upset in the first round of our league
tournament as the No. 1 seed last year. That has little impact, if any, impact
on what happens this year. I don't think their experience lat year will have
much impact what happens tomorrow.  
  
Three-point shot is one of those things that can be an equalizer, but it's
about getting good ones. We don't want to chuck them up to just chuck them up.
We want to make sure we're getting them inside out and our feet are set. We
have guys that are capable of making shots from a lot of different areas. As
long as they're good ones.  
  
And that's part of the big challenge with they way they play, not just not
turning it over, but playing at a pace you're comfortable with, so when you
get those shots you're in a position to knock them down.  
  
Q. Okay. Not seeing any other questions, Coach, we appreciate your time.
Good luck tomorrow against West Virginia?  
NATHAN DAVIS: Thank you.

### [Eljah Long](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33078)

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are joined by student-athletes from Mount St. Mary's,
right to left. Elijah Long, Junior Robinson, Chris Wray. It's been quite a
long 48 hours. We'll open up to questions for these gentlemen right now.  
  
Q. Chris, can you describe what that moment was like when you grabbed
that ball at the end of the game last night?  
CHRIS WRAY: I think the word was necessary. It was necessary. Like we talked
about, in moments like that, especially in March, if a team gets a hand on the
ball, more times than not, it actually goes in. A heave, a throw, anything, so
it was just necessary to get the ball.  
  
Q. For those of us who have not seen a lot of Mount St. Mary's
basketball, for any of the three of you, how would you describe the way you
play and what was the key to your success in the tournament run and last
night?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I think we just cause a lot of chaos on the court. We play
really fast, really hectic. We take a lot of threes and defend the three well.
So our success is just playing, being able to play together, and our love for
the game.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: Definitely, a little word that Coach always says is "mayhem," and
it's like a controlled chaos, and it's just trying to turn the ball -- turn
the other team over a lot. Just fast breaks, a lot of fast breaks, alley-oop
dunks, and just being able to play off each other's energy.  
  
Q. Just for any of you guys, what have the last 24 to 48 hours been like
from playing, you know, a thrilling game in the NCAA Tournament to traveling
here and getting ready to face the overall top seed?  
CHRIS WRAY: As far as traveling, we've done this in the non-conference. We had
a long, three-week trip, so as far as the traveling part, we're used to it. We
just try to keep the same mentality of one game at a time, regardless of what
game it is, whether it's conference, nonconference, tournament, and now NCAA
Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Junior?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Like he said, we had that three-week trip where we played I
don't know how many games in how many days. But -- so we're used to it. It was
pretty hectic. It was kind of fun, too. Now we get to come and play another
game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Junior, you talked about it's kind of controlled chaos. How does that
style fit your style of play?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Just really fast. I mean, we don't really play -- we play
controlled, but we play really fast and sometimes too fast. But we just find a
way to stay -- keep our control and stay calm.  
  
Q. Does it suit your personal style, though?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Oh, yeah, it does. I like playing fast. I like a lot of
threes, I like dunks, and we do a lot of that. So it fits my style perfectly.  
  
Q. Junior, I guess you've had your share of doubters in your career.
What have people said since you've come on the scene now, and obviously, are a
pretty good player. What have you thought about all of the doubting you've
received over your career and how have you handled that mentally?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I've embraced it. It's kind of like a chip on my shoulder to
prove people wrong that height really doesn't matter. It's about the heart
that you have and the passion that you played the game with. I mean, each
game, I'm going to probably be the shortest player on the court. Actually, I'm
going to be the shortest player on the court.  
  
So, I just have to come out -- I just come out and play my hardest and play
with the heart that I have for the love of the game and for the love of my
brothers.  
  
Q. Just wondering, I mean, it's not just playing a one seed, but, you
know, like many people, I'm wondering if you guys were actually watching last
year that championship game and Nova winning it and knowing what it's like
from then to now and knowing you're playing in the NCAA Tournament.  
ELIJAH LONG: Yeah. I think someone asked a similar question yesterday about
that. And I don't think any of us on the team would have guessed that we're
going to play Villanova, you know what I mean? But it is March Madness. It's a
humbling experience, but then again, they're just human beings just like us.
We're just going to go out there and play.  
  
The one thing that they do well on a consistent basis is play hard. I don't
think they ever take a possession off defensively or offensively, so we've
just got to match that intensity and you never know what could happen at the
end.  
  
Q. Quick question for Eli. Eli, you are the first Canadian player in
Mount St. Mary's history, and here we are playing in Buffalo where you get to
play so close to home. What is that like for you?  
ELIJAH LONG: It's funny because I put in a group for tickets and there's
supposed to be 26 of my family members come up, but I didn't get all those
tickets. I only have nine, so only nine people can come up. But other than
that, though, it's amazing, because my parents don't get to see me to play in
person a lot. They're always in Canada. Sometimes they can't cross the border
or they're just busy. So when moments like this come along, and I can play an
hour away from my house, it's surreal. I thank God for it. God always has a
plan, so, it's a humbling experience.  
  
Q. For Junior, Muggsy Bogues talked a lot about watching you last night
and being really impressed with what he saw. Has you heard any of his comments
and how neat is that to kind of put yourself on the national stage a little
bit and to get some of that recognition?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Well, I haven't heard that. That's the first I heard it, so
thanks for telling me. It's an honor, because he's a Hall-of-Famer. It's a
great feeling to be recognized just because I'm short and doing things that
nobody thought I could do.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up for Elijah. You talked a little bit about growing up
just an hour from here. Did you ever make trips to Buffalo as a kid or
anything like that?  
ELIJAH LONG: Yeah. I had -- one of my basically family friends, he played for
a Buffalo team in New York, so I made trips up there to see him. Other than
that, the only time I travelled to Buffalo is to get airports, because they're
cheap, the flights are cheap. I would drive here, past the border to catch a
flight, to go to either my high school or back to the Mount.  
  
Q. Chris, you guys always talked about being locked in. Did you get a
chance to enjoy the win or straight to ill Nova and being knock locked in and
ready to play tomorrow?  
CHRIS WRAY: I mean, we definitely get a chance to enjoy it. We talked about
this, and we're just enjoying the whole ride as a whole. You have to take in
everything for each experience. I feel for us to enjoy it and look back at
later on, we have to focus at what we have at hand. You don't want to look
back at it to say you celebrated too early when you have a lot more in you.  
  
Q. What are you guys most excited about or looking forward to when you
play against Villanova tomorrow night?  
THE MODERATOR: Pardon me?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: Any of us can answer?  
  
Q. What are you most excited about or looking forward to?  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody in particular?  
  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I think it's going to be a hard-fought game. We're go
together make it a grind-it-out game. We have to come out and try to compete
with them at the highest level that we can compete at.  
  
ELIJAH LONG: One thing I'm looking forward to is to see, not only about what's
going to happen tomorrow, but what we're going to have in the future for next
year, you know? It's going to battle-test us and get us ready for not only
tomorrow, but in the future for next year, whatever that is. Because that's a
great team, so, I think it's preparing us now for, you know, not only the
weeks ahead of us but months, and probably hopefully years ahead of us for the
team that we have now.  
  
Q. For anybody, did any of you see video or anything of Kris Jenkins
winning shot last year and have you had a chance to watch him on TV this year,
knowing that Jenkins is back and Josh Hart who's a National Player of the Year
candidate is also on their team?  
CHRIS WRAY: I'm pretty sure everybody watched the game. I mean I was -- I'm
pretty hyped about it. I just love basketball all together, just watching the
game, seeing Marcus Paige make that shot before, and then seeing that, it's
good for the game of basketball. Overall, I can't really say I watched too
many of the games this year, because I've been focusing on what we've been
doing. We have done our scouting, in preparation for the game.  
  
Q. For any of the guys, 16 has never beaten a 1. I'm sure you know that.
Do you have a mentality? Hey, why not us?  
JUNIOR ROBINSON: I mean, records are meant to be broken, and we have the
confidence going into this game, that if we take care of things the way we're
supposed to and handle ourselves in the manner that we can, why not?  
  
CHRIS WRAY: I just want to state, everything to gain and nothing to lose.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Not seeing any, guys, good luck, first
game tonight against Villanova. Appreciate you being here. Thank you. Oh, I
wanted to introduce Mark Vandegrift, athletic communications, Mount St.
Mary's. He can assist you with any other needs you have with their team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mount St. Mary's head coach, Jamion Christian.
Coach, congratulations on a first-round win. Welcome to Buffalo. Great to have
you here. We'll go ahead and open up for questions at this time. We'll get
started right in the center here.  
  
Q. Jamion, you're facing the second very fast turnaround for the week.
Can you talk about the turnaround, having a day to prepare for it?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: First of all, I think our travel couldn't have been more
smooth getting here. Buffalo, everything was great for us when we got here.
We're excited for the opportunity to be here. When you're playing great games
like this in great environments, your enthusiasm has to carry you. We've had
an enthusiastic bunch, an enthusiastic group all season long. So the first
thing is we're really excited about being here.  
  
There are always a lot challenges in every opponent you're going to play.
Villanova is an excellent team. They've been excellent program for 50 years.
They've been really good and they've been on this stage more often than us.
The biggest challenge starts with their personnel, just the professionalism
that they live with every single day. We've got to do a great job of making
sure we understand their personnel really well. Just understanding, we have to
go out and be us, play our game. There's five guys on the floor. Ball's going
to jump up. The team that plays the best on any given day has an opportunity
to win.  
  
Q. Are you able to play freely now, as a 16-seed going against the one?
Is all of the pressure off of you?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I don't really acknowledge pressure. I think pressure is
what you put on yourself every single day. We've tried to do a great job of
doing that in practice every single day. So I don't know if that really exists
in our world. You know, we're going to go play freely because that's how we
play.  
  
I have such a great belief in the guys we have on our roster. We've challenged
ourselves to the highest levels we could this season playing six NCAA
Tournament teams, playing on the road against some of the very best. You have
to believe at some point that your preparation has you ready for the moment.  
  
Q. How different does this feel being here now doing, this as opposed to
that First Four, and do you feel like this is a different level, getting
here?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: You know, no. I think it's a tournament setting. I think the
NCAA does a great job making sure they're positioning teams to feel as
comfortable as possible, and with the short turnaround we had before, I think
we're really well-prepared for what we need to do. We had a short turnaround
for the University of New Orleans, and we've got an even shorter turnaround
for Villanova. So I think we feel pretty good on the stage where we're
sitting.  
  
Q. Coach. Jim Phelan is a native Philadelphian, coached at Mount St.
Mary's for many years. Did you play for him first of all?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I did. I played for Coach for three years.  
  
Q. What did you learn from him and how have you applied his teachings to
your coaching style now?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I think the first thing I learned is you've got to have
really good players and good guards. I believe he was there for 49 years, but
I forced him into retirement. Let's make sure you have good players that
allows you to be a really good coach. One thing Coach Phalen was always great
with is he always gave his guards a ton of freedom. Every day we came into
practice and did very similar things. But it was all about being free and
allowing the guys to play with a lot of confidence.  
  
Hopefully one day we can go watch our team play, they see his resemblance on
our teams because I think our team really try to play that way. We try to take
outside shots when they're there. We try to play unselfish when the moment
calls for it and we try to play really stingy defenses. I think when you see
-- if anyone remember's Coach Phelan's teams playing, 830 victories, his teams
did those things really well.  
  
Q. You preach being locked in. How long did you let the guys enjoy last
night's win and when did sort of the focus become all about Villanova?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: We've got just an amazing group of guys. We're excited for
the country to see these guys get on this stage and perform. They really
enjoyed it in the locker room and they were excited about the opportunity in
the locker room. But about ten minutes being in there, they started settling
in and asking questions about Villanova and started eagerly asking questions
about when they can watch film and start preparing.  
  
They set a goal for themselves. They'll continue to stay focused and locked in
to try and achieve that goal. Our group is different. They enjoyed it for
about ten minutes, I would say, and they really reset pretty quickly and are
ready for the next challenge.  
  
Q. Junior Robinson hit big shots last night. He got that neat note about
him being the shortest player in the NCAA right now. What should the country
know about him and what makes him special as a person, as a player, that type
of thing?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I don't think he's one of the shortest guys. I think he's
one of the best guards and people really got a chance to notice that. Our back
court is exceptional with Elijah Long and Junior Robinson. I think people are
really going to start to get a chance to see two of these guys play together
in a fashion that you don't get a chance to see very often.  
  
Elijah got in foul trouble last night so was not able to fully be out there
the entire time. I think these two guys in the back court can be as good as
anyone. And on any given night, they can play with anyone. Junior has a
tremendous heart, has a tremendous passion for winning, tremendous passion for
his teammates. His spontaneity allows him the chance to make big plays and
he's done that for us not just this year but in the years past.  
  
What the country needs to know about him is he's got incredible heart, he's
got incredible passion, and he's going to try to attack every moment out
there. They are really going to really enjoy watching him play.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could talk about your style of play offensively, and
then your style of play defensively in terms of man-to-man zone, just to learn
a little bit more about what you guys do at both ends?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Yeah. We're going to play -- on the defense we're going to
play predominantly man-to-man. We have some zone stuff in there. But I just
feel like real men play man-to-man defense. We're going to play man-to-man,
and if something happens miraculous and we have to go to a zone, we will. But
we're going to do a great job as we can to just try to stay man-to-man. We've
done a great job of that all season long against many opponents.  
  
Even in nonconference against that tough schedule, our man-to-man defense was
very good. Iowa State went below one point per possession and they're one of
the best offensive teams in the country. I have a lot of confidence in our
team defensively.  
  
Offensively we're going to try to spread you out. We play a couple different
styles. We'll play two post guys some with the opportunity to ball screen you
and throw the ball to the low post and attack from there. But predominantly
the game we'll play with four guards out, very similar to Villanova. We're
going to space the floor our. We're going to shoot 24 to 25 threes a night. We
shot those at 36% this past year which is a pretty high percentage. We going
to try to space you out and make outside shots.  
  
That's going to open the floor for Elijah Long and Junior Robinson to get to
the rim. If they're able to do that, and we're able to make about 15 threes
tomorrow night, it will be a good day.  
  
Q. In follow-up to that, what would you say overall are the two, three,
biggest strengths to the ball club and what areas have you struggled most with
an area that needed to get better as the year involved much?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Our versatility, I think, on our roster. We have a lot of
guys that can guard a lot of different positions and a lot of guys that can
handle. A lot of times we're able to put defense in tough predicaments on
offense because Chris Wray played point guard in high school so essentially
he's a third or fourth ball handler on the floor for us, who can make plays
and decisions for us.  
  
That's one of the biggest trends is our versatility. Again a lot of guys that
can shoot the ball from the outside and a lot of guys that can get the ball to
the right guys. Defensively, I think what we had to work on most was really
just learning how to play with physicality, just being able to rebound the
basketball. We're still a very young team. That kind of comes and goes with
young teams, but we've done a good job of that as of late, over the last
month, being able to rebound the basketball and finding enough ways to make
some tough plays.  
  
Q. Two questions. One, what is the biggest concern about Villanova and,
number two, did you ever feel at the beginning of the season you have a shot
at the defending National Champ?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Biggest concern, really, Villanova, just how well they play.
They are as connected as a program, not just a team, as I've ever seen.
Everything they do from practice to the game carries over. They just do a
tremendous job of playing together and carrying over the things that they work
on, and that's always a big struggle for a coach is trying to get his team to
be able to do that.  
  
Coach Wright did an unbelievable job of getting that group of guys there to
buy into what he's trying to do, and he's been able to do that great with
those guys. What was the second question?  
  
Q. Having a chance at National Championship?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: It's always a tremendous opportunity. That's one of the
biggest things. When that ball goes up tomorrow, it won't matter if they're
National Champions or not. That's the reality of it. The team that puts
together the best game plan and the team that follows it best will have the
best opportunity to win. They've done that 30-plus times this year. That's the
challenge that it is.  
  
Tomorrow is a new day. The ball will go up. We'll have an opportunity to play
against one of the best. We will consider ourselves one of the best. There's
65, 64 teams left in the tournament. 64 teams still have a chance to win a
national title. I would consider our team as good as any.  
  
Q. Coach Christian, I know that many of these Villanova players come
from the D.C./Baltimore area. That's the predominant area you recruit from as
well. You knew them on the recruiting trail before they were Wildcats. What
was it like facing guys that you've seen grow not only in your own program but
within theirs?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Josh Hart and Kris Jenkins, I had a chance to watch these
guys play for a long, long time just being in the D.C. area. Josh I know a
little better than Kris. Josh, I had a chance to watch him really grow up from
a person getting adjusted at Sidwell Friends School to the person he is now as
one of the best players in the country. One thing that's really exciting for
me -- I've always known him to be one of the best people I've ever had a
chance to recruit and get to know.  
  
One of the best things to me being a guy from a distance is getting a chance
to watch the country get to know him and what an amazing person he is. He's a
guy that's really created his own destiny on this thing. He not only worked on
his game, but he's worked on himself personally and he's really turned himself
into an unbelievable person. I'm looking forward to continue to root for him
after this, but tomorrow we're obviously going to be on different sides of the
coin.  
  
Q. You mentioned your nonconference schedule pretty challenging, how
does that prepare you for tomorrow night?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Well, we're going to play against a team that's complete on
all ends. When we played that nonconference schedule we had to do that,
playing six teams in the NCAA Tournament, I think eight teams that were in
there in their championship games and then a Texas Arlington team that lost in
their semi-final.  
  
I feel like to be at your best, you have to challenge yourself against the
best. You have to look in the mirror and see where you're weakest at against
the very best. If you do that against anyone else, you're kind of short-
changing us. So I think it helps us to understand what we need to do. I think
the fact we've been in a lot of games is a big strength for us. Understanding
the level of physicality, understanding the level of execution you've got to
have, understanding how fast you've got to get back in transition, because
those all change depending on the level that you're at. I think that's the big
strength of our team, just having -- the fact that we've had to do it time and
time again and we've got experience doing it.  
  
Q. What does this mean for you, this tournament. What does it mean for
you in the program and how is the program going to be able succeed and
capitalize on being part of the field?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: We got a tremendous basketball tradition here at Mount St.
Mary's. As mentioned before, Coach Jim Phalen coached here for 49 years. He is
in the College Basketball Hall of Fame, made it to 30 wins. We're all
continuing on a legacy that's pretty large.  
  
I always consider our tradition way more like Carolina and Kentucky because
it's an older tradition. It's been around for a long time. A lot of home games
are filled with people who came to Mount games as children and now their
children come, so on and so forth. So you don't see that in many places around
the country. A lot of places have new traditions.  
  
We have a old tradition that expects our basketball program to be good and
loves to support our basketball program. It starts there, and I think moving
forward, anytime you have a chance to play on the biggest stage against the
best teams, you get a chance to show how much progress your program is making,
and tomorrow is an opportunity to show how much progress we've made since the
last time we were here in 2008 when they played North Carolina.  
  
So that's going to be exciting for us, and we'll be able to continue on with
the great tradition we have, partly because we've got great players in our
program now, and continue to recruit well and and this can only help us
continue to recruit well and bring in quality guys that can make our product
better.  
  
Q. Having already been on the big stage last night, how does that help
you go nothing tomorrow night?  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: I feel like settling down is important in any tournament
setting. I think that's really important to be able to do. It's just being
able to -- to understand like the bounce of the ball is a little bit
different, the neutral site is a little bit different. We should be pretty
comfortable with that. The only issue, really, is that Villanova has all of
those guys back basically from last year, and they played pretty well in the
last tournament. So they're going to be pretty settled as well.  
  
I looks for two teams here -- usually you have a lot of turnovers early in the
game. I think both teams will be pretty settled in pretty early on. I look for
it to be a pretty competitive team throughout.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other question. All right, Coach, congratulations on
getting here, and good luck tomorrow.  
  
JAMION CHRISTIAN: Thanks so much.

_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning, everybody, welcome to the Key Bank Center in
Buffalo, New York for the second round of the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We have with us student-athletes from Princeton, from the far side, Devin
Cannady, Steven Cook, Myles Stephens, and Spencer Weisz. Please silence your
cell phones if you have them with you, we would ask that you raise your hand.
We'll get a microphone to you, please wait for the microphone to get you to.  
  
Please state your name and your affiliation. If you could, please direct your
questions to a specific student-athletes. That's helpful and you are allowed
one follow-up question after your original question if you have one.  
  
With that being said, we'll go ahead and get started. Please raise your hand
if you have a question for Princeton student-athletes.  
  
Q. Devin, just your thoughts on going up against your hometown team, and
how close you were to playing against your former teammate, Demetrius
Jackson.  
DEVIN CANNADY: First off, it's an honor to be here and represent the Ivy
League. I know my teammates and I are really excited to play and for me,
especially, I'm looking forward to playing against some of my friends, you
know, V.J. Beachem and I have a close relationship. I play summer basketball
with these guys, so, I live right down the road. So it will be interesting. It
will be really fun for me.  
  
Q. What are some of your emotions? Is this a -- because of the set-up
and who you're playing, is there a little bit more emotion involved with it?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yeah. I think there is. But, you know, when we get on the court
tomorrow, there's going to be high emotions, but my teammates and I are going
to be looking forward to tipping off and playing some good basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Which of you guys have mid-terms that you have to take today? You do,
Spencer?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I do, at 4:30.  
  
Q. What's your schedule like today? Can you describe in terms of -- are
you rushing to study hall after practice?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Focus is on the game. You only go to the NCAA Tournament so
many times in your life. While there will be studying done, most of the
studying will be done of Notre Dame and their scouting report and what the
coaches are giving us and focusing on executing tomorrow at 12:15.  
  
Q. What can you tell me about Professor Gene Grossman?  
SPENCER WEISZ: He's unbelievable. Unbelievable adviser to all of us. Always
wanting to help. Unbelievable person as well.  
  
Q. This is also for Spencer, kind of a follow-up on the mid-term thing,
how much more difficult or challenging has it been, given the fact that they
-- you know, you're coming off the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, and how
much of a juggling act has it been given that fact?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Certainly it's tough, but at the end of the day, that's what we
signed up for. Coming to Princeton University, we know we have to balance
academics as well as athletics. Certainly the stage has risen a bit, but,
nonetheless, we've been balancing both our whole lives, and this is no
different.  
  
Q. Simple question, Spencer, what is the mid-term in?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Business Leadership.  
  
Q. And are you prepared?  
SPENCER WEISZ: Hopefully. We'll see later today.  
  
Q. So, most of you guys, I'm sure, are familiar with snow. Have you ever
seen anything like this? It's like a blizzard outside.  
THE MODERATOR: Myles, you want to take it?  
  
MYLES STEPHENS: We got here Monday night and it was snowing, and we woke up
this morning and it was still snowing, and it hasn't stopped since. I've been
telling the guys on the bus, I can't believe we're driving on these roads that
aren't being plowed. I guess they just don't care here. The drivers must be
really good. But I think it's crazy. I mean, we're here, and we're here to
play basketball, so --  
  
THE MODERATOR: Lots of practice?  
  
MYLES STEPHENS: Lots of practice and driving.  
  
STEVEN COOK: Devin and I are from the midwest, so we're used to this. Maybe
the Jersey folks are less used to it. But yeah, we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Spencer, you said you had a mid-term. How many more of your teammates
also have them?  
SPENCER WEISZ: I'm sure everyone does. We're in the middle of mid-term week,
so whether we're getting proctored today, sometime earlier this week, I'm sure
we're all swamped. Nonetheless the focus is tomorrow at 12:15.  
  
Q. Do any of you other fellows have tests going on this week?  
MYLES STEPHENS: I had a mid-term today. I got it rescheduled until after the
game, so I still have some studying to do. But focusing on the game, first and
foremost.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on the difficulty of studying for two different
types of tests, game and academically?  
MYLES STEPHENS: I'm going to echo what Spencer said. We signed up for this and
we've been doing this for a while. We know what we have to do on and off the
court. I think we -- at this point in the season, and in our career, we've
become pretty good at juggling academics and athletics, so it's just like
another day on the job. I guess the stage is a little bigger, but that's what
we do, so --  
  
Q. This is for Devin. Now you're half a year removed from your trip to
Tanzania, what was the impact of you on that trip and what -- is there some
things you miss about it, food or something else like that?  
DEVIN CANNADY: Yeah. It was a very special trip. I was blessed to have the
opportunity to go over there and do two semesters of studying and prepare
myself. The whole reason for me going was to lighten my schedule for my
sophomore spring. The goal at the beginning of the year was make this
tournament, and so -- in terms of mid-terms, I have a little lighter load. And
looking back, that was the start of it, so, I had some really -- I had a
really good opportunity to meet some amazing people in Tanzania.  
  
One of my friends was actually the national team captain, Merji Mujicat
(phonetic). He is in the States right now. He wished me good luck. I have a
lot of support to people back there reaching out to me on Instagram. Being
able to touch a lot of their lives through basketball and my time over there.
The food was great. It was really cheap compared to what we have in the
States. I miss that, but there are some good relationships I've built, and I'm
looking forward to going back sometime in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Princeton student-athletes?  
  
Q. You know, for any one of you, maybe Spencer, just what can you -- how
would you characterize Coach's offensive philosophy, because a lot is made of
the Princeton, quote, unquote, offense, which isn't really what it was, but
what can you say about some principles about his offensive philosophy.  
SPENCER WEISZ: Versatile. Everyone in the offense needs to be able to dribble,
shoot, pass. It's part of the player, I guess, that Princeton looks for
nowadays, but nonetheless, it's less read and react. It's really just playing.  
  
You know, we're always going up and down during practice, getting after it,
but as much as people want to talk about our offense, it's really been our
defense that's carried us all year. Offense is -- has been there for quite
some time, but our defense was lacking. This year we really stepped up on our
defensive end, and that's a big reason why we're here today. We're playing the
game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else want to talk about what you are doing offensively?  
  
STEVEN COOK: Yeah. I think it's definitely a lot less structured than it was
in the past. When you think of the Princeton offense, you think of sort of
rigid structured decisions. You go back-door when this happens and you come
around other times. The thing that we really appreciate is Coach is giving us
a lot of freedom in the offense, just sort of read and react and do what we
want when we see something on the court, and I think that's really benefited
us this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. If not, Princeton will be tipping
off against Notre Dame 12:15 tomorrow. Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck
tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

### [Stephen Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33044)

### [Zach Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33045)

### [Nana Foulland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33046)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We are joined by Bucknell University student-athletes.
From right to left. Stephen Brown, Nana Foulland and Zach Thomas. Same rules
apply. Please silence your cell phones. Raise your hand if you have a
question, we'll get a microphone you to. Please wait for the mike to get
there.  
  
Please give your name and your affiliation and if possible, please direct your
question to which student-athletes you would like to answer. We'll go ahead
and get started and we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. Hi, guys. I guess first of all, welcome to Buffalo. And just
obviously the snow here has been a story. I just wonder if you guys -- how
your trip was here and your travel here and what that process was like for you
guys?  
ZACH THOMAS: It was good. Took us a little longer than normal obviously, but
we had a nice little police escort going for us, so, you know, we got here
safely and it was good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else want to add to that?  
  
STEPHEN BROWN: Not really.  
  
Q. I know you're used to snow, so it's nothing new.  
ZACH THOMAS: We got a lot down in Lewisburg too. We avoided a little more
actually coming up here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go in the back there.  
  
Q. Stephen, have you faced anyone this year, pressures like you've seen,
what West Virginia does on film, and do you adjust anything, in the way that
you play, or do you anticipate that when you're going to be seeing them
tomorrow?  
STEPHEN BROWN: Yeah. I mean, early on in the year, we played a couple teams
that pressured, played Manhattan. Mount St. Mary's who also pressured a little
bit and a couple in in our league pressured here and there.  
  
Then what we do with that, guys get open, make outlets, just being smart with
the ball, looking for outlets and the coaches do a really good job of
preparing us. Just looking at film, looking at different options that other
teams have done successfully against a team that also pressures. So, going
into it, I think, we're really prepared for what they have for us, knowing
about their pressure, and also experiencing pressure early on this season, I
think also helps, too.  
  
Q. What's the biggest progression you think you've made as a team this
year, starting the beginning of the season until now?  
STEPHEN BROWN: I think the biggest progression for us this year has been
defensively. Since our class has been here, we kind of struggled defensively
in the half court. I think we did a really good job focusing on the defensive
end, helping out, and we have Nana inside, both Nana and Zach inside. Huge
presence in communicating. I think all of the guys did a really good job of
knowing their roles and knowing their spots, and the coaches have done a
really good job of helping us, figuring out what to do on defense, and, you
know, just being more scrappy, I think, this year. And, you know, just
guarding our guy, guarding our ball, guarding ball screens, so we done a
really good job on that, focusing on that, and it really helped us in the
season.  
  
Q. Question for Nana. I'm just kind of wondering, just from doing some
research, you seemed like you're a guy that kind of progressed late in high
school, kind of came on late, and then your game has obviously continued to
progress at Bucknell, and, you know, winning Player of the Year, Defensive
Player of the Year. I wonder if you can kind of talk about your progression
and how you've helped into the player that you have at Bucknell?  
NANA FOULLAND: Well, in high school, I was playing behind Donovon Jack, who
went to Penn State, played with Penn State. And I didn't get a lot of time,
because I was playing behind him, and also my game wasn't as well-developed
yet. I just kept working hard, and eventually I was able to play my junior and
senior year of high school, and I was able to get scholarship offers. And
Bucknell being one of the, of course, I committed here and just kept work
ethic. Didn't want to waiver, so just kept working hard, working hard, and I
guess here I am now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Reminding you're allowed to one follow-up question as well.  
  
Q. Yeah, for Nana and Zach. Just wondering what you're expecting from
West Virginia, West Virginia's defense? What are you expecting? Are you
expecting it to be rough or what?  
ZACH THOMAS: Yeah, I mean, we know that they love to press. They force the
most turnovers in the country. We know that. We also know they have big guys
that are strong and physical inside, which is -- playing bigger teams like
this is not the same as when we play league play. Our nonconference schedule I
think prepared us for that.  
  
So, you know, we know it's going to be a physical game, but we've been
practicing all week, preparing for it, and hopefully that will help us out and
come game time, we'll be ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nana, anything to add?  
  
NANA FOULLAND: No. I agree with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Always a good answer. Other questions for Bucknell student-
athletes? Okay. Not seeing any more, I will remind you that Jon Terry is the
sports information director, right over here on my left, your right, who is
here and can help you with any other need you have for Bucknell. Gentlemen,
appreciate your time, best of luck tomorrow against West Virginia. And
Bucknell head coach Nathan Davis will be up at 12:20.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Before we get started with head coach Mike Brey, I want to note
Alan Wasielewski from Notre Dame the sports information staff is here to help
you with any other needs you have with Notre Dame student-athletes or coaches.
Before we take questions we'll have an opening statement.  
  
MIKE BREY: I love Lake effect. I live in Lake effect in South Bend. This is no
different than a January game, January night, in South Bend, Indiana. But it
never gets old. Just thrilled to be part of the Tournament. I think we got
some rest since playing the night shift in Brooklyn and excited to play a very
good Princeton team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Brey?  
  
Q. Mike, could you just give us a brief recap of where Bonzie is with
the -- Bonzie Colson with the injury?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah. He's much better, Tim. We had some swelling on Saturday and
Sunday -- Sunday and Monday, I should say, and it's come down a lot. He's made
great progress, doing a little bit more every day. You know, I think by noon
tomorrow, he's one of those guys, he's such a warrior, that you tape him, you
give him a couple Advil, and cut him loose.  
  
Q. What's your greatest concern or concerns with Princeton?  
MIKE BREY: Well, they're so efficient offensively, I think the three-point
line is your major concern, you know? 45 percent of their shots are from the
arc, and they're really efficient, can really shoot it from out there. Chasing
people off the arc. Now, that's something we've been pretty good at this year,
taking away the arc and getting out. I think we're third or fourth in the ACC
in three-point field-goal percentage defense. But I think that's a key and
then keeping them off the foul line.  
  
Q. Yeah, Coach, two questions on Matt Farrell. People have compared his
demeanor to Bobby Hurley's demeanor. Could you speak to that? Secondly, I read
where Hurley called you during the recruiting process. What was behind that.
Why did he call? Was it a Jersey thing? His dad or what?  
MIKE BREY: Well, the demeanor and the edge are the same. It's that I-95, New
Jersey edge that both of them have. Actually, obviously, I know Bobby well,
recruited him. He tried to recruit him for her at U.B., I believe, at the time
and knew him and called me, actually the day I was going down to watch him. He
said Coach, I usually don't get involved. He said, I just love him. He kind of
made a comment, he remind he's of myself. I said, well this evaluation is now
over, I know what to do. I think he's better than Hurley because he shoots it
better. He shoots it better than Hurley.  
  
Q. Better overall?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. He's not First Team All American?  
MIKE BREY: I think he's a better player than Hurley, because he shoots it
better.  
  
Q. In some ways, do you feel Bonzie kind of epitomizes your whole
program? I was asking, you guys always fly under the radar. You fly under the
radar. Bonzie flies under the radar. Are you all one and the same?  
MIKE BREY: We must need to hire a new marketing department. Why are we always
flying under the radar? We've pretty darn good. Bonz has been that undersized
guy that when he was being recruited, no one was sure, is he going to be big
enough? Is he productive enough? He probably does epitomize who we've been.
Harangody was in that line. You covered him closely when we were in the Big
East. We had a lot of guys like that. Bonz, he's a good front cover guy for
that.  
  
Q. I know you said you're familiar with Lake-effect snow, but you also
have a connection to Buffalo with your son playing football at U.B.?  
MIKE BREY: Big time.  
  
Q. How much time did you spend here and what was your are experience
like?  
MIKE BREY: I still have an open bar tab at the Marriott Amherst. I'm going to
have to clear that from 2008. 2008 MAC champs, baby. My son had a fabulous
experience at U.B. They won the MAC. As much -- as many big games and exciting
games as I've been part of -- and tomorrow will be one -- there's nothing like
watching your son play and watching him play a MAC championship in Ford Field
back in 2008. He gave us the scouting report on the steakhouse last night, but
a lot of great memories here at Buffalo and of U.B.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, he just got a job in a high school in North Carolina.
What's that like for you?  
MIKE BREY: He's a head coach now. He's saying he's all fired up. They're ready
to go. They're moving to Charlotte. He did the college thing; he's going to do
the high school thing. I'm kind of his agent. He would be pretty good back at
U.B. someday. He'd be pretty good in about six or seven years back at U.B.
Let's talk U.B. football, not basketball. Let's talk MAC champs 2008.  
  
Q. I was wondering and watching tape on Princeton, if you see a little
bit of yourself?  
MIKE BREY: Absolutely. Absolutely. One thing I said to our guys right after
the selection show, I said, it's like guarding ourselves every day. You know?
They don't turn it over; we don't turn it over. They don't miss free throws;
we don't miss free throws. They can shoot it from the arc, and they know how
to play and know who they are. It's very, very similar. A coach very familiar
with them said to me, they're smart and they're tough, like you. And it really
is. And again, they've gotten away from just the pure Princeton offense.
They're flowing a little bit more, which is how we played at Notre Dame. They
still have Princeton tendencies, but they are a little more -- they are not
married to the predictable movement every time down.  
  
Two very similar basketball teams, efficient and smart and know who they are
and old. But here's the difference. Now I know why Mitch Henderson looks so
dang healthy. He hasn't lost since December 22nd. I mean, that's really good
for your blood pressure in this business. He has not lost since December. What
is that like? You go through two months and you don't lose? Must be nice.  
  
Q. You talked a little about this Sunday night after the selection, but
going back to the Princeton offense, I mean, it used to be like way back in
the day, it would be like playing a real unusual team, but now, I mean, it's
sort of -- everybody sort of coopted a little bit the spacing and shooting.
Could you comment on that, and do they have more back-cuts still than other
teams?  
MIKE BREY: They still cut. They still really go without it in back-cut. I
think the tendencies are all there, that's drilled into you in the Princeton
stuff, and these kids ran pure Princeton as young guys. I think it's really
interesting and brilliant what Mitch has done to get away from it, just, you
know, that structure every possession, and open the floor up a little bit and
play. And, you know, that's kind of how we built our program. If you recruit
high basketball IQ guys, you can give them some freedom to play and I think
Mitch has done a fabulous job. I also think he's one of the bright young
coaches in our profession. He's really gifted.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Brey? If not, Coach, good luck
tomorrow.  
  
MIKE BREY: Who are we? Remember that cheer?  
  
THE MODERATOR: U.B.  
  
MIKE BREY: I remember that cheer, baby whoo hoo!

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BUFFALO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BUFFALO)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

### [Steve Vasturia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28640)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Buffalo, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Now joined by Notre Dame student-athletes to my far
right, senior, V.J. Beachem; senior, Matt Farrell, and senior, Steve Vasturia.
Same rules apply. We'll get a microphone to ask these gentlemen your
questions. We'll go ahead and open for questions now.  
  
Q. If I could trouble all of you guys, actually. Every year this team
gets here and every year everyone seems a little surprised. I think Coach Brey
flies way under the radar as a coach of prominence. Why do you think that is
and what do you think he does for this program?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think it start off with the fact that lot of people think of
Notre Dame as a football school. And then secondly, playing in the ACC, you
hear about a lot of coaches in ACC. Coach Brey has done, not only the last few
years, but throughout his entire time at the University of Notre Dame, he's
been probably the most successful coach in the state of Indiana by far. A lot
of things that he's done really fly under the radar, because we were in the
Big East and now being in the ACC.  
  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah. I think it speaks volumes of the culture that he's been
able to build at Notre Dame, and the guys that he's been able to recruit and
guys that we've had in the past. I think he's done an incredible job just
getting wins, and then playing well in big games. He's just a very fun guy to
play for, creates a good environment for us and we just have a lot of fun
playing for him.  
  
STEVE VASTURIA: Agree with both what they said. Coach does a great job getting
guys who buy in to what he's teaching. We always have seniors and juniors
playing a lot of minute, us three have been fortunate enough to play behind
some really good players and learn from them. I believe Coach Brey has done an
unbelievable job and is one of the best coaches in the country. And I think
we've just got to continue to keep winning, and he'll get some of that credit.  
  
Q. This is for everyone. Obviously, Princeton is on your mind now, but
just looking ahead, I know, having the defending champs staring down at you on
the other side, any extra excitement of the possibility of getting to face
them early on in this?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think right now, obviously, you know, we know the way this
tournament works. Our focus is on Princeton. You really don't want to look
past that. They are a really good team and we're going to have to play really
well for 40 minutes on both ends of the floor to move on.  
  
Q. You just kind of talked about it and this is for anybody. 12-5,
historically, there is an upset in the tournament seems like every year. How
do you make sure you're not on the wrong side of that upset and you don't move
forward and took ahead like Tom just asked?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I think the number one thing is treating every opponent with
respect regardless of our seed or their seed or anything like that. You know,
I think a lot of people were talking about our seed on Sunday when it came
out, as far as the 12-5 match-up. But behind closed doors, we aren't worried
about that at all. We just want to go out there and play our game regardless
of who we're playing against regardless, when it is, and wherever it is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions?  
  
Q. Question for Steve. You mentioned the whole idea of ACC and how it's
so strong. You guys have that four-game losing streak there in the middle. How
do you keep things in perspective when you're playing in such a tough
conference like that?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah. I think I mentioned before, we have a lot of older guys
who have been through a long conference season, and, you know, playing in the
ACC, you're going to face some adversity. We got off to a great start. We won
our first five games, but the way the league is, you're going to run into some
bumps along the way. And I think the great thing about this team, you know,
the guys up here, and Bonzie and the other guys who play, we never lost
confidence. We knew we had to kind of keep plugging, and after that losing
streak, we had a home game, and once we got a win, we kind of got it rolling
from there. So just never losing confidence. I think that starts with Coach
Brey and the way he keeps us ready, allows us to play loose, and all we
needed, I think, was one win to get back on track.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 72, Arkansas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel very fortunate. I even told Mike that we were awfully
lucky. I think we were. I thought the moon and the stars weren't aligned
properly, the shot clock was winding down and they make a 3 over a good
defense.  
  
But inside the four-minute TV timeout, I think, it was 3:47 to play, I told
our guys we hadn't won one like this all year long. That would be great for
us. We've got to be tough. It's gotta be with our brain and our heart both.
We've gotta get stops and we've got to get shots.  
  
And Joel got fouled when it was 55-60 and made two free throws, cut it 55-62
and then we got a stop. And then we come down and C.B. McGrath, one of my
assistants, had made a suggestion earlier, and I'd remembered what he said. So
when we had a stoppage of play for something I told him, next time we run
secondary -- run secondary break slip, and that's when Isaiah got the basket
made it 65-64.  
  
Then we get a stop down there and Isaiah gets fouled, and goes to the free-
throw line with a 1-1 and makes two big free throws. And then we get another
stop and we come down and I thought Joel got fouled. I'm sure Mike thought
that Joel fouled. But he throws -- gets it up on the board and Kennedy tips it
in, and that gave us 3 and then we got another stop, and I think Isaiah made a
couple of free throws again to make it five.  
  
We had some fouls to waste. The last play of the game, we were actually trying
to foul when we came up with the steal when Justin got the layup there.  
  
But two things enter my mind. One, what I just talked about, is how tough and
how focused we were to go 12-0. And I don't mind saying, too, we were awfully
lucky. But I thought we were very unluckily there in a stretch. But to go 12-0
-- and the other thing is the little rascal over there.  
  
I wasn't sure when I went to bed last night that he would play today. And the
first thing I thought of when I woke up this morning was wondering how he
felt. You can look at his stat sheet. It doesn't look great when you're
2-for-13, but he's a tough little nut out there today and helped us in every
way possible. The ball didn't go in the basket for him. But I thought he was
something.  
  
And Kennedy with 11 rebounds, and I think -- that said in the locker room that
gave him over a thousand rebounds for a career, can't say anything negative
about anybody on my team. I love the way they competed and feels awfully nice
right now. And I don't mind saying I feel a little lucky. Every now and then I
knock in a long putt, too.  
  
Q. Kennedy, would you ask Coach Williams --  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm doing this for a reason. Seriously. I've known you a
hundred years, but think of this; they're sweaty and smelly. They need to get
in there and shower. I'm not showering. I'll remember your question, too.  
  
Q. Joel, you talked a lot about getting back to the championship game
getting redemption. During a large stretch of that second half where it looked
like you guys might not get out of here, what clicked in those last four
minutes, especially defensively? What changed this game?  
JOEL BERRY II: Well, you know when Coach is talking, I try to do my best to
try to remember what he says. And I remember, if I'm not mistaken, we had our
scout and our meeting room. He told us what we're going to do is we're going
to get a stop and then we're going to go down and score, and get a stop and go
down and score, and we're going to get a stop and go down and score.  
  
That's what we did that last three minutes. We went 12-0 and that's exactly
what he said. And I just told my teammates to believe, and believe that we
were going to win the game. That's why I got it tattooed on the inside of my
arm, that's what you gotta do is believe. Coach said the same thing. That's
what we did the last four minutes.  
  
Sometimes you need games like that. And that's what Coach said -- we haven't
had a game like that in a while. Now we know that we can win a game when we're
down five, with three minutes to go.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, Daryl Macon obviously was big off the bench, 19
points, then he cramped up. What did you think of his play? When he had to
leave there for several minutes how do you think that impacted Arkansas?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think he did a great job getting his shot off. I know he drew
a couple fouls from the 3-point line, and kind of got him going. And Coach
mentioned he had scored like 10 points in three and a half minutes or
something like that.  
  
So he was definitely one of the guys we wanted to contain the best way we
could. And when he got out of the game I think they kind of didn't have that
3-point threat, I guess, you could say. Because he does great creating the
shot like that. So I think together for us as Carolina, we came together at
the end of the game, and we really did a great job of getting stops.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Just picking up what he said, we just did a great job at the
end of defending. He came back in. And I think we did a good job of containing
him. One time he came off a ball screen and Kennedy got up, and just had a
hand up. And he ended up shooting an air ball.  
  
So I think towards the end we dug in and we knew that he was hot and that he
was capable of hitting the 3. So we just tried to take away that. And the
easiest thing is just deny him the ball, to not let him get it. And I think we
did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Either of you guys, the last 2:56, I think, it was you guys went on a
12-0 run. It appeared that happened at the same time that the Tar Heel fans in
the crowd woke up. Did you feel any extra energy from the crowd in the last
three minutes of the game?  
JOEL BERRY II: Our crowd got into it, but it's because we changed our play,
and they saw us digging in on the defensive end. They were just behind us.
They've done a great job of supporting us this year. Even though we're in
South Carolina, you know, they all came out. And I think once they saw us
digging in on the defensive end and playing better, I mean, they got involved.  
  
I mean, it's hard to get involved when the team's not playing well. So, like
Coach said, we played better and they got involved and it helped us out and it
pushed us through.  
  
Q. Either of the players, Coach used the word fortune and lucky a few
times. Do you guys feel fortunate and lucky to still be alive?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I definitely think we feel blessed because of how hard we
worked. I think Coach pushes us every day in practice, especially on the
defensive end to get better and better each time. And we have a drill. I mean,
86-80, we're down three points and you gotta find a way to -- yeah, three
minutes and you're down six. What did I say?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: You said 86-80, down three. He's better in math than that.
It's 86-80, we're down with three minutes to play.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: So I think that's what definitely came into play today and we
did a tremendous job of remembering the things that we do in practice to
capitalize on those opportunities.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: The last seven possessions we scored six times. The last seven
possessions they didn't score. So that's some toughness there, too. I'll still
say I feel lucky. But you know what? Luck is -- what's that old saying --
preparation meets opportunity. And the guys stepped up and made some plays
too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have anything to add to that?  
  
JOEL BERRY II: No ma'am.  
  
Q. Joel, just a quick question here. The last few games have not been
your best shooting performances of the season. Are you thinking about doing
anything differently in preparation for the Sweet 16?  
JOEL BERRY II: Definitely not. I mean, sometimes the ball doesn't go in.
Sometimes it does. And I felt like I started out the game, I mean, I hit two
3s in the first half but it just wasn't falling for me. But way back early in
the season when I had that bad game at Miami, you know, Coach told me, don't
let the ball going in dictate how you're playing.  
  
So I just tried to help my team out in different ways. I mean, I had assists.
I was trying to dig in on the defensive end, and I just took that lesson and I
just, I learned from it. And that's what I'm trying to do.  
  
And it helped us today. I mean, it just wasn't falling for me, but I felt like
for myself I helped my team out in a different way.  
  
Q. The two players, your defense changed dramatically in the last four
minutes. Is it the fact of looking at the scoreboard saying, hey, this doesn't
change our season any? How do you explain the defense going from what it was
for large sections of that game to the way you played in the last three and a
half minutes?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think we just dictated what we wanted them to do instead of
letting them attack us and doing what they want them to do. I think in those
three minutes we forced them into bad shots. The shot clock got down late. And
they just took bad shots.  
  
And, I mean, we're capable of playing great defense like that. But sometimes
we just take plays off. But this isn't the time to do that. But that last
three or four minutes we did a good job of just digging in and just realizing,
you know, winner stays and the loser goes home.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Do I have anything to add? No, ma'am, I do not. (Laughter).  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Isn't life great when you win?  
  
Q. Kennedy and Joel, can you both describe whatever that was that, Joel,
it was your shot, and then Kennedy's tip-in that was key there, late?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think Joel showed a great deal of savvy for trying to get the
ball to the goal, because he knew me and Isaiah would be on the offensive
glass. I just so happened to be in the right position. And Coach always tells
us, when the shot goes up to try to get in front of the defender and you have
an easier rebound. So that's what I did. And the ball just fell in my hands.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, it was a horrible shot on my part, but I just tried my
best to get it up on the backboard and just so happened Kennedy was there to
make up for it, so I've got to thank him for that.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Joel said he meant to pass it that way. They didn't give him
the assist, though.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Roy, Theo was saying in the locker room that the team learned that it
can win this type of game and hadn't been in a game like that where it needed
to do that. What are those lessons that you learn from your team when you win
a game like that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think it gives you confidence, first. I think it also
teaches you to play every single possession. I told them don't look at the
score, just play every possession. Let's get the best shot we can get. Let's
get a stop on the defensive end and let's do it again.  
  
And I did, I pushed a little bit. I was a little fired up about being
involved. You lose yourself in the game. There's so much time to play. And,
again, I think it was 3:47, you guys may have a play-by-play, I think it was
3:47 on the clock when we had the timeout. But I think you gain so much from
that because the more you focus, the more you concentrate, the harder you
play, good things are going to happen to you.  
  
And then, again, we got good shots except for that one possession. And we work
on tips every other practice. We've done it 46 times this year because we've
had 92 practices.  
  
And Kennedy could have caught it with both hands. It would have made me feel a
heck of a lot better if he hadn't just tipped it with his left hand but it
went in.  
  
Q. We hear a lot about Joel Berry and Justin Jackson and their
leadership on this team. But Kennedy Meeks has come up big. Can you talk about
his leadership and his role on this squad as a leader and senior?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Kennedy does see the big picture. He's very, very bright. I
was very upset with him at half because he had all kinds of shots around the
basket and he was hurrying his shot like he was being intimidated, missing the
easy ones around. So and I jumped him a little bit at that time.  
  
But I thought he did do a better job and was much better defensively for us in
the second half, particularly the last three or four minutes. But when you
think about it having over a thousand rebounds in your career, he's been a
big-time player for us for a long time.  
  
Q. I was wondering what you thought of Macon's play. I guess he cramped
up and had to leave for several minutes. Maybe how you think that impacted the
game when he had to go out?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The guys said it well. He was hurting us. He made ten points
in three possessions. He made the 3 right in front of me. He got fouled
because we didn't get him picked up. We had a mistake on the matchups. Then
Kennedy fouled him and he made three. And then Kennedy didn't get up to him
and he made three. So he scored ten points on three possessions.  
  
So we talked at halftime, he had 12 points but we gave 10 of them on three
possessions. We needed to get up to him, and you can't allow somebody to jump
up and shoot it in your face. And you can't foul if a guy is shooting a
3-point shot.  
  
I noticed he was out at that point. I didn't know he was cramping up or
anything like that. But I think that -- early I think he made two or three
baskets, the first four or five minutes of the second half, too. So late he
didn't make much. And that was probably because of his legs.  
  
And for us I can't worry about somebody else's problems, because I was worried
about Joel Berry going 2-for-13 because he didn't have his legs under him
either. But it was big for us that he got hurt.  
  
Q. In the first half you shot 43 percent from the 3 and second 14.3
percent. What led to that change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Neither one of them are very good. 4-for-10 is not what we say
-- if we could do that and make it 8-for-20, I'd take it. But you've got to
credit Arkansas' defense. I think they were the dominating factor until the
last four minutes of the game. To me I think their defense was stronger than
their offense. They got us rushing shots.  
  
We had a couple of wide open there. I thought Justin missed a wide-open one
from the corner. Then they go down and make a 3 immediately. So we missed some
but we made some too. As a matter of fact I was looking, it says that Nate
Britt was 0-for-2. I thought he made a 3 from the far corner, but I guess it
was a 2.  
  
Q. The defense the last three and a half minutes, what did you see as
kind of what changed your defense? Was it just because you guys finally
realized the season was on the line?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No we were more active. We did a better job of screen on the
ball. The big guy was getting up there. We did a better job getting over the
screen. Mike knows this better than I do because I don't coach his team. Maybe
they got a little conservative and then when the shot clock's winding down,
then all of a sudden the shots get to be more difficult.  
  
And we did have -- I don't think anybody had a wide-open shot in the last four
minutes. Every shot they took was challenged. I thought they went to the
monitor to see if we had partially blocked that when it went out, but Kennedy
said he didn't touch it and it went out. Okay. Guys, thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Chris Silva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33266)

### [Duane Notice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26630)

### [Sindarius Thornwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26685)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 88, Duke - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
COACH MARTIN: Unbelievably proud of my guys. You know, they put up with me,
which is not easy to do. And they've become mentally tough, as mentally tough
can be. For us to be able to play against a team like Duke and play so well on
the big stage says a lot about the character of our team.  
  
I've got unbelievable respect for Duke, for Coach K, for how they play, for
what he's done for the game. I've told him this in private: He impacted a
young high school coach who was the son of Cuban immigrants to want to do this
for a career. And it's an unbelievable moment for me personally. But so proud
of these guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you could each take a turn, as it got down to the final minutes,
did you ever allow yourself to think that you were moving on or was it just
about the next possession, next play?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Next play. The game still wasn't over. As long as there's
time is still on the clock the game is not over. We play to the 00:00. The
whole time as the time was winding down was to finish the game, one possession
at a time, just finish the game and make our free throws.  
  
DUANE NOTICE: Like Sindarius said, with the time on the clock felt like an
eternity was going by. We wanted to make sure we stuck to our principles and
we kept our composure. The coaches did a good job to make sure our emotions
didn't get too high.  
  
CHRIS SILVA: Like Sindarius and Duane said, when the game was going on, if the
clock wasn't over, the game wasn't over. So we was focusing on making our free
throws and following the game play.  
  
Q. Sindarius, what changed after going, like, shooting, like, 2-out-
of-22 to the end of the first half, and then score points 65 in the second
half? What clicked for you guys?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We just made shots. Got the ball inside. Chris did a
great job of just posting up and we just fed him. And he played good for us
the second half. Chris was the difference in the second half. He showed up big
time for us.  
  
Q. Sindarius, the other night you set up here and talked about how much
it meant just to win a game in this tournament for this program and this
university. Now that you're going to the Sweet 16, how does that advance what
you guys want to do with this program?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We're not satisfied with just winning one game or this
game. We're in it; why not win it? Why not us? We feel like we can compete
with anybody in the country.  
  
And the goal is not just to win one game or, you know, just to win two games,
the goal is always to win it all. If you win it, why not win it all? And
that's our ultimate goal.  
  
Q. Duane, what can you say about the pressure that you guys put on them?
18 turnovers, I think, and did you see them getting rattled by that?  
DUANE NOTICE: That's just something that we've been doing all year. Playing
under our coach, he does a great job, tremendous job making sure we understand
that defense is our focal point.  
  
And we don't want to let our foot off the gas. When it comes to our defense,
we want to make sure we get into people and pressure them. So when our
defensive intensity is up, it translates to the offensive end.  
  
Q. Chris, can you talk about your second half? Sindarius said he thought
you were the difference. What was the second half like for you? What was
different for you in the second half?  
CHRIS SILVA: Like Sindarius said, I was just posting up. They fed me the ball.
I was making the move and attacking the basket. I was posting up. They did a
great job finding me and giving me the ball, and I was just making a play to
the basket.  
  
Q. Sindarius and Duane, could you both talk about what Felder has given
you the last two games, what he's been contributing?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: He's big. He has the heart of a giant. He doesn't care
who we're playing. He doesn't care how big the guy is, whatever the guy, the
athlete, the guy have or nothing, he just have a heart that he won't stop. He
won't stop. He won't back down for nobody. And for him to be a freshman and to
give us that spark off the bench is tremendous. And he plays a big part of our
team.  
  
DUANE NOTICE: Like Sindarius said, Ra is a guy, he's very confident. He's
electric. It's kind of radiating through the team when he's confident we're
all confident. It's big for him to come into these big stages as a freshman
and play on both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Sindarius, do you guys have to convince yourselves you could win this
game? What was the mindset to get into a positive frame of mind when people
were saying you couldn't win, couldn't win?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We wasn't paying no attention. The whole time we felt
like we can win. The only people that mattered is the people in our circle,
the people that's at practice with us, the people that's been with us from the
jump. They've seen us grind, that's been through everything we've been through
in the season.  
  
Those are the only people that matter, that's the coaches and us players. We
just try to stay with each other and focus with what we have, and nobody else
really matters.  
  
Q. When the brackets first came out, you guys are now advancing, when
the brackets came out everybody was talking about Duke and Villanova regional
at the Garden. A few teams crashed that party. How do you feel about being one
of those teams?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It's big. We are just having fun. We was just happy to be
in the tournament. It didn't matter who we played or anything. We just
celebrate -- we're enjoying the moment and just going out and giving it our
all every game and controlling what we're controlling. And it's our defense
and everything else. Didn't matter who we played. We're just going out and
competing and giving everybody our best shot.  
  
Q. Sindarius, how easy or difficult will it be to try to keep this even-
keeled approach going to the next round, going to the garden to play Baylor?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It's going to be hard. It's one more thing we can to add
on the list that the school hasn't done. But we'll be all right. The coaching
staff is going to do a good job of keeping us level headed, keeping our
composure down and keeping us focused on the task at hand.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Martin.  
  
Q. Coach, Rakym had such a big impact in today's game. And his season
numbers, he had some good games but obviously didn't put up numbers like this.
Why did you trust him so much in tonight's game, and what kind of season has
he had overall?  
COACH MARTIN: For a freshman point guard, he's been phenomenal. He's been a
spark off the bench for us all year. We've won games because he comes in there
and he's aggressive and, like the guys said, he's fearless of the moment. He
loves the big stage.  
  
I needed a New York City point guard. I like New York City guards. That's why
I went and found Rakym. We're lucky he has family in our state. This was his
dream school. Recruiting him might be the easiest recruiting job I've ever
been a part of, the easiest.  
  
And he's become like a son to us, the coaches. He's like a little brother to
Sindarius and PJ. You learn a lot about your freshmen the way your seniors
helped them. Our seniors go out of their way to help him. And it's been like
that from day one. So I know our seniors respect him. I know I respect him. He
gets a little immature on us sometimes, but he's a freshman. Heck, when I was
18, I wouldn't be able to handle the moment the way he does, so a lot of
credit to him.  
  
Q. You said it was the easiest recruitment you had why was that?  
COACH MARTIN: It was his dream school. I had one phone call. Committed without
visiting. Unbelievable. Some of these guys you recruit them for three years
and you don't get them. One phone call. That's all it took. And he wanted to
come. I said, whoa, relax I've gotta do a little legwork here.  
  
And he was in from our first conversation. And that's why he's so committed to
what he's doing. In his heart, he wanted to be a Gamecock. There was no
questions asked. And that's why he is so committed and so proud to be playing
at the school that he dreamt of playing growing up.  
  
Q. In the last 10 minutes or so how much did the last five years have
you thought about it and how much you fought to get to this point?  
COACH MARTIN: A lot. A lot. We've got an unbelievable group of seniors. Those
three guys are phenomenal. When they were freshmen -- Bruce Ellington is a
great leader. He wasn't around. And he was with us for like two weeks. And
then declared for the draft, which I told him he had to do.  
  
And no one was there to help those guys. And they had teammates that didn't
want to deal with the difficult practices and they didn't want to deal with
structure and discipline. Didn't believe in what we were trying to convince
them that we can become. Those three guys stood tall every single day.  
  
And that's why I'm not surprised that we played the way we did in the second
half. Those three guys, think about it, a lot of you guys ask me questions
during the year if I was going to sit Duane Notice. You guys happy I didn't
sit him?  
  
Q. Not to put a damper on your game, but this tournament was moved from
North Carolina because of HB2. And as a lot of fans and some players were
entering the arena, they were met with Confederate flags. I wanted to know
what your thoughts on that?  
COACH MARTIN: It's unfortunate, but it's America. And you think we all agree
on everything? Our state is united. Our state believes in peace and harmony.
That's why this event is being held in our state right now. Our state's
progressive. Our state has incredible people that's about moving forward.  
  
But it's America. We have freedoms. People have freedoms to do whatever they
want to do with themselves and their property. It is what it is.  
  
There's things out there that I don't like. But I can't force people to do
what I want them to do. All I know is this unbelievable university and state
has taken in a son of Cuban immigrants that's married to a Jamaican woman, has
mixed kids, and they've treated me like I'm one of their own from day one.  
  
I wouldn't want to coach in any other state or on any other group of people,
for any other bosses than the ones I've got. Our alums, our community is a
beautiful, beautiful place. It's a united state. Unfortunately things like
that happen but we live in the United States of America. And we don't all
agree on things.  
  
Q. You guys shot 71 percent from the floor in the second half, 4-of-5 on
3s, 90-something percent from the line. Where did that kind of offensive
fluidity come from? Have you seen that a lot in practice? Could you see that
kind of shooting?  
COACH MARTIN: You know, you're asking the question so I'm not coming down on
you. I'm tired of answering as to why we don't shoot more. I'm tired of
answering that question. We wouldn't be in the Sweet 16 if we were a bad
offensive team.  
  
Now, do we shoot 71 percent, what did we shoot, 71 for a half? No, nobody
does. But that's why they call this thing March Madness. I was extremely happy
at halftime. I told our guys, someone's gotta have courage and make shots.  
  
Today we settled for some 3s that we didn't need to settle for. We did today.
Yesterday we didn't. Today we did. We stopped that. And we got production from
our big guys at the rim, which then made their defense collapse and allowed us
to then get better looks.  
  
Then, again, we don't shoot -- was it the Alabama game that we were 3-for-30
or something in the one half? Like 71 percent is an abnormality? 3-for-30 is
an abnormality. We're somewhere in there. We're better on defense but we're a
good defensive team. And we play better on offense. That's why we're playing
next week. If not we wouldn't be in this tournament to start with.  
  
Q. Not to go back about your offense again, but you scored seven baskets
in the first half. But you held them to eight. Are you going to the locker
room thinking we've got the tempo and we've got a way we can guard them that
can give us a chance here?  
COACH MARTIN: Our guys were very, very nervous. This is a new platform. It's
the first time in the history of our university that we're going to the Sweet
16. Our guys were nervous to start the game. They were a little too -- I was
nervous for our guys to start the game.  
  
Once the half started to settle down, I was happy with how we were defending.
I thought we shot some quick 3s that we didn't need to shoot. Unlike
yesterday, yesterday I thought we shot good 3s. Today that was not part of
what we were trying to do.  
  
I think at halftime -- we're very positive. You can't have these kids that
have been through what they've been through for four years to build this
program, and go in at halftime and doubt in who they are. We were very
positive at halftime, like we are 99 percent of the time.  
  
And they responded. They came out. We attacked the paint. Duane Notice drove
the ball, got it to the rim. PJ made some shots. And then Ra Felder jumped up
and made that 3, and that made everybody feel better. And Duane makes one and
Sin makes one and everybody felt better.  
  
But at the end of the day, in the second half we didn't pull the trigger on
the 3s and we attacked the rim. And we as coaches kept telling the players,
they're in a little bit of foul trouble; they're attack the rim. They're in
foul trouble.  
  
And I gotta say, you guys have asked about Chris Silva, second half. I'm
harder on Chris Silva than anyone on our team because he can be so good and
he's just learning the game. He played like a grown man in the second half,
not like a little sophomore but a grown man. And a lot of respect for Chris
the way he accepts coaching every single day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jayson Tatum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32867)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 88, Duke - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The very first thing, I want to congratulate Frank and his
team. They played a heck of a game. You know, it's the toughest defense we've
played against all year. Very physical, actually the most physical game we've
been in all year. But that's how hard they play and I thought our kids played
hard, too.  
  
And they played better. But not harder. And I'm proud of my guys. I've loved
-- I've absolutely loved coaching this group. I've never had a year like this.
With all the injuries, with everything, but never a problem with attitude.
These kids have really grown in to be men.  
  
And I wish I could coach them more. I'm glad they became champions last week.
And they were a close-knit group. And they did a hell of a job for us. So I'm
proud of them. I'm just disappointed that we couldn't go further.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Grayson, obviously you guys came into the season with high
expectations, and it hasn't been easy. But what was going through your mind in
the final five minutes there; you guys had so many comebacks in Brooklyn, what
was your mentality there?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I felt like we could come back all the way to the very end of
the game. We've done it so many times before. And so I know all it took was a
few shots and a few stops. But South Carolina, they did a great job of
knocking down their free throws down the stretch. And they kept the game away
from us. And, you know, they didn't turn it over. So it made it tough to come
back.  
  
Q. Grayson, did you guys feel like at halftime that maybe you'd missed
an opportunity because they had shot so poorly and yet it was still a single
digit game?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: We thought we played good defense in the first half. But they
did, too. They're a very good defensive team. So it's not an easy task to
score on them. And that's what allowed them to keep the game closer in the
first half. And that's what really opened it up in the second half for them,
too, is their defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the second half, was it South Carolina making shots, or did you
feel like you guys weren't contesting enough of them?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I thought we were playing our butts off. And it was a real,
we got worn down. It's the most physical game we've been in all year. And then
we were in a lot of foul trouble. So you just try and patch up, put -- I wish
we had some of that tape that doesn't let water into the boat.  
  
And just trying to do anything you can, because the game, the game was very
complex in the second half with the fouls. Again, they had fouls too. I'm just
saying we've played about seven guys and so you're juggling a little bit, just
juggling a little bit.  
  
Q. There's a lot of red eyes in the locker room. What do you say in the
locker room after a stunner like that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Before you were able to come in there, I told them I love
these guys. I'm proud of them. I'm disappointed that we didn't win tonight.
But at the end of the season I want my guys to either be crying because we've
lost or crying because we've just won.  
  
And it shows that if you're not doing one of those, that means you never
really became a team. It was never really that important. And for these guys,
they were a really good team. This is one of the most proud teams for me
because all the stuff.  
  
You all keep talking about expectations. I mean, look, a lot of these kids
were just hurt at the start of the year and whatever. And they never used it
as an excuse. And they became close. And so I just told them -- I told them I
love them and I'm proud of them. I wish I could keep coaching them this year.
But that's not going to happen.  
  
Q. What makes South Carolina so tough defensively? And I guess just what
did they do to you guys on that end that was so hard to deal with?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, first of all, they're well-coached. And they not only
are good technique-wise, but they add heart. They add toughness. They add all
the intangibles that go with great technique. And then they're all committed
to it. And they played it at a high level, and the game was a very physical
game. And they adapted well to it, and we adapted okay to it. Not as well as I
would like.  
  
But they're a terrific defensive team. Frank does a great job with his team.
And whoever he brought in, they're committed to playing that end of the court.
And because of their depth and their age, they're a little bit older, they put
it out there. It's tough to play against, obviously. Tonight it was tough to
play against. And we tried and came close, but we weren't good enough.  
  
One last thing, I'd like to thank the organizing committee, the people of
Greenville for hosting it. It was, wherever you went, people were pleasant.
They were proud to have the NCAA Tournament here. All the volunteers, everyone
greeted you with a smile. They were terrific. And we're very appreciative of
that. And just to say thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Manuale Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33000)

### [Daryl Macon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32967)

### [Moses Kingsley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32991)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 72, Arkansas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: We came to dance, not to do the one step. We wanted to bust up
some brackets here today. Close -- you don't get -- close don't get it done.
But congratulations to North Carolina. They made the plays they had to. They
got to the free-throw line an awful lot of times.  
  
But at the end of the day, I just thought they made more plays than we did. I
thought we had some bad-decision making going down the stretch. And you can
credit that to their defense, but you can also credit it to our guys just
making the wrong decision.  
  
I just thought we ran out of time. Heck of a ballgame. Again, a lot of people
had us even dead and buried in this game here. But these guys here, they're
hurting right now and they're hurting for the right reason. They came in here
to win and move on in the NCAA Tournament. We're disappointed in that.  
  
But I'm so proud of these guys and what they've done this year. Even as we've
come to the conclusion of some of our guys' careers -- Moses, Dusty Hannahs
and of course Manuale Watkins. Those guys have meant a whole lot to our
program. These two guys here, they've been here -- for the two times we've
been in the tournament to play North Carolina. It was a distinct difference
than it was the last time we played. It was a big-time difference.  
  
So congratulations to them. And, but I'm telling these guys here -- Daryl, the
whole team -- I'm real proud of these guys and what they came out and
accomplished this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Daryl, looked like you were cramping up. What was the problem and how
frustrating was that because you obviously had it going? Then you had to sit
out for a while. I assume you weren't 100 percent when you came back in?  
DARYL MACON: It happens. I don't know how I started cramping. It just
happened. I wish I was out there helping my team win. It hurts losing like
this, but it is what it is.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: He played hard. That's why. He played hard. He left his heart
out on the floor. I think that's what causes cramping. We saw a lot of our
guys, they left it out on the floor.  
  
Q. All three guys, you had them 65-60. Did you think you've got them?
And what did you think happened those last about three and a half minutes that
turned it?  
MANUALE WATKINS: I don't think we thought we had them. We just didn't execute
on offense down the stretch. We turned the ball over a few times. And, I mean,
like I said, we just really didn't execute when we had the lead and we made
it, kind of played on our heels a little bit instead of attacking and trying
to score. We just didn't execute down the stretch, and that's on us.  
  
Q. If the other guys can talk about that, too. And Daryl, when you came
back in, you got the ball but they were just swarming you. How tough a
possession was that with about a minute something left? And if Moses could
talk about the end of the game, too.  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Just like Coach said, we didn't execute at the end of the game
and we didn't get some stops that we needed. That's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Daryl, you came back in, but they just swarmed you. You had to kind
of heave up a 3 there with the shot clock running down. What was that
possession like? Obviously a tough deal.  
DARYL MACON: I just dribbled the ball and the shot clock ran down. And I just
had to jack something up just to get it out of my hands. We didn't come out
and execute that possession as well as we have been doing the entire game. So
we have those type of plays. And I just had to get it out of my hands, so I
shot it.  
  
Q. Was Carolina's defense, was their intensity different the last four
minutes of the game? Seemed like they kind of realized their season was there
on the line there late.  
DARYL MACON: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. Do you think Carolina's defense changed the last four, five minutes
of the game? Seemed like they picked up the intensity, were doing things
differently.  
DARYL MACON: No.  
  
MANUALE WATKINS: I mean, I just think it was on us. They're a great team. And
their backs were against the wall. They made the plays to win the game.
They're a 1 seed. They showed it.  
  
But I just think it was we didn't execute. And I mean that's that. We had the
game. We just didn't make the right plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Six minutes to go or so in the first half you guys were down by 14 or
15 points, I believe. And as Coach indicated, a few people I think were
writing you off at that point. What kind of adjustments did you make midstream
there to kind of get back into it and make a game of it?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: We've been down before. We've been down several times during
the season. We've been down the row, 15 in a row, 12 in a row.  
  
So it doesn't matter. The way we play, we're going to get stops and we're
going to score. I feel like that's what happened. Coach put some people out
there that had some energy and we got in our press and we got some steals. And
we had a run. We get some stops and we're going to score. And that's what we
did.  
  
MANUALE WATKINS: Like Mo said, we started playing our brand of basketball. We
got down 16 or whatever it was, and we got some energy guys in there and
started playing real Razorback basketball, real Hog basketball. That's what
got us in the game. We went to what we've been doing all year. We never panic
when we get down.  
  
Q. Manny, two-parter, I thought Beard played his best game in a long
time and Bailey played a lot of minutes. Can you comment on each one of those
guys' contributions tonight?  
MANUALE WATKINS: They came to play. Big stage, they weren't scared, obviously.
They came, gave it all they had, played hard. And I mean that's all you can
say. They just played hard and they're ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Mike, if Daryl doesn't cramp up, do you think that there's a
different outcome? And how much did that impact you guys when he had to come
out there at crunch time?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he played so hard, he just cramped up. That means it's
gotta be somebody else to step up for us. Should've, could've, would've, you
could say it all you want to. But we had some guys out there that could have
made the plays. And unfortunately we didn't make them.  
  
Q. I'm guessing you probably notice that you didn't get in the bonus
during the game.  
COACH ANDERSON: We shot eight free throws. I noticed that. And I don't know if
North Carolina plays good defense, they don't play great defense. They had
three fouls. And we're an attacking team. We were attacking. There were some
opportunities where we were in the fastbreak mode we were attacking, getting
to the basket. But it was called that way and of course our guys gotta play
through that.  
  
Q. Okay. So you did get that far, I kind of figured you would, but what
was your view of the Joel Berry play that ended up with Kennedy Meeks tipping
the ball in?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought he ran over one of our guys. If he didn't, he
traveled. I thought he did the one-step. I couldn't hardly see it.  
  
But I know we had a guy that was in place there. And he tipped it in. I think
that gave them a 3-point lead. I thought we played great defense at that time.  
  
That wasn't the difference in the game. I just thought we had some bad
turnovers at the wrong time or we didn't get a good shot.  
  
And as you said, we didn't even get to the free-throw line -- we weren't even
in 1-1. We had three fouls. And the first one was probably caused in the first
minute of the second half.  
  
So there's a lot of things you can look back and say that. But at the end of
the day they survived and they advanced.  
  
Q. Could you first talk about how you thought Beard played and maybe he
helped with Daryl down a little bit. And then you played Adrio Bailey a lot of
minutes. What went into that? He seemed like he handled it pretty well.  
COACH ANDERSON: Those two guys came in -- and I think somebody was talking
about what took place in that first half, we were down 14.  
  
We put some energy guys in there who were focusing on the defense and really
just disrupting. And we got our fastbreak going and deflecting passes. And all
of a sudden the game sped up, and that's more to our liking. And Adrio was a
part of that.  
  
So we started him off the second half as well. But I thought Beard looked like
the old Beard that helped us out there after leading, calming guys down,
making big plays, just getting dirty. I thought we got dirty. It's just
unfortunate we didn't pull it off.  
  
Q. I guess just you had a great season, tough ending, how would you sum
up the season and maybe look ahead a little bit?  
COACH ANDERSON: It's kind of hard to sum it up right now. I'm really kind of
pissed, no -- I'm kind of not necessarily ticked off, but it's just one of
those things, you had something in your hand and you let it get away.  
  
But I thought these guys gave me everything they had. I mean, when you think
about -- they had a special year. When you're talking about seven guys who
have never donned a Razorback uniform, to come in, mesh in with five or six
guys who were holdovers from last year and to win 26 games, I think the
second-most in the last 20-some-odd years.  
  
And not only that, took probably one of the top teams in the country, led them
for the most part in a game in the NCAA Tournament to go to the Sweet 16.
Playing good basketball.  
  
I thought our defense -- offensively we probably weren't in sync. But I
thought our defense in the second half in this game was outstanding, even the
first half.  
  
We had North Carolina on their heels for the most part. But they did what an
experienced team do: They made the plays going down the stretch.  
  
When you look at our team, we did some of the things that an inexperienced
team does in this format. Because you've got to remember, this is a one-and-
done. It's over with. It's different pressure than the SEC Tournament or a
regular season game.  
  
But these guys here, I'll tell you what, they're a special group. I think the
Razorback Nation, and even the nation got a chance to see them. Because a lot
of people didn't even think we had a chance to come here.  
  
But I beg to differ. I know my guys. I know me. I like to win. So I'm proud of
them for coming out and really just leaving it all on the floor. It was an up-
and-down game. But we just came up a little short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina athletes Kennedy Meeks and Joel
Berry.  
  
Q. You guys are leading the nation in rebounding margin like 13 --
plus-13 or something. But I think Jackson is the only guy average -- no,
Kennedy, I think you're the only one averaging more than six. What's the key
to you guys leading the nation by such a wide margin?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: That's our main goal every game that we go into. We want to win
the rebound margin. I think that's what leads to wins. I think that definitely
gives you another opportunity at getting shots. So that's our main objective
from the big men, especially. And I know we had the 2 and 3 men hitting the
boards also. So we try to use our size to our advantage and fight around the
box-outs.  
  
Q. Kennedy, along those lines, given the pace of play that you guys play
at, does that help the offensive rebounding be so successful, to do it against
a defense that made it not set?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think so. I think it throws the defensive balance off. I
think it kind of puts them on their heels. And Joel is the type of point
guard, Sev and Nate are type of point guards that likes to attack you, so that
definitely opens it up for the rest of your team.  
  
Q. Joel, Arkansas is a team that likes to play fast, they like to press.
Is that kind of playing into your hands with the kind of athletes you have and
the depth you have?  
JOEL BERRY II: Oh definitely. We're a team that, if the other team happened to
score, we try to get the ball out really fast and get it down the court. So
even though they press, I think it plays right into our hands, because if we
can get it out fast where they don't have to, you know, get into their traps
and everything, that helps us out. We can get down the floor, and we had the
guys on the wings that can be able to attack.  
  
Q. Kennedy, I was wondering what you thought about Moses Kingsley? He
had a really big game yesterday against Delgado, who's All-Big East. What do
you think about going against Moses? What you think about him as a player?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: He's a great defender, major key to their team. And our main
objective, of course, is to try to get him out of the game as much as
possible, attacking the ball inside, and it will open the things up for our
guards and Justin and Joel for easy shots.  
  
So, like I said, he's a great shot blocker. I think he's leading the SEC in
shot blocks. So he's got to -- either pump fake or just go right up. So our
main objective tomorrow is to play as aggressive as you can, try to get some
things going for our team.  
  
Q. Joel, less than 24 hours after tweaking the ankle a little bit, I'm
sure it's not 100 percent. How are you feeling?  
JOEL BERRY II: I'm feeling pretty good. I'm walking better than I was
yesterday. I did a lot of treatment today. It's just a little sore. But
overall I feel pretty good.  
  
Q. Kennedy and for Joel, too, do you expect them to continue to play the
way they played? Do you expect them to still press you and to still try to
make an up-tempo game despite the kind of athletes and the way you play?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Yeah, I don't think they ever change their game plan at all. I
mean, they do a great job of trapping. They do a great job of having defensive
balance and their guards are aggressive. So I just think we have to do what we
usually do, which is our press offense and try our hardest to get the ball up
the court as fast as we can so we can get into our half-court offense.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: I'll say the same thing. I mean, pretty much they've been doing
that all year long. And I don't expect them to get to this point and try to
change up what they're doing. So I expect them to stick with their game plan
and continue to do what they do. And we just gotta be ready for it.  
  
Q. Both of you, I think I've got the stat right. The 1 seed is, like,
111-17 in second rounds, so obviously pretty good winning percentage. How do
you all approach that because there's been a few upsets but not many? As a No.
1 seed how do you approach that?  
JOEL BERRY II: We don't pay attention to those stats. I mean, I guess those
stats are for you guys, but for us we've just gotta continue to play. And we
can't look at that and try to say that that will help us win.  
  
But, I mean, we've just gotta continue to do what we do, and we gotta go into
each and every game and just be ready to play. And this one is going to be a
physical and aggressive game. And we just gotta be ready for that.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think we want to go into the game all the time thinking we're
going to win and we're going to be happy at the end result. So, like I said,
our main focus is not to worry about what seed we are, what seed they are
because they're a great team, they're here for a reason. We can't overlook
them at all, and come out with the right mindset and focus on our scouting
report and put everything we have into it.  
  
Q. Joel, knowing what kind of game it is, do you look forward to
tomorrow because you know it's going to be a back-and-forth, up-and-down game?
And what is the key for you guys against their press and their tempo?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yeah, I just think more importantly is just stop them from
scoring. And if we can get some rebounds to where they don't have a chance to
set up for their press, I think that's the first objective.  
  
And then the second one is just getting the ball out fast if they do score. I
mean, this is the kind of game I love. I like getting up and down the court.
And it's going to be a fun game. And it's going to be aggressive.  
  
But I think that we have the team and the guards to be able to withstand their
press. And, like I said, if we could just stop them from scoring and just get
our rebounds and get out on the break, that will play right into our hands.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Coach Williams.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We were very pleased that we're still here, number one, but --
with the way we did a lot of things last night, realizing in the NCAA
Tournament turns around pretty quickly ... doing sign language, I didn't know
if it was a NASCAR or what was going on. I was ready to pit and quit if you
needed me to.  
  
We did feel good about a lot of things last night. Got them something to eat.
Got them to bed and getting ready to practice here. We have no idea if Joel
Berry, what his ankle's going to be like in another 30 hours or whatever it
is. He's not going to practice today. He's been getting treatment. I'm hopeful
that he will play. But just to wait and see.  
  
The bottom line is I can't be Mr. Miyagi, as I said last night, and clap my
hands and rub it make it better. We'll have to see what it's like. It was the
only time I was hoping we played at 1 or 2 and when I got the notice we played
at 6:00, the way I looked at it it's four more hours for Joel to heal. So I'm
hopeful that we'll have him.  
  
Q. Arkansas loves to play fast. They press. Does that work in your
favor, just because of all the athletes, and you guys obviously thrive in the
open court as well?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know if I'd say we thrive because of all those
athletes we have. We're good in a fast pace, which is the way we always play.
The difference is if you play at a fast pace and you turn it over, it's not
good. If we get the shot that we all want and go up and down the court, that
is familiarity for us.  
  
We do want a fast pace. Arkansas wants a fast pace. They really guard the
Dickens out of you in full court. And we try to guard you in half-court
situation. It's a different philosophy there. But we've got to make sure we're
not careless, we're not casual, we're not cool. Those three C words I don't
like at all. If you're careless, casual or cool when you're playing with them,
you're going back home.  
  
Q. How have you seen Justin's role emerge this year, and how has he
taken to that being a leader and a primary scorer on this team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, last spring, after the season was over with, we had
several conversations going through the combine. Had some more conversations.
And we focused on two or three things, and I think he's done a great job with
it. He's really had a better focus, not that it was bad, but he had a better
focus in the weight room. He's bigger, stronger, faster, quicker, all those
things.  
  
His shot is going in this year. So for us, I told him I wanted him to be more
aggressive. We need him to rebound more. We need him to get to the free-throw
a line more. Hadn't got to the free-throw line as much as I think he should
have. And I think a lot of times, because he's got the little floater and
everybody thinks it's okay because he still got the shot off. But I think he's
done a fantastic job for us, understanding that we want him to score and need
him to score.  
  
I think he went through the four-game stretch there at the end of the season
and through the ACC Tournament that he perhaps was trying to do too much or do
what he had been doing but doing it quicker. And so just got to try to get him
to settle down and just be Justin.  
  
Q. You guys are plus-13 something on rebounding margin. What's been the
key to that, because I think you only have one guy averaging more than six
rebounds.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We lost Brice Johnson last year, who was a great rebounder,
led the league in rebound, had 23 rebounds in one game. So from the first day
of practice we emphasized that we've gotta do a great job and rebound the
basketball as a team.  
  
We don't have a natural guy that just goes and the ball finds his hands all
the time, like it did with Brice. We pushed the O in Justin, the three men on
our team, that you've got to be able to go get some rebounds. We talked to
Theo when he's a 2, Kenny Williams when he was a 2 that you've got to go get
some rebounds for us.  
  
Me, personally, for 29 years, I've really thought that that was the single
most important factor in who wins the games. And so I've emphasized it
forever. But we've had a couple of games this year where we didn't rebound it
well and we usually got beat or struggled during those games.  
  
Q. You said you're kind of unsure about the status of Joel for tomorrow
due to his ankle. If he can't go or if his minutes are limited, how does that
change things specifically offensively?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, Nate Britt, Seventh Woods, Stilman White, those guys
have to share the time. None of those guys have done as good a job as Joel,
shooting over 40 percent from the 3-point line.  
  
Nate shot it well last night, I think made two 3s last night, was five assists
on our chart, no turnovers. Stilman can shoot the basketball, Seventh has
tremendous speed and quickness. If I can put all three of them together and
have one player at the end, I wouldn't be that worried.  
  
But Joel has been one of our leaders and not just by scoring or shooting
3-point shots, but the way he plays defense. But we can't go out and draft
anybody. So we've gotta figure out somebody to play.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the game against Arkansas in the second
round in Jacksonville two years ago? And can that be any help in preparing for
this, because they've got pretty much an entirely new team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think it can give you much. Their whole team, look at
their roster, on our scouting report everybody's a junior or senior there.
Been through it. Some of those guys were playing at that time. But most of
them were not, or half and half, probably.  
  
But I know we won. I know it was a very aggressive game. I know I felt going
into the game exactly how I feel right now, that we've got to attack, attack,
attack, under control and not turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Tomorrow, Duke is basically going to play a road game here against
South Carolina because of the HB2 law. If you were in that position, what
would be your reaction to -- because of that law, basically having to play a
road game in the second round as a 1 or 2 seed?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, you know, a lot of times 1 or 2 seeds get to play a home
game, us and Duke both, over the years. I just think it's a terrible law.
That's the worst thing. It's not good for our state. I don't think we should
be happy about it. It's an embarrassment, and those kind of things.  
  
But we've gone on the road, played NCAA Tournament games before. It's part of
it. It's what you do. I think we played Notre Dame at Notre Dame on Saint
Patrick's Day one time, is that right, Artie? You're the only guy in here
older than me. I wore my Masters green jacket just to tick everybody off and
we won (laughter). I'm not a member at Augusta. I just had a jacket like that.  
  
Q. You mentioned Stilman. He's had a very unique career. And obviously
very unique experience in the middle of it. What was it like watching him come
back to basketball? He said he barely touched a ball for two years, and to see
him be part of these teams these last couple of years?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It was. You think about it. You play and all of a sudden
you're thrust into the magnificent spotlight of trying to go to the Sweet 16
with a guy who basically came as a walk-on kind of thing. And he really did a
nice job.  
  
I still say and believe that if we had been able to get to the Final Four it
would have been one of the great stories in North Carolina basketball. Then he
leaves for two years and he comes back and the first year he's back he's
banged up and hurt all year. He had a foot problem while he was gone. It was
still a thing that was bothering him a great deal.  
  
This year he's really been something for us. He's led our scout team, blue
squad, whatever you want to call them. Every day he's been a load for
everybody to handle. And I told him, I said, you may be the only guy I really
have not given enough time for what you deserve. And so one day I asked him, I
said, "Would you rather me praise you a lot like I've been doing, or just give
you more plus points to get you out of sprinting?" And he just looked at me
and said, boy, Coach, that's a hard choice. But he's been fantastic for us.  
  
Q. I'm not old enough to remember when South Carolina was in the ACC.
But with that kind of historical perspective, you're playing an SEC team.
They're SEC fans. You guys are North Carolina; they're South Carolina. Is the
building going to be for or against you in your game tomorrow? What's your gut
feeling?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Oh, I gotta think -- I looked around yesterday, there were a
lot of Carolina blue shirts in there. I think we'll have a decent crowd. I
think we'll have more people cheering for us than perhaps there will be
cheering for Duke in the other game.  
  
Q. When you look at Arkansas's lineup, Moses Kingsley obviously stands
out in the middle. But what have you seen from No. 0, Jaylen Barford, over the
last couple of weeks of season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Jaylen, and I haven't seen much of him. I saw about three
minutes of their game against Kentucky -- I think it was in the tournament;
didn't they play Kentucky in the tournament just last week or the week before
last? I saw three or four minutes of that.  
  
But Jaylen, you know, I know the reputation, No. 1 JUCO player in the country,
all that kind of stuff. He's really got a great ability to get the ball to the
basket and finish. He can go in the medium post and shoot his turnaround
jumper. 6'3", 210, looks like, and looks like he plays even bigger than that.  
  
I think he's been extremely important to them. And he fits into that constant
motion of harassment, havoc kind of mentality that Mike tries to push. He's
been really good for them. He's a load for our guys, I can tell you that.  
  
Q. You mentioned last night how good a job Mike has done with this team.
Can you expand, what he's done well with this team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I've known Michael for a long time. I spent four, five, six
years going to Arkansas playing in the college coaches golf tournaments,
spending time with Nolan and Michael. Nolan has been a good friend, and Rose,
their family, for me for a long time. But Michael coming back and replacing
Nolan -- not replacing him, but that's what everybody thought. There were a
couple of coaches in the middle there, too, I think. But everybody thought
Arkansas basketball is back. And that was a pretty big burden for him to start
with. But he's a guy that just sort of keeps plodding along, plodding along,
plodding along.  
  
He looks more like a sprinter than a marathon guy, but I happen to think he's
a marathon guy who has really stuck to his philosophy, stuck to what he
believes in, the way that he worked with Nolan when Nolan was the head coach.  
  
He's added his own personal traits to it. But I think he's comfortable
coaching that way. And I even saw -- might have been in their media guide
stuff or maybe it's just off the paper -- I guess three or four kids who have
committed to come there next year, all three of them the state of Arkansas.  
  
He talked about that, their pride in Arkansas basketball. And he has a great
deal of pride in Arkansas basketball and just done a great job, I think. Good
guy. Good guy. His wife's a lot nicer than he is. But other than that he's
okay.  
  
Q. I guess, I know you guys have played a lot more tournament games, but
this will be the third straight time Arkansas has been in the tournament and
played North Carolina in the second round. I know you played them when you
were at KU in the Elite Eight, I think it was. What do you think about playing
Arkansas three straight times like this and kind of the North
Carolina/Arkansas, because it's the sixth tournament game between the two
teams?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm not sure about the three -- we played them three straight
ourselves? When did we play them again?  
  
Q. '08, two years ago. They didn't go between '08 and 2015.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Okay. I gotcha.  
  
Q. So they've kind of run into that Carolina Blue law.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We did it with Michigan when I ended up at North Carolina my
last couple of years at Carolina, we played Michigan, we played Michigan, we
played Michigan.  
  
And I went to Kansas and they played Michigan again. That kind of thing. And
couple of years ago we kept playing Kansas in Kansas City and Kansas in St.
Louis. I wanted to play them in North Carolina one time.  
  
But it's weird the way those things happen like that. But, again, I think I'm
right in saying this, Nolan Richardson, his first clinic he did at UTEP after
the passing of his daughter, he asked me if I would go and I went to that just
because it was Nolan. The people in Arkansas they treated me fantastic.  
  
And I was there a lot during those years playing in that golf tournament,
spending time there. Bobby Wilson, you see advertising some weird thing help
your golf game on TV. He was the pro there at Pinnacle. He's the long drive
champion of the world for three, four, five years. And I've known Bobby and
Mr. Hudson and Mr. Hunt, the Walton people, I mean WalMart people, excuse me,
they were always good. And so for me, with Mike, we've been on a lot of trips
together and he's a guy I really enjoy and have a great deal of respect for.
So I don't really look at it as North Carolina/Arkansas. To me it's people I
have a great deal of respect for.  
  
Q. Luke was mentioning South Carolina. What are your memories of those
days when they were just a big a rival as anybody else in the ACC?  
COACH WILLIAMS: In those days big rivalries meant there was a lot more going
on than everybody knew about. Now with social media, if they had things going
on back then, there would have been guys that weren't playing for years or
years or years or coaching for years or years.  
  
It was a fierce rivalry. A very heated rivalry. There was a lot of things
openly said between the two teams and yet you had Frank McGuire and Dean Smith
who had a great deal of respect for each other.  
  
But I was in school at that time. Some of the big-time games, some of the very
violent games, things that went on during those games. I still remember one of
the North Carolina players, and I know who he is, yelled "Contact, contact!"  
  
And everybody stopped -- and I remember the South Carolina player, and I know
who he is, but if you want to find out you've gotta do your homework -- going
out in the middle of the court and stomping his feet trying to smash the
contact.  
  
I mean, that wasn't looked upon as that unusual, that kind of thing. So it was
a big-time rivalry in those days. But Frank Martin has really done a fantastic
job down there. And this place has a chance to be rocking for him tomorrow
night, but they got their hands full.  
  
Q. When you guys are playing well defensively, what are you seeing on
the floor?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I wish I would see a heck of a lot more of it. That's the big
thing I've got. When we're playing well defensively, I think everybody is
really focused, seeing the big picture, knowing what the other team's trying
to do.  
  
And five guys moving together. Every time the ball moves, five individuals
need to move. And for us then you have to finish it with the box-out.  
  
Last night, the ball was shot and one of our guys turned around and looked and
the ball bounced over his head and I turned to the team, "What is it that we
don't understand?" 91 practices, 34 games, and I'm still having to preach
going to box somebody out. So I'd like those ideas of I hope that we have that
scenario tomorrow, when we're playing defense I hope it's out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
Q. Sin, looking at Duke's defense seems to have the same openings that
Marquette's defense has. Is that what you've seen preparing for this game?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We're going to attack them. We went over it, we're about
to go over it in practice. Coach told us a couple of things, a couple of ways
that we're going to attack them. And that's what we're going to focus on when
we go out here for practice after the meeting.  
  
Q. Sindarius, just in terms of playing in your home state, obviously it
was a big thing for the program to get a tournament win last night. But for
you personally, being from South Carolina, being close by and now getting a
chance to get a second win at home with a big crowd, what does that mean to
you? And PJ, too, you guys are two key players both from South Carolina.  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It means a lot, not just for me and PJ but for Justin,
too. We're all from South Carolina, born and raised, grew up. And for us just
to be able to put our state on the map and represent our state just means a
lot for us.  
  
When we first got here the program wasn't in this situation, but now it is.
Just shows that our work is paying off, and that after tomorrow's game
hopefully we can be in a situation where we're celebrating and we won the
game.  
  
Q. How much of a difference did the environment last night make? And do
you expect it to have another home-court feel tomorrow, even though it's
Duke?  
JUSTIN MCKIE: It played a big impact yesterday. The crowd got behind us after
stops and made shots, which kind of helped us pick up our intensity a bit. And
hopefully tomorrow we'll have the same type of energy from the crowd.  
  
Q. Justin, did your dad have any reaction to yesterday's win?  
JUSTIN MCKIE: I mean, he had a normal reaction. He was excited. He was happy.
I talked to him last night. He was excited for the guys. I talked to him this
morning. I think he might come by the hotel and talk to us a little bit, I'm
not sure.  
  
Q. Sindarius, Coach K called you the best, most unheralded player in the
country.  
THE MODERATOR: Most unheralded great player.  
  
Q. Thank you to the proctor for the correction. Your reaction?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: I'm thankful for it. It means a lot coming from probably
one of the greatest coaches, if not the greatest coach that ever coached in
college basketball, just means a lot. But the game's still gotta get played.
And I feel like none of us on our team don't get as much recognition as we
deserve, like Duane, the way he guards the play and the way he plays defense.
PJ, Chris, I think most of the guys on our team that deserves and could get a
lot more credit than what they get.  
  
Q. Sin and Justin, last night you guys said it was the best game you
played all year. Any takeaways from your performance that you think is going
to help you guys perform even better on Sunday against Duke?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Just how aggressive everybody was, the confidence that
everybody played with, starting with PJ, Maik, Justin, Ra, myself -- everybody
that played last night played with a level of confidence that we need from
everybody just to make a run and compete with everybody.  
  
And I feel like if everybody brings that same confidence and that same
attitude to tomorrow's game we'll be able to compete with Duke.  
  
Q. Sindarius, Luke Kennard is a guy who can put up some points. What's
the best way to defend a guy who can get a shot from just about anywhere?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Just make it hard for them. We've got a guy like Luke who
can score multiple ways. We call that level three, that can score at the rim,
mid-range and from the 3-point range. You just gotta make it hard for them and
make them work for every shot.  
  
And the most important thing is make sure he has to guard, too. He can put up
points but I can, too. So when we come down -- when we get the ball he's gotta
guard, too, coming down on the other end.  
  
Q. Sin, you talked about how if you play, you guys played with
confidence yesterday. You played loose. You played without worrying about too
much stuff, just like yourselves. Does the pressure increase a little bit
tomorrow because of what's at stake? Can you guys play still as free and easy
as you did the other night?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: There's no pressure on us. We're going in as the
underdog. So we're still going in with confidence, no pressure and just go in
and have fun and just embracing the moment and just taking it all in and just
giving it all our all and just hopefully at the end of the game we have a
chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Sin, first of five minutes last night you took a lot of 3-pointers,
not a lot were going in. Was it just what Marquette was giving you? Were you
not being as aggressive as you wanted to be? And how much do you want to be
aggressive from the tip tomorrow night?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: I think those shots were good shots. A lot of them came
off drives or kicks, guys helping. When I drove I kicked it out. Guys stepped
in and took shots that just didn't fall.  
  
I think the difference was last night was in the second half we got more paint
touches and the ball came from the paint outside, so it made it a lot easier
and the guys had more time to set their feet and make a shot. So I think
tomorrow's focus is still attack the paint, and when the opportunity comes for
a shot, for us to step up and make our shots.  
  
Q. Sin, what do you do to, as a team leader steady guys? A big emotional
win like that, you've got to turn around and get ready. How do you keep
everybody on an even keel?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It's quick memory. Last night's win doesn't help us with
tomorrow's game. We understand that. We know that last night is over with.
It's in the past and we're moving forward.  
  
Our focus is on Duke. We can't keep celebrating the Marquette win, because if
we celebrate and still thinking about that win then we're not going to be able
to prepare and focus on the next game. And that's our mindset right now is on
Duke and just focusing on them.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about the bench production you guys got in that
first game, you, Ra and others. Everyone contributed. How were the other role
players and bench players, how are you going to carry that over into Duke with
even more confidence or things you guys are able to do in that first-round
game?  
JUSTIN MCKIE: We just gotta come in ready to play. The starting five they'll
do their job like they have all season. And then it's on us to continue to
keep the ball rolling once they come out and we come in -- just gotta play
with confidence, the same level of intensity that we played with yesterday,
and I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Duke is one of those polarizing programs everybody loves or hates.
When you guys were coming up, how did you view Duke? Did you have favorite
players did you follow them at all?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: I was North Carolina. You know how I feel.  
  
JUSTIN MCKIE: I liked Duke when I was younger, but as I got older it was kind
of whatever.  
  
Q. To piggyback that question, are either one of you guys at all aware
of the history between South Carolina and Duke from their ACC days and the
kind of basketball battles they used to have, anything on that?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: No, that was way before our time. Way before our time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening comment.  
  
COACH MARTIN: Watching a lot of film last night, I've come to the conclusion
that Duke's pretty good. So I think they're a well-coached team, too. We've
got a venerable challenge ahead of us and one that we're excited for. They're
playing real good basketball. They're healthy. They got all their parts.
Obviously coach's personality being there every day, again, has kicked in. And
we got our hands full.  
  
Q. It was a year ago that the SEC hired Mike Tranghese as a consultant
to help prop up basketball. Now you've got five teams in the tournament. Four
of them are still going and two of you have a chance to make some noise
against the ACC tomorrow. Do you see your games here in particular as a real
opportunity?  
COACH MARTIN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all of us in the SEC understand that
we're carrying a banner that's a little bigger than just our own schools. We
know we've got a real good league. It's unfortunate that there's been a
message put out there -- I'm not saying our league's better than anybody's.
I've been in other leagues. I comprehend how every league is. But we don't
take a back seat to anybody.  
  
And that's the one good thing that -- I can't speak for the other SEC schools,
I know they feel this way but I don't want to speak for them -- our guys are
battle tested because of the games that we've had to play in our conference.
Playing Vanderbilt, Kentucky, Florida, Arkansas, all them teams, our guys have
been prepared for this moment. And we collectively, the coaches, we're taking
pride in trying to change this whole message about the SEC being inferior to
other leagues.  
  
Q. Just how difficult is it to try to game plan for a team like Duke
with guys who are so big and can play inside and out and don't really stick in
one spot on the floor?  
COACH MARTIN: It's hard. It's the same thing as preparing to play Kentucky. I
mean, you know, trying to play Alabama. I'm not trying to disrespect Duke. I
mean, they've got real good players. Kentucky has real good players. Florida
has real good players. North Carolina has real good players. It's what you
face at this time of year.  
  
And you don't trick your way into the NCAA Tournament. You don't trick your
way into winning in the NCAA Tournament. You earn your way into that. And
Duke's -- Duke is phenomenal. And I'm a huge Mike Krzyzewski fan. I think
we're pretty good too. I like our guys. They've taken me on an unbelievable
ride right now.  
  
Our guys will go out, they're going to do what they've done every game this
year. They're going to lay it on the line. And in the end it's either going to
be good enough or not. And we're excited. We can't wait.  
  
Q. The other day you said if you win Friday night, you'd enjoy it for
about 45 minutes and then go on to the task at hand. Here you are in the
process. How do you get that mindset to work not only for today but for a long
day tomorrow? And what are some of the techniques you can apply to make sure
the guys are ready?  
COACH MARTIN: Guys are fine. There were some people that weren't very happy
when they announced our game time tomorrow. I was ecstatic. I remember in 2010
we played Xavier when I was at Kansas State. I was done with the media -- I
got to the hotel at 2:00 in the morning. It was a double-overtime game. It was
the last game of the night.  
  
We found out right after the game that our Saturday game was going to be the
first one of the day. So we turned around and tipped off at one-something,
2:00 p.m. something, it's the first one of the day. That's kind of 36 hours
later from the time I walked in the hotel until the time we actually tipped
off. And that wasn't very good.  
  
So we've had time to recompose ourselves. We've got time to prepare all day
tomorrow. We've got time all day today. So preparation is not going to be a
problem. We expose our guys to these quick turns during the season on purpose.
Who you're preparing against is what the problem becomes. And our guys will be
prepared. They'll be ready to go. Our guys have shown the ability to prepare
on a quick turn. We've just got to hope that we play real well.  
  
Q. The word "confidence" has come up a lot in the last 24 hours. What
can confidence do and what is it doing for your team, especially in this
setting? And given that win last night, best game of the year for your guys?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't care what walk of life you're in, if you've got no
confidence in what you're doing, you're not going to succeed. And we became a
good team because we got a lot of confidence in who we are, and that didn't
start on Wednesday of this week. That's something that started five years ago.  
  
And a lot of times you don't win a game and the people on the outside think
that your team is not confident. But the way your guys handle that moment lets
you know whether you can have confidence in them or not. Our guys are a
confident group of kids. That's not lacking in who we are. Our guys are
confident.  
  
Once we got past the first eight, ten minutes of the game yesterday, I thought
the nerves kind of went away and everyone focused in on the game itself. And
we eliminated some of the mistakes that we were making. And then we played
with an unbelievable desire that our guys have played with all year.  
  
The difference is that we were able to convert some open-court opportunities.
We were able to make some 3s. Sindarius made a 3 when we needed one. Ra Felder
made a 3 when they were in the middle of a run where they could have flipped
the game again, yet he just jumps up and makes a 3. And I'm sitting there
saying, you talk about confidence? That's a freshman. I'm saying, wow. What
courage to just jump up and shoot that ball, let alone make it.  
  
And it's an unbelievable group of guys. It's an unbelievable group of guys.
And we'll be confident and we'll be ready tomorrow night. That's not going to
be the reason why we succeed or not succeed Sunday night.  
  
Q. When you look at Luke Kennard, a guy who can score in so many ways,
what can you do to try to get him off his game?  
COACH MARTIN: He's a hard guard, man. And they do a great job of putting him
in different actions. They make it hard. They put him in so many different
actions that it's hard to just focus in on one part of the floor.  
  
You gotta have guys that are connected. You can't guard them with one. Gotta
be your team. And it's going to be a hard guard. He's a heck of a player, heck
of a player. And it's not just that he can score; it's that he knows when to
go and not when to go. There's some guys that score, they think they can go
all the time and they end up taking a bunch of bad shots. So they score a lot
of points but they also give you a lot of opportunities, because bad shots,
it's a turnover.  
  
He doesn't take bad shots. He knows when to go and when not to go, very
efficient player. Difficult guard. Difficult guard. We're going to practice
here in a little bit, and we've been studying film. And we're going to have to
do the best we can.  
  
Earlier this year, we had to prepare for a guy named Malik Monk who is pretty
dynamic in his ability to score. And we did a good job at times, but we also
lost him at times. But we've got our hands full with Luke. Studying him all
night last night, I watch him play whenever I can. During conference play it's
hard for me to watch teams from other leagues that we don't play. It's hard
for me to watch them. But I watched him a lot here last night and today. And
he's a hard guard, a heck of a player.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you understood but Brad Underwood was just hired at
Illinois. I didn't know what you had to speak about Brad's job and what you've
seen from this?  
COACH MARTIN: Are you serious? Wow. Wow. I'm -- I'm ecstatic for him. I knew
some things were going on. I'm not talking about Illinois, about where he's
at. I'm ecstatic for him. He spent a lot of time at Western Illinois. So
there's -- I know he and his wife love that part of the country. I'm really,
really happy for him.  
  
Q. I was just talking to a couple of players in the locker room. They
said what makes this team very unique is the chemistry, the amount of belief
they have in each other. They said it started in Costa Rica. How did that trip
help and how do you think it's paying dividends right now, especially as you
get on bigger stages and as the lights get a little bit brighter?  
COACH MARTIN: There's a reason why I didn't coach in practice or games when we
went down to Costa Rica, because I knew we had a lot of new parts, and we had
some guys that needed to put their thumbprint on the program. They needed to
become the new voice.  
  
Michael Carrera was so emotional and so loud with everything he did that he
dominated the personality of the team. I knew that other people needed to kind
of become that voice, that passion. So, I purposely, I didn't do it. Not
because -- some people said, oh, you run your players too much. They hear your
voice; it gets old. I think that's the biggest bunch -- I've never gotten old
of listening to my mother talk to me. I've never understood the whole thought
process that you coach your players too much.  
  
I needed to observe them, so I could see who was signing up for what jobs and
who wanted nothing to do with certain things. I wanted to see how they co-
existed with each other. And when I watched those practices, the first thing I
took away from it is how good a coach Matt Figger is. And the second thing I
took away from it was these guys really want to win, the way they helped each
other, the way they competed with one another, the way the older guys looked
out for the first-year guys.  
  
The first-year guys didn't show up with the answers. On the contrary; they
were listening to the older guys as to how do we do this. And I saw that, and
that's when I said, you know what? We've got a chance. We've got a chance and
it's never stopped.  
  
It's continued to happen and that's a tight-knit group in there, tight, tight
knit group. And that's why we're here. We're not here because we've got a good
player; we're here because we've got a team and they're fun to be around.  
  
Q. What did you think of Silva's play last night and the other bigs? Did
you get out of them what you were hoping for?  
COACH MARTIN: Yes, I thought Kotsar had the best game he's played since who
knows when. Maik had a great week of practice. I told Maik, you scored more in
practice, he was more engaged in plays in our four practices leading into the
NCAA Tournament than he had been in the whole month of February.  
  
I thought Chris was great until he committed those two nonsense fouls in the
second half. He stayed away from those for the most part, and then he commits
those two fouls that just -- I'm out of words. I don't know how to get him to
stop doing that. I really don't. If I did, he wouldn't commit those fouls
anymore.  
  
But I think he's gotten better at it. But then last night, in a three-minute
span he commits three fouls and two of them are, like, nonsense fouls. But I
thought those two guys were a big, big reason why we won. I understand Sin and
PJ were great, and they made the plays that created the stats part of it. I
thought Maik Kotsar's ball-screen defense yesterday was phenomenal. The times
we switched off, his ability to keep little guards in front of him, I thought
he was -- that was a big, big reason we were able to do a better job in the
second half on contesting a 3-point line.  
  
I thought Chris played well until -- you know, Chris and Mike, they're so
young. Chris got embarrassed when he missed that dunk, and he just kind of got
embarrassed. Then he comes out and he commits a foul that's just, it's a bad
foul. But those two guys, Chris was the happiest guy in the locker room after
the game. It's unbelievable. He's a beautiful kid. Beautiful kid.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke student-athletes Grayson Allen and Frank
Jackson.  
  
Q. What do you know about Sindarius for South Carolina? Have you been
able to watch him throughout the season or from film?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: He's really good. He's an old player, he's very tough. And he
does a bunch of different things for their team. Scores the ball, rebounds,
blocks shots, gets steals. And so he's going to be a very tough matchup for
us. I think he's really a big key for their team and with how much he provides
for them.  
  
FRANK JACKSON: I think Grayson touched on that perfectly. He's a talented
basketball player. They're a talented basketball team. So we're looking for a
good matchup tomorrow. And I know he's going to bring it, and the rest of
their squad is going to bring it as well.  
  
Q. Initially this region was supposed to be in Greensboro, North
Carolina, but because of the HB2 law it's here, and it's a 90-minute drive
from their campus. Last night felt like a home game for them. What are your
thoughts on basically having to play a road game as a No. 2 seed in the second
round?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It's another game for us. And we like tough environments. We
played in tough environments all year, really. And I did hear their crowd at
the end of our game. When they were coming on to the court, they got a big
standing ovation from their crowd. And they're going to be well supported. I
mean, we know we're going to have Duke fans in the crowd, too. But it's really
just another tough game for us.  
  
FRANK JACKSON: We've been in these tough situations throughout the year.
Everywhere we play is a brutal environment. And, you know, I think we'll be
ready. And we've been preparing the whole season for tomorrow night and for
the weeks to come.  
  
Q. Frank, how do you -- obviously you hear the boos Grayson gets every
time he touches the ball from a lot of places. How do you think he handles it?
And do you think you could handle it if it were happening to you? That seems
like a lot to put on somebody's shoulders.  
FRANK JACKSON: It is. And G's a tough kid. And I think with the support from
his teammates and from the coaching staff, you know, he's been able to fight
through all that stuff. He's not worried about it. We're worried about what
goes on in our locker room.  
  
No one knows what we go through day in, day out. But you know, I know that if
that happened to me, I have a group of guys who care and love about me, and
that's all that matters to us, is what happens inside of our locker room.  
  
Q. Grayson, I read a story in the Jacksonville paper, which is pretty
amazing story about you and your friend Savannah. And I first Googled around
and I was surprised the story didn't get picked up very much anywhere else.
The fact she died two days before the Elon game, I had to think that that had
something to do with the emotions you were feeling during that period of time.
Can you comment on that?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, that's a long time ago. And there's really no connection
between that and what happened on the court. And really anything further with
that, that's -- the story that was in the Jacksonville paper, that story was
for Savannah and her family, and we wanted to get Savannah's story out there.
It wasn't trying to make it about me or anything like that.  
  
And so really to answer your question, there was no connection with what
happened on the court. And the reason it wasn't out there was just because I
didn't want it to be out there. I wanted it to be between me and her family.  
  
Q. South Carolina did a pretty good job stopping a good 3-point shooting
team last night, especially in the second half. For Grayson first and maybe
for Frank, some of the things that jump out that you saw defensively out of
them and how you'll try to attack that kind of defense?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: They're very strong defensively and they really just come after
you the whole game. I know they forced a lot of turnovers last night and even
throughout the whole season. That's really what they do defensively.  
  
And they're a very aggressive defensive team, so they're going to go for
blocked shots, they're going to go for steals, they're going to rat at the
ball and dig. So you have to be very tough with the ball. And you just have to
be tough when you're attacking them.  
  
You can't take breaks on offense, just because of how strong they are and how
active they are. And another part of that is they're a very big team. They're
very big and long, and even when they go small they're still big, and that
really helps with their length and contesting shots.  
  
Q. Grayson, tomorrow is the first time South Carolina is playing after a
victory in the NCAA Tournament. You guys seem to do it every year. Do you
think that experience that you have can be a help come tomorrow?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It can be a help, but you know our team has never played after
a win in a NCAA Tournament either. And we have a lot of freshmen we rely on,
and that was their first NCAA Tournament game. And where South Carolina is a
very experienced team, regardless of tournament experience. And so I don't
know if we're getting any advantage from that. It's just both teams gotta come
out ready to play.  
  
Q. Yesterday, Coach spent a lot of time talking about Amile and Matt and
their leadership roles on the team. Can you guys tell us what they mean to the
team off the court and how important their roles are this time of the year?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, those two guys, they've been in the tournament. They've
played a lot of tournament games. Amile's played a lot of Duke games and so
has Matt. So they know our coach. They know our program. They know everything.  
  
And so really they can just echo whatever the coaches are saying, and even say
some of the stuff they're not. Both of those guys were big parts of our
freshmen-year tournament, my freshman-year tournament in 2015.  
  
So they've been here. They've been in the tournament and they have the
experience, Amile especially has the experience of really leading the team.
And really we're just all ears just listening to them and following their
example both on and off the court and how we're conducting ourselves at the
hotel.  
  
FRANK JACKSON: Yeah, and I think on court, they're both tremendous leaders,
but as you were talking about off the court, you know, being a freshman,
they've been able to get me through maybe some hard times and rough patches my
freshman year.  
  
So to have those two guys as our captains and team leaders has been huge. They
really have been there for quite a while now and they know what goes on. They
know how to get through kind of hard times in situations they were in when
they were my age. So I couldn't ask for better captains on our team.  
  
Q. Grayson, you said you guys have been in tougher environments all
year, so tomorrow night's not going to faze you. But is it different in a NCAA
Tournament, a win-or-go-home game to be a road team, do you think?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, just thinking about recently for us, we were playing in
the ACC Tournament where we were playing a game and not only are the opposing
fans there but Carolina's fans are also there waiting to boo us too. So we've
played in games that are supposed to be neutral where it felt like an away
game. There's not much difference.  
  
With it being a tournament game, there's always going to be a lot of pressure
on the game for both teams. So both teams just gotta play and win.  
  
Q. Isn't it going to be kind of similar tomorrow because you've got
Carolina here?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Exactly. It's always going to be like that for us.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask both you guys, because you're shooters, about the
mentality of bouncing back from a bad game or bad streak. Luke yesterday had
his worst shooting game of the season. You've had good games, great games, bad
games. Can you just talk about bouncing back and what you have to think about,
both of you because you're both shooters?  
FRANK JACKSON: Luke, he's human. He's a human being. You're not going to be
perfect all the time. But he's been terrific throughout the season. And he
continues to shoot the ball well every single game no matter how many shots or
how many shots he makes.  
  
But you just want to have a mindset to stay aggressive. I know that all of our
perimeter players are knock-down shooters. And you keep shooting and seeing
the ball go in. It gets easier as the game goes along.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I tell guys just to, I like math. I just tell them look at it
like math; if you miss four and you're a 50 percent shooter, the next four
gotta go in. It will even out eventually so just keep shooting it.  
  
Q. Frank, just in terms of South Carolina, obviously they're a strong
defensive team, but they took it to Marquette late in the game with that, I
think they had a 16-0 run. They're definitely a physical team on both ends of
the floor. You seem to have handled that better toward the end of the season.
How will you handle their physicality on both ends, not just defensively but
their ability to take it to you guys offensively?  
FRANK JACKSON: I'm still going to look to stay aggressive at the same time,
not try to let them speed me up, just play my game, let the offense flow into
whatever we're running.  
  
Like G said, they're an experienced team. That's what they do. They pressure
the ball, they force turnovers. So I think I gotta find the open guy and stay
poised and just run our offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We're good, health-wise, except for Marques. For about three
days now, he's just had flu-like symptoms. We didn't even bring him over here
today. Give him IVs and medication and see what happens with him. But the
other guys are in good shape and -- ready to play an outstanding team.  
  
And one of the best -- the best, unheralded, great player in the United States
in Thornwell. But they're not a one-man team. They're obviously very, very
well coached. They're men and they're coached by a man. And so we're going to
have to be men tomorrow night in order to beat them.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sindarius Thornwell. Does he remind you of anybody you
might have coached throughout your career?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He's really unique. He's so unique. I'd hate to -- I think
he's him, you know? And he leads their team in everything. But then he's their
leader. And then you don't see as much on tape until you see him in person.  
  
But last night I saw a couple times where Wojo was giving a signal to his team
what to run. And then you would see him tell his teammates, this is what
they're going to run. And then put -- come on. That's -- that's not alive and
well in our sport. Like, he's really like an old-school great player. And I
say that with the highest level of compliment.  
  
Q. I read today that 37 years ago you were hired at Duke. You've put
together an impressive coaching tree. And Frank Martin said yesterday that he
patterned his defensive philosophy after your Duke teams. What does that mean
to you as a coach to have that type of legacy?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I'm honored that he would say that. I didn't know he
said that. And if you're in the business as long as I've been in, that means
you've probably had pretty good success. And so someone's going to pattern a
little bit what you do about any of those guys.  
  
Like I'm sure Roy, Jim Boeheim. Pitino, these guys, they've stood the test of
time. And he can hang his hat on his own thing, because he's really good. But
I'm really pleased to hear that. That was a nice thing for him to say.  
  
Q. I wanted you to help me with a little history.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know about that.  
  
Q. 1969, NIT, you played South Carolina. Did you defend John Roche that
night?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I did defend John Roche.  
  
Q. What memories?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We won. He had six points. And I'd like to say it was
because of me. But it was because they played a double-high offense. They put
their two big guys at the elbows and they screened for him. And one of my
teammates, Mike Levey, was so good at it, he just yelled stuff at him. And I
think John never went to that side. So I knew he was only going to the side
that Dick Simmons was on.  
  
And, you know, there was no shot clock or anything. If there was a stat for
time of possession for an NCAA player, I probably would have won it that year,
because I kept -- I was not allowed to shoot. And I just went from side to
side trying to get the ball to our two shooters. And we won, I think, 57-45. I
think that was it. That was a good one. That was a good win.  
  
Q. Sticking with the historical angle, what do you remember about Bill
Foster when you replaced him?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Bill was, I think, one of the innovators about
promotion. He was not only an outstanding coach. He's really an outstanding
guy. And, but he promoted the game well. He did things earlier than people did
them.  
  
Like it would be unbelievable if he was a coach in this era to see what he
would do with social media and -- he was just really innovative. And some of
the things that he did at Duke -- our logo, not this one, but the other one --
I think he's the one who started that. And just a good man. Good man. Loved by
the kids who he had the honor to coach.  
  
Q. How has Grayson remained an integral part of what you guys do? He's
coming off the bench now, but now that you're immersed in the tournament, what
is key to what you guys do?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The main thing is he's healthier. He knows he's as good as
anyone on our team. And you can only put five guys out there. And so by
putting him in when we do, we can keep at least two of our major scorers in
all the time. He, Luke and Jayson, those are our three best scorers.  
  
And it actually, I think, helps us keep a better offensive continuity. But
he'll play as many minutes as anybody in a game. And end-of-game situations
and end of half. Like the end of half yesterday was big. For him to hit that 3
and then Jayson get the block, we had like a five-point differential there.
But Grayson's playing real well.  
  
Q. As someone who appreciates good defense, what were some of your
observations last night watching South Carolina, in addition to Thornwell and
some of the things they do that makes them so good?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they'll be as good as a defensive team as we've played
against. First of all, they're together. Every position is pressured. You have
to work hard to get open. And then they rebound well. You have to beat a great
defense.  
  
And we have to be strong to get open and strong in our movements, because
they're going to be strong in trying to stop us in doing that. When you say a
team plays physical it doesn't mean that a team is fouling. They are a
physical team, and when you're physical and you play hard, it usually means
you've got a well-coached team, and that's what they are.  
  
They're an extension of their coach. He's a really good -- he's a tough
competitor. And his kids believe in him. And he's built something really good
here.  
  
Q. The other day you talked about the HB2 bill. But now because of it
you have a pseudo-road game in the second round as a 2 seed. What are your
thoughts on the kind of atmosphere you guys are going to run into tomorrow
night?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, we're okay. We're fine. We usually always play in
front of a packed arena. And when we're on the road, we're always in an arena
where people want to beat us. We'd rather have an upbeat crowd. I don't think
it will hurt us. It probably helps them because it's nice to hear people
cheering for you. But it won't be intimidating to us.  
  
And it's just the way it is. I have no complaints. Let's just play. We're
okay. If we lose, it won't be because we couldn't -- because they had more
people here than we did. It will be because they played better defense than we
played offense, you know.  
  
Q. I'm kind of fishing here, but we haven't really seen a lot of the,
quote/unquote, madness this year, the buzzer beaters, the crazy upsets. Is
there anything -- what would you attribute that to?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I haven't watched the whole tournament. There have been a
number of close games, just because you haven't seen one team hit one more
shot than another doesn't mean the tournament's bad.  
  
You know, I mean, you know, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Somebody
said that one time before. I think when you see the teams that are so-called
favored to win, it means they're playing well. I don't think that means it's a
dull tournament.  
  
Q. PJ Dozier has a lot of length and athleticism. Is there a player you
guys have played against that maybe compares to him? And what does he do
that's so special?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he's really good. He's got a great wing span. He's a
basketball player who doesn't have a position. He can be used anywhere. They
use him a lot at the point. But I wouldn't call him a point. He's just -- and
he can defend a lot of people.  
  
Again, I don't like for me to kind of compare players. You guys do that. You
do it probably better. I know you guys make predictions better than me. So
those two things -- comparisons and predictions are in your court, all right.  
  
Q. I want to follow up a question I asked Grayson. I have a very good
Duke friend, you may not believe that, but I have a good Duke friend, Dorn
Parnell (phonetic), sent me a good example from the Jacksonville paper about
Grayson and his friend Savannah. It traces their relationship, the fact that
she died a couple of days before the Elon game. And at that time you said,
trying to keep -- coaches trying to keep everything in the family -- and you
said you guys don't know half of what's really going on. So --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Actually, more than that. More than half.  
  
Q. 90 percent. Right. So I don't want you to comment on this particular
case, but as an example of something that the public might not have known at a
time when --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think, Art, you hit on a point for all these kids, in
that, again, we live in this quick-judgment, shallow-analysis world really
because of Twitter and all of this stuff to get something out. And we don't
have to document anything. We don't have to investigate. We can hear something
and we put it out. And then we're not held accountable for whether it was true
or not. And it can take on a life of its own. And that's for any player.  
  
And we're dealing with college kids who are growing up, and they're not
professionals. And as educators, we're supposed to preserve and educate the
kids that we have the honor to coach, and not to appease a quick-judgment,
shallow-analysis type of judgment on things. And so that's all. And we're
going to continue to do that. And we'll bear the praise or the criticism of
what happens in that regard.  
  
Q. Grayson said that the story didn't get circulated very much because
he didn't want it circulated. Was the story written --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That's a shallow analysis. In other words, if somebody
wanted to look deeper, it wouldn't ruin their story. A lot of people don't
want their story ruined. They want to create a story. And by more in-depth
analysis a lot of times the story would go away. And then you wouldn't have a
chance to tweet it or have surveys or judgments or all these things that
people have right now. And, again, so be it. But we can't live in that world,
in the world -- I can't live in that world.  
  
Q. It seemed that would have been a good story for the public to know,
to balance it. But he said they wrote it just for Savannah's family and that's
all he wanted.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: God bless them for doing that. And there's a lot of things
all these kids do on all teams that go unnoticed that coaches do and whatever.
But it's called using your platform the right way, and not just for bringing
attention to yourself, but bringing maybe comfort, some help to people and not
everyone needs to know it.  
  
There doesn't have to be a TV camera or a Snapchat or a tweet of it or
Instagram or anything. A lot of times that ruins it. That ruins it. And so,
again, we're not the only -- look, there are a lot of these kids who do things
like that. And he did that and he's done more. But we're not going to say,
well, now it's okay that he tripped. We're not -- like he did that. That was
wrong. But there's a lot more into it than that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas.  
  
Q. For Manny and Moses, Carolina is a plus-13 rebounding. Just what do
you think of that, and how tough of a challenge is that for you guys?  
MANUALE WATKINS: It's going to be tough. Seton Hall, I think, it was plus-7,
and we didn't do a good job on the boards. We gotta box out, hit people and
help our bigs, help Moses, DT, Trey, all those guys, help them rebound. The
guards gotta rebound really well this game.  
  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Yeah, just like Manny said, we've got to be rebound, we got to
do a better job than we did last game. We have to do it collectively. We have
to do it as a team -- the guards, the bigs, too, everybody.  
  
Q. Manny and Moses, you obviously played Carolina two years ago. This is
the third time, third straight time that Arkansas has been in the tournament.
They're playing Carolina in the second round. What do you think about that?
Seems like Arkansas can't get away from Carolina?  
MANUALE WATKINS: I think it's fun. It's an opportunity. They're a 1 seed, so
what more fun can you have than knocking off a 1 seed and moving on in the
tournament?  
  
I think it's just a great opportunity. I don't know how the committee does the
things, but I mean that's what they did. So we're ready to go. Whoever we're
playing, we're ready for.  
  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I guess it's going to be fun to play in the game against North
Carolina. I wasn't here two years ago when they played them, but I know they
always talk about it. I think it will be fun to play. We're just ready to
play.  
  
Q. Jaylen since the postseason play started, you're leading the team in
scoring, and most of that is attacking the basket. Have you changed your style
of game, or what have you done differently over the last four games?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I just stay more aggressive and just try to make plays for
everybody and myself and just keep attacking, because I know when I attack it
opens up a lot of things, so I just stay attacking.  
  
Q. Moses, against Seton Hall, they had the one big guy Delgado, and he
gets his every game. Carolina has so many more bigs. Are you a little bit
concerned that they've got several Angel Delgados going instead of just one?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Just like I said earlier, we have to do a collective job
because they have size. They have size -- the guards, the bigs -- they're
bigger than the team we played last time, and we gotta do a better job of
keeping everybody off the glass, because everybody, almost all five of them go
to the glass every time they shoot the ball.  
  
I think let's shoot it, go get it and put it back. Just like I said, we gotta
do a collective job boxing out everybody and getting the ball going.  
  
Q. Dustin, you had such a good game yesterday. Talk about what worked
well for you and how you want to continue that against North Carolina, how
important that is?  
DUSTIN THOMAS: I just knocked down that first jumper, got going early and just
kept the same rhythm and confidence throughout the rest of the game. They've
been playing off me a little bit, sagging in there on Mo. So them are the
shots I gotta take.  
  
Q. Manny, do you feel a lot more confident in your team at this stage in
the season knowing how you guys are mixing defenses based upon the fact that
you go all the way back to early February you guys were able to go to the zone
against LSU and that kind of turned the tide a little bit, made you guys a
little more confident defensively? Does that make you confident going into a
game like this against North Carolina?  
MANUALE WATKINS: Yeah, one thing with us is we're a really confident team. I
am, it's kind of hard not to be when you're one of 32 teams left in Division I
basketball playing in the NCAA Tournament. So, I mean, we have the utmost
confidence in our offense, our defense. And us being able to switch around
defenses and go at people with different looks is a key part of what we do. So
we're going into the game with 100 percent confidence like we do every game.  
  
Q. Manny and Moses, anybody else who wants to take it, last week you
guys, a week ago tomorrow, you play Kentucky in a, quote, neutral site but
obviously they had the crowd. You know Carolina will have the crowd here
tomorrow. Do you think playing Kentucky last week and their talent level, that
atmosphere helps prepare you for tomorrow?  
MANUALE WATKINS: I mean, yeah. We've been playing at neutral sites. They
obviously had a lot more fans and Carolina is going to have a lot more
tomorrow.  
  
But we don't really get into the fans and the atmosphere. We're just here to
play basketball and do what we love to do. That's all our focus is is going to
be just try to get a win in. They have five guys out there; we've got five
guys out there. That's basketball.  
  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Yeah, they have five guys and we have five guys, and we're
going to come out and play. They don't have more guys than we do on the court,
so we have to do what we came to do, don't worry about things and just do what
we've been doing for the whole season, just come out and execute, get stops,
get rebounds and let's push the ball.  
  
Q. Jaylen, I think I got this right, I think 8 seeds are 11-53 against
1, so it's not impossible. But the odds are stacked against you. How do you
guys feel about an 8 seed taking on a 1? How would you like to add Arkansas to
that group of 8 seeds that have upset 1s?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think -- can you ask the question again.  
  
Q. I think it's around 8 seeds are 11-53 against 1 seeds, so obviously
the odds are against you. It's not impossible because 11 teams have done it.
What do you think about those odds and your chance of becoming the 12th team
to do it?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think our chances are pretty good. I think we're a pretty
good team, honestly. We can play anybody in the country. I think we just have
to come out and play and don't worry about what the seed is, just take it one
game at a time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Opening comments from Coach.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: This is round two now with us surviving and advancing and
playing against an outstanding North Carolina team. Seemed like it was two
years ago, I think, we was at this same place playing against a North Carolina
team.  
  
But here it is and we're one of 32 teams that are still playing, so we're
looking forward for the opportunity to play against one of the bigger teams in
the country.  
  
The perimeter players are playing well. Justin is playing, well. I mean, I
think four of those guys, four of their starters, those guys played, we played
them two years ago. They were freshmen and maybe sophomores. So it's an
experienced team -- Meeks, Hicks.  
  
They're a very, very good basketball team. So we've got our work cut out for
us, especially after giving up 21 offensive rebounds last night to Seton Hall.
And we know we can't let that occur with North Carolina. If so, it will be
over quick.  
  
Of course Joel Berry is playing outstanding for them. Our guys are looking
forward to the opportunity to continue to play good basketball. I think we're
playing good basketball. We're finding ways to win, even when things don't
look like, don't look promising, our guys have had the resilience to find a
way to win, and we've done that throughout the year. So we use those
experiences to get us to this point. And so again we're going to have to play
an awful good game against a very good North Carolina team.  
  
Q. Mike, it was this week a year ago that your conference made Mike
Tranghese a consultant on how to get more teams to the tournament obviously.
Obviously you've got more this year. But do you see that SEC basketball made
strides this year, and do you see tomorrow as a day with both you and South
Carolina playing ACC teams here where something really good could happen?  
COACH ANDERSON: It's an opportunity for us. You've got to be in those
situations in order to -- you talk about the brand, the SEC brand -- we talk
about. And yes I think we had five teams, possibly had six or seven teams in
the tournament. And it's what you do once you get into the tournament.  
  
South Carolina had an outstanding game last night. Vanderbilt was probably one
play away from winning as well. But I think the commitment from the SEC has
been awesome from the institutions, each institution with the coaches they're
bringing in, I think they're really pulling into their programs and I think
you're going to see a big difference.  
  
And we're seeing it right now. I think it's starting to scratch the surface,
when you talk about recruiting, the coaches that are in place. And even this
year, we had three last year, three teams in the tournament last year. We got
five this year. So I think it's just a sign of some great things to come and
we'll be one of the better conferences in the country.  
  
Q. What do you remember about that game against Carolina two years ago
down in Jacksonville?  
COACH ANDERSON: It was an up-and-down game, I remember that. I thought we came
in, playing at a high level. And they were playing at a high level as well. I
remember Paige taking over in the second half. I mean, he was almost like a
one-man wrecking crew.  
  
But they had some other -- the big guys I remember the big guys really
dominating the glass as we went up and down the floor. They attacked us and
attacked us pretty well at the basket. The game, I think, about ten minutes to
go or eight minutes to go, was almost 50-50, something like that. We had a
chance to tie or something and they went on a run and ended up winning by
double figures. But I thought it was a game up and down the floor, and that's
what I think we'll see with this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. The 1s haven't lost in the second round very often but you've
experienced that. I think UAB, you guys were a 9 seed, 8 or 9 when you beat
Kentucky. What's it take for to beat a No. 1 seed in the second round game, do
you think? And what do you guys have to do tomorrow?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think we've got to play well. We've got to play outstanding
basketball. I draw back on those experiences that I had at UAB. To me it was
not necessarily just seeds. It was just two teams playing each other. And we
were the underdogs. I mean, no one gave us a chance. Just like now no one's
giving us a chance.  
  
And in that locker room that we had, those guys believed and they came out and
they gave themselves a chance. It was like David versus Goliath. I'll never
forget it. We threw a mighty big blow with a big rock, we did.  
  
It's going to take one of those kind of efforts. You've gotta play almost
perfect basketball. And of course they've gotta do some things and not play
well. But defensively we've got to keep them off the boards. I think that's
going to be big and not let them get easy opportunities at the basket.  
  
Our strength has been our bench. Our bench has played well for us. But it's
going to be a physical ballgame and we've got to match their physicalness.
We've got to make the game chaotic, disruptive. We can't be predictable. But
at the same time we know they have size. Justin Jackson is playing at a high
level. Shot the ball extremely well. Berry can shoot the ball. But we've got
to limit them to one shot when they do shoot it.  
  
Q. Given the fact two years ago you said the game was an up-and-down one
with North Carolina, do you anticipate the same -- I mean, you guys like to
run, they like to run. You talked about causing chaos. Do you think it's going
to be that same up-and-down, or do you want to kind of take them out of that
rhythm?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think they like to get up and down the floor. So I don't
think it's about what we -- we're going to worry about what we do. But I'm
sure Roy, he's not going to change. We're not going to change. I mean, you do
what got you here to the dance.  
  
Q. In the SEC postseason play, it looks like Jaylen, he's elevated his
game to another level leading you in scoring. Is he doing anything
differently, or is it as simple as his shots are starting to fall?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, I think he's just taking command of our basketball team.
He's doing it kind of quietly. He's not talking or boastful about it. I just
think we're just playing, and our guys are following his lead. He's more
comfortable in his role, so to speak.  
  
Sometimes guys come in, they try to fit in, especially junior college player.
I don't need him to fit in. I need him to come play. I think he's taken that
mindset and run with it. I think Daryl has done the same thing. And so we're
going to need Daryl to play at that same level for us tomorrow in order to
have a chance.  
  
Q. This is going to be the sixth time Arkansas and Carolina play in the
tournament. I guess it'll be your fifth involvement as either assistant or
head coach. Obviously played against them. Obviously, Lee played against them,
Scotty played against them. Always seemed like Arkansas is playing Carolina
for whatever reason. What do you think about that and what do you think about
the history you guys have had in the tournament?  
COACH ANDERSON: Obviously, North Carolina has great tradition. And we have
tradition as well. And I guess that says that, you know what, when you get in
this tournament and you start advancing, you're going to play outstanding
teams. And it's amazing how -- they play for championships. And we've had an
opportunity -- I've been a part of three Final Fours. We had a chance to play
for some championships, too.  
  
So I mean maybe that's what it means. We're trending that direction. But when
you play in this tournament, you're going to play tremendous teams, whether it
be North Carolina. We played Arizona. We played many teams in the tournament.
Played Duke as well. So that means you're advancing in it.  
  
Q. You mentioned their rebounding. They're like a plus-13, I think it
leads the nation. Watching them, what makes them such a good rebounding team?
They only have one guy averaging more than six rebounds, so seems like
everybody is getting a few here and there?  
COACH ANDERSON: They've got eight pros, have you seen all those guys they got?
Eight, nine pros. You got pros, they can go get it. And they've got size.
They've got girth. They've got experienced guys.  
  
And so, again, it's going to be the ultimate challenge for our team, because
that's something we hadn't done consistently, hadn't done as well as I would
like us to be. We're not going to be a great team, but we've got to keep
people off the glass.  
  
Q. Piggybacking on Mark's question about the SEC, the SEC was 4-1 in the
first round. You and Carolina both beat Big East teams. Everybody's always
talking about the Big East in basketball. Just how good a statement do you
think you guys made in that first round, and then obviously want to make
tomorrow, too?  
COACH ANDERSON: It was the first game in the tournament. And I know from a
coaching standpoint, you get nervous about that game. And especially I got
seven new guys, seven guys that have never donned a Razorback uniform. Here
they are in the NCAA Tournament going to the second round, playing in the
first round.  
  
But those guys came, seen things through my eyes, they came out and played
well in terms of for the conference. I think it speaks well in terms of what
our conference is all about. People look at our conference and thought it was
down this year, but it was not.  
  
I mean, we lose at Missouri, we lose to Vanderbilt. We lose at home to
Mississippi State. We lost to Florida a couple of times. But our league is
really good. You're in the family. You start fighting each other.  
  
So now it's kind of neat to get out of the family and go play some other teams
and hopefully do well in the tournament. And continue to put the brand of the
SEC basketball, it's for real.  
  
Q. Justin Jackson, I think he was sort of in a mini shooting slump. He
had about four games where he was shooting around 30 percent. Looked like he
broke out yesterday. Were you kind of hoping his struggles would continue?
Just what do you think about him as a player?  
COACH ANDERSON: He's a good player. Averaging almost 20 points a game,
probably here in conference, 18. He's leading their team. And he's expanded
his range. I see him cutting to the basket. He can rebound the basketball. He
can pass it. I mean, had a chance to see this kid grow. Watching him even from
high school get a chance, tried to recruit him a little bit.  
  
But when you look at two years ago, he was a true freshman. Now he's like the
leader of this basketball team. So he's grown as a player, and that's what
good players do. They develop. And I think he's developed into a very good
outstanding player. And you don't look at stats this time of the year. You got
guys that got to produce, and he knows he's got to produce for his team.  
  
Q. Obviously Dustin had, like you said, probably the best game of the
year. What do you think the odds are that he can duplicate that tomorrow. How
important is it that he play big against a team like Carolina and all their
size and everything?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he'll come out and play. I think he'll come out and
give us everything he has. With those guys, with those forwards, you talk
about Dustin, DT, we call him DT. You talk about Arlando Cook, whether it's
Trey Thompson, always somebody's been on for us. And it's going to take more
than just one guy being on. I thought DT had his best game. Who knows, it may
be DT and Trey and Cook. We're going to need them against the forward
contingency that North Carolina has.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 103, Texas Southern - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina, coach Roy Williams and student-
athletes Isaiah Hicks and Justin Jackson. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Generally we're very pleased, to say the least, to still be
here and be advancing on a Saturday, or Sunday -- what day is today, Friday?
So I guess we play Sunday.  
  
I think we got off to a good start. Shared the ball early and got the ball
inside. We felt like we had a big advantage inside. We wanted to get there and
we did. Justin was phenomenal in the first half.  
  
Five 3s, five out of six in the first half. And the thing is he's had a great
year, not just a really good year, he's had a great year. And he put a little
bit more pressure, thought he had to try to do more. And I told him all he had
to be was be Justin, and I think that's what he was today. And I think he was
sensational for us, and also had three assists, one turnover.  
  
But our big guys did some things also in the first half. We had, needless to
say, a big margin at halftime, and I challenged them to come back out and play
the second half and I thought we did.  
  
We had six guys in double figures. We had a huge rebound margin, 54-27. And
points in the paint, 52-28. So we feel good about where we are, but it's just
a great job by these guys.  
  
Q. How much confidence does 100-point game give the team going into
Sunday and to the rest of the tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The number of points we scored really doesn't have anything to
do with it. It gave us confidence that we tried to follow the things that the
coaches emphasize to them, and we wanted to play defense without fouling.  
  
The first half they shot six free throws, so we did a better job of that. We
wanted to do a great job on the boards. We wanted to get the basketball into
the lane by pass or dribble. I think we did that and take advantage of our
height. That gives you some confidence.  
  
And there's a game on Sunday. Whatever happened today can give you confidence,
make you feel good. But you still have to play that second game.  
  
Q. You have a tougher game Sunday. Are there any negatives of playing a
game like this?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I have won close games and then played great the next game.
I've won by big margins and played great, and we've also did both and probably
played sorry.  
  
My biggest fear was Joel Berry. All of a sudden you know how sometimes as a
coach, when there's a timeout you have negative thoughts, or he's laying on
the floor kind of thing.  
  
Took me back to 2002 we were a 1, playing Holy Cross, a 16, and we almost lost
the game. Kirk Hinrich sprained his ankle terribly, and weren't able to get
him back in the game at all, but he iced for about 48 hours, and we played
Stanford in the second round and played really well. So that's what I thought
of.  
  
Joel came down on the side of the guy's foot. And Doug took him back, and he
jogged some back there. And I put him in for two or three minutes because he
wanted to, and we wanted him to get confidence that he was okay, it wasn't
that bad. And also, I think, the more you move those things around sometimes,
they don't balloon up. And so that was the thought of me and Doug. And I guess
he talked to maybe the doctors back there when they were back there also. But
we got him three or four more minutes.  
  
But again, you guys that have been around a long time, one year they said
isn't it great you're peaking at the right time, in the Big Eight, I guess it
was the Big 12 Tournament by then, we won a game like this, and the next day,
less than 24 hours later we got our butts beat. I don't know if you're
peaking, but I'd rather win regardless.  
  
Q. Is Joel okay?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, my guess is it will stiffen up a little bit. But I feel
certain that he'll be able to go. And he said his momma's here, so she can
clap her hands together like Mr. Miyaga and put her hands on his ankle and I'm
sure it will make it feel better.  
  
Q. Down 10-8 you went on a 16-point run and went up, you talked about
the play, that ignited your play and it stayed consistent.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that was probably -- I know two of them -- I shouldn't
say I know, I think two of them were Justin's 3s at that point and the other
two were layups inside.  
  
No, we -- I think I did look at the score. One time during the first half I
was just concerned about how we were playing, and I saw at halftime it was 25,
I think, but that big run was good for us.  
  
But we're bigger, and you gotta take advantage of that, and I think we did get
the ball inside. I think Kennedy and Isaiah both were really effective for us
in the first half. And I liked the fact we had nine guys play at least 15
minutes I think is what somebody said.  
  
Q. Arkansas is a team that really plays an up-tempo game like you guys.
What are some of the keys to Sunday?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we've got to attack them back. I think they do want to
speed you up. We want to play at that pace ourselves.  
  
We want them to go fast. We want to go fast, but we've got to take care of the
basketball. They're very aggressive. They play very hard on the defensive end
of the floor. We've got to make sure that we don't turn the ball over.  
  
I'm always yelling at my guys attack, attack, attack and then I pause, and
they give me the last two words: It's under control. So we've got to make sure
we attack those guys under control.  
  
Mike's done a great job with his club. I've watched three or four minutes of
their game against Kentucky in their tournament, but I haven't seen very much
of them until then. But I know Mike, he worked with Coach Richardson a long
time and believes in that style of play. And Nolan and Mike with those teams
at Arkansas, they did it as good as about anybody's ever done it.  
  
Q. Obviously you did a lot of things well. But if there was maybe one
thing that you were particularly pleased with today, what would that be?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think I'd have to say two things: One, for Justin to
see the ball go in the basket. I mean, he did. He just put too much pressure
on himself and tried to do too much possibly, which you love that, you like a
guy that tries to step up.  
  
But I'd say that would be the biggest thing. But then the other thing is we
did try to make sure that we stayed down on the shot fakes, tried to slide our
feet and play defense without fouling.  
  
And they shot 16 free throws. The last two times we played Duke, they shot 72
free throws in two games we can't do that and be a good team.  
  
Q. Talk about a game like today where you got a chance to get a lot of
young kids maybe their first tournament experience where you may need them
down the road.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we like to play eight, nine, 10 guys and feel that we
need all those guys. I was not going to play Brandon Robinson. He threw up
twice before the game.  
  
But it got to that point and I thought it might help him a little bit to get
out -- as long as he didn't throw up on the court or me I thought he'd be all
right. But he got hit in the stomach and that just accelerated a little bit of
pain for him. So we took him out.  
  
I do think it's good to get a lot of guys in the game because I play a lot of
guys and they're going to be important to us.  
  
Q. Rebounding is 54-27. Is that just a function of just being bigger, or
is it an effort you like to see on the boards?  
COACH WILLIAMS: There's no question we're gifted with more size than they had.
But I do think it was one of the three things that we put up on the board that
we wanted to emphasize.  
  
I like trying to get as many offensive rebounds we can. I always say that the
game of basketball is really simple: You get the ball and then I get the ball;
you get the ball and then I get the ball. The only way for me to get more
opportunities is to get some offensive rebounds and not let you get some
offensive rebounds.  
  
So I do think that's important to us, and we emphasize that every year I've
ever coached.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Madison Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32952)

### [Angel Delgado](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30693)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Arkansas - 77, Seton Hall - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard and student-
athletes Angel Delgado and Madison Jones.  
  
Q. Angel, you and Moses kind of battled the entire game. Coming down in
those final minutes, what was the difference this time?  
ANGEL DELGADO: I don't know what to tell you. We just was playing hard, and we
both battled, let's say.  
  
Q. Madison, obviously you've been around a while. You've played a lot of
college basketball. A call like that, do you feel that maybe the call on Desi,
do you think that maybe intent should be looked at maybe more than the letter
of the law?  
MADISON JONES: I mean, whatever the ref's decision was I guess that's what he
believed was right. When they replayed and looked at it, they made the call
that they thought was right.  
  
Q. Angel and Madison, considering the season you had and the game that
you played for most of this game with an eight-point lead, how difficult is
this to swallow the way the game ended?  
MADISON JONES: It's definitely difficult for me especially being the last game
I'll play. But I'm still proud of our team and what we accomplished this year.
And I can't thank everybody enough.  
  
ANGEL DELGADO: I think we played an unbelievable year. Everybody played good
all year. This is how is the game -- somebody win, somebody lose, that's how
it is.  
  
Q. To only score three points in the final six, seven minutes, anything
you can pinpoint on to what happened during the end of the game?  
MADISON JONES: We just had a few costly turnovers down the stretch that cost
us, but other than that, that's pretty much.  
  
ANGEL DELGADO: Got a lot of turnovers the last six minutes but that's how the
game ends. We just gotta take care of the ball more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, what can you say about the way -- I mean, just the way -- you
guys had an eight-point lead and it just kind of dissipated? Is there anything
in particular you can point your finger at that happened down the stretch for
you guys?  
COACH WILLARD: I think the free-throw line really hurt us a little bit. We had
a couple of times where they had, it was 66-58, if I'm right, Kingsley gets
fouled, makes two free throws.  
  
We missed two, I think it was. They come down and hit two really tough shots.
I thought it was two teams battling and playing really hard.  
  
We had our opportunities. We missed a couple. We missed an offensive rebound.
We missed a tip-in. We missed a little bank shot. We had our opportunities.
You've just got to give them credit. They played really well.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to see the replay of the foul and your thoughts
on it?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I mean I just watched it. You know, I thought the three
guys tonight did a really good job. It was a physical, athletic game. I think
it's one of those things you've got to, if you've been around the game long
enough you've got to know time, score, you've got to know what's going on.  
  
It's an NCAA Tournament game. I think you really gotta understand what's going
on. But they reffed a good game all night. So I can't really complain about
whether I agree or not. I'm always going to disagree with it. That's what
coaches do.  
  
Q. On that last possession, before the flagrant foul was called, there
was a replay circulating now online of the Arkansas player taking three steps
before dribbling and then the flagrant foul is called on the other end. Just
your thoughts on those two -- the one non-call and then that call against you
guys?  
COACH WILLARD: That's part of the game. We shouldn't have been in that
situation, to be honest with you. We were up one with the ball with 1:20 left,
I think, somewhere in that range. We turn it over, we come down, miss a layup.  
  
So it's one of those things. We should never have put ourselves in that
situation. We had a chance, if we just take care of the ball with 1:20 left.
You don't want to leave it to other people. We had the chance.  
  
We talked about that in the timeout, under-four timeout, learning from the
Villanova game and finishing off games. I'm a big believer if somebody comes
in reaches behind somebody and gets the ball, it's physically impossible to
reach behind somebody and back tip a ball. It happened twice. I think that's
my only complaint that I would have about officiating was, I just don't think
it's humanly possible for someone to reach behind somebody and back-tip a
ball.  
  
I have pretty long arms, I know I can't do it. Maybe they have extra super
long arms and can do it. But, again, I thought the game was tremendously
officiated. But those are the kinds of things, that's the only thing I
disagree with.  
  
Q. Just a variation of the question I asked the players, given the
season that you had, this group of guys, how difficult was it to see it end
this way?  
COACH WILLARD: It's always going to end. It's always difficult when it ends. I
think this group of guys, this team, a lot of people doubted what this team
could do, what they can get, especially when Z went to the draft. I think
every one of these kids stepped up, improved their game. I think Myles Powell
had a phenomenally freshman year.  
  
It's always difficult when it ends. But, man, I'm super proud of where these
guys have brought this program and getting back to the tournament, back to
back, for the first time since '93 and '94. I like the direction that these
guys are going, and we'll learn from this and we'll bounce back. That's kind
of what we've always done.  
  
Q. Kevin, just the emotions for you last year compared to this year.
Last year was disappointing. This year probably goes down -- maybe after the
Western Kentucky and Michigan, Seton Hall losses -- as one of the probably
hardest to take. Just for you at getting so close to winning a tournament
game, what's it feel like?  
COACH WILLARD: It's tough. I'm not going to lie to you. It's tough. To have
the kids play -- it's not about me. College basketball is not about me. I
think it's going to be extremely difficult for these guys and how hard they
worked, the hours and the travel, everything.  
  
I feel for these kids because they've really bought in to each other. They
bought into the program. I'm going to wake up tomorrow morning and I'll do
what I do on Saturdays, is go to my son's basketball game.  
  
These kids, college basketball is about the kids, it's about the student-
athletes. It's about their emotions and I'm just so proud of what they've done
for this program. It's going to be tough for them. It's hard when you lose and
you have a game. But that's hoops, man. That's ball. It's life. You've got to
bounce back, and I've got a lot of confidence in these guys, how we'll do and
how we'll bounce back next year.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

### [Jayson Tatum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32867)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 87, Troy - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke, coach Mike Krzyzewski and student-
athletes Jayson Tatum and Grayson Allen.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we beat a good team. I thought they had their team
well prepared. All these teams that win championships, they got really hot at
the end of the year in a very close-knit conference. And they can score the
ball. They have -- all their kids can score and they're very well coached.  
  
I thought we did a good job of defending the 3, which that's what they do. And
that was going to be a key to the game. I thought our guys played hard and
well. And one thing about March is everybody believes they can win, and they
were not going to go away. Our guys did some things in the second half with
the defensive rebounding.  
  
Jayson was just terrific on the defensive boards -- nine defensive rebounds.
And G was terrific. He gave us a huge lift at -- the three at the end of the
half. But seemed like whenever we needed a bucket, he got it. And his passing
was good.  
  
We played well. We had to play well or else we would have gotten beat. Because
they played well. And their coach can talk about it, but I was pleased with
that first performance of ours.  
  
Q. Grayson, toward the end of the season you've had great success coming
off the bench. What do you bring to the team, and how has it worked for you
coming off the bench?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, coming off the bench doesn't really change the player
that you are, necessarily. It's just when you come in, my job is to give
energy.  
  
And most of the times when I'm coming in it's kind of right after that first
media. And it's just to give the team that extra boost.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: And score points.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: And score some points. But just come in and bring energy. And
just I'm coming in with fresh legs right off the bench. So I'm just coming in
to explode, really.  
  
Q. Jayson, the fan reaction, when you touched the ball, does it motivate
you at all? Do you hear it? What's your reaction when it goes on?  
JAYSON TATUM: Well, it's something that I don't hear anymore. But we like
playing in buildings where it's loud. So we hear the noise, and when there's
noise in the crowd, it gives everyone on the court energy. And so we use that
energy and play with it.  
  
Q. Grayson, do you feel like coming off the bench, did it actually gives
you a chance to see some things that maybe the guys on the court don't see,
that when you come in you can contribute in a different way?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, when I'm on the sidelines to start the game I can
definitely see how the game's going, what's open, what the defense is doing,
what we need to do on offense and what's being successful for the other team.  
  
And so when I come in -- while I'm watching the bench, make sure that I'm into
the game, and so that I don't feel like I'm just slowly getting into it.  
  
And so I know what's going on and I can go in and make some reads and maybe
tell some of the guys what I see.  
  
Q. Jayson, Coach mentioned your nine defensive boards, but you also had
four steals and four blocks. Can you just talk about your effort tonight on
that end of the court?  
JAYSON TATUM: Yeah, we all played great on the defensive end. Not early but
towards the second half. We were just talking more. That's what Coach
emphasized the first half. Guys weren't talking on the defensive end. And we
really paid attention to that in the second half, guys were talking. And I was
just fortunate enough to come up with some loose balls.  
  
Q. Is there room for improvement going into Sunday?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: There's always room for improvement for us. That's why with the
short turnaround you don't have much time to watch what you just did. You need
to learn from it. And that's the goal here now that you're in the tournament
is learn from winning and keep improving, because we know in the next round
whoever it is we're going to play, they're going to be a really good team. And
we need to show up a better team than we were tonight.  
  
JAYSON TATUM: Just to piggyback off what he said, we can just learn from what
we did today. And it's just a short turnaround. And it gets tougher each and
every round. We know we're going to play a great team Sunday. And we're
looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Grayson, Jayson came out and made that first 3 to kind of start the
game, and then you guys were able to hit a lot of 3s tonight. How key was that
shot for you guys?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It was big. I thought it really started our offense off. And
really started the game off for us. And for us to see the first shot go in,
and kind of loosens it up for everyone else.  
  
And then I thought we did a really good job of moving the ball around. And we
did a good job kicking it and moving the ball fast, so when the ball's moving
like that, the shots tend to go in.  
  
Q. Both guys, talk about Frank Jackson and what he really has brought to
the table the last couple of weeks. And what was Javin's shot? What was going
on at the end of the game there?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Frank's done a great job. He keeps improving and getting
better. He's like a running back at the point guard position -- he just goes
and he's so strong that when he drives the ball he can finish. And he's
playing great defensively.  
  
And he just plays so hard and it really just -- I think it goes throughout the
other guys on the team, just lifts everyone up. And I know Javin wanted to
dunk that one at the end, but he'll take those two.  
  
Q. I know defensive numbers are often a function of what's going on with
the offense, especially a explosive offense like Duke's. Can you speak to the
evolution of Duke's defense during the course of the year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I think we're a good defensive team. I don't think
we're a great defensive team. I think we're a better offensive team than
defensive team. And I think sometimes when you have guys who can score a lot,
they're only going to be so good defensively, because at the end of the day
they believe they can outscore you. Not that they're thinking about that while
it's going on. But it just works out that way.  
  
But we're a good defensive team. And we're switching up a little bit in the
ACC Tournament, and this game we did a little bit of zone and what we call 32,
it's a 2-2-1 press. And I thought that helped us.  
  
It stopped their driving and kind of stood them up for a little bit. And we're
just -- because they had good momentum. They had good momentum. They cut it to
single digits. And they had really good momentum. And we kind of came back and
then I thought that helped us.  
  
Q. You coached a lot of first-round NCAA games over the years?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: 33, yeah.  
  
Q. Some of them have been tight and difficult. Some have been fairly
easy. Can you read anything into these games?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think there are more good teams. And there's not the so-
called great teams and the poor teams or whatever.  
  
I don't know if there are any great teams. There are teams that may be the
best this year. But the difference between them and a team from the Sun Belt
that wins, in Troy, is not -- it's not as big a difference.  
  
And especially when you're playing the championship team, the championship
team, because that means they've come off something really good. But they're
champions. And that's how these kids played tonight.  
  
I was really impressed with Troy and how they prepared for us. I thought they
did a really good job -- I thought we played well. It's a 20-point game, but
it was a hard, hard 20-point game because they played so well.  
  
Q. You've done 33 of these, as you've said. I imagine some teams have
more energy going into the tournament than others. And coming off four
straight games last week, Coach, the energy level of your team tonight, are
you happy with it?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I thought we had good energy. I thought we started
great. We've done some things in the week in between to get our guys rested
and they prepared well. They warmed up well.  
  
If you guys wouldn't do stuff to the court where we have to wait, I don't know
who did that. One of you probably dropped a camera or did something. And we'd
of had even better momentum until that happened. No, I'm just screwing around.  
  
But, no, we were ready. Our guys were ready and they're fresh. And they just
played well against us. We had to play well to win tonight.  
  
Q. Are you going to watch this game as a fan or --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, no, no.  
  
Q. Are you going to be pulling for Wojo?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I'm just going to -- I can't think of it being Steve. He's
like my son. And so I hope they do great. And we gotta play whoever. And so
I'll watch from -- I don't like to go out on the court and watch. And I'll
watch from behind the first half and then we're going to leave at halftime and
then watch the rest of the game and prepare.  
  
And whoever it is, you know, I think both teams -- they're different. One is a
great defensive team in South Carolina. And they're coached by a good friend.  
  
And Steve's team is an outstanding offensive team. They're the leading team in
the country, 3-point shooting. So I'm just proud that he's brought his team
there, just as I'm proud of Chris for what he's done at Northwestern. And I
wish we weren't in the same pod, in the same bracket. But we are.  
  
Q. Harry Giles was a huge reason for your ACC Tournament run. He didn't
get a lot of minutes today. Was there anything behind that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, he didn't play well. Did you watch the game? I mean,
he fouled right away. And he has played well. And I thought the fouls affected
him. He played -- he was young tonight, where when he got those two fouls and
then when he had a chance to come in, he couldn't get rid of those two fouls.  
  
And that's part of the experience he hasn't been able to get. But we have
confidence and he'll play Sunday. And Antonio Vrankovich came in and gave us a
few minutes that were really, really important. But we have confidence in
Harry. He's still a young guy.  
  
Q. Obviously the Jayson-in-the-right-block post area's become an
increasing part of your offense. Are there more wrinkles you can do with him
now that he's got that one down? Can you start to add more things like that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I wish he would have had that one down a little bit better,
where we scored on it. But yeah, we have other things in there.  
  
And then one of the main things is that he can't -- he can't get down when he
misses. And tonight he had that one finish where he should have just tried to
dunk it instead of -- because he can hit free throws. The kid is really a good
player. And he's getting better and better. And we'll use him, we'll go as
many ways as we can.  
  
The thing tonight to show that, you know -- nine defensive boards, 12 boards,
four blocks, four steals -- that block he had right at the end of the half was
sensational.  
  
And he had a dunk attempt in the first half where I thought he got hit.
Otherwise that would have been, like, the spectacular play of the game,
besides Javin's. All right. Okay. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

### [Luke Fischer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26181)

### [JaJuan Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18331)

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 93, Marquette - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marquette.  
  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: First of all, congratulations to South Carolina. I
thought the better team won tonight. You know, obviously they're a team that
plays very hard and is incredibly physical. They were allowed to play really
physical tonight. I thought over the course of the game that wore us down. And
where they were able to get separation in the second half. So congrats to
them.  
  
The kid Thornwell is a big big-time player and they have an outstanding team.
I'm really proud of our guys, especially these two guys sitting to my right,
these two guys were at Marquette when I was hired and they're two of the big
reasons why we're back in the NCAA Tournament this year and I'm proud of my
team. I thought we had a really good year where we had a mix of returnees and
newcomers. And those guys were able to come together to put us in a position
to be a part of the NCAA Tournament, which we haven't -- Marquette has not
been able to do for three years prior. So it was a good year. It's a tough
ending. But again I'm proud of my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. It seemed in the second half the interior defense kind of fell apart
a little bit. Was it Thornwell, dealing with the fouls early, or maybe
something else?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: They just turned a couple of notches there. It was tough for
us to get going on the offensive end, that's all I can say.  
  
LUKE FISCHER: Yeah, I would say they're a really physical team. They were able
to get to the basket. We weren't always up on our ball screen coverage. We had
some miscommunication plays and they capitalized on all that stuff.  
  
Q. How big of a factor was the crowd, their campus is about 90 minutes
away. Especially in that second half where they got going seemed like they
rode the emotion of the fans?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Yeah, fell like an away game almost. The crowd was loud and
every time they made a run you could hear them.  
  
LUKE FISCHER: I definitely agree. I mean, with them being so close and being
in their home state, we expected a large crowd for them and they definitely
followed them for this game.  
  
Q. To face a 7 seed and basically be a road game, did you feel like you
got the short end of the straw there?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: No, we didn't. One of the things about playing in this
tournament is for us, if they said we needed to play in Timbuktu and they were
only bringing their home fans, we'd be fine with that. They have great fans
and they showed out tonight. But that's not something that we worried about
nor should we be worried about.  
  
Q. Luke, it seems like your shoulder is a little more bandaged up than
it was against Seton Hall, more of a serious injury or just precautionary?  
LUKE FISCHER: Just precautionary, we wanted to make sure the incident didn't
happen again. This past week we made some adjustments and made sure that I
could play this full game.  
  
Q. Obviously this is kind of a sour end to the season, but it's been
really an exciting year for the team as a whole. Maybe more big moments this
year than the past two combined, do you think about that, both of you, at all
as this comes to an end or is it too soon for that?  
LUKE FISCHER: Some of the first things you think of is our time here. I mean,
I thought back to my very first game right away and just how many great
memories I've had playing for this university and the love I have for it. I'm
really going to miss it. It's been a heck of a two and a half years playing
here and I wouldn't want to play anywhere else.  
  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: The same. Marquette, I'm a Golden Eagle for life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Steve, you said that the Gamecocks were allowed to play physical. Did
you think the referee should have reined them in some more, or was it up to
your players to step up to that level and combat them a little bit?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I'm not an official. I don't want to speak for them. I
thought the game was really physical. That's how Frank's teams play.  
  
I thought over the course of the game their physicality wore us down. And you
have to be incredibly mentally and physically tough in order to win any NCAA
game but in particular against South Carolina tonight and we weren't able to
sustain that for as long as we needed to, and that's when they were able to
create separation.  
  
Q. The turnovers really became an issue in the second half. Was that
just the pressure South Carolina was putting on you?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, I think when you play a team that pressures like
they do, at times the effects of that pressure don't show itself until late.
And we're not going to win a game where we give a team 25 points off of
turnovers. That's just not how we're made up.  
  
We have to -- taking care of the ball has got to be one of the things we do
best against a team the caliber of South Carolina. And we weren't able to do
that. And the reason was because South Carolina was playing outstanding
defense and playing really hard and we weren't able to sustain what we needed
to do from a mental or physical perspective.  
  
Q. I asked Luke and Jajuan about the season as a whole and the big
moments that Marquette basketball has had this year. As a whole, how do you
feel about the season with your first NCAA Tournament run, would you say this
was a success?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah. Anytime you're 20 minutes after a loss, it's hard
to take a step back. But I'm sure when I'm able to take a step back, this has
been a great year. To be back in the NCAA Tournament, after -- when I took the
job, we had to reboot the program.  
  
And in a few short years we're back into the NCAA Tournament where we want to
be consistently. And I give our guys a lot of credit. There are different
times over the course of the year where, you know, if we didn't respond we
wouldn't be in this position.  
  
When we were 6-7 in the Big East, and we felt like we probably had to get the
10 wins to put ourselves in a position to win, to be in the NCAA Tournament,
our guys won four out of five games and we played our best basketball.  
  
I never made a big deal about it. We started two freshmen the whole year. And
in a conference that's as good as any conference in the United States. We're
integrating four new guys who played key roles for the better part of the
first 40 percent of the season. And those guys ended up being real key players
for us.  
  
So there's a lot to be proud of, I'm sure, as I step back and more things come
to thought. But our group did a really good job this year. And it's hard to
feel as good about it just because we left the battlefield. But I'm sure as we
take a step back we'll feel really good and so should the people who support
our program and support the Marquette community. This team did a great job to
get us back into the NCAA Tournament. And I'm really proud of them and so
should the people who support our program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [PJ Dozier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32949)

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Sindarius Thornwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26685)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 93, Marquette - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
COACH MARTIN: Just for these guys to have never been on this stage, our school
never had won since '73. I'm just so proud of our guys -- these two guys right
next to me, they've carried the load for us all year.  
  
You saw Justin McKie today step up and give us tremendous minutes as a senior.
Duane was phenomenal defensively. Had a chance to make some 3s but he was
engaged. He was engaging in what we were doing.  
  
So I'm just really proud of these guys. And we've got a lot of work tonight, a
lot of work tomorrow. But you know what, these kids have taken me on an
unbelievable ride and I couldn't be prouder.  
  
Q. What was the concentration at halftime, because it seemed you were
much more aggressive offensively driving the ball in the second half?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Just to stay consistent on defense. Just keep grinding,
keep staying on them, make them take tough shots and on offense keep
attacking. And we stayed with it, stayed with the game plan, and that's really
it.  
  
PJ DOZIER: Just as he said, to stay aggressive defensively, make our offense
out of our defense, just like we've been doing it all year.  
  
Q. Sindarius, the environment today was bananas. Can you talk about
that, and did that fuel you guys on the court?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It was great. Thank you to all the Gamecock fans that was
here supporting us and watching us on TV, too. It was great. It helped the
momentum when PJ got those couple fastbreak dunks. And the atmosphere went
crazy. It just gave us the confidence we needed to get over the edge and push
through the final minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Sindarius, when you were serving your suspension, did you think about
this possibly happening? And what did you kind of say to your teammates during
that time, because since you've come back you've obviously played the best
basketball of your career?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Yeah, I thought about it a little bit when we took a
couple of losses. I kind of faulted myself for that, those losses because some
of those losses wouldn't have happened if I played.  
  
I tried to stay as positive as I could, tried to coach from the sideline and
stick with them. And hopefully by the time it was time for me to come back, we
could pick up where we was at when I was playing. And that's what we did.
Throughout the season, we just kept working and kept grinding and made it
here.  
  
Q. You're both from South Carolina. How does it feel to get to play NCAA
game in your home state and get a win in your home state?  
PJ DOZIER: It's amazing. The first dream is just to make it to the NCAA
Tournament. And then playing in your backyard is even more greater.  
  
It's just a blessing to be able to play in front of our fans. Like Sin said,
we just thank them for coming in and fuelling us to come out and play hard,
just what we've been doing.  
  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: That's what we signed up for. We signed up to put this
program in a situation where when it's time to leave we're competing with the
best teams in the country. And making it here and playing here in South
Carolina just makes it even better. And that's really it.  
  
Q. Do you think Duane doesn't get enough credit for his on-the-ball
defense? Looked like he was locked in all game but a lot of times people talk
about the shot blockers and the stealers. How good is he defensively?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: I thought he should have made all-defensive team. He
heats them up. Everybody talks about our defense, and talk about me stunting
the ball and stuff like that, but Duane doesn't get enough credit for what he
does, how he heats point guards up, how he routed them.  
  
He get them playing at half court and it's easier for us to get in line and do
stuff like that. But I feel like Duane, one of the best, if not the best on-
ball defenders in the conference.  
  
Q. What do you expect Sunday to be like, probably the biggest game in
program history in decades, and you have it in your backyard against one of
the national title contenders?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Duke's great. They're a good team. They have good
players. We're going to do what we do. We're going to come in and play hard,
going to prepare tonight when we get back, prepare tomorrow. And the game's
still gotta be played. We're going to, when the game is tipped, we'll try to
do what we do and that's really it.  
  
Q. Sindarius, can you appreciate what this means to so many people in
South Carolina, given that it's been so long since the program's done this?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Yeah, man, this is great. That's what we play for. We
play for those fans that's been supporting the basketball program for so long
and haven't seen that much success, but still supported them, still came to
the games.  
  
Even when I first got to school here, the gym was empty. It was cold some
games. We still had fans that was there supporting us loud and proud. And
those are the fans that we really get up for. Those are the fans that we
really appreciate. Not saying we don't appreciate everybody. But those fans
means a lot to us.  
  
Q. PJ, you seemed really intent on driving the basketball and had a lot
of finishes at the rim. Was using your height advantage something you were
focusing on doing?  
PJ DOZIER: Yeah, just the coaching staff continues to tell me to stay
aggressive, attack the rim. Being 6'6", 6'7" that's what you have to do. You
have to put pressure on the rim, and I feel like that's when I play my best
basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the first ten minutes with the 3-pointers, were you happy with the
shot selection, or would you have preferred to be a little more aggressive,
like you guys ended up being in the second half?  
COACH MARTIN: Are you talking about us? They're good shots. You gotta make
them. You can't pass up -- you can't tell good players to pass up open shots.
I had no problem with what we were doing offensively, just missed.  
  
Q. Sindarius mentioned when you first got here the place was empty, a
lot of home games. And you see tonight it's been 44 years. What you see
tonight how hungry Carolina fans were. Anytime there was a basket they were
jumping to their feet. From where you started to tonight's atmosphere could
you just talk about the difference between the two and the journey along the
way when it comes to fan support like you saw tonight?  
COACH MARTIN: Our school's got unbelievable fans, they're just incredible.
They're rabid about our school. And that's why coaches, whether it's Coach
Spurrier or Coach Tanner, Dawn, that's why they come and love it. It's the
support.  
  
You go to a soccer game, it's sold out. You go to a volleyball game, it's sold
out. Two years in a row we lead the country in attendance when you combine men
and women's basketball together.  
  
We had more fans at our open yesterday. I'm not talking about total fans, I'm
talking about Gamecock fans than we had in the first game I coached at the
Colonial Life Arena. It's fun right now. You're 13th in country in total
attendance.  
  
I knew if we could build it -- and it was a big if -- but if we could build it
and we play the kind of basketball that I like my team to play, that our fans
would absolutely love it. And it's starting to happen. We're not there yet.
We're not there yet, but it's starting to happen.  
  
Q. The first half, Marquette shot 50 percent from 3 and second they shot
25 percent. What led to that change?  
COACH MARTIN: We made some -- our guys were nervous. You know how hard they've
worked to get to this moment? We lost some hard games at the end of the year.
Again, the public opinion is that we stunk and we didn't play well. We played
hard. We just missed shots coming down the stretch and we played postseason
teams on their court and they beat us.  
  
So we were a little gun shy coming out of the regular season. Once our name
went up on the board and I saw our guys' demeanor in practice, the looseness,
the confidence, the aggressiveness, I knew we were going to play well.  
  
But I also knew we had to get past the initial hit of being nervous. I don't
care how many times you coach or play in the NCAA Tournament, that first game,
when the ball goes up, you're nervous. I don't care what anyone says.  
  
And I think we as the half went on, that first half, we settled down. We
started guarding the ball better. Our ball-screen defense got better. We made
some mistakes off the ball, but you know what? Marquette is good. They're not
here by mistake. Offensively they're very, very good.  
  
And they made us -- every time we made a mistake they made us pay. But as the
game went on, I think, we kind of settled down. And when you play a jump-
shooting team, our defense is predicated to try and slow people down as the
game wears on. And I think, I don't want to speak for Marquette or for Wojo,
but I think that they weren't as clean shooting the ball coming down the
stretch as they were early in the game.  
  
Q. Obviously Sindarius has had a fantastic year and he's carried this
team on his back sometimes. How did he get some help tonight and how was that
key to the win?  
COACH MARTIN: That kind of bothers me when I continue to read media saying
we're a one-man team. You don't get to the NCAA Tournament riding one guy.
We're a team. We've got guys that play together.  
  
We've had some great wins this year. And that's because we played the game
together. Too much attention has been paid to the game against Alabama where
his numbers were astronomical. You know what? He carried us that day because I
called every single play for him. That came from me.  
  
But as a team, we've got PJ, Duane, they've been tremendous. But one thing
that goes without being said sometimes is that outside of those three seniors
we are very, very young.  
  
And those young kids have ups and downs. Not too many people, freshmen have
success in the year or get to this tournament. Those kids have been great. Rah
Felder today just fearless. They made a run, he came down, he shot a 3 like,
this is what I do. And I'm sitting there thinking, wow, look at this young
buck, fearless of the moment.  
  
Then he came down and he drove it and scored over their big guy. But they're
young. They made mistake early and as the game went on we settled down. But
Sin's a stud. Sindarius is a stud. He's a winner.  
  
Q. Some of the things you did defensively in the second half, wondered
how did you decide to make some of the moves? For example, the trap to set up
the dunk to make it 55-49. Was it something you planned the whole time,
something you saw, just what led you to do that?  
COACH MARTIN: I didn't want to zone them in the close game, when they had
certain lineups in the game because they have too many -- they can really pass
and too many shooters. But once certain players weren't in the game, I knew I
wanted to zone because they're that good offensively. You can't give them the
same look over and over and over.  
  
And when I saw certain subs in the game, we went to our half-court trap deal
and it worked out. Sometimes you do things and it doesn't work out. It worked
out today and I'm real proud of those guys.  
  
Q. I know you get in that SEC bubble when the season starts. How much do
you know about Duke? Have you seen them a bunch this year just flipping
channels and watching them play?  
COACH MARTIN: I haven't watched Duke play since they've had their team
healthy. I watched -- I love watching Coach K's teams. I've watched them a lot
in non-conference play. Once we get to SEC basketball, I kind of just zero in
our team and our opponents in the league. So I really haven't watched them.  
  
I've got a reporter night tonight. I kind of joke with you guys sleeping til
10:00 in the morning. Well, I've got to live your life today. I'll be up
writing my story til about 4 o'clock in the morning.  
  
But I don't get to sleep until 10 tomorrow. I've got to wake up early and get
these guys ready to go. I'm a huge, huge fan of Coach K's. I've said this
story before. I think you've heard me.  
  
Back as a high school senior, we lost to Tommy Amaker at the Beach Ball
Classic in Myrtle Beach. And I loved how he played. So I said I need to watch
that guy play in college. And I started watching Duke. And you had him on the
ball, Johnny Dawkins in the passing lanes, all that. Between my high school
coach and watching Duke defend is how I've kind of developed my philosophies
defensively.  
  
And I'm a big fan of Coach K, what he does for this game, across the board,
not just Duke basketball, across the board is phenomenal.  
  
We coached against each other once before and they beat us up pretty good.
Kyrie Irving were unguardable that night but they were good. We need to be
real good to be able to compete with a team like Duke in a couple of days.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Mike Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14123)

### [Stephan Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33191)

### [Marvin Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33099)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 103, Texas Southern - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas Southern coach Mike Davis and student-
athletes Stephan Bennett and Marvin Jones. Coach, an opening comment?  
  
COACH DAVIS: We knew we were playing probably one of the best teams in the
country today for sure, but I'm proud of my team for what we did this season.
Like I told our guys, we can't let this take away from winning more games than
anybody's won in school history and winning the conference tournament and the
regular season. North Carolina is just at a totally different level than where
we are as a basketball team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys have faced a lot of top-notch competition early in the
season. Can you talk about what the difference was with North Carolina as
opposed to the teams you faced earlier in the season?  
MARVIN JONES: The difference is it was November then and it's March now. So
they came out with a totally different amount of intensity. They just play
hard. They are just a really good team. You can't take anything away from
them.  
  
I think Coach told us about a stat that they rebounded something like 45
percent of their missed shots and opportunities like that. When you go up
against a beast like that you just have to take it each and every play.  
  
STEPHAN BENNETT: Can you repeat that one more time, the question.  
  
Q. The difference between facing those tough teams earlier in the season
and facing this Carolina team. What was the difference between Carolina and
some of those other teams?  
STEPHAN BENNETT: I mean, during the regular season, I think that playing
Baylor and Cincinnati, I only played half the nonconference schedule. But
playing those teams, they're tough. And then going into the SWAC, it was a
little bit easier, but -- I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your experience just getting into the tournament,
and just the experience from an HBC, you being in this big atmosphere?  
MARVIN JONES: Honestly, you know it's just a big target. When you come from
the SWAC, so you're not a top five conference like that. So when you come in,
it's already -- you already got all odds against you, and everybody's cheering
for you and hoping for you to win.  
  
But like the challenge is so big, like when you go up against a team like
North Carolina, because this team is like already, one of the teams that's
projected to win the tournament. So when you are coming from a SWAC, like a
team like us, they're bigger, stronger, faster, we can't have too many laxes
as a team.  
  
Once you have one mistake and two, and just keep building and building, you
look up at the shot clock, you're down 10, all of a sudden you look up and
you're down 15. It's hard to come back from that because a team like that,
they're going to constantly keep doing the same thing over and over and over
and over again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Player like Justin Jackson, I think a couple times he had some open
shots, but he put up a lot with a hand in his face. What makes him such a
special player?  
COACH DAVIS: He's from Houston. And he's home schooled and I've been knowing
Justin for five years when I got to Houston. He's put the work in. He's always
been a really good basketball player. His mid-range is second to none.  
  
But he improved his jump shot. And I watched him and John Lucas work out a
lot, and he stuck with it. He could have easily -- not got distracted -- but
he projected to come out of college one year, two years, whatever, but he's a
worker and it pays off.  
  
Like I told our guys, he's not going to miss an open shot. If he misses it,
it's not because of anything other than he just missed a shot because he's put
the work in. It's not luck. It's not getting hot. It's just doing what you're
doing every day. And like I said I've been doing it for a long time, and he's
probably one of the hardest workers in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, you've taken a team as far as you can take a team in this
tournament, had a game like this where you didn't make it past the first
round. But is the feeling sort of the same? If a team's giving you everything
they've got to give you, at the end of the year do you have the same emotions,
regardless?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, the reason we play those non-conference games, because we
all set goals, and you need to know if your goals are real or not, if you can
accomplish the goals. And we played Louisville and all those guys. And you
know when we start out our conference games, if we focus, if we're playing at
a 10 effort, 10 toughness and 10 in alertness. And this year we were able to
win at our conference playing at a 5 and a 6.  
  
And I told our guys, in this event no 5 or 6 effort or toughness is going to
win these games. And so today if it would have been in our league, we would
have won the game today. But unfortunately when you go 10-10 and then they
score just before the first timeout, then they go on a run and then we come
back, make some good plays, cut it to 11. The next thing you know it's 19.
Then you come back, next thing you know it's 20.  
  
Well, you have to -- if we don't win a game in our non-conference against a
big power-5 school, it's going to be very tough for us to compete at this
level against those teams. And unfortunately this year, we lost to Louisville
and Baylor and all those guys by a large margin, and today was no different.  
  
But this team, today, we, I think, after playing Louisville and Baylor, it's
unfair to judge them because we played them in November. But that team we
played today was unbelievable.  
  
Q. It was 15 years ago that you took down another school from the ACC,
your Indiana team?  
COACH DAVIS: Was it that long?  
  
Q. I'm afraid so. We were younger then. But when you think back over
your career from Indiana in the Georgia Dome against Maryland for the title
and now Texas Southern, 16 seed, against North Carolina, what do you think
exactly? I was there and now I'm here and that's it?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, what's so special about it to me is that I understand the
feeling. I know what it takes. And trying to get your team to understand it
when they don't see it on a regular basis is difficult. And for me, I just
feel like from tomorrow when we get back, all the way through next year, I'm
going to be preaching and coaching about the effort you have to give, about
the work you have to put in.  
  
I know the feeling. But they don't know the feeling. So it's really hard to
kind of get them to see it. And then once we play our non-conference, they
forget it, because we've been 16-2, 16-2, 16-2 the last three years. So we
only lost six conference games in six years.  
  
I feel this is the first team I have back next year, other than Marvin Jones
and Stephan Bennett, and we have some big guys sitting out. I told all the
guys: Don't forget. Don't forget how hard it is. And don't forget how hard it
is in April, May, June, July, August, because we'll be here again next year.
We'll be here again next year. But if we don't change the way we approach
everything, the way we work, then the results will be the same.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Jordon Varnado](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33116)

### [Wesley Person](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33115)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 87, Troy - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Troy head coach Phil Cunningham and student-
athletes Jordon Varnado and Wesley Person.  
  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: I thought we fought today. And that was the one thing we
wanted to make sure we did was play without fear. And these guys didn't. They
didn't play with no fear.  
  
We didn't start the game off very well getting down 16-4. And we thought we'd
have the jitters and we did. And we played like that. We fought back, cut it
to eight and second half cut it to nine.  
  
They were good today. Duke was really good. They did a terrific job
defensively. But we fought. And just so proud of our guys, just their
mentality all week and showing no fear whatsoever. And when you go into a game
like this, that's the first thing you want is the mentality to be right, and
they were ready to play.  
  
Q. Wesley, we talked in a feature story what it would take for you guys
to come up here and shock the world and do that. You guys played tough, like
Coach said. What was it -- you guys didn't come out firing, dropping 3s, like
you normally do. You put them up, just wouldn't go down. What was it tonight
that things just wouldn't go for you?  
WESLEY PERSON: I guess it was just one of those nights. Shots just weren't
falling for us. But we did some other things on offense good tonight like
driving the ball. But I thought -- felt like we could have cut down on
turnovers early and kept it close. Maybe we would have altered the outcome a
little bit.  
  
Q. For both players, you started out you all looked like you might have
had the jitters coming out, then you all settled down midway second half. Talk
about the mentality you got in this game, how you got settled and how that
mentality manifested itself throughout the game?  
JORDON VARNADO: Like you said, we had jitters coming out at the first, but we
could settle down and calm down and tried to run the offense, try to cut down
on our turnovers. At first we had a lot of turnovers in the first half. We
just had to calm down and just try to play basketball.  
  
WESLEY PERSON: I knew coming in there would be some nerves, first round of the
tournament playing Duke. But I guess as the game went on and we calmed down a
little bit, we cut back into their lead and got it back down to about eight
late in the first half. And we just couldn't ever go on that one more big run
to cut it a little bit closer.  
  
Q. For both players, talking about the first half, seemed like every
time in the first half you'd fight your way back, they'd hit a 3. I think they
were 10-for-17 from 3. Any frustration as that was going on? Did you say, man,
these guys, what do we have to do to stop them?  
JORDON VARNADO: At first it was, because we kept giving them offensive
rebounds and second-chance points and that's how they was hitting the 3s and
transition buckets. We wasn't getting back to our mans and they were hitting
wide open treys.  
  
But we just had to realize the it's a game of runs and we just had to keep
fighting, pushing on. And stuff like that.  
  
WESLEY PERSON: And we knew coming in that they're a good shooting team. And
our turnovers and breakdown in transition led to some open looks. Once they
got it going, they just kept it going throughout the game.  
  
Q. Both you guys scored in double digits today. How do you hope you can
use this game and propel you guys to really just like another successful
season next year?  
WESLEY PERSON: Well, it was a good learning opportunity having a chance to
come here and play in the tournament. And we have a lot coming back. We are
losing three seniors. But we're a pretty deep team, and we got some guys ready
to step into those roles. And it was just a good opportunity for us to play on
the big stage.  
  
JORDON VARNADO: Like Wesley said, we have a lot of guys coming back, but
before this game it was a good feeling. We gotta use this as motivation and
this fire that we have before this game and just try to come back hard and
work during the offseason and just try to push on.  
  
Q. Guys, outside of tonight's, the ending, the outcome tonight, how much
has basketball been for you guys the last month, month and a half?  
WESLEY PERSON: Oh, it's been a fun year. Whenever you have the opportunity to
finally start winning some games, it just makes it a whole lot better and a
whole lot more to enjoy.  
  
JORDON VARNADO: Like Wesley said, it's been a fun year, a great year. But when
the conference tournament started we know we had to stay focused. But also we
enjoyed the ride we had during the conference tournament and the regular
season. And especially when we got here, it's been a great journey this year.  
  
Q. Wes, you and Alex both had some pretty awesome dunks in that game.
Got the crowd going, the Troy fans going. Talk about the support that y'all
had way out here in South Carolina?  
WESLEY PERSON: Our support today was unbelievable. A lot of Troy fans made the
trip here to South Carolina to support us, and they've been with us throughout
the whole year. And they just kept believing in us, and I'm just glad to see
so many Troy fans here in Greenville.  
  
Q. Wes, you guys got within single digits a couple times throughout the
entire game. But what kind of stopped you from even going further than that?  
WESLEY PERSON: They play well offensively and defensively as well. Whenever we
would try to go on those runs, a turnover or something would lead to some easy
opportunities for them in transition. And it's hard to fight back whenever you
turn the ball over.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. 365 days ago, if you can remember back, what was going through your
mind now, and what's going through your mind now -- what was going through
your mind then, and what's going through your mind now and where your program
is?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: Well, we had a tough ending to the year last year. And but
what we did is we signed three guys in the spring that we knew could help push
this team over the edge. We had eight of our top nine guys coming back. We
signed those three guys.  
  
They're probably, outside our office and outside our locker room, there's
probably more hope than faith. And I understand why, but we signed those three
guys. And once they got here, particularly DeVon Walker and what he added in
terms of leadership that we kind of had a void of that until we got him, we
felt like we had the ingredients to make a run like this.  
  
And we probably thought it was a year away, a year ahead of schedule, but to
just get to where we are today, from where we are last year, not only is it
amazing for the team, but it shows the craziness of coaching right now, too,
and how things can change.  
  
Q. The nation definitely recognized Troy today, just being out there and
all year with the football team and everything. Talk about what's next for the
entire athletic program.  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: Well, our athletic program right now is just enjoying
unprecedented success. I mean, the run that we're on, as you mentioned in
football and men's and women's basketball, it's unheard of for a school like
this. And I just think it just builds momentum.  
  
We were probably at a stage where we needed a year like this. We had the North
End Zone project, needed to get that pushed. Football took care of that. And
men's and women's basketball, we've been to a point where we need to try to
get people regularly coming to the Trojan Arena more.  
  
We needed something like this. You can do all the marketing and promotions you
want, but nothing affects it like winning and having success.  
  
So we've got to push, like these guys were talking, push on to that next
level. But this run and what's going on right now in the athletic department
is really, we're in a really good spot.  
  
Q. Obviously a little bit slow coming out of the gate for y'all. Seemed
like they couldn't miss from 3-point range at all throughout the game,
especially in that first half. Talk about how you kept the squad together.  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: Well, we were concerned about two things from a strategic
standpoint: Their shooting, their ability to shoot the ball. If you look at
their numbers, they've shot almost 40 percent as a team. And to play in the
ACC, I guess the kind of defense they play against, that's phenomenal to shoot
as a team. So we knew they were capable of doing what they did today.  
  
The other thing we were concerned about was their length defensively. And it's
ironic that I think both of those concerns came out to be true, because we
really struggled to make shots against their length. We're 5-for-23 on 3s.
Then you turn around and they're 13-for-28.  
  
The third concern we had was they've been here, we haven't been there. How are
our nerves going to be? And sure enough, we get down 16-4. So we just kept
talking about chip away, chip away, and get back in this thing. And we did to
our guys credit.  
  
Because that's one of those things when you you're down 16-4, it can get away
in a hurry against a talented team like that. We didn't allow it to happen
even in the second half. We got it down to 9, but never got it to the point
where we made the pressure mount on them. A bucket here or there and it kind
of would have flipped the other way, and they would have had all the pressure
on them as a higher seed.  
  
Q. There at the end of the ballgame you made a point to empty the bench,
so everyone could get the experience. But especially Whit and draining that
free throw. Just talk about him and what he's done as a walk-on guy?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: When Whit joined the team, we didn't know a whole lot about
him, just knew he was a pretty good player, pretty good walk-on. And what he's
added to the team, he's got an infectious personality. You see our fans love
him, but our players love him, too.  
  
And he's done a good job. And it was -- we had to make sure we got everybody
in the game there, because this is an incredible experience. And it worked out
good because as a coach you worry about let's don't get -- make sure we get
everybody in and not get beat by 30 at the same time. And we kept fighting and
that allowed us to get all those guys in and keep the score where it was.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Arkansas - 77, Seton Hall - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas coach Mike Anderson and student-
athletes Moses Kingsley, Dusty Hannahs and Jaylen Barford.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: Wow, what a game to open up the tournament on Friday. Two
teams I thought that were evenly matched. And it's kind of like the team that
probably had the possession the last was going to win it.  
  
And we went down one and then we made a play on the ball defensively and
Jaylen, I think, came up with a layup. And our guys, again, our guys just
found a way.  
  
It was kind of a grinding game, and then you have some spurts there where each
team went up and put us back and forth.  
  
And my hat's off to Kevin and his team. They're tough because they can attack
and create. And then you've got the leading rebounder in the country in
Delgado. But I thought we did a pretty good job on him.  
  
That's what it took it took a tremendous defensive effort by our basketball
team tonight. I kind of shortened the bench, if you noticed, but I had some
guys that had a nice rhythm going. And I don't know what happened to Moses,
but he awakened today and he was big. But it's a good win for us, and we're
looking forward to advancing.  
  
Q. Moses, what did happen? What was the reason for your awakening?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: I mean, it's win or go home. And I have to bring it. And my
team's looking up to me to bring it in games like this, and I think that's
what I did.  
  
Q. Dusty and Jaylen, you were down eight with about seven minutes left.
What was the mindset? What did you hear from Coach Anderson, and what did you
do differently at that point because seemed like you guys helped slowed down
the Seton Hall guards at that point?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: Coach told us to keep chipping away. He knows we don't lose our
head. We've been down a lot this year. And we just stayed focused on the task
at hand and we knew we had to get stops.  
  
We were trading buckets when we stopped hitting buckets they kept getting
them. Once we started getting stops and pushing the tempo up, the game was
going in our favor.  
  
Q. Jaylen, could you describe the play -- you guys were down 70-69 --
you knocked it away from Carrington. I think you knocked it to Manny. Then you
got down, got the layup. Could you describe that play?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: The free throw?  
  
Q. You hit a layup that put you up by one?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: Oh, that play. Just try to defend like I can, pressure the
ball and just get steals, deflections whatever to get a loose ball. And Manny
always in the right spot when I'm doing this. So that's what happened.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Coach Anderson, what did you think of the Flagrant-1 there
at the end?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I didn't know he was going to push me like that. I never felt
like that. I was surprised he pushed me like that. But I don't know if he was
trying to make a play on the ball or what, but it came in our favor. I knocked
down two free throws, and it helped out a lot.  
  
Q. How does it feel to win a game like that and advance? Because you
have done a really good job in close games. Do you think that experience
helped you guys a lot, Dusty or Jaylen or maybe both of you guys take that?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: Yeah, I definitely think so. We've been in a lot of those this
year. And I know the guys on the team last year, we lost a lot of close ones
like that. So you live and you learn in situations like that. And I think
we're built for close games like that.  
  
You obviously don't want to be -- your dream is to win them comfortably. But
when it's a grinding, a two-point game, I think that's where we're at our
best.  
  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think so as well. I think we don't have no pressure as a
team. We seen them go up by I think eight. We wasn't worried because we knew
we were going to come back and make a run. I think having close games like
that it's good for us.  
  
Q. Moses, as great as your game was today, how big was it the play of
Dustin Thomas?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: It was big. It was huge. He knocked down a few wide-open shots
which we needed because the bigs weren't coming out to guard him. We needed
him to stretch the floor and make good baskets. He was good on the defense. So
he played very, very great, and also in the game to help us get this win.  
  
Q. Moses a lot of people will talk about the win. You got the block with
about 18 minutes left in the game. The guy goes in for a dunk, you put him on
his backside. What did you see and what did you make after that?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Coach said you've got to protect the paint. That's what I
tried to do today. They told me -- because sometimes my guards are going to
get beat I've got to be the last line of defense, and I can't give up anything
easy. That's what I tried to do, go after the ball and I'm very glad I got the
block.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Dusty, what did you guys think of Moses' game today on
both ends because he had a lot of blocks, lot of points?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think he had an outstanding game, honestly, blocking shots.
I think when he got the block, he was about to dunk, that was the turning
point for us because they were up five and he helped us a whole lot to get
back the momentum that we needed. But just protecting the rim and just getting
buckets after buckets, doing what we do best, honestly.  
  
DUSTY HANNAHS: I've played with Moses since tenth grade, and he's just grown
as a player every year that I've ever been around him. And now it's almost
Peak Moses, and I'm glad that the world got to see him. It's fun to play with
him and on that defensive end you better come in there strong or it's going to
get whipped right back out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Carrington, great player, you guys forced turnovers on back-to-back
possessions after you were down by one. How big were those defensive plays?
And what did you think of Jaylen's play? He knocks it away and then he gets
the go-ahead bucket on the other end.  
COACH ANDERSON: Actually, he was playing terrible defense, that matador
defense I tell him he plays. But he was in the right place at the right time
in terms of Jaylen.  
  
He drove the ball behind him and Jaylen was able to deflect it from behind and
I thought it was a big play, especially when we had just went down one point,
missed a free throw and I think they got a layup on the other end.  
  
But what was your other question at the beginning?  
  
Q. Just you forced Carrington, a really good player into back-to-back
turnovers?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought our defense got dialed in right there at the end. We
put Manuale out there and we had I think Dusty off the floor. And we had a
nice group out there, had a nice rhythm.  
  
They were locked in. I mean coming off the screen, I thought Moses came up
there one time and we doubled up on them.  
  
I thought our guys -- I thought fatigue was a factor in this game. Sometimes
fatigue happens, your decision-making is not as quick. Early in the game they
were attacking us, getting to the basket, whipping that ball around.  
  
But as the game went on, they kind of slowed down all those decisions. So I
would like to think that was part of it as well as our guys were they were in
that moment. And they made plays defensively.  
  
Q. When your team when they were on the 9-0 run you called timeout. I
was curious what you shared with your kids because I know it was two
3-pointers and an and-one that got them to nine-point run. What did you say to
your kids to get them to bounce back the way they did?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought, 1 we had to settle down and get back to doing what.
In the first half it was even, a close game. We were guarding, we were
defending, and I thought we lost our composure, I really did.  
  
I always say you're going to win championships or you win games with defense.
I thought we went offensive-minded. We started trying to do it individually.
So I told our guys that's not who we are.  
  
And I think once we did that and we got some baskets we went right inside to
Moses, we went into the bell cow and he made buckets, got to the free-throw
line. And now we get Delgado in foul trouble. So it was an effort of really
let's establish inside.  
  
And it's amazing how that opens up the outside and then now you get to the
free-throw line. We thought we could go off the dribble on those guys, and it
really came in hand during those times when they went up that we were on the
run. It's a game of runs. So we had to run to come back at them.  
  
Q. There seems to be consensus people who've seen the replay of the
flagrant foul, that was a borderline call. I'm curious what did you see when
you saw it, and what were your thoughts on a call like that, a turning point
in the game that was so close?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought it was no play on the ball. That's as simple as
that. There was no play on the ball. He pushed the guy down. You saw it. I saw
it. I mean, what's borderline when you say, you know what, he didn't play on
the ball. So we've had some like that take place, too.  
  
So it just came at a bad time, probably the right time for us. But I just
didn't think there was a play on the ball.  
  
Q. You got some great play out of Dustin Thomas today. Just talk about
his minutes and what he added to the game?  
COACH ANDERSON: That was probably start to finish Dustin Thomas's best game as
a Razorback. It was needed, because their defensive scheme was to stack, was
packing in there and guard Moses and leave that forward open.  
  
And so he knocked down some shots. I thought he was active defensively. On
switches he was guarding guards. He looked like he was real confident. And
that's the most minutes he's played, the most minutes he's played this year.  
  
So it was productive and it was much needed. We're the ultimate team. You've
got to have somebody, somebody to step up for you, and we had four guys in
double figures. And you look at the bench, seven points off our bench. That's
very rare. But the beauty of that is now the starters, we have four starters
that all scored. They scored in double figures.  
  
Q. You guys had an advantage in turnovers, points off of turnovers. What
was one of the keys of you guys being able to get out get on an early run off
of turnovers?  
COACH ANDERSON: It's funny, because in the first half we only got two points
off turnovers. I think we missed about five layup opportunities, whether we
charged or not make the right decision or they make a great play and block it.  
  
And I thought in the second half we made, once we sped them up or turned them
over, I thought we made better decisions with the basketball. We're a team, a
second half team. You don't know when it's going to come, those runs are going
to come those turnovers are going to come.  
  
And today we needed that. We had 12 steals. We needed it because they were
just attacking us on the glass, 21 offensive rebounds. You don't win those
kind of games unless -- you've got to change the possession game some kind of
way, and I think that was the difference in the game today. We utilized those
turnovers and scored off of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned the rebounds there, Coach. We talked about it all week,
you needed to control yourself on the glass. Did you ever imagine a game you
could win being minus-14 in that category?  
COACH ANDERSON: We've done it before. It's not something I marvel at, but
we've done it before. We've got to get better at it, as we continue to move in
this tournament, we've got to get much, much better at it.  
  
But you've got to remember Seton Hall, that's what they do. They put it up
there and go get it. When you've got Delgado, we paid a whole lot of attention
to him. So now when you've got other guys that are getting rebounds for them.
So we've got to get better at that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

### [Luke Fischer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26181)

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marquette student-athletes Luke Fischer, Markus
Howard and Katin Reinhardt.  
  
Q. Katin, what is it -- you show up on a team and they end up getting
into the NCAA. Is that how it works?  
KATIN REINHARDT: It's a blessing for me to be part of the three teams that
have been in the NCAA Tournament. I've just been fortunate to be on teams that
are good enough to make it in March.  
  
Q. I've never been to one of your practices, but I wonder if one of you
could give me an idea of the intensity level of your practices?  
LUKE FISCHER: They're pretty intense. Coach wants the best from us. He comes
from a great pedigree of coaching before him. So he expects a lot from us.
They're intense, a lot of up and down, a lot of contact, but in the end he
gets the job done.  
  
Q. Markus, when you go to the NCAA Tournament, you expect to play at
more of a neutral venue. But playing South Carolina in Greenville, it seems
like it's going to be more of a home atmosphere for South Carolina. So how do
you guys wrap that around your head?  
MARKUS HOWARD: We'll we're going to try to treat it as any other road game in
the Big East, but as a team we're just fortunate and happy to be in the
position we are, and we're excited to play, we're ready and excited for the
challenge.  
  
Q. The game is being billed as one of the top 3-point shooting teams
against one of the top defensive teams against the three. What have you seen
of South Carolina's defense that makes them good?  
MARKUS HOWARD: We've seen in film of South Carolina, I mean, they're a great
team. We've seen that they like to pressure the ball, and pressure off the
ball as well. So just pinpointing that in preparation for us has been a key
part of what we've been doing to practice and prepare for South Carolina.  
  
Q. Markus, Luke mentioned about the pedigree, Steve's pedigree. Does he
ever talk about this is the way they do things at Duke or did things when he
was at Duke?  
MARKUS HOWARD: No. Coach, he's part of the Marquette family now. So he keeps
things pretty focused on that perspective.  
  
But I mean we all know his pedigree. We all know his background. So just his
knowledge of the game, we all try and pinpoint different aspects of where he's
been and try to learn from every aspect possible.  
  
Q. Given, Markus, what you said about Coach Wojciechowski's pedigree, do
you know what it means if you were to advance and he gets to coach against his
mentor in Coach K?  
MARKUS HOWARD: We're all focused on South Carolina. That's our first and
foremost, No. 1 concern. We're just going to take it one game at a time and
just focus on that at the moment right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Wojciechowski.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We're incredibly excited to be here. I'm so happy for my
players, my staff, the entire Marquette community. It's an honor and a
privilege to play in the NCAA Tournament. I think our guys are very excited
about earning the right to be here and we're looking forward to tomorrow
night's game for South Carolina.  
  
Q. Mike mentioned that he thought you've done a really good job with
Marquette of taking the players you have and molding your style of play around
that. Is that by design? And ultimately you want to get it back to being more
of the way you played at Duke and coached at Duke?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I assume by Mike, you meant Coach. I'm not used to
referring to him like that.  
  
But I think one of the things Coach has always talked about to all of his --
the guys who have worked for him, is figuring out how to put your team in the
best position to win. And with the way we've played this year, I think it
gives our team the best opportunity to win.  
  
I think, obviously, I learned a lot from Coach in my time at Duke, but I think
everybody's got to be their own person and make their own decision. So
hopefully decisions that my staff and I have made for this team have been good
ones.  
  
Q. You've obviously been to a lot of NCAA Tournaments. Is this any
different because of you being a head coach and taking this team here?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, they're all special, but I don't think any of them
are more special than this. Like I said in the opening statement, the thing
I'm most excited about is that our players get to experience this. We have a
number of guys on our roster, all but one, who have never been part of the
NCAA Tournament. And I think the NCAA Tournament's the greatest sporting event
there is. And so for our guys to experience this and for me to get to go along
on that ride with them, it's something that I'll always cherish.  
  
Q. Pretty much the same subject, but are there things that you took from
the Duke program that you want to put the same stamp on your program, not
necessarily the style of play, but in just the overall program?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: The type of experience players have, the pursuit of
excellence, both on and off the court, the relationships, the type of
experience the players have, not only as a player at Marquette but as a
student-athlete at the university. Those are all things that I want the guys
at our place here at Marquette to feel.  
  
Q. Steve, what have you seen out of South Carolina so far this week on
film?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, it's really been fun for me to study South
Carolina, obviously. I have utmost respect for Frank Martin, and in learning
more about them, they play exactly like a Frank Martin team, what you would
expect them to play.  
  
They play incredibly hard. I think they're as good a defensive team as we've
played against all year. When you watch them play, not many people play
defense like them anymore. There's been a trend in college basketball to go
into more prevent defenses, pack-line defenses, and to watch them play and get
out in passing lanes, contest every pass, really be aggressive in that
respect, you know, as a coach it's fun to watch. But as a coach it's not fun
at the same time when you have to play against them. And so we know we have
our hands full against an outstanding team in their backyard, really.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about having players that have not been to the
tournament. How do you keep them loose, having to play the late night game
tomorrow night? They're going to be anxious to play. How will you keep them
focused?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think in some respects it's an advantage to be able --
although we've been very busy today with our preparation, whether we're at
meals, whatever, you get to see the games going on -- you really start to feel
a part of the tournament.  
  
For our team, we have to shoot our bullets, and we need to go into the game
not holding anything back. People who have asked you seven months ago if you
thought your team would have been in this position, most, quote/unquote,
experts would have said no. So our guys have played at their best when they've
been loose and free and determined, and that's how we want to go into the game
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How often do you and Coach K communicate during the season or during
the offseason, and is it all basketball talk or is it beyond that?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We communicate quite a lot. Obviously during the season
it's harder to get somebody on the phone. I mean, we're both -- we have a lot
of responsibilities with our own team.  
  
But obviously we communicate quite a bit in season and then we talk out of
season as well. He's one of the people I'm closest to in my life. So that's
the type of relationship we have. I appreciate everything that he's done for
me as a player, as an assistant coach, and now being somebody I can lean on as
a head coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
GREENVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+GREENVILLE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Justin Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26736)

### [Theo Pinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30899)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Justin Jackson
and Theo Pinson.  
  
Q. Nonsensical question for you, the hats. You sent out that photo. I
already spoke to Shea up in New York about making them. How did you guys come
about choosing the design you did? And how do you feel now that you have
them?  
THEO PINSON: Shea has been wearing those hats all year. And they were cool.
Every hat he has is really cool. So Shea, you can make it for the team. And he
said, yeah, that would be awesome. He's been working his butt off to get it
ready for the tournament.  
  
And all we really did was pick out the design of how like he would mold the
hat and the color. And he did everything else. Everything on the hat was his
idea. I mean, the dude has a gift.  
  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, I'm not a very artsy person. So I just told him to do
whatever style he felt fit me best. But, yeah, he put in so much time. I mean,
he stayed up late doing it. Anytime he had free time he was at the gym working
on them. So they did a great job and like Theo said, he's got a gift.  
  
Q. Do you feel you can carry them off? Does it make you feel like a man
when you're wearing?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, gives you a different type of confidence, I guess, to be
able to pull it off. We're blessed to have him.  
  
THEO PINSON: I look great in it.  
  
Q. Justin, Roy was telling us the other day that he had made it a point
to have a couple of conversations with you since Brooklyn, just about your
shooting and maybe trying to get your confidence back. Have those been
helpful? And what did you think about those conversations?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Yes, sat with Coach in his office and talked to him a little
bit. My confidence isn't gone. I mean, it was four games that I have not shot
the ball well. And that's all it is. And so for me, still going to shoot the
ball the same way, still going to be aggressive, still going to do everything
I've been doing all year.  
  
It's not like all of a sudden the world is ending. And I got in the gym a
bunch after the ACC Tournament. And I've been doing the same exact things I've
been doing all year.  
  
And so talking to him, obviously, he just wanted to reiterate that he still
has the same confidence in me and the coaching staff. I know my teammates have
the same confidence in me, but the coaching staff, they still feel the same
exact way about me and still want me to do the exact same things I was doing.
So there's no change. Just gotta get back to working on it.  
  
Q. Justin, looking at the roster, Texas Southern has three Houston guys
on there. Do you know any of them? Have you played against any of them, and
what can you tell us about Texas Southern?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Texas Southern is in Houston, if I can remember right. So I
mean that was right down the road from where I used to work out all the time.
I know the coach pretty well.  
  
It's going to be a fun game. Obviously they're here for a reason. So we've
gotta go in there and play as hard as we possibly can. Like you said, there's
a bunch of guys from Houston that are there.  
  
Actually one of my teammates because one of the ones that actually left to go
for the football track, but it's a really good team. They just happen to be
from Houston.  
  
Q. Do you know any of their guys?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I don't. If I went back and actually tried to think through
some of the guys on the team, I might. But I haven't really done a ton of
research as far as like who the people are and stuff like that.  
  
Q. You've got a long ways to go, but if you guys end up playing Duke in
the finals, how thrilling would that be for you? What would that mean for each
of you guys?  
THEO PINSON: It will be awesome. That means we're in the national
championship, first of all. I mean, it's a long way to go. I can't even think
about Duke right now. Right now, honestly, I'm going to focus on tomorrow. But
that would be one game that everybody will be watching.  
  
Q. For both of you, at tournament time, how much is it about focusing on
your game, your game plan as opposed to scouting the other team and knowing
what their tendencies are?  
THEO PINSON: I think it's a little easier to focus on what you have been doing
all year. You know, it's different when you come from conference play.
Everybody knows what you're doing. And once you go into tournament play, the
team you're playing most likely hasn't played against you for a long time or
whatever. And they won't be accustomed to what we do and stuff like that. And
we won't be accustomed to them also.  
  
So, I mean, it's about Xs and Os at some point. But at the same time you want
to continue to do what you do. And we're really trying to -- we're just trying
to focus on what we do offensively and defensively.  
  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I think to piggyback off what Theo said, we're playing against
a team that obviously hasn't seen us play all year, and we haven't seen them
play all year. And so it's a little more fun. Playing in the ACC, I mean, the
teams, they know every tendency you have they know every single player that
you have.  
  
So for us, we have to go in there, Coach kept reiterating the fact that they
haven't seen us all year, so we have to do the things we know make us
successful. And so that's where to draw up plays, do all the little things
that against teams in the ACC they might be able to read that out, but against
teams that maybe didn't see us all year, maybe it will work out. So for us,
it's focusing on us and making sure to focus on the new team we're playing as
well.  
  
Q. Tell me a little bit about the cowboy hats. Whose idea was it, and
kind of some background?  
THEO PINSON: Our teammate, Shea Rush, beginning of the year he started wearing
hats. Actually every road trip he's been wearing a hat. And he always had
different designs and stuff. We was like, Shea, could you make a hat for the
whole team and the coaches? And he said he was all for it.  
  
And he's been working on it since. I don't even know when. But he's been
working countless hours to just get it ready for the tournament. And they were
finally done yesterday. And we wore it on the plane. And we're going to sport
them as long as we go.  
  
Q. What's the reaction you got from people on the plane, and is it kind
of like a team bonding thing to help you relax going into the tournament?  
THEO PINSON: No, I mean I guess you could say that. We just like the hats. And
he spent so much time wearing them, if you don't wear them, it's selfish.  
  
But every hat is cool. And we were all ready to get them. And really proud --
I'm really proud of Shea what he did for the team. He really cared about it a
lot and we did also.  
  
Q. Theo, now that you're a starter and you're invited up to the podium,
have you designated a designated press conference crasher this year?  
THEO PINSON: It's about time I've been up here. I'm just playing. (Laughter).
But I mean, it's cool.  
  
Q. In your losses Joel has kind of struggled. How important, obviously,
is he to your team, and does he kind of understand that, I'm sure?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I'll take that one. Joel knows that he's a huge part of our
team. In those games that we lost he didn't go out there and say, I'm going to
struggle tonight.  
  
Everybody has bad games. Everybody struggles. Everybody, the ball doesn't fall
in the hoop the same way every single game.  
  
So unfortunately when a big-time player for a team might struggle one night,
it might hurt the whole team.  
  
But at the end of the day even those games that we lost it wasn't on him. But
Joel, he definitely has the same confidence that he's always had. He's the
same exact Joel Berry that everybody's talked about, everybody's praised. And
he's definitely deserving of all of that praise and he's going to go out there
and play it like whenever the game starts tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Coach, in your losses Joel has struggled. Have you seen any kind of
common theme in those games where he hasn't been at his best? We all know
obviously how important he is to your success?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, usually to break it down even as strictly as you can,
the ball doesn't go in the basket for him. He hasn't had many of those games
where people use the word struggle where his shot has gone in or he's gotten
in foul trouble.  
  
But he's extremely important. It's sort of like -- you know, in football it's
only one of 11 guys; in basketball, it's one of five. If that one of five
happens to be your point guard I think it's exaggerated even more. So he sets
the line of our defense. He's a tremendous outside shooter. He pushes the
pace. He does all those kind of things. And when it's not going well for him,
it is a big loss.  
  
Q. What did you think of the cowboy hats?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I didn't necessarily think they were cowboy hats. Is that what
you think they are?  
  
Q. What did you think of the hats?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Could be Mafia hats. Who knows? I like 'em. I've got one.
We're going to have a team picture made today with everybody -- we'll have a
team picture today with everybody, coaches included, with the hats. I don't
look good in a hat at all, may not look good anyway, but I know I don't look
good in a hat. But I'm going to try to put mine on. He asked me what color,
what band. All that stuff. Hats by Shea. It's a pretty neat deal.  
  
Q. You've obviously been previously outspoken on many occasions about
the HB2 stuff. Has that ship sailed now that you're here, or are you conscious
of it being here?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I still think I'm conscious of it being here because I'm
afraid what's going to happen in the next few years. I hope to coach a little
bit longer.  
  
I hope this is not my last hoorah kind of thing. I'm very sad, very
disappointed about the whole thing, what apparently is something that's
really, really hard to change.  
  
But people in Greenville have been great. We already practiced today at the
school right out of town. And they were great. I asked them if they painted
their floor trim Carolina blue because we came and, no, that was their colors.
It bothers me. It's really something. It's very, very sad to me, to be honest
with you. It's one of the best press conferences I've ever been to.  
  
Q. How much of an inconvenience is it really to be a No. 1 seed and kind
of have to go on the road like this?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't really look at it like that. I love to, when I was at
Kansas, playing close to home and North Carolina playing close to home. If I
can't play close to home I say give me the warmest place, because I'm tired of
the wintertime.  
  
But I don't really look at it like that. I just think, again, sad is the
commentary I'd probably use, the word I would use, because the people in the
state of North Carolina and the kids in the state of North Carolina aren't
getting the opportunities that we've had in the past. And I think that's the
biggest thing with me right there. It's just it's not the way I'd like for it
to be.  
  
Q. One question on Jayson Tatum, you've seen him quite a bit in the last
month or so, and he's really taken off since then. What do you think has been
the difference with him? And did you notice -- even the first game against you
guys where he kind of went off in the second half as a turning point for him
-- what makes him so good this last month?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think with every freshman you have no idea when the light
bulb is going to go on. The more gifted you are you hope it goes on a lot
quicker if you're their coach.  
  
I've recruited Jayson very hard, saw him play tons of times. The injury -- I
apologize I can't remember what his injury was, I know he missed some time
early -- so it's probably getting healthy is the biggest thing, the
familiarity and then being all of a sudden to able to do things that he was
able to do in high school gave him more confidence. But I think it's just
father time gave him a little bit of help getting over the injuries, and maybe
when he did get started in there, it was a little bit later than everybody
else. So he may have fresher legs now too, but I just think getting healthy
was probably the biggest thing from the outside looking in.  
  
Q. What problems does Texas Southern present?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Looking, first of all, it's scary when someone -- I'm going to
miss this, I probably shouldn't say this -- 19 out of the last 21 games or
something like that. Played 16 straight games on the road. I've known Mike a
long time. He was an assistant coach at Indiana and head coach at Indiana.  
  
I think taking the road on the team like that to help them financially and
probably taught them some tough love kind of thing with the adversity they
faced.  
  
You look at them, they've got four starters averaging double figures, and I
think Marvin's like 9.6. So they're a balanced team. Trey Jefferson, the speed
and quickness that he does things with, -Lofton, the things he does to you
inside/outside, averages six or seven free throws a game.  
  
So it's the kind of team that I don't like to play because everybody scores,
not just one guy. I think it's always a little easier to guard when only --
the team only has one guy to score unless it's like Malik did us in Vegas when
he got 47.  
  
They don't mind a fast pace, so I know our pace isn't going to bother them.
They play man-to-man. They know who they are. They know their strengths, know
their weaknesses. There's a reason they're here. When you go through league
play and only lose twice and then turn around and win your conference
tournament again, that's pretty impressive. There's a lot of things, there's
not just one that jumps out.  
  
Q. You were talking about freshmen to begin with but in particular
Seventh Woods. I was just talking to him. He said in the beginning he battled
confidence issues because a kid like him was making such a big impact. How
have you brought him along to make him a more confident player to come off the
bench to contribute?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I haven't made him a confident player. I wish I could have
done a better job. But the biggest thing with Seventh is he's been battling
injuries since the end of his senior year in high school. He got hurt at the
end of his senior year, didn't play in many of the all-star games or anything
in the spring because he was hurt.  
  
Came to Chapel Hill in the summer and went to one session of summer school,
then starts practice -- we played, I can't tell you when it was, but we played
quite a few games. I said, on a scale of one to ten where's your body?  
  
He said five or six. I know a month or so ago we got it up to an eight. When
you're a freshman, No. 1, point guard, No. 2, somebody throws a lot of things
at you if they play the way we do. So we've thrown a lot of things at him
mentally.  
  
Then the biggest thing is that he wasn't as healthy as we needed him to be and
as he wanted to be, because when he's healthy he's got a gear that a lot of
people don't have.  
  
And so just recently we've started seeing Seventh do the things that we
thought he could do all along. But because of his body and aches and pains and
not being healthy, he lost some of his confidence there, and I haven't been
able to get him back to where I'd like for him to be confidence-wise.  
  
But I say this, and I believe it other than his mom and his dad, nobody thinks
he's going to be as good a player as Roy Williams does.  
  
Q. With the way the last year ended, what kind of motivation has that
served, especially now that tournament time is here?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's two ways. The way that last year ended, meaning
the final shot that we lost the national championship game, I'm hoping that
motivated them. And we talked about it, providing some motivation or fuel to
work extremely hard in the offseason. And then when practice started, I said,
it's motivation for that reason and it's motivation because what we did last
year was great.  
  
Everybody in the country would have loved to have done what we did last year.
There was only one team that enjoyed it more than we did. So I think just for
me, talking to the kids and reminding them how much fun it was last year,
let's try to do that again.  
  
So I think we've used it as motivation a little bit. But kids maybe not be
driven as old guys like me because of something that happened. They may just
want it because they want it themselves and that's okay. But I do try to
remind them how much fun we had last year also, not just the hurt of the last
shot.  
  
Q. I wanted to not talk about tomorrow especially but 32 years we've
never had a 16 beat a 1. Is it going to happen or is it close to happening at
some point?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Who knows. I'll tell you what. Every coach of the No. 1 always
worries like the Dickens about it the night before. It's something you always
think about.  
  
I forget what year it was but I'm going to guess 2002, when I was at Kansas,
we were right there. We were a 1 seed in St. Louis playing against Holy Cross.  
  
And Kirk Hinrich got hurt during the course of the game. We were right there
starting to make history and the kids made some big plays down the stretch and
we ended up winning the game.  
  
Yeah, I'd say it's probably going to. That's just the way I look at it. If I'm
a 1 seed let's just put it off for another year. If I were a 2 seed, I
wouldn't care. Probably happy (laughter). Get it out of my way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Seton Hall student-athletes Angel Delgado, Desi
Rodriguez and Khadeen Carrington.  
  
Q. All three of you, Angel, what makes you such a great rebounder?
What's your attitude about rebounding? Both his teammates, talk about what you
think about his rebounding, what makes him such a good rebounder?  
ANGEL DELGADO: I think it's just something God gave me because I really cannot
explain it. It's like, how can I tell you this, it's like, I always play hard.
When you play hard you can get anything you want.  
  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: He said about his rebounding? Like he said, I think it's a
gift because if you know him you can't jump over a stack of newspapers, but he
get every rebound. But it's just a gift he got.  
  
DESI RODRIGUEZ: It's like nothing I ever saw before. I never saw a great
rebounder like Angel before. Coach scream at me for rebounding but it's hard
to rebound the ball when Angel is in there. He kind of takes all my rebounds.
But it's definitely a gift and I'm excited for him.  
  
Q. Tell me the value of Ish. He doesn't really score but when you watch
you play, he's so valuable. Why is he so valuable that he rarely scores?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: This is tough. A lot of things he do it will show up on
the stat sheet. He's our best defender, I would say. Keep us together. He's
just a hustler. And every team needs somebody like that, and that's our guy.  
  
DESI RODRIGUEZ: It's just the most hard-working person on our team. He gets
after it on defense and he challenge everybody to make them better. Like
Khadeen said, it don't show up in the stat sheet, but he definitely pulled out
a lot of wins for us this year. And he's great.  
  
ANGEL DELGADO: I think he's one of the best defenders in our league because
everything he do on the court, he do the little things. When he do the little
things, that makes you a good player or a great player. I think he's a really
good player in our league, and for me he's the best defender, too.  
  
Q. Khadeen, how would you say you guys are going to try to match
Arkansas's tempo? You know they really like to play fast. They average 80
points per game. What have you guys seen on film?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: We definitely see they like to play fast. They kind of
play like Creighton. Creighton like to play up and down like that. So we kind
of compare them to Creighton.  
  
But we like to get up and down also. But we just want to play at our pace.
Sometimes we're going to play fast. Sometimes we're going to slow down, so we
just try to keep it at our pace.  
  
Q. What happened to you guys last year in the first round, knowing that,
how has your approach changed this year on a day like today, even a day like
tomorrow? What's the difference between this year and last year for you
guys?  
DESI RODRIGUEZ: This year I believe we have more experience. Last year we took
a big step in winning the Big East championship and we didn't know how big --
maybe we didn't know how big the NCAA Tournament was.  
  
So this year, knowing we're going to be more hungry coming in and being more
focused, and the junior class and some of the guys that was here last year
know what it was, knows what it takes to win. So this year I'd definitely say
we have more experience.  
  
Q. Khadeen, piggybacking on that question, does it help this year to
know you guys have the extra day now, you're playing on Friday? Was everything
rushed last year, the way everything went down?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: Yeah, I definitely say so. It was definitely rushed. Like
Desi said, we just came off winning the Big East championship, so I guess we
were still on our Big East championship high. I guess we didn't take the NCAA
as important as we should have.  
  
Even though it was a big step for us, I don't think we were experienced enough
or we knew enough to take it that serious. But this year I think we took a big
step forward. So, yeah, we're definitely more hungry this year.  
  
Q. Angel, what do you know about Moses Kingsley, Arkansas' 6'10 "
center, and your thoughts about matching up against him?  
ANGEL DELGADO: I think he's a great player, a good player. I think he'll give
me a good battle in the post. But I'm not focused -- I'm the type of player
that doesn't focus on one guy, I got to focus from the point to the center.
That's how I play, and that's how our game is.  
  
Q. You guys all decided to come. You talked about making history,
bringing the program back to where it was. Last year, as big of a step as last
year was, how important of a step is it to advance in the NCAA Tournament this
year. Just Khadeen?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I think it's a big step for us. Like I said, we won the
Big East championship, and that was one of our goals coming in. And this year,
we made it back to the NCAA Tournament. So definitely a win right now would
definitely, that's another goal of ours. So we definitely are working towards
that goal.  
  
Q. What would the significance be of advancing in the tournament after
losing early last year?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: It will be great for us, individually, for the program. So
it will be great all around. That's why we're working, we're working now to
get a W.  
  
Q. For Khadeen and Desi, Arkansas plays maybe 10 guys or more double-
digit minutes. What do you think about their depth? And how big a concern is
wear and tear, or do you feel like with all these TV timeouts and everything
it's not as big an issue?  
DESI RODRIGUEZ: We just gotta study film and just see how they -- what their
style of play. We know they like to get up and down. I feel if we can stop
their guards we can probably slow them down a bit. They have a deeper depth on
the bench and more guards that come into the game. But if we stay solid and
just defend and stop them from running so much, we maybe have a good chance of
winning.  
  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: They definitely are deep on the bench, deeper than us. But
definitely the TV timeouts play a role, get us more rest. And if we just focus
on keeping the guards out of the lane, keeping them from hitting 3s -- number
three, number four, keeping them from hitting 3s -- I think we have a great
chance of winning.  
  
Q. You guys said you're hungry. How would you describe just the mindset
right now compared to what it was last year?  
DESI RODRIGUEZ: More hungry, we mean we're more focused and we're taking it
one step at a time. We was here last year. We know what everything is about.
We know what it takes to win and what we have to do to win. And we have to
prepare well and that's what we've been doing so far.  
  
We're going to get out and practice and just go up and down, make sure we're
in great shape for tomorrow, because we know they like to get up and down.
Last year we was kind of, maybe I'd say tired, or we were just tired coming
off a great win over Villanova.  
  
So this year we're more focused. We got a lot of rest, and we're just looking
to go out and have a great game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Kevin Willard.  
  
Q. Do you feel a different vibe this year as opposed to last year, just
the extra day to prepare, just not coming off a Saturday game? Is it a
different experience, especially with your players having gone through all
this?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I definitely think the vibe is the same. I think our
attitude is a little bit different. Again, last year was such a whirlwind,
winning the Big East Tournament and the Selection Show and leaving for Denver
that Monday.  
  
I don't think we ever recovered emotionally. Physically I think we were fine,
but emotionally I don't think we ever got back on track.  
  
This year, with a tough loss to Nova, we're able to have two days where we
kind of can get back and get normal. And we've had a normal week of
preparation.  
  
So I think it's just kind of, you know, you're still excited to be in a
tournament, Selection Sunday was awesome, being at the house with everyone's
families.  
  
But I think we're still excited and it's awesome to be in the tournament. But
I think we're a little more rested and a little more emotionally back to where
we normally are.  
  
Q. In all of your days as a player and coach do you remember anyone
quite as unique as Ish? He doesn't score as much but it's clear how valuable
he is?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I mean, and it's been a tough year for Ish, because -- I
just talked to him in my office before we left. He got hurt at Georgetown on
February 4th. And he's only played technically three games since February 4th.  
  
So he hasn't had quite the year that I think he was expecting or maybe we were
expecting. But he is as valuable to us as Angel, Khadeen, Desi, because of
what he does on the defensive end and from an energy standpoint. He's a
difference-maker that doesn't show up in the box score.  
  
Q. Arkansas, you know they go about ten guys deep, sometimes even 11.
What's your thoughts about their depth? And they usually outscore teams in the
second half. What's your thoughts on the wear-and-tear aspect and how you can
neutralize that?  
COACH WILLARD: It's not an easy thing to neutralize. It's quite impressive
having, in today's, especially this time of year, still being able to go 10 or
11 deep. Just about everybody shortens their rotation to maybe eight. Even in
the SEC championship game, they were bringing subs in late in the second half,
guys hadn't played a whole lot.  
  
I think that's what Mike's teams try to do. They've always tried to do that. I
think he's successful in that. I think the most impressive part about Arkansas
is their guard depth. It's very hard to get four or five guards to come in
play at a high level.  
  
If you look at what Barford is doing, his last eight games has been as
impressive as anything. And the fact that Mike still plays ten guys this time
of year is more impressive.  
  
Q. What have you guys done to prepare for pace of play, tempo?  
COACH WILLARD: You know, their tempo is a lot like Creighton. I think we're
lucky that we have someone in our league that plays as fast as them. Creighton
really likes to get up and down, outscore you, get in the 80s, put a lot of
pressure on you.  
  
So we've kind of gone back to our practice plans when we go against Creighton.
A lot of transition defense drills. But I think it's going to be a little bit
of a shocker for us when we first go out there, because we haven't -- Nova
plays a really slow tempo. Marquette plays a fast tempo, but not really.
DePaul doesn't play a fast tempo.  
  
So most of our league that we've played in the second half is a grind-it-out
style. We haven't played Creighton since early February.  
  
So a matter of just getting our guys used to transition defense, constantly
getting back. It's something that I think it's going to take us a little time
in the game to get adjusted to because we just haven't seen it in a while.  
  
Q. Question about Moses Kingsley, how he's a rim protector, how he's
impressed you on film?  
COACH WILLARD: I like Moses because of the way he runs the floor. I think the
amount of pressure he puts on opposite bigs. Obviously he can block shots.
He's physical down low.  
  
They can switch pick and rolls with him. They can trap pick and roles with
him. He can play one-on-one in the post, they can trap in the post.  
  
But I think what's most impressive is a guy his size with his physicality that
can run up and down the floor and get deep post position is really impressive.  
  
There's not too many big guys that have the motor and the stamina that he does
for the minutes he's playing. So he's been -- not only is he impressive on the
defensive end, but the offensive end the way he runs the floor.  
  
Q. With your NBA background, is there anybody that from the NBA days
that reminds you of the way Angel rebounds? Or anybody in college? Did you
know he was going to be this kind of rebounder when you signed him? I'm sure
you knew he would be good, but did you think he would be this good?  
COACH WILLARD: We call Angel Moses Malone, to be honest with you. I know Moses
wasn't in the league when I was there. But I remember watching Moses.  
  
Angel's tremendous at following his own shot and using his lower body to get
position. He doesn't out-jump you. He doesn't out-quick you. But he's really
good at reading where the ball is going to come off.  
  
He also understands -- he's very smart, in fact, he understands what offensive
play and who is going to shoot the basketball. And it's like, a little like
Dennis Rodman, always knew how Scottie Pippen always hit the back rim, or
Michael's shot always hit soft. Angel is very smart which guys are shooting
the basketball.  
  
He reminds me of Moses Malone, in the fact that he'll get it, he'll out-muscle
you down low. If he misses it, he's got a great motor to follow it. And he
usually gets fouled on the second one or gets a score on the second or third
one.  
  
And when we signed him, it was what I loved about him most was his motor. He
was a relentless rebounder in high school, he really was.  
  
He didn't have many other skills, but he was a relentless rebounder in high
school.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina student-athletes Sindarius
Thornwell, Duane Notice and PJ Dozier.  
  
Q. I'm sure you didn't finish the regular season the way you wanted to
but you're here now. Have you talked about how none of that matters the last
month if you just go out and play a great game tomorrow night?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Yeah, that's really what we talked about is just going
out and having fun and embracing the moment. And that's really it, forgetting
about everything that's happened in the regular season and in the SEC
Tournament and just going out and playing our game and enjoying every moment.
Just glad we're going on.  
  
DUANE NOTICE: Not really too concerned about the future, not too concerned
about the past, but trying to focus on being the best we can be everyday
individually and as a team, trying to embrace the moment, like Sin said. It's
a great experience to be out here and we're just trying to get better every
day.  
  
PJ DOZIER: Just to piggyback what they said, those wins that we got in the
past don't even really matter anymore. It's like a 0-0 record. So we just
focus on getting the next win.  
  
Q. Sin, if you can just talk me about your reaction when you're watching
Selection Sunday and you find out you're going to Greenville?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Yeah, so Coach had talked to us, like, before it came on
and stuff to the returners, and was telling us what he thought and stuff like
that. And so we always was thinking that we was about to be, like, a tenth
seed, be headed somewhere far.  
  
So when we got the seventh seed and playing in Greenville, we all was happy we
got to stay home and stay and play in front of our fans and didn't have to
travel so far away and just happy, excited and ready to play.  
  
Q. Sin, how many times have you heard from fans: You gotta win the game;
we haven't won a NCAA game in my lifetime, in 44 years or whatever it is? Have
you heard that a lot this week?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: No, nobody's said we gotta win a game or nobody said
anything like that. Everybody just trying to do what they can to relieve the
pressure from us. Everybody's just been saying just go out there and have fun
and play our game. That's all we can do and control what we can control. And
that's what we're focusing on is just having fun and enjoying the moment.  
  
Q. Sindarius, to follow that up, are you aware this program hasn't won a
tournament game since the '70s? And is that something Coach has mentioned as
one of the special things you could achieve in this ride?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We was aware and we had Mack come talk to us. Those who
know who Mack is, Mack's been around the program longer than anybody than I
know. And he came and talked to us and told us how much it means for him for
us to just make the tournament and how much it would mean for him to just, for
us to win that win first game, it would mean so much for him and for us and
our relationship with Mack.  
  
If we was to win the game tomorrow it would be for Mack and all he's done and
for all the players that play for the University of South Carolina, we all
have a relationship with him and how much he loves and cares for the program
and the work he put in goes unnoticed. And if we win it will really just be
for Mack.  
  
Q. Because of geography and because of what the reasons that North
Carolina/Duke had to come farther, do you guys feel like this is kind of a
home regional since this is geographically closer than any other team?  
DUANE NOTICE: Yeah. We kind of do have that sense, that home field. We have a
lot of supporters and fans around the region and in the area. So we want to
come out there and play as well as we can because all year we've had a great
home crowd.  
  
For us to have that support behind us at this tournament would mean a lot to
us. And the fact that we didn't have to travel out West or something that we
thought we were going to be doing, it kind of is a benefit -- beneficial to us
and it kind of helps with our confidence and things like that. So it's also a
good thing that we're close to home.  
  
Q. How much of a benefit is that in a situation like this?  
DUANE NOTICE: It's huge. It's huge. Like I said, we're the type of team that
we play off of our home crowd, things like that. I know once we get on a run
and get things going and we kind of hear the building erupt and just see
familiar faces and things like that, and everybody just play loose and relaxed
and be willing to be at the top of their game.  
  
Q. Sindarius, then maybe one others can chime in -- how often during the
preseason practice or preseason that the heartbreak of last year and being
left out, motivate you? Was it mentioned coming down the stretch when things
got a little wobbly and that kind of thing?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: That was really our focus point coming into the season,
preseason, everything. Our slogan this year was "unfinished business" because
we felt us not making the tournament last year our business here wasn't
finished. So we had that slogan all year. And that was really the goal.  
  
The goal all year was just to make it to the NCAA Tournament. And coming down
the stretch, we didn't really -- like we pressured ourselves, but Coach talked
to us and Coach tried to tell us don't worry about it and stuff like that.  
  
But I think we pressured ourselves too much about it. And I think just us
being here, you know, that pressure we brought on ourselves is gone now, and
we can relax and just play.  
  
Q. Just with the game tipping off so late at night, how does that adjust
or affect the way you guys prepare for the game, if at all?  
PJ DOZIER: I don't think it affects how we prepare at all. Each day coming
into practice we're preparing for the next game. And our coaching staff does a
great job on getting us prepared.  
  
Our slogan for the game is, like, we play the game before the game is actually
played. We win the day. That's what we say -- we win the day in practice. And
it carries over into the games.  
  
Q. Defensively Marquette's numbers don't look very good. How much
confidence does it get that you'll be able to find some easy shots or get to
the lane and get to the rim and force them back?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: It gives us a lot of confidence just knowing that we're
going to have our opportunities and we just gotta step up and make the shots.
We've had opportunities even coming down the stretch, you know, we just didn't
make shots.  
  
Like I said, I think they just came in with pressure stuff like that. Now I
feel that the pressure is gone and everybody's relaxed and just trying to have
fun. That's what we're trying to do is get back to having fun and playing our
game.  
  
Q. Marquette is good at 3-point shooting. How have you guys prepared to
go up against them and defend them as a team that's noted for being a really
good defensive team with really good defensive players?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: We're really good at 3-point defense too. So it starts
with Duane guarding the ball. Starts with me and PJ denying our bigs, doing
their job, too. So we're just going to get out there and do what we've been
doing all season. After that is getting after it and guarding and trying to
make them feel uncomfortable.  
  
Q. Duane, you were going to respond to what I asked earlier about what
you used as a motivation from last year's heart break. What do you have to say
about that?  
DUANE NOTICE: Similar. The team, we all have the slogan "unfinished business."
A lot of the new guys we had, our first-year guys, weren't along the ride with
us so they didn't understand the heartbreak we faced.  
  
We try to instill that to them in practice and know that you guys don't want
to feel what we felt last year, just sitting around on Selection Sunday and
just not being picked. We wanted to make sure we did everything in our power
that we didn't feel like that way anymore.  
  
We let some games slip at the end, but we remain confident because of what we
did in our non-conference schedule and put everything in God's hands. And once
we were able to be selected we let everybody know that God was looking out and
we know we did what we had to do, and what's in the past is in the past and
we've got to focus on the future now.  
  
Q. What does it feel like just to be here and see the NCAA logos and
look at the court? Does it match your expectations of what you thought, like,
this environment would be?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Yeah, as a matter of fact, just when we were walking
here, Duane said something like: Man we should have been here all four years.
But it's fun. We're just enjoying it and embracing it and just trying to have
fun.  
  
Q. You're about to go out to the open practice session after this, some
fan interaction. Are you looking forward to that, or is it more focused on
practice and let's get ready for this game tomorrow?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: Everybody is going to look at me every question
(laughter). We've had practice already. We practiced earlier today. I think
today right now we'll go out here just getting up shots, getting used to
shooting in the arena and interacting with the fans, I think that's what we're
really just focusing on right now.  
  
Q. Sindarius and Duane, at some point, whether it's this weekend, next
weekend, the weekend after that, it's going to be over for you guys. Have you
gotten the chance to think about what you've done for this program, what
you've meant for this program? Have you kind of started to think about that?  
SINDARIUS THORNWELL: No, I haven't. I'm just enjoying the moment, just trying
to keep the season going as long as I can and keep this thing going and trying
to make it as far as I can. And I can think about everything else when it's
all over with.  
  
Q. Frank said to you all this week in preparing, he's been through this
before, and what have practices been like? Has he kept the pedal to the metal
and worked you really hard or has he let up a little?  
DUANE NOTICE: We've been practicing hard. We've been practicing hard because
we're preparing for what's about to come. He wants to make sure we're all
prepared but at the same time I think he's done a good job of letting us know
he's been there before. So he really wants us to enjoy the experience. And I
think that's just a testament to the type of coach he is, and he just wants us
all to feel relaxed and loose.  
  
We worked on watching film and worked on our defensive schemes and getting
shots up and things like that. But at the same time he's going to make sure we
all enjoy this experience and this ride because it took a lot for us to get
here, and we want to make sure that we cherish it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by coach Frank Martin.  
  
COACH MARTIN: Unbelievably exciting week for us for obvious reasons. I'm so
happy for our players, for our alums, for our former players, for the
administration that believed in me and gave me a chance. And here we are and
it's been five years worth of work by everybody involved to make this a
reality and now we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Have you sensed a more loose atmosphere around the kids as they've
gotten ready for this week, a more fancy-free kind of thing, no pressure on
them?  
COACH MARTIN: Yeah, I think -- I don't know if I'm the kind of person that
enjoys work in that kind of freelance mode, just like everybody have a good
time and hug and kiss and high-five each other. I just think there's a time
for that and a time to work.  
  
But the pressure part, I think there's no doubt. I think there's absolutely
zero doubt that last year we set a school record for wins and it wasn't good
enough. Plain and simple. We can all complain, whatever, it's irrelevant. It
wasn't good enough.  
  
And I think as we were coming down the stretch, we played some real hard games
against postseason teams in road games. And I think our guys kind of felt that
a little bit.  
  
And anytime you bog yourself down a little bit you don't perform as well. So
from that standpoint, there's no doubt. I think our guys are in an
unbelievable place right now mentally. And they've been great this week.  
  
Q. The last time you faced Andrew Rowsey, albeit at UNCA a few years
back, he had 30 points in that game. I'm assuming you've impressed upon your
players that they may want to guard him a little more closely this time?  
COACH MARTIN: We weren't as bad as it makes it sound. He's just a real good
player. We guarded him pretty good that day. He just knows how to play.  
  
It's hard to defend real good players. It's not as easy as it sounds. And we
also weren't -- you know, my guys, just like him, were young, like Sindarius,
Duane. They're in the same class he is. So they were all young.  
  
So defensively we weren't as good as we needed to be yet at that time. We
we're much better defensively but you know what, he's also -- he's playing his
tail off right now. I watched some of their games early this year. And he's
playing in a completely different place now right now.  
  
He's got that confidence going. He's aggressive. He's got that unbelievable
knack to get to the foul line with his shot fakes. And if you're late on any
coverage, that ball's in the net.  
  
And he's a real good player. I didn't have to say a word to our players. Our
guys, they remember.  
  
Q. You've been in the NCAA Tournament before. Obviously none of the
players have. What's the main thing you've stressed to them about what they
need to do and what differences there may be when you get here?  
COACH MARTIN: I showed them a picture of me on March 27th, 2012, which is
right after I coached my last NCAA game, and I showed them a picture of me
last Sunday. And I told them: If it takes five years between appearances, this
is how you look (laughter). I've tried to share what I know, what I've lived,
what our players that I've coached that have been in it, what they shared with
me.  
  
I've tried to share that with them, with the understanding that they've earned
the right to be here. This wasn't, like, let's just kind of draw names out of
a hat and, oh, my God, we're, in this thing! Wow, do we belong? No, we've
earned the right to be here.  
  
And enjoy the moment, enjoy the ride. It can last a long time or it can be
over quick. You don't control that. So don't worry about those things. Just
enjoy the ride and just do everything in your power to play the best game that
we've played all year. That's it.  
  
And at the end of the day, you know, you've earned something special. They
earned the right to be part of this exclusive club for this year. And that's
something that they should be proud of and at the same time feel a lot of
confidence in.  
  
Q. You've been to a number of NCAA Tournaments. Does this experience
because of the five years in between mean any more to you than any of the
others?  
COACH MARTIN: They're all special. They're all different. Anytime you're in
this event, I told my wife this morning, I said, I feel like a little kid.  
  
Anytime you're part of this event, you can be here -- you'd have to ask K and
Roy and some of those guys that have been in it like forever, what it feels to
them. But I can tell you, for me, it's incredible.  
  
Every second that you're a part of this, it's just an unbelievable feel, a
joy. You realize how lucky you are that you're around so many special people
that allow you to be a part of this.  
  
And it's a special deal. They're all different. Every team's different. Every
year's different.  
  
The one thing that was satisfying at K-State, the first time we went, and has
been satisfying here, is that both schools had not been to it in a long time.  
  
And to be able to be a part of a team that kind of returns makes it fun
personally. One day I'll sit back and I'll say, you know what? It feels pretty
good, feels pretty good that you can take two different programs that hadn't
been a part of it for a long time and you were a part of the team that went
back.  
  
Q. When you're at K-State, I know you said they're all different, but
you won your first game the four times you got there, most of which were
seedings around this. Is there anything in common from how you won those kind
of games you can apply to how you approach this one?  
COACH MARTIN: Yeah, the first year as a head coach, I didn't know what I was
doing. I got no idea. I know we practiced real hard and we were the 11 seed
and we played USC. And I had two guys on my team that Bill Walker and Mike
Beasley, and those two guys were unbelievable that game. And that's why
they're both pros.  
  
And we figured out a way to win, and the game ended and I had no idea we had
won. It was just crazy.  
  
But all the other guys who were on the team were freshmen that year and then
we missed it a year. The following three years we went.  
  
And every time we went, we had returning players that got a taste of it. And
then that drives you, because you understand what a special feeling it is to
be a part of this. And it drives your guys to do things better, to be more
aggressive, to be better decision makers so they don't make mistakes off the
court, to be more on edge for offseason workouts, because they understand how
hard it is to get here.  
  
Like Sindarius and Duane, the reason we got here this year, those two guys,
Justin, PJ, Chris Silva, the disappointment of last year drove those guys.
They didn't make excuses. They didn't blame. It drove them all offseason to
prepare for this year. That's why we're here this year. And now once you're in
it, all the other guys are first-year guys. They don't know what's going on
right now.  
  
But being a part of this, it's going to give them a taste. How does all that
help us figure out a way to win tomorrow? I got no idea. We gotta trust in who
we are. That's all I've talked to our team about. It's been six months in the
making of getting ready to become the team that we are.  
  
You've got to trust in that and you've got to go play through that personality
and that identity. And at the end of the day a team's going to be good enough
or it's not. That doesn't make us a good or bad team.  
  
It just means that tomorrow night, at whatever time at night, heck, I used to
be taking showers to go out to South Beach. Now I've got to worry about going
and coaching a game at 10:00 at night. I hope I don't nod off on the bench.
But we've gotta be the best team that we can be tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Since Hassani joined the starting lineup, what's he give you on
defense and really at the start of that game, in those First Four minutes?  
COACH MARTIN: I thought he had been practicing real well, and Mike, I kind of
saw what I saw in PJ last year, just a first-year guy that was trying to take
a deep breath and couldn't figure out when he could take that breath.  
  
And Hassani practiced, well, and he gives us another decision-maker with the
basketball. I thought our passing had gotten bad and Hassani is one of our
better passers. Defensively we were getting ready to play a bunch of teams
that play small, for lack of better words.  
  
So I thought why not? If I'm going to try something to shake this up a little
bit, why not now. And he did his part. He did his part. And I think Mike's
playing a lot better again. I think that decision helped Mike take a step
back, take a deep breath and recompose himself.  
  
Q. I know you've said in the past that you have a friendship with Steve
Wojciechowski. I just wanted to understand where that friendship came from,
where it started and how it's grown over time?  
COACH MARTIN: First of all, I'm a fan of basketball. And watching him play was
awesome. I wasn't very good, but when I tried to play, that's how I tried to
play.  
  
And so from afar I always respected him. And then the first day he got put on
the road as an assistant by Coach K, him, Hugs and I were at the same event
and Andy Kennedy, all four of us, out recruiting. We spent the whole day
together and just conversations on the first day on the road.  
  
We kind of hit it off. And over the years, you know, we've shared scouting
reports with one another. We've shared ideas. When he got hired at Marquette,
we spent some time talking about my first year at K-State and some of the
challenges and things that I experienced.  
  
And then he had to hire a trainer. And that's probably when we spent the most
time as far as personally speaking about things. And he hired Brandon Yoder, a
dear friend, who is an unbelievable trainer. And I think who Brandon has been
for Wojo and their program has created unbelievable trust towards me and us.  
  
And I've got a lot of respect for Woj. He's a star in this business. He's
great for kids. Watching his team play, it's a machine.  
  
Everyone wants to talk about them defensively. They're so good offensively.
And what's used against people is how many points do they give up per game.
That's because they score a lot of points. To score a lot of points you've got
to play very fast. So they're pretty good on defense.  
  
They fight you. If you remember Woj, he's not going to accept playing people
that don't fight their tails off to get on the court. And they're good.
They're good. They're fun to watch. I'm not enjoying watching them on tape
right now. And it's not going to be any fun guarding them, but I'm exciting
for him, excited for what he's building.  
  
Q. As far as the 44 years since an NCAA Tournament win for this program,
what's your coaching philosophy on that? Is it something you avoid because of
extra pressure, is it something you address because of extra motivation or
something in between?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't know if that impacts us one way or the other. I'll be
honest with you, first couple of years at South Carolina I didn't even know
that because, let's be honest, nobody really cared about what we were doing so
no one really spoke about it.  
  
But last year, once we started earning respect and it kind of became popular,
and this year, I'm not trying to sell our program here, I'm just telling you
the truth -- we're 13th in the country in total attendance. That means a lot
of people are coming to watch our kids play.  
  
And with our guys being able to succeed again this year and get this bid, a
lot of that is starting to come up. I don't know if that impacts our guys one
way or the other, I really don't.  
  
But I can tell you personally nothing would make me happier for us to
eventually break that. You go back and you think of some of the guys that have
played at South Carolina, the incredible coaches that have coached at South
Carolina over those 44 years, I think it's a remarkable -- it's one of those
stats that you're like how is that happening.  
  
How is Frank McGuire not win an NCAA game since 1973. How does Eddie Fogler,
Dave Odom? Keep going -- the names of the coaches and players that have come
through there. How does that happen?  
  
And I'd love the opportunity to be able, not for me selfishly, that doesn't do
anything for me, but for all those former guys and our administrators and
former coaches that sacrificed. Because this is hard, getting here is hard.
Winning here is even harder. To be able to accomplish that I think would
soothe a lot of people. It would make a lot of people smile. At the end of the
day that's what our job and life is to make others smile.  
  
Q. Going back to Marquette's offense, in your preparation, how have you
addressed dealing with their 3-point shooting and how do you feel about your
3-point shooting defense at this stage of the season?  
COACH MARTIN: Am I in a better mood today, Phil? Last Sunday you were worried
about my mood.  
  
Q. You seem a tad bit happier?  
COACH MARTIN: I am. I'm a bundle of joy (laughter). They're as good a passing
and shooting team as we've played against. And anytime -- usually good
shooting teams are very good passing teams. Usually teams that don't shoot
well aren't very good passers.  
  
Their spacing is very good. They play fast. They're aggressive. Their ball-
screen offense is what they used to create separation from their shooters.
They try and put you in situations where if your ball-screen defense is not
perfect, then you're forced to help. And when you help against a real good
passing team, that usually means someone's getting shots.  
  
And they've got a lot of guys that can shoot it. One thing I know about our
team even when we didn't play great, I go back, I don't think we played bad.
We just didn't play as great as we did, I don't know, through early February.  
  
We have to go play some hard teams. I thought our 3-point defense was still
pretty good. It's got to be the best it's been all year tomorrow. It's our
ball-screen defense has to be tremendous. And then our perimeter defense has
to be the best it's been all year.  
  
Here's something else they're great at -- shot faking. They're unbelievable at
shot faking and getting you up in the air and creating fouls that way. You've
got to keep them off the line. They don't miss free throws.  
  
So we have to be very disciplined defensively. But we've been that all year.
So we just gotta be real good at it tomorrow.  
  
Q. What's the main message you want to leave with your guys right before
you step out on that court this morning?  
COACH MARTIN: I've been kind of preaching to them all week about this. You go
through decisions and benchings and disciplines and hugs and tears and all
kinds of emotions that the season brings to you. So it hardens you.  
  
It makes you understand how important it is that you play 40 minutes. Go out
there and do it. Go out there and forget all the good and bad that's happened
up to this point, trust in who you are. Do your job with an unbelievable
commitment to it, and play as close to the -- this tournament you could play
for 39 minutes and 52 seconds and get beat for those 8 seconds you didn't play
well.  
  
You have to do your job the best you can. And at the end of the day enjoy the
ride. It's a special, special thing and it's something that they get to talk
to their parents and their family and their children one day about the ride
that they've taken me and everyone else at South Carolina on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke student-athletes Luke Kennard, Matt Jones
and Amile Jefferson.  
  
Q. If you all want to chime in, Jayson's obviously had a great second
half of the season and month. And I'm wondering, was there a turning point for
him? Was it kind of once he got fully healthy, got into the rhythm of things,
or what's led to the month he's on right now?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I think it's just the work he's put in, and he's been doing a
great job of getting up extra work with Coach Scheyer working on doing things
really quickly and just the small things of being a really good player,
because the talent is already there. It's oozing out of him.  
  
So for our team, you know, it was just about him being sharp. And this last
month, he's been doing an amazing job at evolving, doing much more, things
like rebounding, playing really good defense, drawing two guys and finding the
open man. I think he's done a really great job over this last month of just
like growing up, not making like common freshman mistakes.  
  
MATT JONES: I think Amile answered your question.  
  
LUKE KENNARD: For me, Amile said it 100 percent right. And I think he's just
being himself. I think he's being the player that Coach recruited him to be.
And he's just -- he's all in. He's just being himself and that's what we
wanted him to do. We wanted him to continue to do that, and we have leaders on
this team that have really gave him confidence to be the type of player that
he can be.  
  
Q. Amile, Harry Giles gave you guys big minutes in the ACC Tournament.
He talked about how he was playing more instinctively with the more minutes.
How have you seen that help his game and be able to help you guys out as a
whole?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Definitely. When he's not thinking about other things, making
a mistake, or just out there playing, he's a really great player. He's one of
the most athletic guys in the country. His second jump is unbelievable.  
  
So when he just let it all out -- and that's what he did in the ACC
tournament, he just let it out -- we saw a really special player.  
  
He had about six sequences back to back to back in that UNC game that changed
the game for us, really won the game for us, if I'm being honest. And he's
added a new dimension to our team and taken us to a new level. So we have guys
that can do that. We have special guys, and he's one of them. So for him to be
playing this well, I'm real proud of him.  
  
Q. Luke, has this year surprised you coming off of -- there's obviously
all the talk of all the freshmen coming in, probably been the team's most
consistent player. What did you do in the offseason in the summer that you
think set you up for this year?  
LUKE KENNARD: Last year was a learning curve for me. Last year I had a very
inconsistent year and my confidence wasn't there 100 percent. But I have guys
like these two, great coaches that have built a lot of confidence in me to be
the player that Coach recruited me to be.  
  
And like you said, I've been more consistent this year than I was last year.
And just for me to do whatever I can to help our team win is what I want to do
most.  
  
Like I said about having great leaders, with these guys and coaches to build
confidence in me has been really, really big for me.  
  
Q. For all of you, you probably feel like you went to the Final Four
last week with the games you had to play. How much did that take out of you?
And being successful like you were, talk a little bit about the confidence you
have going into the tournament now?  
MATT JONES: I think that we have ultimate confidence. As far as being tired,
fatigued, I don't see that happening. Me and Amile especially, we know how it
feels to lose and lose pretty early.  
  
We just tried to relay the message, hey, it's on to the next play. And Coach
does a good job of doing the same. And, yeah, I think we still have a hungry
team, and knowing that, that should be good for us.  
  
Q. Luke, was it difficult this year -- at the start you guys came in as
preseason No. 1 -- was it a difficult path to kind of get to where you are
now? And do you feel like you're now that team that everybody thought you were
going to be back in November?  
LUKE KENNARD: Yeah, it's definitely been difficult when we've battled so much
adversity with injuries and things happening. I mean, when we started the
season, we had some of our freshmen out.  
  
So, it can be tough to build your team exactly like how we are now. And once
we started getting everybody back, we've continued to develop an identity, I
guess you could say. We learned a lot from this past week winning the ACC
championship.  
  
We've developed our identity of a team. And I think we're continuing to grow.
So it's been difficult. We've been on a great journey. We've hit some bumps in
the road. But it's made us better as a team, made us tougher and made us
closer as a group.  
  
Q. Amile and Matt, you guys were part of a team, that 2014 team that
lost in the first round, and part of the team in 2015 that went all the way
and won. Is there anything going into the NCAA Tournament? Was there a
difference, or do you see a difference in terms of attitude, confidence,
momentum, anything like that?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I think in both those situations, the great thing is that we
have the experience now. So going into this year, we know what it feels like
to do both. We know the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.  
  
So we definitely, you know, have momentum from playing well last week, and I
think what we have right now is addition. We've added. And that's a great
thing.  
  
We've added Marques. We've added Harry, playing instinctually playing at a
high level. We've added Jayson, learning more about himself and learning that
he can take over games. So I think the biggest thing for our team is that we
have been able to add in these last three or four weeks.  
  
Q. All of the players, you mentioned highs and lows and back to the high
of last weekend. How do you keep your mind straight, especially in that low
part of the season? Coach is out, you guys are struggling, injuries and such,
all the adversity. Is there an unsung hero, a player maybe people just don't
know about in the locker room that's keeping your minds right? Maybe another
coach that's just keeping things back on track. Is there somebody behind the
scenes that really just helped you as a team to keep pushing through the
adversity?  
LUKE KENNARD: You know, we have great coaches, and when Coach was out, our
coaches were, they were tremendous. I think they did a great job.  
  
For me, I think it honestly starts with our leadership, our seniors, our
captains. They made sure we were on the right track. They made sure we stayed
together.  
  
And it was tough when that happened. But we won some big games. And it all
started with these guys, making sure we were just on the right track. And that
was good for us.  
  
And like I mentioned earlier, we've hit some bumps in the road. We've hit some
adversity. When stuff like that happens we make sure we're together as a group
and it's made us a tougher team and an even better team.  
  
MATT JONES: Even though I'm flattered by what Luke said, I think for this
team, it was the pain we felt, that really drove us to become better, not only
as players, but as people on and off the court. And I mean pain forces you to
grow, with Coach being out, with guys being injured. And every day being so
unconventional, we had to learn how to adjust.  
  
And the talent was there. It was just about putting it together. And we were
able throughout the season strengthen areas little by little to where now all
those areas that we were able to strengthen are starting to come together and
that was a really good thing for us now that we can look back on it. But in
the process, it was definitely -- it was definitely hard and we had to learn
from it.  
  
Q. Amile and Matt, what has Luke meant to this team this year? And are
you at all surprised at what he's done, considering when the season was
starting, initially he wasn't going to be a starter. Admittedly inconsistent
last year, and now he's obviously one of the best players in the country?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: For me, I think Luke has been the consummate Duke player.
He's emulated what it means to be immersed in us and because of that he's
grown beautifully.  
  
It's obvious that he's been our most consistent threat, our most consistent
player. And he's won big games for us. And we wouldn't be in this position
without him. So I think it's just a testament to all the work that he put in,
especially this summer.  
  
And then just running his own race, not worrying about whether he's going to
start, how many minutes he's going to play, just being a player. And when his
number was called, he was ready, and I think he's done it beautifully.  
  
MATT JONES: For me, Luke's been the ultimate competitor this year. He's shown
that he can be a winner. Kind of like everything Amile says. But the
consistency was the most important thing because he always had the talent. It
was always there.  
  
But for him to be able to pull out something that was in him that y'all are
able to see but we always saw, whether it be in the summer or parts of last
year, I'm really happy for him.  
  
Q. What have you guys noticed most about Troy?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Troy can really shoot the ball. We have a kid in Person who
is just really a dynamic shooter. Then they have a big guy in Varnado, who is
a force down low, but who can spread the ball and shoot it. They have about
six or seven guys that can knock down the long ball.  
  
So we're going to have to be really locked in. They're champions, just like
us. They won their league. And they did it in a similar fashion, you know, win
four games in five days. So we have to be locked in, because they're a really,
really talented team.  
  
Q. Couple of games are already over, you guys will be one of the last
teams to play in this tournament. Is that a good thing in terms of the extra
rest, or is it bad that it's nervous waiting for the first game?  
LUKE KENNARD: I mean, playing one of the last games, I guess, it can give you
more time to prepare. But at the same time we don't want to be focused on what
other teams are doing, paying attention to who is winning, who is getting
beat.  
  
We're just trying to stay locked in what we're doing and prepare as a group.
And we have one mission, we have one goal, and that's to win. And we've got to
take it one game at a time and that's what we're looking to do.  
  
Q. Luke, earlier you said this summer Grayson really helped you. Can you
tell me, like, how did he help you? Was it with your game? Was it with the
mental side? He had kind of gone through what you were going through in terms
of freshman year, not probably playing at your best, and obviously had a great
sophomore year?  
LUKE KENNARD: Yeah. I learned a lot from Grayson this past year. Well, the two
years I've been here. And I think for me just being able to compete against
him has made me a lot better to learn from his competitive side. Just to
talking about the little things of the game has really helped me a lot.  
  
And just being able to go at each other in practices throughout the summer and
in pick-up games has made me more comfortable as a player and all the guys
have built confidence in me as the player I am. And it's just been really good
for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by coach Mike Krzyzewski.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We're excited to be here in Greenville. Great city to host
the NCAA Tournament. And hopefully we'll fulfill our obligations to play some
good basketball.  
  
We're in pretty good health. We have a couple of kids a little bit under the
weather but who will play, but no, like, sprained ankles and things like that.  
  
But after you have a week like we did last week, I think you're more prone to
having some colds and all that kind of stuff because of the emotional and
physical output that you had in order to win. But we're good. We're excited.
Ready to go.  
  
Q. Back in Charlotte in October, you were like, yeah, we may be No. 1
right now, but there's a long, long way to go. What kind of journey has this
been for your team? And how do you -- do you think now they're playing like
many people thought they would be in October?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know what many people thought because none of the
people saw. So how could -- I guess that's what predictions are. And that's
why people make money and that's why people go bankrupt by predictions.  
  
And if you did a careful analysis of each team and understood that each team
has a journey, and ours was a difficult one, because every guy on our team got
hurt. I was out.  
  
So it's not about what people thought we should be, because that really
doesn't make any difference. And it wasn't based on any factual stuff that
they saw. So we've just developed. And we're a good team right now. We haven't
used any of that stuff as excuses. And our league, in order to survive, you
have to be good.  
  
In order to live in that neighborhood, you better become good. And that's why
we have a lot of good teams. We're one of them. And thank goodness that the
conference exacts that from you and that we're healthy enough to meet that
challenge.  
  
Q. What about this year is different or needs to be different compared
to years past?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: For what, for --  
  
Q. In order to make it to the finals.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Each year it's different. You have a different team. You're
not Brady and Belichick coming back or hopefully the Cubs do it again. I'm a
Cub fan. We have most people back. Should have kept Fowler.  
  
It's a different journey every time. And I like my team a lot. I'm proud of
them. I think they've become men. And that's a good thing.  
  
So going into it we feel we had a chance to give our best shot. We play a
team, and every time that -- you know, can beat us, and we respect that. And I
think my team is mature enough to understand that.  
  
So it's what makes it interesting. That's why if you win this thing, it's a
heck of a thing. And if you win it more than once, it's really a heck of a
thing, because you do it with different people in different circumstances.  
  
So I like my group a lot. And my upperclassmen, Matt and Amile, have really
helped us immensely in their leadership to bring this team around.  
  
Q. For years, since the one-and-done got big, you had a guy like Amile
and Matt played with you four years. Got to cover Matt in high school. What's
your take on what he's done for you over his career?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he's a believer. In other words, he's an extension of
the coaching staff, not just on the court but on the practice court, the bus
and team meal.  
  
He basically has lifted up the standards of our program. And for four years.
In Amile's case, five. And that helps these young guys immensely.  
  
And then they also understand by being in so many games -- they've been in
games where we've gotten beat and they've won championships. And they've won a
national championship. And so they understand the process. And to be true to
the process and to stick with it.  
  
And Matt and Amile have been so instrumental in bringing this team along.
We're really lucky to have them. I love those two guys. We've won a lot of
games together, and we've developed this team together as a result of the
relationship of staff and especially with those two kids.  
  
Q. With everything that you've been through this year, what do you
think's been the big lesson this team's learned?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No excuses. And try to win with what you have. And with the
amount of preparation and whatever continuity you've had. When I was out from
back surgery, I went out and Amile got hurt.  
  
And it's much more important that Amile played than I was there. And so we
didn't have the continuity and the ability to prepare and get to know one
another as well until February.  
  
And then these last three, four weeks we've, Matt's been healthy. Amile and
Grayson have been, they've been hurt but they're better, a lot better. But
we've had them all there. And as a result they've gotten to know one another
better. And we've won close games. We've lost a couple of close games. But,
again, we keep getting better.  
  
Q. As much as you've enjoyed being here in Greenville, is there any
sadness that this tournament isn't being played in Greensboro, where it was
originally scheduled, and it might not be back in North Carolina again?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't want to take away from the great people of South
Carolina and the people of Greenville. They have the right to host it whether
our state is smart enough to have it. It shouldn't be a contest of one
another. South Carolina is known for great basketball, and this is a great
town. So we feel really good about being here.  
  
It would be nice if our state got as smart and also would host not just
basketball tournaments but concerts and other NCAA events. But maybe we'll get
there in the next century, I don't know. We'll see.  
  
Q. What's the solution then to the previous question?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't want to get political right now.  
  
Q. Fair enough. Then following up one more time --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Look, it's a stupid thing. That's my political statement. If
I was president or governor I'd get rid of it. And I'd back up my promises. As
unusual as that might be. Anyway, I don't want to get too political.  
  
Q. What do you think has been the difference with Jayson this last
month? And obviously he's playing as well as anyone in the country?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's a good question. You'd have to just follow how Jayson
was able to prepare. And the third week of October he was really playing well
and he hurt his foot. And he's out for more than five weeks, missed eight
games.  
  
And even when he came back he didn't have -- because there were exams,
Christmas break or whatever -- there's about a two-month gap of the
preparation that any player needs but especially a freshman needs, and he's so
good and he's so committed and our guys are good with him, that since the
beginning of January when we were able to have that he's progressed that much.
And I'm proud of him.  
  
I think he'd be playing at this level earlier. But I'm glad he's been able to
achieve the level that he's playing at during this season that he's playing
college basketball.  
  
Q. Kind of back to the point you asked about before, how surreal has
this year been for you because you had a stop and start again in terms of
being in sync and being in the flow of a typical season?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, for me, even though I had the surgery, I was watching
tape and being with the team every day. Maybe not physically. So I never got
completely out of sync. And I have a great staff. Jeff Capel did an amazing
job while I was gone and he's my associate head coach. And a lot of what we do
is what he thinks we should do.  
  
So I like that. But I haven't really been out of sync. The team has not had
the ability to be in sync. And I've gotten well. So I'm fresh. I'm good. I've
been ready to go. And but for about a month and a half or so there not good.  
  
Q. What is one thing you think your team has gained from winning the ACC
championship to prepare for the tournament?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, an ACC championship. That's the very first thing. And
I say that not being like joking. It's a tremendous honor. And confidence
comes through with achievement. And when you -- I think our confidence -- it
was good, real good going into the tournament.  
  
It's better as a result of playing those four games and winning. And now just
we have to make sure that our confidence coincides with the ability to still
prepare, not have a rearview mirror and look back at it but to be in the
moment.  
  
They were in the moment in New York and they got better. Now we have to be in
the moment here against Troy.  
  
Q. When you look at Luke's year, how surprising is it when you consider
the preseason there was talk that he wasn't going to be a starter, and he
admittedly had an up-and-down freshman year? Now he's had as good of a season
as anyone in the country.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: There you go again based on listening to people who haven't
seen him. People didn't see him in practice or whatever and predictions and
all that. We can't live in that world.  
  
And it's -- we live in a world of quick judgment and shallow analysis. And
that's not how you prepare a really good team. Luke's been great since the
get-go. He had a terrific freshman year.  
  
Actually, in one of our inner-squad scrimmages before Jayson and Marques got
hurt, I think Luke scored 47 points. And I said, well, he might be pretty good
even though it wasn't based on factual prediction of what he might be. So it
doesn't surprise me what look has done.  
  
Luke's a heck of a basketball player and competitor. And because he doesn't
have a position, we can use him in different parts of the court, and his
efficiency is unbelievable. To put up those numbers but not take the number of
shots is really good. It's really good.  
  
Q. How much do you confer with Steve Wojciechowski during the season?
And what kind of qualities do you see in his team that you see in your team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I wish we could shoot as well as his team. They lead
the nation in shooting. You don't converse that much, I think. After a big win
you text or call. After a tough loss it seemed more important to text or call.
Both ways, when I was going through my surgery and that, my assistants who are
now head coaches.  
  
We have a family. Steve and I are family. We spent -- heck, it's probably 19,
20 years. Are you kidding me? And besides that, he's Polish. So we share an
even greater bond. And he didn't change his name and I didn't change mine.  
  
Q. [Indiscernible]?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: The fact that they share the ball so well. And I think what
Steve has done is he's taken the talent that he has and meshed it into a style
that can beat you instead of trying to fit guys into another style that
wouldn't be as successful.  
  
And a big thing for him, they play good defense but they play even better
offense. I mean, they play -- I haven't watched them to study them yet. That's
just when I get a chance to watch them. I've studied Troy. That's all. So I
just hope we get a chance to play on Sunday.  
  
Q. What have you seen out of Troy that impresses you the most?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, first of all, the fact that they've won four games in
five days. The Sun Belt is a really good conference, historically and again
this year.  
  
And what Person's done is unbelievable in the tournament. And they have a team
that can really score the ball. Almost 50 percent, 45 percent of their shots
are 3s. They're dangerous. And the fact they've won makes them even more
dangerous.  
  
So we respect them, no question about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas Southern student-athletes Demontrae
Jefferson, Marvin Jones and Zach Lofton.  
  
Q. I want to ask you guys, both the men's and women's teams are
representing in the NCAA Tournament this year. Talk about the excitement on
your campus with that going on?  
ZACH LOFTON: It's amazing, you know what I mean? What we've done for the
institution and for the institution itself, you know what I mean. I've said it
in many interviews, we didn't do it just for us; we did it for the city and
the school. And it's great.  
  
MARVIN JONES: Just to piggyback off what Zach said, it's an unbelievable
feeling to have both teams go. I know it brings a lot of different attention
and just a lot of positive things to the school. So just to have just a
positive and just a good outlook on our school, it's a great thing.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I think both teams going to the NCAA Tournament was very
exciting, because I think the women's never went before, so this might be
their first appearance. And the men's to not go last year and return this
year, it's real big for the university.  
  
And I think us and the women's going to the NCAA Tournament was -- made the
university more proud of everybody on this team.  
  
Q. You guys didn't play a home game until the first of the year. Talk
about just the fact that you guys spent that extended period on the road, for
all of you guys?  
MARVIN JONES: Honestly, just being on the road that many games, it honestly
just gets you motivated to go outside a different arena and just compete and
just share with your brothers because honestly, it's just you 15 guys and the
coaching staff.  
  
It's really you versus everybody. So just to be able to come and play all
those games and have to fight through each possession and it makes it just all
odds for us. It made us grow together once we got to the SWAC conference it
made some games easier because we played on some of the biggest stages in
college.  
  
ZACH LOFTON: Great experience for us, you know what I mean? Going out and
playing everywhere away, you know what I mean, it built us for this, you know
what I mean. Built us for this, you know what I mean. We're in South Carolina.
We're right next to right next to North Carolina. So I think that helped a lot
experience-wise.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I think as a player, I didn't play prior -- I think eight
or nine games in the beginning of the season, but when I came I played five,
and it was just like the competition and the experience and the environment
being in those big gyms, knowing how much history was in those gyms and me
coming here being able to play in front of people, I never thought would come
and see me or never thought I'd play in these gyms.  
  
So I think playing non-conference kind of made me more physically and mentally
stronger and made me realize that these games aren't just about me and just
about the team is way bigger than us.  
  
Q. Zach, what's the first step in trying to slay this giant dragon in
front of you or even just stay in the game, make them sweat a little?  
ZACH LOFTON: Execution, following Coach's plan, that's the first step for me.  
  
MARVIN JONES: Honestly just taking it a possession at a time. We can't go in
trying to say that we're going to win by this much or we're going to stop them
to this point. We're going to take each four-minute period, get it as close as
possible, and just give it our all. That's all we can do.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: Stops, stops. Defense wins games. If we can stop them or
contain them or stop them from rebounding 40 percent of the shots they do and
get them a little bit uncomfortable and take a couple of players out of the
game, I think we can come out of here with a W.  
  
Q. Every year in an NCAA Tournament, an HBC, you typically get a 16
seed, occasionally get a 15 seed. Do you guys think that's a lack of respect
for the programs in the MEAC and the SWAC?  
ZACH LOFTON: That's a tough one, you know what I mean? I mean everyone's
biased of us because the competition isn't as great as the Power Five, you
know what I mean? So I think our talent level may be better than the 16 seed,
you know what I mean? But that's not for me to-- you know what I mean? I don't
make the season. But I don't know. We're just happy to be here, you know what
I mean? I don't get into all that. I'm just happy I'm here.  
  
MARVIN JONES: Honestly, I don't fall into that, because I know what I'm
capable of. He knows what he's capable of. So we're going to come out and play
right there, just anybody else at the park. I'm not going to go out there be
timid or nervous just because their jersey says North Carolina or just because
Roy's over there.  
  
I know how historic this program is. It's a blessing to be able to go up
against those guys. But I'm going to go out and compete, like I was going up
against Jackson State or anybody in the SWAC. That's not the problem for us
because we all play versus high-level talent all our lives. It's going to be a
very exciting game.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: I think us getting the 16 seed, yeah, I think it was a
little bit disrespectful because we had the ESP or.  
  
MARVIN JONES: RPI.  
  
DEMONTRAE JEFFERSON: RPI was good. We had a nice RPI, the best coming out of
the SWAC ever. So I think me and the team and Coach Davis was expecting a
higher seed. Once it was what it was we just took it from there and never
looked back and just started preparing for tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Coach Mike Davis.  
  
Q. Any benefit to the fact that your team actually played a game in this
building last year? And does that mean anything to you? I know you guys see a
lot of arenas based on your travel and I know you've turned some of your
roster over since then?  
COACH DAVIS: We have a different lineup. Not one guy on that team now played
here last year. And so I'm the only one. And I don't think I'll be making any
jump shots tomorrow.  
  
Q. Realistically, how much -- when you guys play so much on the road and
kind of play those guaranteed games early against bigger competition -- how
much can that and does that help in the situation now where it's tournament
time and you're in that same situation, basically?  
COACH DAVIS: See, a lot of people think we play the game for money, to support
our other programs, and we don't. My goal is to try to win a game in the NCAA
Tournament. And so when you set a goal, it has to be a real goal.  
  
And it has to be something that you know that you're willing to work for. And
so I've played those games -- I think we played Louisville and Baylor and
Arizona. I'm not sure, two of those are 2 seeds and one is a 3 seed.  
  
After we play those games and then you come back and you see if you're willing
to put that type of energy and effort into your practices every day throughout
the conference play, seeking that you play at that same level that you played
against Arizona and Baylor. Now, once you get into the tournament, you're used
to that effort and you'll be able to sustain that effort for long periods of
time.  
  
Unfortunately, we didn't play at that 10 level that it takes to win games in
the NCAA Tournament. We kind of danced around a little bit with seven, eight,
but mostly at five. And with our talent level we were able to win a lot of
games in our conference at a five.  
  
And the only way you win games and the only way you benefit from your non-
conference schedule is that you have to take those games and realize how hard
those games are and come back and practice that way throughout the course of
your season.  
  
And then once -- our goal is to get to the NCAA Tournament every year. So once
you get to the tournament, did you work hard enough from December to March to
be able to face a team like North Carolina?  
  
Q. Obviously your program's in the spotlight this week, unlike it is in
the rest of the year. And I wonder, for the program and for the team and the
players and for you, did you do anything in particular this week to use that
spotlight, maybe in recruiting or just exposure, when you have that
opportunity?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, not really, not really, because when our name came up to
play North Carolina, we got a 16 seed. I was hoping for a play-in game once I
saw our name.  
  
But we don't do anything special. We want players to come and play for Texas
Southern because they want to play in the championship game. Houston is a
beautiful city.  
  
We haven't been out recruiting in three, four years so most of our recruiting
comes on the phone and people see our program and see our schedule, who we
play. We haven't played a home game in non-conference in two seasons, and if
you want to be a pro, most guys think they want to be a pro.  
  
What I did this year was kind of special. We played Texas Arlington on the
Saturday night, got up next morning at five, played Delaware, played the very
next day. We played LSU on a Saturday night, 8:00 game, got on the bus, drove
all night, played TCU at 5:00 the next day. So a lot of guys thought they want
to be a pro. They realize it's a very difficult schedule to play that
schedule.  
  
But also, did that put us in a situation to tell who we are and how bad you
want to play basketball?  
  
Q. You mentioned your goal's to make the tournament every year, but you
see North Carolina pop up. Not only that, you're coming to their backyard.
What does your message become to your team other than embrace the moment?  
COACH DAVIS: We talked, everybody talked about David and Goliath. What I told
my basketball team, that story is a powerful story. But what people don't
realize is David was supposed to win. He was the expert. He wasn't someone
they sent out to fight and never had ever used a sling shot.  
  
His sling shot was like a gun, shooting a gun. And he was an expert. So
Goliath was a big, old guy and he had one eye. If he got his hands on you he
was going to automatically win. So as you take that story, that's a powerful
story. So are we experts? Are we in great shape? Are we prepared to give great
effort every possession? Are we willing to get back in transition, block out?  
  
So don't go into this game thinking that you're a David if you're not willing
to prepare yourself up to this point to play at that 10 level for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. You've been on both sides of this kind of a game now. How does that
inform -- and you kind of partially answered it there -- but how does that
inform your team entering a game like this?  
COACH DAVIS: We started from game one, when you set goals you have to set
goals that you're willing to pay a price to achieve that goal. It's like a
wishful thinking. It's like a wish list. Some of our guys feel really good
when I told them we was playing Arizona this year, and they feel great about
going to Louisville and Baylor. But once they got into it they realized
there's another level of not just talent but another level of effort.  
  
And so going into this game it's like, okay, North Carolina, they rebound four
of their missed shots in transition. You can score the basket on them and they
can score a basket on you within three seconds.  
  
And so now all the work that we put in this year, all the conversations and
speeches and everything that I've done, we talked about tomorrow is the day
you must lay it on the line.  
  
If not, we can play our best game that we've ever played, every guy can have a
career high, but we're still going to lose the basketball game.  
  
What we have to try to do is play our best game, prevent them from playing
anywhere near what their best game and be the worst game and we still may lose
the basketball game.  
  
So we can't respond and react to anything negative or positive. We just have
to go out and play the game the way it's supposed to be played.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Phil Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33114)

### [Wesley Person](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33115)

### [Jordon Varnado](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33116)

### [Jeremy Hollimon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33118)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got our student-athletes from Troy -- Wesley Person,
Jordon Varnado, DeVon Walker and Jeremy Hollimon.  
  
Q. Guys, what does it mean to be able to make the NCAA Tournament? And
also what challenge is there in playing a good ACC champion in Duke?  
WESLEY PERSON: It's a great feeling playing in Greenville, having a chance to
play in the NCAA Tournament. It's been our dream and our goal for the whole
season, and just to finally make it here, it's been a good ride.  
  
And I know we have a tough matchup ahead of us tomorrow, but we've prepared
for the game just like any other and our team is confident. And we'll be
prepared and ready for tomorrow.  
  
JORDON VARNADO: Like Wesley said, it's just an unreal experience to be here
right now and for the opportunity to be here. And like he's been saying, we've
been preparing for the game for tomorrow. It's going to be a real great show
tomorrow.  
  
DEVON WALKER: Piggybacking off of what these guys said, it's just a blessing
to be here. As these guys said, we've prepared and we're going to bring it
tomorrow.  
  
JEREMY HOLLIMON: I honestly feel it's a blessing to be here and as far as the
opponent, it doesn't matter who we play, we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Wes, when do you hope the wow factor of being here kind of wears
off?  
WESLEY PERSON: I guess when we step out there tomorrow for warm-ups, and they
finally tip the ball off and we played a couple of possessions, the wow factor
be gone. Just feel like a normal game, and we just gotta be ready to play our
game.  
  
JORDON VARNADO: Like Wes said, when the ball tip off tomorrow we'll be ready
and focused for the game.  
  
DEVON WALKER: For me I hope it wears off when we get on the bus heading over
here. I hope we approach it just like any other game which I know is kind of
impossible but that's my hope.  
  
JEREMY HOLLIMON: I'm still in wow. I'm going to remember this forever.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. You've been on this stage before. You've been to a Final Four. What
can you do to tell these guys what they're going to experience tomorrow?  
DEVON WALKER: Just all week really and in practice, just telling these guys
not to let the experience take over the game.  
  
We still have a game to play. There's still a lot of things that's surrounding
us, a lot of, as you said, the wow factor. There's a lot that's going on. So
we don't want to let those things overshadow what we came here to do and
that's to play basketball.  
  
Q. Your experience to get here, what's it been like going from Florida
now to Troy?  
DEVON WALKER: It's been crazy. It's been crazy. I couldn't have wrote a better
story. It's all the blessing to be around these guys.  
  
I've been on some great teams. Florida, played under Coach D. Did a lot of
great things, but this right here is in the top with it. Like I said, I just
can't imagine coming to Troy and being able to have this opportunity.  
  
Q. Wes, I asked you about Brantley a couple of times already, but just
what does it feel like now being here, a kid from Brantley, small town, I-A
basketball, and now you're here trying to play on the big stage?  
WESLEY PERSON: It feels a whole lot different coming from here to Brantley,
Brantley being a population about 500 people, and coming here somewhat of a
big city, and just to see all the hype around the March Madness. And finally
to be here, soak up all the feeling of having a chance to play in the
tournament and playing against Duke tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordon, your brother plays in the NBA. What advice has he given you
about this moment?  
JORDON VARNADO: Just to take it all in. Just be focused, prepared, lock in
mentally and just try to get your legs and body back in right shape and right
form.  
  
Q. Wesley, I wanted to ask you just how many 3s you think you'll score
tomorrow? And what's the challenge of going up against a Duke defense that
allows under 30 percent from that area?  
WESLEY PERSON: Well, I'm not worried about how many 3s I'm going to make
tomorrow, but just going to continue to play within the offense. My teammates,
we all do a good job finding each other when we're open. So I know we'll get
looks that we've been getting all season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: We're obviously very excited to be here. It's been a
whirlwind since we won on Sunday and made the tournament and got home late
Sunday night. But it's been a great experience at this point and very good
problem to have, everything we've got going on. So just really excited here,
looking forward to getting down to business and playing some tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, this week your program is in a spotlight it's not
always in the rest of the year. Is there anything you're going to do or ways
you're going to do it, maybe it's recruiting, exposure, anything, this week
just because it's here and you have it?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: The thing about the day and age we all live in now, it's all
instant news and we've got a tremendous media staff, and they're pumping
information out like crazy. So the thing about in terms of recruiting, I think
it's probably helping now. But it will really help us down the line some, and
when we have time to go back and reflect and use it to our advantage. But
social media right now everything is instant. Our stuff is out there
everywhere.  
  
Q. Wes Person had a phenomenal tournament out in New Orleans. How do you
think his momentum carries out here?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: He's been a guy consistent throughout his career. But he
really stepped it up in New Orleans, is on a roll. Confident young man since
the day he walked in, didn't feel the fear of a freshman. He started every
game except for one in his career when he was late for a shootaround or
something one day, overslept.  
  
But outside that he's been on the floor from day one. He's never showed one
ounce of fear, and I don't think he will tomorrow night. He'll be ready to go
and they'll be zeroed in on him like all defenses we played against.  
  
But we certainly use him, the way he's shooting the ball the way he's playing
right now, we could use that to our advantage, if he can stay hot like that.  
  
Q. Being on this big stage, what's it like having a guy like DeVon
Walker, who's been here before, been to a Final Four. What kind of influence
does he have on the team?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: The thing that stands out to me that DeVon has helped us
with this week is just a calming presence. When I look at him, his reaction,
starting in New Orleans as we advanced in the tournament, he never wavered
from an emotional standpoint.  
  
He was the same guy day after day, not too high, not too low. And that's
carried over from Sunday on. He just hasn't shown a lot of emotion either way.
He's been right down the middle of the road, which is what we try to preach
every day anyway.  
  
But I think if I'm a guy on our team right now and I look at him and I know
what he's been through as a player -- the locker rooms he's been in, the way
he's been on teams that have advanced to the extent that they did at Florida
while he was there -- and I'm on our team and I look at him and I see that
he's not very effective. I think it's really been a calming presence for the
rest of our team because he's been the leader of our team. Even though he was
a grad transfer we challenged him to be the leader of our team and he's done
that. To answer your question again, I keep going back to he's been a calming
presence for our guys.  
  
Q. You've played on now two extremes, one in Dothan where the lights
basically don't work in the arena, and now you're here at the NCAA Tournament.
Where does your team come from the moment it started to finishing middle of
the pack of the Sun Belt and kind of getting hot when the time's right?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: It's been a year filled with a lot of ups and down, but from
the start we thought this team had a chance to be really good. I keep saying I
look back on the trip we made out when we played at USC when they were
undefeated, ranked in the Top 25.  
  
We took a three-point lead with about a minute to go and felt like we had a
chance to win. We knew we had the ingredients to be really good. I don't think
what's happened here in the last week, I don't think it's been something many
people thought would happen. But we've been pretty good.  
  
You look -- we've beaten the best teams in our league. UT Arlington, you saw
what they did last night against BYU. So our league's been really good this
year and we've beaten most of the better teams.  
  
And just to win our league shows you that we have what it takes to be here.
But it's been a climb. But in the last month or so we've been playing at the
highest level we have all year. It's all sort of come together at the right
time.  
  
Q. Obviously you're playing a very good Duke team tomorrow in that game.
But does it help you to kind of fly under the radar? Does that give you a
little bit of an advantage for you guys being disrespected in that way?  
COACH CUNNINGHAM: Probably so. I don't know that disrespected, I don't think
they feel like they've been disrespected. Again, it's been such a whirlwind
since we made the tournament and just the preparation.  
  
I think the thing that stands out to our team is I think they're so excited
about being here, but not only just excited about being a part of the
tournament, but I think as a competitor, they're excited about playing the
game. Ultimately that's what it comes down to.  
  
All this hype and everything that goes with it, that's a great part of the
process. But ultimately, they're excited about walking out there on the court
and playing with a brand name like Duke.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas.  
  
Q. Dusty and Moses, Dusty, now that you're here on site you have the
NCAA banner behind you, how does it feel? Does it feel what you envisioned?
And if you could talk about Delgado the leading rebounder, what you think of
him and what you think of the matchup between the big guys?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: It's really cool. We just got here. We had a practice yesterday
and a practice at Furman, a practice at Furman yesterday and Bob Jones
University today. But this is the first time we're getting around here. And
it's really cool. I like the environment. Just really ready for tomorrow.  
  
MOSES KINGSLEY: What was my question?  
  
Q. What do you think of Angel Delgado, the 6'10 " Seton Hall player?
He's leading the country in rebounding. What do you think of him as a player
and going up against him and you guys matching up?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: He's obviously a very good player. We've just gotta do a very
good job of keeping him off the glass. If we do that, we can push the ball
after we get a rebound.  
  
Q. What's the key to keeping a guy off the glass who is averaging 13
boards, because obviously everybody is trying to do that, haven't been working
too good. What's your plan to do that?  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Box him out. Box him out. That's how you keep a guy off the
glass, box him out. And then you get the ball and you get it away, that's a
rebound. And then you -- and really what you gotta do is put a body on him. If
you put a body on him, the only way he can get the ball is to go over your
back. And if we do a good job of that we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Manny, the leadership on this team, just the way it's evolved this
year, and all the guys up there really have been leaders for this group. And
now you're at this stage. Collectively what's the leadership been like on this
run for you guys?  
MANUALE WATKINS: What you said, it's been just a collective group of leaders
and it's the guys you're looking at. These guys right here, up here, these are
the guys that have just brought it every single day at practice, on and off
the court and that's what leaders do. It's not just on the court or in the
games. It's continuous every day.  
  
And when you've got five of us doing it, it's just real big for the team and
that reflects, and we made it this far. So it's just evolved into the whole
year, and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Daryl, you have a deep bench, big rotation. Seton Hall a
shorter bench. What do you think you can do in terms of getting the game sped
up and making depth an issue?  
JAYLEN BARFORD: I think we just gotta push the ball, keep the tempo up and
just play our game, because I think they play with seven people. We play 10.
So when they get tired we just keep going, we just keep going.  
  
DARYL MACON: Piggyback on what Jaylen said, if we push the ball and play our
game which is up tempo definitely really coming to play in this game. Like
Jaylen said, we play 10 people, they play seven. We play (indiscernible) post
player there's no way a team can play seven players with us.  
  
Q. Manny and Moses, what's changed from two years ago when you guys were
in the NCAA Tournament as younger guys versus being a little bit older now?  
MANUALE WATKINS: I mean, it's really the same feeling. You're here but you're
just not excited to be here, you want to keep dancing. We're not here just to
-- oh, yeah, media, the hotel -- you're at the NCAA Tournament. I mean that's
all nice, but that's not our focus. We're here to dance.  
  
And obviously, I mean, we're here, we're seniors. It's different than when
you're a sophomore. It's your last time ever getting an opportunity to play in
March Madness. The sense of urgency is through the roof. And you're just ready
for the moment. Can't wait.  
  
MOSES KINGSLEY: Two years ago we played. Me and Manny played in the games, but
we didn't play that much. But this year we are one of the key players on this
team.  
  
And we know what it takes, because we played in that game two years ago. And
we know what we have to bring to the game and what we have to tell the guys to
bring to the game to execute.  
  
We're not just here to play one game or happy to be in the tournament, we're
here to win games.  
  
Q. Dusty, was there ever a time when you thought you wouldn't get to
enjoy this moment? I mean, like after last season? Or were you always pretty
confident it was going to happen this year?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: I was pretty confident it was going to happen this year. After
last year, it was down, because I didn't even have a team that sniffed the
bubble yet.  
  
So being able this year to have a team that's successful. And, you know, I
knew when we were playing pick-up in the summer we were going to have a
special team. I could just tell. I could tell people's mindsets were
different. And from then on it's been a grind and everyone's focused and
taking one game at a time.  
  
Q. I actually know this, when the team went to Jacksonville a couple
years ago, you redshirted, I don't know if you're allowed to go to as a
redshirt. Did you get to do that?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: I was on vacation, Miami.  
  
Q. What's it like, you practiced with the guys all year, you're part of
the team. They go to the NCAA Tournament. You can't go because you're
redshirted, what was that like?  
DUSTY HANNAHS: It was difficult. But that whole year I had gotten used to not
traveling because I could never travel with them.  
  
But it was cool just being a part of that team anyway. Whenever they got back
from wins and stuff, being able to to help contribute a little bit in
practice. But I definitely wanted to go. But you're not allowed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Coach Anderson.  
  
Q. You've obviously got a deeper bench than Seton Hall. What's the key
to making it an up-and-down game where you guys can take advantage of your
depth?  
COACH ANDERSON: We prefer the game to be up and down the floor, and I think
even Seton Hall does. They get up and down the floor. You look at some of
their scores, they scored in the 80s as well. It's the NCAA Tournament. I'm
sure they're going to come with everything and we're going to come with
everything as well.  
  
The game is a 40-minute game. And as I say, our defense hopefully can dictate
some of that in terms of how the game goes. But they're a very good defensive
team as well. Great guard play. When you've got one of the leading rebounders
in the country, that gives you a plus as well. So they really attack the
glass. And that's something that we're going to really, really have to do a
good job of, and I think that's how you get the game up and down the floor.
We've got to limit them to one shot and when they make it, we've got to make
transition offense a priority and transition defense a priority as well.  
  
Q. What do you think of Delgado? I guess after being able to watch him
in film and stuff, and how do you see the matchup between him and Moses?  
COACH ANDERSON: First of all, I think the matchup is going to be Seton Hall
and Arkansas. You can't just guard him with one person, Delgado. You've got to
keep him off the glass. But he has a great presence down low. He can face up.
He's a great passer.  
  
I mean, he has those soft hands. When he catches it, it's like Velcro. And
that's really helpful in rebounding. He's a great position rebounder, and they
play off of him. I think he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of passion.  
  
With our team, I think their time -- we go as Moses goes. I think with Seton
Hall, I think he and Carrington, no question about it, are big keys. And the
guy who's really playing really well is Rodriguez, playing absolutely well
right now.  
  
But Delgado, we've got to make the game -- we can't just let him just have it
in the paint because he'll destroy you. He can pass the ball well, and he can
use his body to score as well. He's a first-team all-conference player,
unanimous. That tells you, a guys that can get that many rebounds, I'll tell
you what, he's got great instincts with the ball.  
  
Q. The guys were in here joking, laughing at each other as they always
do. How much does that looseness help in an NCAA Tournament? You've obviously
done it a few times. Is it good to have your players loose? Is there such a
thing as too loose?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, the first game it kind of scares a coach because you
don't know how they're going to come out, but this group has been pretty good.
Coming off the SEC tournament, hopefully that gives these guys an idea what
it's going to be like to play in a setting like this here.  
  
We've got to lean on those guys you saw up here -- Manuale, Moses Kingsley.
We've got to lean on those guys to make sure they understand what takes place,
and a guy like Anton Beard was here. But in terms of being ready to play our
guys will come out, they'll be ready.  
  
Q. You mentioned Anton Beard. He actually got the start for you a couple
of years ago. Obviously there's been a lot to his story over the last couple
of seasons. How have you seen him grow from that point and especially this
season as a player?  
COACH ANDERSON: Anton's been real big for us. I think he's the reason why
we're seeing the adjustments for Jaylen and Daryl Macon. You made the
statement he started for us.  
  
And a lot of guys, they have a problem with that. You know, with new guys
coming in, but for him, he's been all arms, probably one of their best
friends. He's been key to us coming off the bench.  
  
He's a calming force, and I think he's playing some of his best basketball
this year, defensively, offensively. He got sick there for a while -- because
he was starting before he got sick and he had some other guys start playing
well. But he's going to be key. And we're going to have to lean on him. And we
have leaned on him. His experience throughout this season.  
  
Q. To turn to your bench, one of your guys being a starter in DT. How
much have you really talked to DT and Cook and Thompson, as far as motivation
knowing Sunday didn't go the way they wanted it to, in terms of how they
contributed, how they performed as a complement to Moses inside?  
COACH ANDERSON: In terms of -- they know how they played. They know -- when
they play well, our team really plays well. They had some moments in that SEC
Tournament, not necessarily in the championship game.  
  
But they've just gotta come out and do what they do. And what do they do? They
do some blue-collar things for our basketball team, and when teams are packing
in on them they've got to step out and knock down that 15-, 16-foot shot.  
  
But more importantly they've got to bring the energy, they've got to be
screeners. They've gotta do their roles, and I think if you combine Dustin
Thomas, who starts it off, or Arlando Cook as he comes in and gives us quality
minutes. And then of course Trey Thompson. I think he's playing outstanding
basketball for us.  
  
We're going to need those guys to match the Seton Hall folks. I think that's
going to be key in this game. As we move forward, our forwards are going to be
key. I think our guards are playing pretty good -- there are nights when I say
Daryl may have it going on or Barford may have it going on. And teams are
targeting in on Dusty Hannahs. But we've got to have somebody step up and
there comes Anton Beard.  
  
And we see what Manuale brings to the table. He just adds another dimension to
his game and shooting the basketball and playing with a lot of confidence.
Still doing all the dirty work. So again to me, it's about a team of balance
and having more options now. So who are you going to key in on is the key with
this basketball team. But we've got to have somebody step up.  
  
Q. Dusty, he waited five years to get here. What sense do you get from
him about how glad he is to cap off his career when he's waited so long and
just what have you thought about his season overall?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'll tell you what, I think so much of Dusty because coming
in, obviously he was a guy that shot the ball. He was scoring. And we've seen
his evolution as a player. He's developed going off the dribble, getting to
the free-throw line, and even playing a lot better defensively than he had in
the previous years.  
  
But I think he cares more about winning now. Sometimes you're around guys who
embody winning. It makes a big difference.  
  
Now you start doing those little things and we're seeing that. And Dusty is
playing with an edge too. I think he's turned into a leader with this
basketball team. When I was walking up here and I heard somebody mention what
did he do the last time we went to the NCAA Tournament. Hell, he was off on
the beach somewhere. We're out there trying to play in a win-in game in
Jacksonville and he's at the beach. And he should have been there.  
  
But in essence Dusty to me, I think he's had a very good year, outstanding
year. He's been a target. But I think he's done it the right way. There are
sometimes when guys are in that position, then they try to go "get" the game.
I don't think he's done it. Every now and then he's going to shoot some bad
shots. That's what shooters and good players do.  
  
As a coach sometimes you've got to live with it. And I've lived with it this
year. And I think it's freed him to go and play and become the best player he
can be.  
  
Q. For a team that scores as well as you guys do and usually in the 80s,
there's been some stretches, long stretches with no points at all like in that
Kentucky game. When you see those kinds of things happen going into the game,
what do you tell the guys if they're going through a little bit of a funk like
that, maybe drive and try to get fouled get to the lines so you don't have
such long stretches with no points?  
COACH ANDERSON: You just answered the question right there, didn't you? You
said drive or get it inside. Let's go inside. Let's go into the beast. Let's
get to the free-throw line.  
  
It's kind of like you're bleeding. Let's stop the bleeding. So we've got to
figure out, we do have those drops, we gotta come down and gotta execute and
get in what we need to get in.  
  
In the Kentucky game we did have some big drops, and that's a concern,
especially even when we get to this stage here because you're playing against
a team against Seton Hall, outstanding defensive team as well.  
  
But we've got to be able to -- whether we get guys attacking the basket, we
get guy spotted up, we've got to start -- I think start inside, maybe getting
Mo a nice touch, because sometimes it's not him, the key to him touching it,
it may open up somebody else.  
  
Q. You went through a little stretch this season where you guys weren't
playing particularly well, Missouri, Vanderbilt; you lose at home. People were
down on the team. What were you going through right there, and was there a
turning point coming out of that that you look back at and say that is the
kind of thing that started to click for you?  
COACH ANDERSON: We talked about this the other day. I just think that with
this team here, with so many new pieces, you gotta grow as a team. And we
started this process in the summer months, going to Spain, getting into our
offseason. Then, of course, practice. And even as you get into the regular
season, it takes time. And with this team here we had a pretty good non-
conference schedule. We did pretty good in it.  
  
All of a sudden, you jump into conference play. No sooner we jump into
conference play, the sense of urgency goes up 10, 20 notches. And I don't know
if our guys understood that as a whole. I know the guys coming back
understood.  
  
But that's the process we're talking about of building and creating that
chemistry with your team. And even as we got back on a winning track, winning
streak, then, of course, then we bump our heads again.  
  
We go play Missouri, play a team we played early in the year. You've got to
understand they're better. Their sense of urgency was way out the roof. I
thought our guys just went to show up to win. I think it's more mental than
anything else. We start growing up mentally.  
  
Vanderbilt comes in and waxes us that home. I think we learned. Anytime we
have some adversity we learned from it. I think that's why you're seeing a
team starting to surge and put those experiences into use. So I'm anxious to
see how we come out -- you're coming from the Kentucky game, where I thought
we were just -- I thought we wanted it so bad that we were too amped up.  
  
And now you come to the NCAA Tournament, the last, the tournament, and trying
to win a national championship. I'm anxious to see how we come out. And I
think we learned from that, knowing that it's one game, and you've got to
leave it all on the floor.  
  
Q. With just three guys who have experience in the tournament, going
into tomorrow, 24 hours from tip-off, do you talk more about your previous
experiences, or do you rely on those three guys to tell the other guys what to
expect?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think it's got to be a combination. They've got to see it
through my eyes. They've been seeing it through my eyes, that's why, when you
hear them talking, they're talking one game at a time. That's all we preach:
One game at a time.  
  
Throughout this course of the year, I've kept things simple. Obviously we
added on some things, but we don't change. As a matter fact, we get to this
time of the year, we really want to turn up the intensity in terms of how we
play.  
  
But at the same time we've got to lean on those guys that have been through
it. Anton, Manuale, Moses, even Trey. Those guys were here. And so they've got
to be the guys that say: Hey, guys, this is how we do it.  
  
And I think these guys have enough experience now to understand the sense of
urgency in terms of how we want to play and what we want to do in terms of
carrying out our game plan.  
  
Q. Besides Delgado, who is obviously a great offensive rebounder, seemed
like, with Seton Hall, a lot of them crash the offensive boards, even the
guards, like Carrington, he'll slip in there for an offensive board, how much
does that concern you, and how much, if you get the defensive boards, can it
obviously kickstart your transition game?  
COACH ANDERSON: That's going to be -- the main part of defense is rebounding
the basketball. You're absolutely right. Rodriguez, he's a tremendous
rebounder, all those guys rebound. Carrington, their guards. They are one of
those teams, they shoot it and go get it because they shoot it and they know
where it's going.  
  
That means we've gotta do an outstanding job of keeping them off the boards.
And they played quite a few teams. And you can see the difference in
rebounding is offensive rebounding is unbelievable.  
  
So that tells you they've got a knack for that and we've got to limit them to
get that, because what not only does getting offensive rebounds, you're
talking about scoring, but it puts your guys in foul trouble as well because
that's when those fouls come.  
  
So in order for us to keep guys out of foul trouble we've gotta do a good job
on the glass. Once we do that, our guards have got to rebound the basketball.  
  
And I think that really gets us into transition, and we've got some forwards
we feel that are versatile enough, they can get up and down the floor.  
  
But I think the key is, Delgado's gotta be one we gotta keep off. I think the
other guys, we've gotta do a good job of keeping body on body.  
  
Q. For Dusty, how happy are you that he's finally getting to experience
the NCAA Tournament? What do you think it means to him?  
COACH ANDERSON: He wants to win. I think that's it. He doesn't just want to
experience it. He wants to win, and I think it's kind of fitting for he and
the seniors. We talked about it at the beginning of the year, as we brought in
this group of guys to go along with that, making it a special year.  
  
When you have the seniors that we have that have invested in our programs,
doing the things the right way, getting ready to graduate, we've got Moses who
is on the SEC leadership SAC program.  
  
We've got some guys that are doing some outstanding things in our community.
So to me it's fitting that they go out in a great way and what better way to
go out than to have an opportunity to participate and expand and dance in the
NCAA Tournament. So he's happy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Mangok Mathiang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33182)

### [Tony Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33261)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 73, Louisville - 69  
  
COACH PITINO: Obviously, the team is very disappointed we lost, but, as
always, unless you win it all, it's always going to be a disappointment. We
played a good game, especially in the first half. We played terrific defense.  
  
We've lost games this year not because of effort, because these guys have
given me A-plus effort. We lose games because mentally we have a very
difficult time focusing on what to do defensively. It cost us the game tonight
by constantly giving them their right hand, which has to be taken away.  
  
That being said, we made a lot of big shots. Give them credit. We wanted to
hold the three down. We did it. We wanted to attack inside. We did it. They
were just a better team down the stretch, a little more experience.  
  
I was glad to see that Tony got a chance to play in the NCAA, get some
experience. That's why he came in as a fifth-year senior, and Mangok has been
a joy to coach for the 11 years he's been here.  
  
Q. Mangok, maybe just talk, they got a lot done inside, but you guys
were trying to get out and stop the 3. How tough a challenge is that to try
and cover everything? They seem to do it all well.  
MANGOK MATHIANG: Because they shoot the ball so well, the plan was to
basically try to switch everything. And once they seen that they try to take
advantage of our guards and the big fella, they did a good job of working on
getting into the paint.  
  
Like coach said, we did a poor job of giving them the strong hand, which was
the goal, to basically eliminate that. We didn't do such a good job on that.  
  
Q. Rick, did Moritz surprise you with being able to get that much done,
even though, obviously, you guys were focusing elsewhere on defense?  
COACH PITINO: We made some bad switches by not communicating. Mangok was
trying to tell the guards to get over it so we didn't have to switch. We
wanted to switch going toward the perimeter, not going to the basket. We made
some poor switches.  
  
Probably the weakness of our team this year has been our defense. Our offense
in the last ten days or two weeks, we've gotten significantly better because
we worked inside to out.  
  
But our backcourt defense, getting over screens, has probably been the biggest
weakness this year. We've got to improve in that area.  
  
Q. Rick, you talk about the defense in the second half. Was that the
difference in the game? Was it something Michigan was doing in the second half
that might have been different?  
COACH PITINO: They made some shots in crucial moments, but we played really
good defense in the first half because we switched intelligently, and we took
away the strong hand. You have to take away Michigan. They're a dominant
right-hand team, and we concentrated on taking away Walton because he's been
on such a run, the right hand. Then we gave him his right hand on a couple of
crucial plays.  
  
That's what it comes down to, a couple of crucial plays. We made a couple of
big mistakes. Mangok made one, fouling with three seconds to go, giving him
the right hand in the elbow and Deng not challenging the shot on the layup
when we did give them the right hand.  
  
But really, as a coach, you can never complain when you give great effort. All
year, it's been very tough on the whole team to focus in mentally on the
little things that make a great defensive team.  
  
That being said, we played the toughest schedule in the nation, finished 25-9.
Couldn't be prouder of the guys. Going forward, we have to learn how important
defense is because with the game on the line. We broke down defensively, not
offensively, because we shot a good percentage in the game and did a lot of
good things offensively.  
  
Q. It may not be the correct time, so I apologize, but Mangok, if you
can maybe look back a little bit at your time, I know Rick jokes about the 11
years at Louisville, but it has been a long run for you. Unfortunately, it
comes to an end tonight.  
MANGOK MATHIANG: I have no regrets in tonight's game. Coach is being honest
about focusing on key things towards the end of the game, and we did a poor
job on that tonight. And it started off with me when it came up to three
seconds left, poor foul, especially coming from a fifth-year senior and a
leader as well.  
  
Other than that, I feel like the team fought, played real hard. They gave
their teammates and coach everything they had, but we just fell short.  
  
Q. Tony, you found yourself in long stretch of the game against one of
the hotter point guards in the country. What was it like to be part of this?  
TONY HICKS: It was just a great experience. I couldn't have asked for anything
more. Just trying to make it tough on him. He was kind of the head of the
team. Tried to make it tough. It wasn't enough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Shaquille Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30385)

### [Zach Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33119)

### [Landry Shamet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32645)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Kentucky - 65, Wichita State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wichita State. And Coach, we'll ask you to make
an opening statement and then take questions.  
  
COACH MARSHALL: We came up one possession short and got to execute better in
the game, and that's on me. So I wish we had that over to do again, but we
don't. Congratulations to Kentucky on a hard-fought win going to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Landry, can you talk about the game you played today and basically
when it looked like the Shockers were at the end of their rope, you basically
revived this team?  
LANDRY SHAMET: I just tried to stay aggressive and make my open looks and take
advantage of whatever opportunity came. I didn't play very well in the first
half. One thing I want to touch on, Coach said that that late-game execution
was on him. It's on me. I'm the point guard. He called it. It was clear with
what we were supposed to do. I just didn't do exactly what we needed to do
there down the stretch on a few possessions.  
  
Q. Gregg, those last two shots, could you take us through those and how
not having any timeouts obviously handicapped what you could do?  
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, that's a rarity, as you know. I wish I had a couple. I
don't really remember exactly what happened with Markis's shot. To be honest,
I do not remember what we were doing, what quick or set we were in.  
  
I think we might have broken down into motion, and it's plenty of time on the
clock. He just -- I think he just rushed things a little bit and settled for a
very contested 3-point shot. I don't know if he thought he was going to get
fouled. I don't know what he did, but he certainly did, and it was a great
play defensively by them. I think we could have put more pressure on them by
driving. There was plenty of time at that point to drive the ball.  
  
He elected to pull the trigger there so that wasn't great, to say the least.
Then we had a place set up at the end, but it's hard -- Landry was ultimately
going to be passing the ball, and there was some action. I'm not going to tell
you exactly what we were going to do, but we had other play -- there were
other options.  
  
We didn't run that play. He basically, as you said, he had willed us back in
the game with some tremendous opportunities. So he elected to break off the
play. I guess you'd have to ask him. I think he thought he might have an
opening.  
  
Don't know if we had time to go to the rim for a quick two so we were trying
to get a three to tie the game. Just didn't work out.  
  
Q. You guys looked like you were about out of it and then made the last
comeback to get back. Can you describe the willpower you had to get back in
the game?  
SHAQUILLE MORRIS: Just late-game situations, that type of stuff. Coach
Marshall does a great job of preparing us for it in practice. So it was
something that we were used to.  
  
We just tried to make plays, and that's what we did, kept fighting. There's
not too much give-up in us at all. That's pretty much what it was.  
  
ZACH BROWN: Just what Shaquille said, we got guys who aren't going to give up
no matter what. At the end of the day, we're going to continue to fight all
the way to the last second. Wish things went different at the end, but that's
how the game goes. You win some. You lose some. We'll be all right.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: They touched on it.  
  
Q. Gregg, for most of the game, seems like Wichita State was able to
contain Kentucky's athleticism. But how big of a factor was them kind of
unleashing that in the final ten minutes or so?  
COACH MARSHALL: We obviously made some mistakes, which you can't do. We had a
breakdown defensively on a ball screen. We didn't hedge, and that resulted in
a dunk. And then we didn't have very good ball security. We had a couple of
really bad passes that fuelled their transition.  
  
So we talked about ball security and shot selection keeps them out of
transition. When you don't do those things, they're able to get out and gallop
and run and finish.  
  
That's how they got the lead, whatever it was, six, seven, eight points. I
don't even know what it got to. But to follow up on Pat's question, I mean,
there's no quit for us. I mean, we have to grind for everything that we get.
We know that. It's pretty evident.  
  
We thought we'd come back and win the game. We thought we were the better
team. In our locker room, we believed we were the better team. Regardless of
what whoever thinks, we thought we would and should win the game.  
  
So it's a 40-minute game. In the end, we didn't make the play to force
overtime.  
  
Q. Landry, could you describe Fox and his quickness and the challenges
that presents?  
LANDRY SHAMET: He's an NBA guard. They've got a couple of them. He's pretty
versatile. Played him more as a driver, so you kind of knew when he wanted to
get to the rim and play off the dribble.  
  
He does present some challenges. He's really quick. He's like a bigger,
stronger Paris Lee, a good, heady player. We had a good game plan coming in on
how to contain him and Monk and the rest of the guys, and I think we executed
for the most part. But like Coach said, had a couple of breakdowns down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Gregg, after that 2014 game, you said it took that effort and a loss
for people to see what Wichita State was about. Do you have similar feelings
after this game?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't know, Paul. How many years do we have to do this to
make people respect our program? I don't know. That's up to you guys.  
  
I mean, I know that we have the heart of a champion. I know these guys, how
they work, how hard our staff works, how much time, energy, passion we put
into this.  
  
This will just be more fuel for us. This will be a 3-point loss to Kentucky, a
2 seed. We know we can play much better. Basically, other than our two seniors
who started as walk-ones, we've got everybody back.  
  
So we will -- it really doesn't matter what other people think, to be honest.
It matters what we think. And we can't change people's perception of our
program. We can't change people's preparation of the Missouri Valley
Conference or the talent level. It's more important that we know what we're
about, and we sleep really well at night knowing what we have and what we
continue to prove and what we continue to do as a program.  
  
And if we get a break or two, and another shot goes down, maybe we're
advancing, maybe we win the whole thing. I mean, that's possible. So that will
be our goal next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Malik Monk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32316)

### [De'Aaron Fox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32317)

### [Edrice Adebayo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32938)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Kentucky - 65, Wichita State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with an opening statement and take
questions.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: I'm really proud of the guys. Hard game to play. They really
grind it out. The offensive rebound, I thought we rebounded with them, did
good stuff.  
  
It was great to have Malik back. Haven't seen him for a while. He's on that
path, still not all the way back, but he's on the path that we need him on.
And these guys up here, they're young, but they have a will to win and play
with courage and are skilled basketball players and great kids who share. So
proud of them.  
  
Q. Bam, could you describe what you saw on their last play when you
blocked them when they were going to the 3? And John, did you consider fouling
in that situation?  
EDRICE ADEBAYO: We was just playing defense. He pump faked, and I knew he had
to shoot it so I just went up and tried to block it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
  
COACH CALIPARI: It entered my mind when they messed around with the ball, but
I hadn't said anything. When it got down to four, five, I'm thinking we gotta
foul. Ten seconds is way too early, too many possessions left. I don't like it
with that time, but these guys guarded it.  
  
We knew what we were doing, switching everything and playing high. And if they
were going to take something, make it a two.  
  
Q. Same question to Bam, but to Malik. What did you see on the blocked
shot that you had the possession before?  
MALIK MONK: Like he said, playing straight-up defense. We knew we couldn't
foul. We knew they was going to shoot a 3. Just play solid. I just contested
well.  
  
Q. Bam, were you aware of what Dominique was doing on that block? I
mean, he jumped and had to avoid fouling. Did you have an awareness of his
presence in that play?  
EDRICE ADEBAYO: Yeah. The way it happened, my man had said a back screen for
Zay. And the ball came to my side. He pump-faked Dom, so I had to help my
teammate. As soon as he went to jump, I blocked it.  
  
Q. Coach, how big were the seniors in this game?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, in the first half, Dom just played outstanding. I was
thinking about starting him in the second half, but we got a good group that
sticks together so I just went with what I was doing.  
  
Mychal Mulder made a huge 3. I put him back in to play the four. I was going
to play he and Derek as the fours. I played Derek almost the whole half. He
played well. Then Derek made the 3 in the corner, made a couple of 3s,
rebounded pretty good. Ended up with eight rebounds and nine points. Think of
that. Three steals. Derek Willis.  
  
I mean, it's nice that we've got veterans like Isaiah and those seniors
playing. Isaac did all right. I didn't play him a whole lot, but he did fine.  
  
Q. De'Aaron, the position, Wichita State went zone late and you went
through it. Could you take us through what you saw there?  
DE'AARON FOX: They had been playing man most of the whole half. I think they
got in the 1-3-1, some type of defense. I called it out. It came from the
right wing. I called it, and I saw nobody behind my defender. Most of the
time, I'm not looking at the guy guarding me. When I saw there was nobody
there and I had a clear lane, I just took it.  
  
Q. John, you spoke highly of Landry Shamet before the game. Did he do
anything in this one that exceeded even your expectations or praise?  
COACH CALIPARI: He made big-time shots, like those are gutty shots. Like the
game was over, and he makes a 3. He makes a 2. We got it to seven, ready to
bust out and he made plays. He's good. He's a good player.  
  
Q. Malik, seemed to get off to a soft start. How did you get it going in
the second half?  
MALIK MONK: Told me to be patient. He was going to give me the ball and run
the offense through me and Bam. Bam made good-time dunks. He got me open and I
knocked down the shots.  
  
Q. Shamet picked up his fourth foul with four and a half minutes to go.
Do you change your offense to attack a specific player like that or just run
your offense?  
COACH CALIPARI: Any time I've done that, it screws up the game, so I don't.
Every time, go at him, go at him. All of a sudden, you take yourself out of
what you're doing. I'm not worried about the other team, I'm worried about my
team. If these guys are out there knowing a guy's got four fouls and I'm going
to drive him, that's fine.  
  
But I've done this 30 years, and every single time I've done that, I've
screwed up a game. So no.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you could get a rematch with UCLA in the next
round. Your thoughts on maybe getting them again.  
MALIK MONK: They play at 9:50 or 9:40. Whoever we play, we'll focus on that.
We'll have great days of practice, but we'll still focus on what Kentucky
does.  
  
Q. De'Aaron, at what point this season did it start to maybe turn around
for you that in late game situations? You've found yourself sort of, for lack
of a better term, maybe taking over and finding in the big spots?  
DE'AARON FOX: There's been a couple games like that. The first one was, I
think, Mississippi State. I think the SEC tournament, I was really good down
the stretch. Also, the Georgia game, at Georgia, I was good down the stretch.
So it's just been a few games. We don't have a go-to person down the stretch
because we've got multiple guys that can get it done.  
  
If it's my turn, I do it. Malik hit a big 3 off the dribble, and he knocked
down clutch-free throws. Whoever hands the ball ends up in, that's who does
it.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Thanks, folks.

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [D.J. Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32939)

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 73, Louisville - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will begin with an opening statement from Coach Beilein, and
then we'll go to questions for everybody.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: A little damp right now, but our guys, we started a tradition
of taking a shower, I guess, without going into the shower after good wins.
It's not stopping.  
  
So proud of these guys. The end of the first half, I thought was a defining
moment for our team in this particular game. We could have approached that
differently. We were coming back, shot clock's down, they nail a 3. I think
they came back down again, nailed another 3. Then all of a sudden, we got a
foul, and they get two more. We're down eight at half.  
  
A team that isn't as experienced, that despite have the poise we have, would
come back and try to win it all right away. We won every four-minute period
until we got ahead in the game. And just by playing in those little increments
made a big difference.  
  
Coaches helping me, assistant coach is helping me, great game plan, Billy
Donlon, 69 points. I can't tell you how many plays Jeff and Saddi suggested
that worked. It was a great team win for everybody.  
  
Q. John, you had 40 points in the paint tonight. You obviously made a
decision to take the ball inside when they were trying to take away your 3s.  
COACH BEILEIN: You can't do both with them. We work on it a lot. You won't
believe. People think we're a 3-point shooting machine. You can't do that
anymore unless you can drive the ball or both D.J. and Mo. We've worked hard,
Saddi Washington, to play one-on-one in the post. People are sticking with our
shooters. We do that a little bit with Jordan Morgan during good years and
Mitch McGary and DeShawn Sims. We haven't been able to do that in many of our
years now.  
  
It's a big game changer, as well as Derrick Walton and Muhammad not settling
for jump shots. They can take the ball to the basket and finish. We've been
working on it endlessly. We've been working on it for four years.  
  
Q. D.J., you're like a point guard now, as far as getting to the free
throw line, knocking them down, second straight outing. Take us through the
mental process with that kind of pressure, 18,000 people watching. What do you
go through to nail them as you did?  
D.J. WILSON: I don't feel any really. Everybody is confident in my ability
knocking down free throws down the stretch. I'm confident in myself. So that's
really all I need. I think yesterday when we played Oklahoma State, I think
that really helped me. So when I went to the line, I just had to have
confidence.  
  
Q. Coach Beilein, are you surprised with the six turnovers and are you
surprised that the University of Louisville did not extend its defense
earlier?  
COACH BEILEIN: We only average nine a game. So I didn't know in short prep,
you know, we were expecting anything. We try to prepare for all of it. But,
again, you open up the floor, people don't press much anymore because you know
what it gives you? A wide open three at the other end, which we do at five
positions. So that's why John Wooden pressed for years. You can't do that
today.  
  
I'm sure it's something to do with that. And at the same time, they really
played really good. We could not get used to their length on offense. A lot of
screens. We had to settle down to realize we can take the ball to the basket.  
  
Q. Mo, given the defense on Derrick, the switches that gave you those
mismatches, what gave you the mindset to protect the basket?  
MORITZ WAGNER: Like Coach B said, we've been working a lot on the switching
defense, getting the ball in the post, being aggressive down there as well. I
think I'm just very confident because of our practice because of the work we
all put in, and it paid off today.  
  
Q. Mo, did you have a sense going into the game, based on the way they
might play you guys that you'd have to play a big role or did you develop as
it happened?  
MORITZ WAGNER: No. I just let the game come to me. Don't force anything and
see what happens. Today, I got a couple easy ones early. Therefore, my
confidence level was high.  
  
Q. For D.J. and Mo, there was a minute there when you guys kind of
embraced near the basket and hugged each other. What did you say to each other
there? What was going through your emotions?  
D.J. WILSON: Me and Mo, we're real close, especially off the court. We're
roommates. So I don't know. We just got, like I keep saying, confidence with
one another. I don't know. We kind of -- our play is kind of contagious out on
the floor. I feed off his energy. He feeds off mine.  
  
Down the stretch, when we pulled out the victory, I was as happy as I could
have possibly be, and I seen Mo right there so I just embraced him.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: Like D.J. said, we're very close, and we work so much together.
We do similar things. So it's beautiful to see each other being successful and
very happy that the team, in general, could be successful today.  
  
Q. Derrick, you'd been having a tough shooting night. Can you describe
that last drive, the big play you made? Did you feel I'm taking this or did
you feel like giving it up to somebody else?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: No. I felt like every shot I shot today was a great shot,
and I know Coach B would yell at me if I start to defer. So I just kept
screening to my guys. After they made play after play after play, I just told
them I could bring it home and hit the shot. I hit the jump shot, and I hit
the layup. He looked at me. Like I said, I feed off those guys to give me so
much confidence. I knew if I stopped shooting, they'd be mad at me.  
  
Q. Derrick and D.J., of all the things that Mo gave you guys out there
today, what do you think he did best?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: He's got the mentality where he wants to make the play.
We feed off him so much because he plays with so much energy. He just makes
the right play at all times. He has the calls to make the big plays, so we
feed off him because he's not afraid of anything. So that's pretty much his
mentality.  
  
D.J. WILSON: Mo just has the mentality of he's not scared in the moment, and I
think you definitely saw that today. Down the stretch, when he got the ball,
he knew he was going to make a play, and we watched him. He executed well down
the stretch. That was big, a big confidence boost.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like during the regular season, there was a
perception about the Big Ten maybe having a weak year, a down year. Three
teams in the Sweet 16 now. Did you feel during the regular season that it was
stronger than it had been given credit for?  
COACH BEILEIN: I don't know how they'd judge how teams were, but we're all
going to be judged a lot on what happens in November, December. We had a
tremendous league last year with a lot of turnover. Guys going pro, great
seniors in the league.  
  
We had some injuries to some players as well. So you get judged by that. I
thought we had a pretty good record, actually, as a league, but it didn't
measure up.  
  
There's always going to be a lot of hype about what teams are getting most
hype early, and it just doesn't go away. And so as a result, I just told
everybody, just wait. The level of coaching in this league, the resources in
this league, the level of talent in this league, it will come to the top at
the end of the year.  
  
Moritz, he averaged two points a game last year. He's 19 years old. You got to
watch this guy. D.J. averaged the same. There's a process that people go
through to develop their teams, and we had a lot of good seniors last year who
graduated and a lot of guys waiting in the wings. It may have not showed in
November, December. It's showing in March.  
  
Q. Derrick, I guess I'll go back after the Ohio State game at home,
Michigan State game, and I think you were quoted as saying you looked at
yourself, why not me take this team, put this team on my back. Has your
leadership skill, even though you're a four-year starter, ramped up
significantly from when you were a freshman?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Of course, since I was a freshman, my job was easy, run
the team, and get guys involved. Now, at this stage, it's a lot more. Credit
to a lot of guys I work with that help me work on my leadership. At this
point, I feel like why not have this team have my identity, just a
determination and just a will to win. I'm happy I was able to have a
thumbprint on this team so they want to keep going.  
  
Q. John, you alluded to the decisions you guys made as a staff about how
to make changes once the game started, whether it's isolating Mo or D.J. Could
you kind of walk through the process?  
COACH BEILEIN: We run a bunch of action. Some of it is non-ball screen. Some
of it is ball screen. You throw it out there, and you read how they're doing.
So now we're training every four minutes. We get to huddle up, and we talk
about it, and then we try to get the game to evolve in the way they're playing
us.  
  
Now, Louisville could have changed in the middle and then we'd have to
reevaluate, but there's a process we go through to figure out how people are
playing us, to then apply the right type of action. That was happening.  
  
And we had expected they may switch ball screens because their big guys are
long and they're athletic and they're going to try. As Derrick said, man,
Coach, those guys are long and they're shooting over. Once we knew that, there
was some action we were going to delete, and we were going to go with other
stuff. Part of that is just post-up action.  
  
Q. For all the players, a couple days ago, Rick Pitino called you guys
the Golden State Warriors after you bombarded Oklahoma State with those
3-pointers. Today, you beat Louisville missing 11 of 17 3-pointers. Do you
think that short-changed what you guys are all about, just a free-throwing,
shooting team?  
MORITZ WAGNER: We always believed in ourselves, not only from a shooting
respect, but also on the defensive end and in the paint as well. So, yeah, I'm
very happy. I just said that to Coach B, we only shot six 3s today and we won.
So it's awesome. We played gritty basketball, and I think we can be proud of
that.  
  
D.J. WILSON: I think it just shows the versatility of this team. Our offense,
it's kind of like pick your poison. Today, we didn't knock down the 3. We
worked, and we did other things to put the ball in the hole, and it was
effective.  
  
I also think just on the other end, they had ten offensive rebounds in the
first half and limiting them to five in the second half was key for us to pull
out the victory.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Pretty much what that those guys said, found another way
to win. That's been our identity in the last month and a half, finding
different ways to win. Whether it's the 3-ball or not, it's finding multiple
different ways to win and taking what the game gives us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

### [D.J. Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32939)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Derrick Walton, Jr., D.J. Wilson and Zak
Irvin.  
  
Q. Just general thoughts when you first think of Louisville or see them
play, what comes to mind, what makes them unique in your mind's eye for all
three players, please?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: They're a really good coached team. They're really
athletic, really long. They attack the glass on the defensive and offensive
side. They pose a different threat just with their length and athleticism, so
we're doing some things to make sure we keep those guys off the glass.  
  
D.J. WILSON: They have nice guards. Their starting guards can shoot the ball
well. That's nothing different than we're used to in the Big Ten. But I think
the biggest difference is how hard they attack the offensive glass. They have
a lot of athletic fours and fives that can get after it.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Touching on what Derrick said, they're just very long and athletic.
Also too they try to disrupt our offense with pressing and try to take things
away from us.  
  
Q. This is a Louisville team with a lot of length. How important is D.J.
and what kind of impact can he make in this game?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think he's very important for us. He's able to change the game in
a various amount of ways because of his versatility, being able to play
multiple positions. He's long and athletic like they are. It will be a key
part in the game for us tomorrow.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Just like Zak said, he can guard, defend multiple
positions. He's agile. We got a lot of confidence in him being able to match
up with those guys. Looking forward to see what he does against those guys.  
  
Q. Derrick, yesterday Rick Pitino, who has been known to exaggerate,
compared you guys to the Golden State Warriors. I wonder how you reacted to
that and which one of you is Steph Curry.  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I was going to ask who is who? I didn't take it any type
of way. If it is sarcasm, I think he's saying we're a good team. That's all I
think of it as.  
  
Q. You guys are obviously really good at shooting the 3-pointer.
Louisville is one of the best in the country defending the 3-pointer. What are
some of the keys to success when you face good 3-point defense in terms of
getting shots off or making shots?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think we can't get disrupted with our offense, get in the flow
early. I think it took us a little while yesterday to get settled down into
our offense. That will be key. How well Derrick has been playing, he's getting
everybody in their spots. That will be key.  
  
D.J. WILSON: The first few minutes when we see the defensive game plan, what
they try to take away, we'll get adjusted to it well after like a media time-
out or whatever, once we see what they're trying to do and how they're trying
to guard us.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Just like D.J. said, we just adapt to what the game gives
us and pretty much just go from there, takes what the game gives us.  
  
Q. Does Louisville look like anybody you guys have faced this year? Have
you seen anything similar to what they present?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I think you could think of SMU as far as how they attack
the glass, having good length. That's my best comparison.  
  
D.J. WILSON: Same. SMU comes to mind just because how athletic they are and
how they attack the offensive glass.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: I'd agree with those two, SMU. They crash the glass hard. Oklahoma
State yesterday crashed the glass hard. That will be key. We've got to get
them off and out in transition.  
  
Q. You guys started the season with a 19-11 record and then won your
last six straight. Some of the elements of keys to success of why that's
happened and how much of an influence was what happened at the airport that
day and how has that changed you guys?  
D.J. WILSON: What happened at the airport, I don't think that has a lot to do
with how we're performing on the court. I think we're just clicking at the
right time. Our defense is starting to click.  
  
We're starting to get a lot more stops. So once you combine the defense that
we've been playing over the course of the second half of the year with our
offense, then we're dangerous.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Touching on what D.J. said, I think our offense has been there the
whole year. It was our defense that was lacking, and we made those adjustments
and want to be playing our best basketball in March and hopefully continue
into April. We're doing that right now.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I think to say the least, as a team, you want to get
better as the year progresses. That's pretty much what we do here, and we just
get better each and every game and throughout the season and pays dividends.
We've been able to put up some wins.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about everything starting to click. What do you
see out there that tells you it's falling into place, it's clicking?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Just our communication with one another and making plays
is the biggest difference at this point, having complete control over what
we're doing out there, pretty much.  
  
D.J. WILSON: I think it's on the other end, just defense, starting to click on
that end. Like I said, the offense has always been there throughout the course
of the year. It was just whether or not we were going to play defense. We have
so far in the second half of the year, and hopefully we can carry that
momentum on the defensive side into tomorrow.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: At this point, player-driven teams be coach-driven teams, and we've
done that the past two months, I'd say. Like D.J. said with our defense, the
intensity has ramped up. It's been a game changer for us.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, not that it's really relevant to tomorrow, but
curious if you have any particular memories of the Louisville/Michigan
National Championship a few years ago.  
ZAK IRVIN: It was the year before Derrick and I got here. I just remember
watching the game, how well Spike played. A lot of people didn't see Spike
before that point, 17 points the first half, it was incredible. Then the
controversial call with Trey and I think it was Siva with the blocked call.  
  
D.J. WILSON: Those two come to mind automatically, Spike and the call, the
foul. Then, also, the Tim Hardaway, when he had that dunk in the fast break.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Pretty much the same. And just want to see our team
succeed, though we weren't here. I wanted to see them succeed so bad. That's
pretty much it.  
  
Q. It's often been said that it's difficult to face a Pitino-coached
team on very short notice because his defense is just so complex. What are
some of the challenges for you guys on short notice in wheeling back around
and facing a new team? Is it adjusting on the fly? What are some of the
challenges?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I think we did a great job last week. We had to play four
games in four days, so adjusting will be pretty much what we do at this point.
Adapting is another part of our identity. We just adapt to what the game gives
us and go from there.  
  
D.J. WILSON: Like Derrick said, playing four games in four days, that's
something that you have to kind of just adapt to as far as learning their
offenses and whatnot. But at the same time, I also think that we're hard to
scout for with just a day between the games just because we're so complex on
the offensive end, and we have so many weapons.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Just really what they touched on. It's not going to be easy by any
means, but I think we'll be ready for it. Everybody knows Coach B has us
prepared for several things coming at us. Once the game gets going, it will be
fun.  
  
Q. Derrick, what is the key to you guys having such a low turnover rate
all year? What makes that happen?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Well, first and foremost, if we turn the ball over in
practice, there's a consequence. So our coach really values not turning the
ball over and making sure we get the best possible shot each and every
possession. I think as a team, our identity, that's something we've came to
means with it and making sure we get a shot every time down the floor and make
sure we pass the ball to the guys on our team.  
  
Q. What is the consequence of turning the ball over in practice?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: It varies, running to the top of our gym or just being
taken out of the drill. It's just one of the things that we still know we
don't want to turn the ball over.  
  
Q. For Derrick, I don't know if you've seen UCLA play, but if someone
hadn't been watching college basketball this season and said who's the best
offensive team in the country, what would be your answer?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: We played Oklahoma State yesterday, and we played UCLA,
so it will be one of my top two. But I wouldn't short change us either. I
think we've got five or six guys on our team that's already reached the
20-point plateau. I think you can make an argument for Michigan being one of
the most offensive teams.  
  
Q. Yesterday, you guys set a school record in the tournament for three
points made in the tournament game. What was the key to your success,
especially in the second half, with the 3-point shot?  
ZAK IRVIN: One of the things for our team is we're so unselfish, especially
how well Derrick is leading our team on the offensive end is something
special. One of us gets it going like Derrick did in the second half, it's
contagious for all of us, and we're able to score in various ways.  
  
D.J. WILSON: I think everybody around the court has utmost confidence in
themselves and each other. When we get the ball and shoot it, we plan for it
to go in. We don't second guess ourselves.  
  
At the same time, I think that we're just taking what the defense was giving
us. With our offense, you have to pick your poison. So they were leaving us
open for three, and we were making them pay.  
  
Q. Zak, at this stage of the tournament, how important is executing
whatever the plan is, or can teams get away with sort of freelancing or
relying on talent?  
ZAK IRVIN: At this point in the season, I think execution is key. I think we
showed that yesterday against Oklahoma State, especially those last five
minutes, the game kept going back and forth. For us to be able to get stops,
especially on the defensive end was huge. We had big-time players, made big-
time plays.  
  
Q. Zak, a few years ago, there was a lot of criticism in the college
game, especially shooting. Obviously, you guys are a great example of how far
it's come. In your career at Michigan and watching college basketball, what do
you think has changed to where there's been a better value on shooting the
basketball?  
ZAK IRVIN: Like I said, I think there has been a change in shooting. I think
also too, you just give credit to teams have started playing smaller
basketball. With fours, especially like D.J., how he's able to change the
style of the game for us, even Mo, a five-man, being able to shoot the ball
the way he does. We work on practice all time. Coach B has done a great job on
working with people and their shooting forms. I think that's been one of the
reasons why we have been so successful.  
  
Q. Speaking of the 3s, how much are you instructed in -- you talked
about penalties for turnovers in practice. Is there a penalty for taking a
15-footer? Are you guys told to specifically avoid that?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: No. The main thing Coach B preaches is take the shot when
you're open. That's all we do here. We take what the defense gives us, and
there's no penalty for shooting 15-footers.  
  
Q. I'll stay on the topic of shooting. Pitino's comment, Golden State
Warriors, how much are you influenced by what happens at the next level
because it seems like there's a trickle-down effect with the small ball.  
D.J. WILSON: I'm not too sure how much it influences us. I just think we have
a lot of pieces, and Coach B does as best as he can to kind of just control us
in a way to let us have freedom while at the same time just letting us play
our game.  
  
So I don't know if it really has much of an influence of how we play. We're
just utilizing all the tools that we have.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Coach B does a great job with the Xs and Os. But he says from time
to time, it's the players. It's not the plays. Like I said, just to harp on
Derrick, Derrick's doing a great job with that and for us to be able to score
the ball in various ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Pitino is here. We'll get started.  
  
Q. As one of the pioneers of the use of 3-point shots in this tournament
or in the game in general, what do you make of the continuing evolution of
that, where Michigan shot more 3s than 2s, both the college and pro level? Are
you surprised it took this long?  
COACH PITINO: The amazing thing to me is you look at the size of the players
that Michigan has, and they shoot it like backcourt players. That's what's
really coming on.  
  
I made a concentrated effort this past year in our recruiting is just recruit
bigs who could shoot because we don't have bigs who can shoot now. So we
signed kids that number one priority is they can shoot the 3-point shot
because it has evolved where 6'10", 6'11" guys no longer want to play in the
post.  
  
The other thing that's really interesting about the pros is the great centers
are all losing in basketball. Dwight Howard's winning a little bit now and,
certainly, he's up there. But most of the true centers are not winning.  
  
You look at New Orleans and Sacramento before Cousins left, and it's the small
teams that shoot the 3s that are all winning. So it has evolved into -- from
1987 to now, it's gone through a great change.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that, talked to John Beilein about the college game
trending toward some of the NBA, and he said he wouldn't be in favor of a
24-second shot clock. Want to know your thoughts on that.  
COACH PITINO: I think it wouldn't be good. I'm in favor of it because I've
coached in the pros. But it wouldn't be good for the game because it would
take away from teaching the fundamentals of basketball, the art of passing the
right way.  
  
In the pros, they take a lot of challenged shots, and they're able to make it.
I remember somebody saying one time, Allen Iverson's personal wasn't very
good. I said, yeah, but it's because with five seconds to go, everybody's
playing him. He's got to take very difficult shots.  
  
And I wouldn't want that to come into our game where everybody's got to take a
difficult, rushed shot all the time. 30 seconds is, I think, just the right
time.  
  
Q. Rick, you've had great runs in March. Michigan's on one right now.
Actually dates back a little into February. How would you define what a March
momentum run is like?  
COACH PITINO: Well, they have all the ingredients that add up to great runs.
They shoot well from the foul line. They shoot well from the field. They're a
much-improved defensive team as the season's gone on. They're extremely well
coached at the fundamentals of the game, and then they have as tough a point
guard as there is in the college game from a mental standpoint.  
  
So they're got all the ingredients to understand why they're making such a
strong run.  
  
Q. Rick, you've had a couple of very memorable NCAA tournament games
against John Beilein teams. Does this team play like his other ones? Is his
style pretty much continuous, or are there changes?  
COACH PITINO: Well, that's the genius about John Beilein is we prepared a
different way to play Jacksonville State. This team that we've had, and I've
never done this before since I've been a coach, we've almost -- against
Kentucky, we played a matchup zone. Against Indiana, we played a switching
man. Against Jacksonville State, against Wichita State, against Purdue, we
played everybody almost different every single night out.  
  
We had a week to prepare because we lost in the opening round of the
tournament. With one-day prep, this is about as difficult a task as I've faced
since I've been a coach because of the way they play.  
  
There's nobody similar this year, and we had the number one schedule in the
nation that I can say plays like Michigan. You have to beat them, because if
you put them to the line, they're going to make their free throws. If you give
them open looks, they're going to make their 3s. If you overplay them, they're
going to go back door.  
  
So they're truly unique. And with one-day prep, it's very difficult. And they
only give you an hour and a half practice too.  
  
Q. Rick, in the same vein as that earlier question about March. It's
been 30 years since your run down at Providence. What were the endearing
moments and memories you have from that run 30 years ago?  
COACH PITINO: Well, it's one of my favorite teams of all time. I've said this
about 30 times to the local media, the last two years have reminded me of 1987
as people.  
  
It's the closest thing I've seen to the type of people. Damien Lee and Trey
Lewis coming in and the guys I have now remind me of my Providence team as
people.  
  
The Providence thing was truly Cinderella. I look back, and it's molded my
career in thinking that anything is possible because when I first took over at
Providence, I remember as if it's yesterday, sitting with Dick McGuire and
Fuzzy Levane as an assistant coach of the Knicks watching Providence College
lose by 30 points, and they carried Joe Mullaney off the court, and they lost
by 30 points.  
  
And Dick McGuire said to me, he said, you're not considering taking that job.
I said, well -- because I had both of them watch Providence. They were losing
their three good players. Billy Donovan did not get in the game or play. And I
was meeting Lou Lamoriello, the A.D., at the Abbey Tavern in New York City, a
block from where I grew up.  
  
I'll never forget it, because Dick, Fuzzy and I talked about you cannot take
this job. It's the worst job. Seton Hall and Providence were dead-last place
since the inception of the Big East, and I knew I couldn't turn this program
around. It was too, too far down.  
  
Lou Lamoriello sat there with his head down when I walked in, and he said,
this happens every year how people come down by train, and they go home after
the first round and lose by 30 points.  
  
And he said, but I'm going to change it. I'm going to change the whole
culture. I'm hiring you tonight. And I already made up my mind, sitting with
Dick and Fuzzy, there's no way I can ever coach this team. Immediately, I said
yes, I'll take the job.  
  
I never forgot that moment in my life because he patronized me for one
sentence, and I took the job without talking contract or money. And that '87
Providence team, I'll never forget because it made me so positive in thinking
anything's possible in the game.  
  
If that team could go to a Final Four, anything's possible. And if Billy
Donovan can go from a 190-pound basketball player who I was beating 15-0 every
day one-on-one to an All-American and I couldn't even carry his shoes after
two years was quite special.  
  
Q. Rick, I wonder if you could describe for me a good challenge of a
3-point shot. I see a lot of players that think they're far enough out or
whatever and the ball goes in and coaches get on them. What are you talking
--  
COACH PITINO: I was just watching West Virginia/Notre Dame and the West
Virginia guard was taking a shot at least 15 feet behind the line. There was
no doubt in his mind it was going in.  
  
You see that a lot with Michigan. I happened to be watching the second half
with the players in the locker room. I think they were 4 for 15 maybe in the
first half. I forgot the number. We all sat there with our mouths open
watching one shot after another from six, seven feet behind the line go in.  
  
Immediately, I saw the team rooting for Oklahoma State.  
  
Q. Covering Michigan sports, I'd imagine that most Michigan fans,
especially the casual Michigan fans are quite familiar with your championship
team from a couple years ago when you played Michigan.  
So maybe you can talk a little bit about how your team plays now, how you
might contrast that team and this team; and then, also, the two Michigan
teams, the one from back then and the one which you see now.  
  
COACH PITINO: Well, as I said in Boston, Gorgui Dieng is not walking through
that door and Peyton Siva and Russ Smith aren't either. It's a far different
basketball team that we have now compared to that '13.  
  
I would say Michigan, in style of play, there's no Trey Burke, and there's
some of the players that they had right now who are playing in the NBA are far
different.  
  
That doesn't mean that they're not better or as good. It's just far different.
It's a much different Michigan team in '13 than they are now.  
  
So we're both different, and we obviously had more seasoning. We had a team
that was coming off a Final Four. We went to the Final Four in '12, and then
we came back. So this is a team that didn't play in the tournament last year
and only had one nine-point scorer returning in Quentin Snider.  
  
So much different team, and I'm sure John would say the same.  
  
Q. Rick, you have at least a passing relationship with one Big Ten coach
who has played against Michigan. Did you get a scouting report from that
coach?  
COACH PITINO: Well, he's on his way in here, and I was actually at the
Michigan/Minnesota game live where Minnesota won in overtime. Their power
forward, center, two-guard, whatever they call him, made a shot from 15 feet
behind the line to put it into overtime as if it was a layup.  
  
So I happen to know Michigan very well, and Richard said, you know, he gave me
his thoughts on the game. And I said, well, they've won 10 out of the last 12.
And since the time I've seen them, they've gotten a lot more confident and a
lot better. And I think it really stems from the play of their point guard.  
  
Q. Rick, you've been obviously offered a lot of jobs over the years. Do
you ever think back on the Michigan conversations with Bill Martin and wonder
what-if, or does your mind not go there?  
COACH PITINO: You know, I've been really happy at Louisville. Michigan has
done quite well for themselves. So it was a time that -- I actually took the
Michigan job that morning, and my wife did not want to go for a variety of
reasons. She said I was making a decision based on the wrong factors, and she
was right, because I never -- I've never been on the campus before. I didn't
know the athletic director, and I was taking a job blind to it all.  
  
But I thought it was a great job, great university, academically as well as
athletically. Just wasn't the right fit for me.  
  
Q. Rick, at this stage, how important is execution of whatever the plan
is and how important is just guys using their God-given talent to make it
happen?  
COACH PITINO: You know, Jerry, they're so unique, it's really difficult to
gauge because they can beat you so many different ways. They can beat you with
cuts. They can beat you on the break. They're a terrific foul shooting team.  
  
Like I said, they're a much improved defensive team from the time I watched
them at Minnesota to even now. People like to say it's because of the trauma
they went through with the plane. I don't think that had anything to do with
it. I really do think adversity does make you stronger, certainly, like that.  
  
I think they just keep evolving into a better basketball team in all phases of
the game. They can beat you so many different ways. That's what makes it
difficult going into this basketball game.  
  
We have a scheme that we think will be successful, but you just don't know
because of their shooting ability.  
  
Q. Two-part question, Rick. How has the limit on the shot clock
influenced how much you use the press and how effective is the press at
inhibiting 3-point shooting just because you don't get quality shots?  
COACH PITINO: I would say this year, I've seen more teams, what I call, soft
press either 2-2-1 or 1-2-2, like a Villanova type 1-2-2 than any time in my
coaching career because everybody is trying to get people to take six to eight
seconds in the backcourt.  
  
So when they come down, they have 20 seconds to execute or 18 seconds to
execute. That's why I always felt pressing in the pros is much better than
college because of the 24-second clock.  
  
If you can get the team to take six to eight seconds in the backcourt in the
pros, basically you've got a 14-second offense because they're not going to
let it go down. The difficulty is you play 82 games, and it's difficult.  
  
I did it with the Knicks because we played ten guys every night. So it's a
factor in the game, but Shaka Smart tried to press Michigan at VCU, and it
didn't work too well. We didn't press too much in '13. We would change a
little bit. We didn't press too much.  
  
When you have a great shooting, passing team, pressing can be a big danger. We
had to do it last night to beat Jacksonville State. But we're probably not
going to press Michigan too much in this game. Tell John that so he doesn't
work on his press offense.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Rick, a lot of your players, when they were up there before, were
saying we have to limit their 3-point attempts. Not makes. The attempts. They
were 16 for 29. How confident are you you can take them out of what they want
to do by limiting their attempts?  
COACH PITINO: It's difficult because when you do that and you crowd a 3-point
shooter -- now, if they don't put it on the floor and they're just a spot-up
shooter, but that's not the case with them. They put it on the floor great and
then they force you to help. And then when you rotate, they find their open
people.  
  
So it takes good balance, good intelligence. You've got to stay up all night,
and your players got to really be tuned into film work more than practice in
seeing how they get it and what they do.  
  
This team is very difficult to go against. If you said to me right now out of
all the teams in college basketball, who are the two most difficult teams to
play against with one-day prep, it would be Michigan and West Virginia because
it's the first time I've seen a team press nonstop on misses. So they're both
very -- with one-day prep. Now, if you have four days, it's a lot easier.  
  
Q. Rick, just generally, not specific to your game tomorrow, time and
score considerations, is that becoming less of a thing? Are players not going
with time and score as much as they used to?  
COACH PITINO: I'd say that's true. Especially in Oklahoma State/Michigan
yesterday. I think a lot of teams are going to go 2 for 1 at the end of the
half. Q told me yesterday when he was coming in the game, he said do you want
me to go 2 for 1? I said yes, go. The 3-point shot, I don't think I've seen it
one time this year, which is kind of unusual, where you're up three and you
foul the other team and put them to the line. I haven't seen it one time. I
don't know if all of you have.  
  
I've seen that a lot in past years, but I didn't see it one time in a game
this year.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
COACH PITINO: I think that although announcers say it's a good percentage, I
would never do it because I've got really thin-legged guy who get pushed
underneath on free throws, and I would never do it. I lost a game myself at
Kentucky with Mashburn doing it that way. I wouldn't do it, but the announcers
always make such a big deal.  
  
I didn't see one game, and I watch a lot of games, this year where that came
about.  
  
Q. It's one thing you talk about the '87 team in a room where there's a
lot of people old enough to remember it. How do you balance, when you're
talking to your guys who are 20, 21 years old, using your experience, stories
of past teams and players, without them kind of rolling their eyes and
thinking you're talking about old stuff?  
COACH PITINO: I tell them stories about Bernard King all the time, and I
realize as I'm telling them that, they have no clue to who Bernard King was.
My point, what I was trying to make to them was that Bernard, when we came
down and we ran our offense, he demanded the basketball, kept yelling ball,
give me the ball, give me the ball, almost every play down the court. We had a
play called power right, power left. That means you get Bernard King the ball.
He demanded it in the way he posted up that the guards throw him the ball.  
  
I was trying to teach the guys post offense, they're not throwing you the ball
because you're not demanding the basketball like Bernard King. I told them his
background. He led the team in scoring. He had three straight 50-point games
in Texas. Now we've done a great job of making sure the guards are not
selfish, but they will ignore you.  
  
Now, you yell out ball three times, they'll be embarrassed that they didn't
throw you the ball. So we've done a good job with that. I tell them old
stories about players all the time. They just met Grant Hill. You would think
they would know all about Grant Hill because it hasn't been that long. I
certainly remember him.  
  
So I tell them pro stories all the time about guys, and we have a good time
with it. They're a good group of guys. There are certain teams I've coached I
wouldn't tell stories to. This group is pretty good.  
  
Q. Speaking of stories, Coach Beilein has been talking about his team
about comparing them to like the '05 team and that was the team that you guys
came back 20 down in the Elite Eight. So kind of watching the film, I don't
know if you've been able to see the comparison, but what about this current
Michigan team kind of reminds you of that John Beilein team?  
COACH PITINO: I forgot about that. It does in a way. I'll never forget that
game. Out of all the games I've ever coached, that one sticks out to me the
most of any game I've ever coached because we were playing basically seven
players. We never pressed. We never played man. We just played a two-three
bumping zone, not even a matchup. Our seventh man, Otis George, had a stress
fracture, so he didn't practice.  
  
So as soon as we found out we were playing them, we knew we couldn't play them
man-to-man. We had to play zone. If I remember correctly, they had 11 3s. We
were down 20. We cut it to 12 or 13 right before the half. They made 11 3s.
John's son made a 3 from the Lobo. And I went in at halftime, we had to walk
up the ramp at the pit, and we moved all the chairs. And I said, guys, you're
not going to believe this, we can't play them zone. We're going to get killed.  
  
We moved all the chairs and went through the Princeton offense of back doors,
running the guy into our chest. And we went out with one or two minutes on the
clock, and we had a walk-through in the locker room. We played man-to-man for
the first time that year, and we were lucky to win it in overtime.  
  
But we could not play them zone. They just torched us in the way they shot the
ball. So I agree with you, there's a lot of similarities to the way they shot
it and the way this team shoots it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. See you tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
COACH MARSHALL: Gregg Marshall.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with Coach Marshall.  
  
Q. I asked the players, and they gave the reaction I expected. Do you
ever look ahead in the bracket to see who's down the road, potentially? And
how much fun is it for you personally to be on this kind of a stage where
you're playing some of these elite programs that you get to play here?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, when the bracket first comes out, the first thing you
look at is what city are you going to and what day are you going to play. In
this case, we were able to -- last year, we had to immediately pack up and
basically leave Sunday night, Monday morning, to get to Dayton to play
Tuesday. We played Tuesday late night, Thursday late night and the first game
on Saturday in Providence, Rhode Island.  
  
This year, we got a lot more time to prepare for a Friday evening tip. So we
got to Indianapolis. We knew it was Dayton. We knew we had our hands full, so
we poured the majority of our energy into that game from a staff perspective.  
  
But we also saw Kentucky, we saw UCLA, I think North Carolina, Louisville or
Kansas as a likely path to the Final Four. So we just, you know, we're going
to play it one game at a time.  
  
Kentucky and Northern Kentucky was a really good game last night. I thought
John Brannen's team fought really hard, probably just missed too many shots.
But Kentucky is expected, prevailed, and now we have an opportunity to play
one of the great programs in the country.  
  
So we're excited, and this will be a great opportunity for us, and we just
need to go out and play well.  
  
Q. We were chuckling a little bit. Some of the players were talking
about wanting Nike Elite to recognize them and then you came in with a Nike
Elite shirt. It sounds a bit like they've got a bit of a chip on their
shoulder when it comes to that stuff, big, bad Kentucky. Is that kind of the
attitude you want them to have going into a game like this?  
COACH MARSHALL: We have some Nike Elite stuff. I have to take the big stage in
order to wear it. We're excited about that. Our guys are not your five-star
recruits walking in. They understand that they came to our program for a
reason, to win and get these opportunities and to get better and grow as
people and students and players.  
  
This doesn't get any better. You're playing Kentucky. And they're one of the
handful of blue-blood programs in the country. And it's something crazy like
Kentucky, UCLA and North Carolina have 20-something national championships
between the three of them, so it's quite a road.  
  
But you got to take one stop at a time, and the next game is Kentucky on
Sunday, and we're excited about it.  
  
Q. Gregg, can you speak to the coincidence that in 2014, you guys were
the 1, they were the 8. The question was, how can Kentucky be an 8. Now it's
the complete reverse. John saying, how can Wichita be the 10? What do you
think of that coincidence of this occurring with the same two teams, three
years apart?  
COACH MARSHALL: John can't say that now because it was two days ago that John
was saying the seeds are perfect. He can't go back on that.  
  
Q. He'll be here shortly. You can tell him.  
COACH MARSHALL: I already have. I don't know if it's a coincidence or not.
They've got quite a sense of humor, then, don't they, those guys in that room.  
  
The bottom line is the only two guys that remember that game, other than you
media people, are Coach Cal and I. Everyone else is new. There might have been
a couple of my guys that were freshmen at that point, but can't think of too
many that played in that game that are going to be playing.  
  
I think Willie Caulley-Stein is with Sacramento and Randle is with the Lakers,
I hope. And I've got a few guys in the NBA from that group as well. In fact,
we watched a little bit of that game with our team today just to show them how
we countered Kentucky's size and athleticism.  
  
I mean, you saw Cleanthony Early and Ron Baker and Fred Van Vleet and the
Kentucky players I just mentioned. That court was full of NBA guys. It was a
tremendous game. I didn't even realize it until after the game what a great
game it was because I hate giving up that many points.  
  
But the way they shot it, the way we shot it, it was back and forth. And it
was after that game when everyone says, what a classic game. That may have
been one of the best games in X amount of years in the tournament or the best
game this year by far in the tournament.  
  
I didn't feel that, but what I thought was really ironic that year is we were
such a polarizing team. We deserve a 1 seed. We don't deserve a 1 seed. And
you're either on one side of the fence or the other. Then we get the 1 seed,
but we get Kentucky as an 8. I think they hedged their bet a little bit.  
  
But in the end, it took a loss to validate our team, which I think is really
ironic and sad.  
  
Q. So I know you started that answer by saying players that were in that
game, but then you said you actually used the game to exhibit that. How often
do you do that to show teams how a coach coaches?  
COACH MARSHALL: Oh, we do that all the time. I mean, we show our team what we
can to best represent what they're going to see or what they're going to face
in a particular game, how they're going to defend, what their transition is
like, what type of breakdown offense that they use.  
  
So we're trying to get our boys prepared for the mental part of the game, and
that's the last time we played them.  
  
Q. Gregg, Rashard talked about little things as being a key component of
what you guys do, like boxing out.  
How important are these little things to what you get done and in the
tournament itself when there's good players, obviously, on every team?  
  
COACH MARSHALL: It's interesting, Jerry, that a lot of people, and even we
refer to them as little things, but those things aren't so little. Boxing out,
communicating on defense, executing -- setting a great screen, being the first
to the floor on a loose ball, those aren't little things, but those are things
that you can control.  
  
And I think it's interesting, if you talk to  
  
Fred Van Vleet and Ron Baker, those are some of the things that help them
stick in the NBA. Obviously, they're great teammates and great, very talented
players from a winning program. But they were free agents, and they go to this
veterans camp and the coach keeps saying, man, they just keep doing the little
things. They check down. If a big guy comes over and tries to block the shot,
they come from the perimeter and try to box out the center, who's left alone.  
  
Those are things that, hopefully, our guys learn in our program that not only
help us win, but help them be better pros.  
  
Q. How long does it take the typical player to fully accept and execute
the little things?  
COACH MARSHALL: Jerry, it just depends on the player. Some of them come in
much more in tune with what it's going to take to be a successful player in
our program or at the next level. But some of them, it takes quite awhile, and
it's just repetition and repetition and letting them know that not doing the
little things, they get more time sitting over by me than doing them, and then
they get to exhibit all of their other talents and skills.  
  
Q. Gregg, you mentioned all the NBA guys. How much does that help in
recruiting now? Like when you go into the living room, are you mentioning
these guys right away? And do you notice, are you getting access to a
different quality of player as a result of these NBA guys?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think we are because you look at Landry Shamet and Markis
McDuffie, for instance, those two guys had some big-time offers. And they
looked at the success that we were having as a program, and then the
individuals that were having success, go onto the next level. It takes a while
to build that.  
  
It wasn't day one. We were selling a vision early. Now we're selling reality
in what we have accomplished.  
  
Bob, you made an interesting point about playing Kentucky. Well, when we just
redid our lobby in our office complex in the last three months, instead of
talking about the Elite Eight team in, what was it, '81 and not to take
anything away from Xavier McDaniel and Cliff Levingston and Antoine Carr. We
love those guys.  
  
But we started exhibiting the people that we had played, a lot of the teams we
had played and beaten, like Arizona and Ohio State and Gonzaga. We also had
pictures of the Louisville game and the Kentucky game and the Kansas game and
the Indiana game.  
  
That's who we've been playing. When you're a 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 seed, that's who
you get to play. We've seen very few Cal Polys, like we did that first year
when we were the number 1 seed.  
  
Q. Gregg, we didn't see some of the buzzer beaters or fantastic finishes
we're accustomed to seeing the first couple rounds this year. What do you
attribute that to, if anything?  
COACH MARSHALL: Myron, I can't answer that. I've been worried about Dayton.
I've watched very few games. Are you saying the games aren't close?  
  
Q. It's not some of the buzzer beaters and big upsets.  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't know. I think it's a fluke. Maybe you'll see more in
the second round. I have no idea.  
  
Q. Gregg, what stands out about Bam Adebayo down low and what kind of
matchup will that be like with him and Shaquille?  
COACH MARSHALL: He's a mountain of a man. He is a huge guy. He likes to jump
higher than anybody on the court and dunk it through the basket. You can't let
him do that. You've got to keep a body on him, and you've got to box him out
and put some doubt in his mind when he gets it low in the post, what's going
to happen next.  
  
And Shaq's got to be smart, and he's a little older and more mature,
hopefully, and he can make him have to make some decisions how to guard us.  
  
Q. Gregg, Kentucky's had some inconsistencies this year, individual
players and, also, as a team, highs and lows in games. How much more difficult
does that make a team to appraise and figure out when there's
inconsistencies?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, I can tell you this, when we showed the video of
Kentucky, we only show the shots that they make. So our players probably think
they make about 80 percent of all their shots. Hopefully, they don't do that.
Hopefully, they're all having bad karma tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gregg, when you make a list of the important qualities in terms of
winning a game, how high up does it rank being the aggressor and the more
physical team?  
COACH MARSHALL: Very high. I mean, I talked to my team last night about not --
at halftime, I thought we were sluggish. I thought we were on our heels. I
thought Dayton was the aggressor.  
  
It appeared that some of the guys were in their first NCAA tournament or even
if they weren't in their first NCAA tournament, the new guys, some of our
returners were in new roles, if you will. They were more prominent players.
They weren't the doo-wop singers in the background. They had the microphone
and the lead.  
  
They played like that was their first time. So we were much more aggressive in
the second half. I think that showed in our play, so hopefully that's beyond
us now, and we can play well tomorrow from the giddy up.  
  
Q. For those of your players who are not five stars, what are --  
COACH MARSHALL: Those? Which ones are five stars?  
  
Q. I don't have a list in front of me.  
COACH MARSHALL: You've got the list. It's on that piece of paper right there.  
  
Q. For those who are not, or all of them, what is being missed or
overlooked about their abilities or do you see that some of the elite, quote,
programs are less willing to spend the time developing them?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, I don't know. I can't speak to the other programs about
-- I'm not sure that's the case. I'm sure that a lot of those programs would
love to have some of our guys and develop them as players, but they can get a
bigger, faster, quicker, stronger athlete coming in the door and develop them.  
  
I think Cal's done a great job of that, developing guys in one or two years to
get them NBA ready. That's maybe the difference. It takes those guys one or
two years to develop NBA ready bodies in games, where our guys maybe have not
as high a starting point, so we have to develop a little more.  
  
But we're sending some. We just haven't had the lottery picks yet. We may be
working on that.  
  
Q. Gregg, Markis was talking about being able to guard Isaiah Briscoe
from the start and kind of going back to their matchups in New Jersey.  
How versatile is he? He said he can guard one through four. Is he a guy you
can use to guard anybody?  
  
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, he and Brown and Kelly, in fact. I think that's one of
the interesting things about our team this year is Landry Shamet at 6'4.5",
Brown at 6'6", Markis at 6'8", and Kelly at 6'7", all those guys can guard one
through four. It's given us flexibility in match-ups and how we want to start
games. I didn't even know Isaiah Briscoe is from New Jersey, but obviously he
is, and they played against each other. So they're familiar with one another's
game.  
  
We can put Markis on Briscoe. We can put him on Fox. We can put him on Monk,
and that gives you a little flexibility from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Q. Gregg, you mentioned how Shaq is an older player, obviously, more
experienced than Bam. How can that show itself, maybe not in that particular
matchup, but how can veteran savviness show itself against maybe a younger,
talented player?  
COACH MARSHALL: This is his fourth NCAA tournament. He's played in a lot of
NCAA tournament games. He didn't play great yesterday. He made some silly
fouls. He and Pollard were both fouling each other, just two big guys down in
the mud, mud wrestling down there.  
  
We've got to get more out of Shaq tomorrow for sure. But Rauno Nurger usually
plays well against big guys. He did it last year in the win against Vandy.
They had two seven footers. One was a lottery pick, and then Cornette and
Tarczewski, Zeus and those big guys Arizona had, he played beautifully against
them. He generally plays well against big guy.  
  
Then Willis, we have a three-headed monster at the five. So we're going to
keep those guys fresh. Bam, I'm sure he's in great shape, but he's going to
need to be in great shape tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gregg, you've relished being kind of a spokesman for the poorly
seeded and the little guys. Why have you taken that on? Why is that important
for you to speak up for that segment of college basketball?  
A. That's where I've always -- I mean, I've been doing this for 32 years.
Wichita State is the highest level I've ever coached. I mean, I think it's
pretty obvious. Everyone believes that in this room. If you don't, raise your
hand. We can have a discussion.  
  
Everybody sees it. Everybody knows it. I don't know why they continually do
it, but they do. That's just the way it is. I think they keep saying that
history, what you've done in the past, doesn't mean anything this year, and
they just try to weed us out, if you will.  
  
Teams like Middle Tennessee and St. Mare's and Wichita State, we're just --
Gonzaga, we're just determined that that's not going to be so easy. That's the
deal for us. We want to make it really hard, if that's what their intent is.
You wouldn't think that's the case, but it certainly seems that way.  
  
We're just going to continue to make it as hard as possible for that to
happen.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that, how concerned are you in terms of the future
of the tournament that there's less likely going to be a Cinderella Final Four
run from guys like you guys four years ago or Butler or whomever?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think there will be a non-Power Five team win the whole
thing, maybe Villanova. I don't know what you consider Villanova last year,
but they're not a Power Five. Maybe a Power Six, if you want the Big East to
be included in that.  
  
Butler was close. We are very close in '13, but it's going to happen. It's
going to happen one day, unless they decide to exclude it and break off and
have a different tournament or whatever.  
  
But I was watching television before I came to practice today, and it was
either on CBS or ESPN, I don't recall which, but the whole thing was talking
about the tournament, first round, both days. And the whole thing was about
Middle Tennessee, Rhode Island, our game, and that's what was interesting.
That's what they wanted to talk about.  
  
They talked about the Michigan/Oklahoma State game a little bit. And the foul
with Vandy, but not much, not much else. That was what was interesting in the
tournament.  
  
So I don't know why you would want to exclude that or diminish that in any
way.  
  
Q. Why are you so confident that breaker will happen?  
COACH MARSHALL: Because there's good basketball being played at those levels
and good coaches and good players. Just as these guys have a chip on their
shoulders, I'm sure Kermit Davis, his group has a chip on their shoulder and
Giddy Potts is a really good player and those Aussies at St. Mary's, those are
tough dudes, and Gonzaga is pretty good. So I think it's going to happen.  
  
Q. Gregg, that said, does tomorrow's game represent something larger
with the possibility that you're saying that you've been underseeded, you're
playing Kentucky, if you win, the implications with maybe the committee in
future years?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't know what type of impact it will have, Myron. I know
we're going to try our best to win the game, and I'm sure Cal's group's got
the same mindset. We both want to get to Memphis.  
  
We're going to play as hard as we possibly can. Be gritty and grimy and tough
and active and energetic and passionate and hopefully make enough shots and
get a whistle every once in a while, and the ball falls our way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. See you tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [V.J. King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33226)

### [Anas Mahmoud](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33227)

### [Ray Spalding](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33228)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have been joined by the University of Louisville players,
V.J. King, Anas Mahmoud and Ray Spalding.  
  
Q. For Anas and Ray, what stands out on film and what you saw yesterday
from Michigan, specifically their offense?  
ANAS MAHMOUD: They shoot the ball really well, all five positions. Watching
film yesterday, we realize we have to limit their attempt, not even contest
it. We have to make them do something else other than shoot the 3.  
  
RAY SPALDING: Very similar to what Anas said, they're a very well shooting
basketball team. They play very aggressive. Defensively, they've gotten better
defensively, coach said. We're looking forward to attacking them.  
  
Q. V.J., rough start in the game yesterday. How important will it be to
reverse that and avoid that in tomorrow's game against Michigan?  
V.J. KING: I think we kind of started off slow just because kind of the first
game of the tournament, just jitters. I feel like that lasted throughout the
whole first half, but we definitely picked it up and started playing our game.  
  
We have to get off to a fast and a good start this game because if we get down
to a team like Michigan, they'll really put it on it, and it will be hard to
come back if we dig a hole like that. It's important to start out strong and
start out focused.  
  
Q. How have you guys fared, in your minds, against in type of team that
relies on the 3? Do you think it's a good matchup for you?  
V.J. KING: Definitely. They play at sort of the pace we like to play at with
the way they shoot the ball, but it's going to be difficult for us to guard
that. We have to, like Anas said earlier, limit the attempts and lock in on
defenses. Offense comes and goes. If we play the defense we know how to play
every single game, we have the best chance to win.  
  
ANAS MAHMOUD: Just like V.J. said, they play similar game tempo. They don't
push the pace too much, but they're really opportunistic. If they're open,
they're going to take the shot. Just like V.J. said, it is going to come down
to defense. We're going to get more stops and we are going to attack them and
transition.  
  
RAY SPALDING: Just like what Anas and V.J. said, they're similar to our tempo,
the game we like to play. I think really shoot the ball well. I think the way
we play defense and how we're going to lock in today with the scouting in
practice today, we look forward to trying to stop that.  
  
Q. Out of curiosity, Rick Pitino compared them to the Golden State
Warriors. Who would you compare your team to, what NBA team, in terms of
style?  
RAY SPALDING: In terms of style is a good question. I'm more of a Sacramento
Kings fan. I don't know that we compare to the Sacramento Kings. Let's go with
the Cavs.  
  
ANAS MAHMOUD: It's tough to compare, you know, college to elite, especially
when you're focus so much on the defense. I don't think people in the NBA
focus as much on defense as college basketball do.  
  
We always talk that we try to pass the ball as well as the Spurs basketball
and move the basketball well. So I hope we can reach that level.  
  
V.J. KING: I have no idea. I don't want to throw out a team because I don't
want to say the wrong thing, but just go with what those two said.  
  
Q. Obviously, your coach has been coaching these tournaments since long
before you guys were born. Do you feel that when he's preparing you and
talking to you? Do you get that sense of just that vast knowledge and
experience he's bringing to this?  
V.J. KING: Definitely, just because it's definitely tournament time. He's
definitely turned it up a notch. With him, it's always the same with how we
prepare, with how he coaches, with his intensity and passion. It's the same
with every team. If we were playing the first game for exhibition game to a
game like we're playing tomorrow, it's always the same.  
  
He's definitely turned it up a notch because he wants to win. He sees the
potential in us and knows how far we can go if we just play the way we're
capable of.  
  
ANAS MAHMOUD: Since I've been here, everything  
  
Coach P told us in practice happens in games. Whenever we have a bad practice,
he comes up to us, you guys are going to have a bad game tomorrow because you
had a bad practice yesterday. It always happens.  
  
We kind of picked up on that, and we just listened to him as well as we could.
Like V.J. said, he really picked it up going into the ACC tournament after our
first loss playing last week before the NCAA started. Because he knows how far
we can go and just he's really picking it up on us.  
  
Q. Describe the processes you guys follow in one of these tournament-
type atmospheres. When you come off a game, describe what you do when you've
got a game the next day or as is the case with Michigan tomorrow, describe the
processes you guys go through.  
In other words, do you start preparing for a team like Michigan anticipating
you'll be playing them, or do you wait until after you play the game and start
preparing and then what that preparation consists of?  
  
RAY SPALDING: With Louisville, preparation is very key in this program. We go
by three Rs; refuel, refresh, recover. We really focus on that.  
  
Once we won the game yesterday, it was onto the next one. So we dial into who
we'll play, who we could potentially play. Like before we even came to the
tournament, just preparation the coaches were going through and the scouting
report they have on several different teams we could play, it was crazy, but
we're really prepared well.  
  
ANAS MAHMOUD: We never really kept any team -- coming in last week, we looked
at the bracket. We see who we potentially can play, but we never really
prepare for any other team other than Jacksonville State. Nothing is
guaranteed when you go to the tournament. You have to win every game.  
  
You have to play game by game. Last night, after the game, we went home and
ate dinner and started watching film on Michigan. Today, we have a scouting
practice and just that's how our program is. We don't skip any games, and we
literally prepare for every single game.  
  
Q. Ray and V.J., your minutes seem to fluctuate from game to game.
Yesterday, you played a lot. Do you think it is matchup-based or how you
perform in practice? What determines your role and how do you see it from game
to game?  
RAY SPALDING: Really, I don't know. That's a good question. I guess however
coach is feeling with the game, how the game style is played and how the game
is going on with substitutions and minutes. It's upon him. I don't look into
the minutes and points being scored. My jersey number is called, and I'm told
to go in, and I look to produce in some type of way.  
  
V.J. KING: Like Ray said, it's not really about how we perform in practice,
but just how the game's going on with foul trouble and the flow of the game.
Like he said, whenever our names are called, just be ready for however long it
is for us to come in and try to contribute in the best way we can for however
long we're out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you. See you tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Conner Frankamp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26894)

### [Landry Shamet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32645)

### [Rashard Kelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32698)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Wichita State's players are here.  
  
Q. How much does that 2014 game against Kentucky, how much is it talked
about, referred to as a big moment in this program's history and your guys'
experiences at Wichita State?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: It is not talked about too much, honestly. Obviously, it was
a very historic game against two very good teams. Both teams are different
now. It's just a new game for us now, pretty much.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: The only talk we've really done on it -- we watched a little
film. There are just a few similarities here and there, but like Conner said,
it's two very different teams now.  
  
RASHARD KELLY: Personally, none of us was involved in that 35-0 year besides
our two seniors. We personally wasn't there, but we knew how much the state of
Wichita, the fan base loved it.  
  
Q. Do any of you guys get caught up at all looking ahead in the bracket
at some of the teams that are in Wichita State's path?  
RASHARD KELLY: No. We treat every team the same amount of respect, one team at
a time. Just like the game, it's just one play at a time, one possession at a
time. So we don't try to get too ahead of ourselves and just worry about the
task in front of us.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: You can't afford to look ahead. Your full attention has to be
on the team you're currently pitted against. That's what we try to do.  
  
Q. For all three of you, how accurate would it be to consider you guys
an execution team?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: It's decently accurate. We really try to focus in on making
sure we do our sets right and doing what coach says. We have guys who can get
a bucket at any time we want. We try to follow coach's game plan and the plays
the best we can throughout the game.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: He hit it on the head, execute it as much as we can. We're not
really blessed with having a bunch of seven footers and being more athletic
and more skilled than everybody else, so you have to execute almost sometimes.  
  
RASHARD KELLY: I think that's probably the easiest part of the game, when you
execute and do what you're told to and just make plays and a match-ups easier
for you to get the best outcome.  
  
Q. Landry, Coach Marshall said one of the better decisions he made this
season is going with you. It didn't obviously happen early. At what point did
you think you were ready to take control?  
LANDRY SHAMET: I've always had confidence in myself to play either the one or
the two. Obviously, at that point when I did make the switch, I was starting
to get really comfortable at the two. It was a fairly smooth transition.
Conner was playing it, and we're pretty interchangeable. So we both can do a
lot of the same things. It was smooth. I felt ready after maybe one game where
it was kind of somewhat more of a learning experience and then getting
confidence in my teammates and them getting confidence in me.  
  
Q. I asked Coach this last night. Kentucky is known for sending guys to
the NBA. Wichita State now has two or three guys in the league. How much does
that help, do you think, in recruiting now when Coach goes out and tells kids
like you guys or whoever that, hey, we have multiple NBA guys. When you chose
Wichita State, did you think, oh, this is a program that's got guys in the
league and can help me get there?  
RASHARD KELLY: I'd probably say makes you appreciate the grind more. Over four
years, you see how you change your game, and you just craft your skills. I'd
probably say the overall reward, building yourself up as a complete player in
four years is probably more appreciated than just jumping straight to the
league.  
  
Some of them players are just smarter players than freshmen. So I think either
way you get there is a blessing. So it's just how hard you want to work.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: Any time you've got -- that was a big reason I came here. I
wanted to play with Ron and Fred, knowing they're two NBA guards. When you can
say that about your program, it's definitely going to be more attractive to
people.  
  
Q. Rashard and Landry, how much have you looked at how good Kentucky is
in transition, in fast break, and how important it will be to try to make them
go against the half court defense?  
LANDRY SHAMET: They're one of the best in the country, if not the best.
Combination of speed and size in the open court, and pretty talented around
the rim. That's a point of emphasis for us, trying to stop transition.  
  
You've got three or four seconds, really, to get back, cut the ball off and
get the ball stopped and get in our set defense, which is where we think we're
pretty good.  
  
RASHARD KELLY: They're elite. You've got the top recruits coming to Kentucky.
You've got the Nike Elite gear. They get all the Nike gear. They're elite in
everything. We are trying to be elite one day too, Nike.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You guys are on a long winning streak. What factors have contributed
to that?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: I think just getting better every single day, not taking
anything for granted. Even after a win, we know we have to get back to work
the next day and improve on the mistakes you made the last game.  
  
Like I said, coming to get better every single day and working on our
weaknesses.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: What he said. We got a great coach, and he's also a coach
that's rarely satisfied. You can't always make him happy. So every day of
film, even if we win by 20 or 30, he's ripping us or whatever about this play
or that play. So that goes a long way.  
  
You're playing teams, and you've got to remain consistent with your
preparation. And I think that's one thing that we like to hang our hat on.  
  
Q. If I remember correctly, before the 2014 game, your coach said none
of your players had even gotten a look or form letter from Kentucky. Did any
of you hear from them at all? If not, what did they overlook in your skill
set?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: I committed to KU my sophomore year, so it was really early
for me. I knew that's where I wanted to go when I was younger, and I had that
opportunity when they offered. So I committed early. I didn't get to
experience the recruitment process that much, really.  
  
LANDRY SHAMET: They never talked to me.  
  
RASHARD KELLY: Me either.  
  
Q. What did they miss?  
RASHARD KELLY: Probably because I'm not 6'11", don't have a 7'2" wingspan, but
it's all good.  
  
Q. Landry, watching Fred last year, what kind of things did you pick up
from him about the point guard?  
LANDRY SHAMET: He's just so patient, so under control. Nobody sped him up.
Nobody got him out of his rhythm or changed him from what he wanted to do. He
was just always in complete control, and that's one thing I'm still trying to
get a handle on, just staying at my pace, going at my speed and controlling
the game.  
  
Q. Rashard, you talked about not being 6'11 ", not having a 7'2"
wingspan, not having the Elite Nike gear. So how do you compensate for that in
a game like tomorrow and you guys come out on top?  
RASHARD KELLY: You just got to do the little things. Sometimes teams like that
don't focus on boxing out, checking down, defensive pressure, just little
things that make us great. And I think that's what makes us appreciate playing
and working so hard more because we do little things that end up being a big
reason why we win.  
  
Q. Rashard, you talked about coach ripping you guys even if you win by
20 or 30. Maybe it was Landry. How much are the little things the topic that
he's ripping you about?  
RASHARD KELLY: We have a win, but we get beat on like the rebounding total for
the game, the film the next day will be terrible. I mean, we'll win by 20, but
you'll be everything in the book, you know. So he just pushes us every day. He
just wants the best from us. I kind of respect that from him. He made all of
us -- all 16 of us, he just helped us mold into men throughout the year, and
we definitely appreciate that from him.  
  
Q. Landry, to follow up on recruiting, what schools did you consider
besides Wichita State when you chose them?  
LANDRY SHAMET: If I wasn't here, I would probably be at Colorado. That's the
simplest answer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Calipari is with us.  
  
Q. John, how late did you state up last night, and how do you feel about
two games within less than 48 hours?  
COACH CALIPARI: Last night, looking at my watch is why that I had the response
I had. Right now, I'm just worried about coaching my team in this next game.
They probably didn't get to bed until 1:00 in the morning either. Ours was a
little bit later than that.  
  
Two good teams going at each other. Should be interesting.  
  
Q. Most observers, when they think about this matchup, of course they
think about the game three years ago. What do you remember most about that
game, other than winning it?  
COACH CALIPARI: It was a long time ago, and I haven't watched it. I watched it
after the game. I know Julius Randle was really big in that game, if I
remember right, but a lot of players played well. Their team played well. They
had the last shot to win the game, so it was a good battle.  
  
Q. John, Gregg said he showed that tape to this group of Wichita State
players to just show them what it's like to go against a Kentucky team and
Kentucky bigs, even though the players are different. What are the chances you
could do that to show what a Wichita State team coached by Gregg Marshall is
like?  
COACH CALIPARI: There's all kind of ways of doing this, and it's just not
something I would do because the players are all different. And I'm just
worried about us playing at our best. We're going to have to have a heck of a
game to win the game, we know that, and play better than we played yesterday
to win the game.  
  
They're talented. They're big. They're physical. They're strong. They're
veterans. Good team.  
  
Q. Seems to be an undercurrent of resentment among the mid-majors about
both the tournament bracket and the seedings. Do you think they have a
legitimate beef?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, there's a couple things. I was at those schools, and I
used to always say you can't put them all in one pocket because it doesn't
give a group a chance to advance.  
  
Then you had VCU and this team and that team in the Final Four. You know what
I'm saying? So then it was the other way.  
  
What's happened right now, the fifth-year transfer has changed and made it
tough for some of those schools that are building. It hasn't affected Gonzaga.
It hadn't affected Wichita. It hadn't affected some of the other schools.  
  
But the reality of it is that's the issue, and I wish we could deal with it.
It's just guys are losing their best players their fifth year. Guys are losing
jobs because kids are leaving and going to a major school.  
  
I would say that's having more of an affect on those programs than anything
else. I just can't imagine we can't come up with a solution that you have to
sit out. If you transfer, you sit out. It's just what it is.  
  
I mean, whether you graduated or not, you sit out. From what I understand,
there are programs that have the names of all the kids that have a chance of
transferring and playing right away. Who can we grab out of that? Come on.  
  
The problem is those kids play for a coach whose job may be on the line. So
you take those kids and now all of a sudden, that guy loses his job. I don't
think it says the right thing to the kids. I know it's not right for coaching.  
  
But we'll be mad about one and done. Really?  
  
Q. John, Wichita State really kind of took off in mid-January when they
made Landry Shamet the point guard. What are your impressions of him?  
COACH CALIPARI: He's really good. He's really good. He's fearless. He's not
afraid, can shoot it, runs their team. He's good. He's a good player.  
  
Q. Cal, what has it been like this year to finally coach your own son?
Just the experience of -- I know he's been around all your programs forever,
but to have him in practice, is that a different dynamic for you?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, being a walk-on in this program is a very hard thing
because it's hard to get on the practice floor, let alone the floor. And when
Hami came, he kind of had to take a little more of a back seat.  
  
But I'm watching him, and I love the fact that he's in the gym early. He comes
on off days. He's working on his game. He's trying to be a great teammate.  
  
My wife's on me all the time, you're up 21, why won't you put him in. Come on.
It's just nice being around him, like when we travel. It was my birthday down
at Alabama, and I was feeling awful. I was in a room by myself. I call him,
say hey, come on up here. Why? Because I'm in a room by myself. Come on up.
Dad, please don't make me come up there.  
  
But he still brings clothes over to wash to his mom, though. I know he does
that. It's probably against the NCAA rules, but he does it.  
  
Q. John, Wichita State talked about doing the little things, like boxing
out, rotating on defense. How well do you guys do those things? How well do
they do them? And what difference could that make?  
COACH CALIPARI: I've watched four tapes of theirs. I can just tell you that
they viciously go after offensive rebounds. If you don't rebound in the game,
you don't have a chance to beat them.  
  
They also are not afraid to go inside. They'll be physical when you drive. I
mean, you're not getting a clear drive. You're going to have a body on you,
something on you.  
  
It's the kind of game that's just a competitive, you know what it's going to
be, and you love walking into those kind of games, know how good they are. You
got an unbelievable opponent who plays with heart and fight and battles, and
you bring your team in, your young team, and say let's see what we are. Let's
see what we are at that point.  
  
Our team has gotten better. We really have. But still, there are gaps. And if
you have a gap against this team, it will be bam, bam, bam, bam, time-out.
What just happened to us? Let's get this back in order.  
  
So I'm looking forward to it just because I know how good they are. It's going
to be a hard game, and I want to see how my young guys respond.  
  
Q. John, you seem to be working real hard on coaching your team on the
court. You're pretty animated on the sidelines.  
COACH CALIPARI: Not as much as I've been. I'm not watching myself either, so I
would tell you not as much as I've been. But go ahead.  
  
Q. Two or three weeks ago, you were focusing on the importance of
empowering your team. Have you just accepted the fact that this is a group
that may need your guidance a little bit more down the stretch?  
COACH CALIPARI: Here's what I would say, I think they are empowered. I've
empowered my staff. Maybe there are times, though, that I'm looking at this
game and saying, we could lose this game, and then I'm going to stand up. This
is the end of the year now. This is like when you lose, you fall off the
cliff.  
  
So if I have to stand up and yell and grab and do -- I'm going to do what I
have to to try to help the team win. At the end of the day, though, this has
got to be what they want, not what I want. I've got to be on -- this has got
to be me being on a ride with them. I'm just here to -- I told them today,
you're prepared for this moment because of what we've done all year. We've
worked on all the things that you're going to have to do in this game to do
it. Now you'll have to perform. You're going to have to want to be on that
stage.  
  
You're going to have an opponent that absolutely believes they can beat you.
They're coming at you and they're not going to give you an inch. Do you want
it any other way? We know how hard the game is going to be. This is a Sweet
16, Elite Eight game that we're playing. But that's okay.  
  
Q. John, on that subject, how better prepared do you feel like your team
is now for a physical, grind-it-out-type game than it was earlier in the year?
Or do you think it is prepared for that type of game?  
COACH CALIPARI: We are. But, again, they play fast now. They're trying to
score, and they'll press and do some different things to try to muck up the
game. Sometimes they hard shell and pick and rolls to get you out of rhythm,
pressing different ways on the ball, off the ball. Quick trap, try to steal,
go back.  
  
So, you know, we'll figure out how ready we are tomorrow when it's tipped off
at 2:40. We'll see. But, like I said, when you got young guys, you just hope
they want this moment, they want to play in this kind of moment.  
  
Q. Malik struggled, obviously, with his shooting last night and it's
been several games. What do you see? Are defenses playing him differently? Is
the confidence level not quite there?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, he didn't practice this week because he had a lower
back, butt bruise, whatever you want to call it. He didn't practice for two
days. But what I liked was that he took 2s. He drove the ball. He made free
throws.  
  
Because you're not going to be on every game, so you just don't take 12 3s,
then. You're not on today. Get the ball to the basket, get fouled, take 2s.
He's a great 2-point shooter. They'll still play him to three because he can
make seven in a row. He's one of those ones you say, man, he's due. Let's just
hope he's due. Come on, he's had about three games where he hasn't made some
shots.  
  
But it's nice when you have Dom, when you have Derek, when you have Mychal,
but he doesn't have to make 3s. He doesn't, not for our team. De'Aaron Fox is
making 3s now. If he does, it's great. If he doesn't, make sure you defend and
rebound and take 2s and get fouled and then we'll see if it's the next game.  
  
He'll break out at some point because he's too talented, and he's got a great
spirit about him.  
  
Q. How does Briscoe fit into the puzzle this year? How has he been the
difference?  
COACH CALIPARI: I think his leadership, his defense, his toughness, his
rebounding, his ability to get in the lane. I mean, if your team is not
attacking that lane, and he gets in 16, 18 times a game, his feet are in that
lane.  
  
There's unbelievable value to that. Shooting free throws better, shooting the
ball better in the last week or so. His ability to create shots for his
teammates. But, more importantly, he just comes up with balls. One we needed
yesterday, he's the guy that dove on the floor and scooped it.  
  
He's really become that well-rounded player that I would have hoped. And he's
playing with young guys, like he's the guy -- he's the old guy. He's like 20.
He's the old guy.  
  
Q. Coach, just to follow up on the Isaiah thing, do you think because of
what you just said about his style of play, if he gets to the NBA eventually,
he'll succeed more there because of NBA rules, he can get to the rim and
things like that?  
COACH CALIPARI: He's going to be fine. He's got the body. He's got the
physique, so that's not an issue. He's going to have to get in the gym and the
shot's going to have to be more consistent. But do you know how many guys go
in that league with that as the one thing?  
  
When you handle the ball like he does, when you're as tough as he is, that's
winning basketball. Got to shoot the ball better. All right, get in the gym,
shoot a thousand a day, make a thousand a day.  
  
Same on getting to the rim. You're right. The court's a little more open, but
he's got those traits and all those things that he does in his game.  
  
Q. With Wichita State playing a different game yesterday from their
typical body of work this season, does it change how you prepare for them in
such a short window?  
COACH CALIPARI: As far as what?  
  
Q. Like grind it out, close game, where they won like 20-something games
by 15 to 20 points, does yesterday's game change how you look at it?  
COACH CALIPARI: No. You're looking at a group of games, and maybe each team,
how they played them, what they tried to do to them. What worked, what didn't
work. Is there anything they did offensively to them.  
  
I mean, you're just kind of picking out some stuff. But on a quick turn like
this, I mean, if I'm spending all my time worried about Wichita, I know how
good they are. I know how talented they are. I know they're veteran. I know
how tough.  
  
I've got to worry about my team playing their best. If they don't do that,
then it's done. If we play our best, let's see if that's good enough. We don't
know. We'll see, though.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, John. We'll see you tomorrow.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino called you the Golden State Warriors, called your team
the Golden State Warriors. I'm curious, what influence do you think teams like
the Golden State Warriors and other teams at the next level have had on the
college game in recent years?  
COACH BEILEIN: First of all, it's a huge exaggeration. I would not put us in
that ballpark in any way.  
  
But the style sometimes would be we resemble each other. Here's what I love
about this, there's not too many people that are coaching as head coaches
right now that were head coaches before the shot clock, before the 3-point
line.  
  
I'm one of those guys. As you watch the evolution of the game, you just
embrace it. It's incredible how the game keeps changing. Those that have made
the rules 99 percent of the time, they've made great adjustments, and
everybody keeps adjusting to it.  
  
Then we copy the heck out of each other. So I think that if you watch the Big
Ten, we're going to have a similar style because I don't sit at home and say
Louisville's playing tomorrow, let's watch the Syracuse game. We don't have
time to leisurely watch games that you don't -- aren't bearing on your life.  
  
So I think that, obviously, the computers and the synergy and all these things
have had a huge influence on people finding new ways to win besides the three-
out, two-in game that we saw in the '70s. It's probably more like the games in
the '60s right now with Rudy T. and Calvin Murphy and Bob Lanier and Pete
Maravich than it is to what we saw in some periods of the 44-42 game earlier
on.  
  
Q. John, you had a couple of very memorable tournament games against
Rick Pitino, 2005 and '13. What are the specific challenges of facing teams he
coaches? Do you see the same things in this team that you saw in those?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah. Where they have been able to really expose a weakness of
ours is just getting baskets over the top or getting offensive rebounds
because they usually have very talented guards.  
  
They're able to get downhill a little bit through a lot of great action,
college action, pro action. He's got a great mind for the game. And then while
you're either giving help or give one step to get help, if they miss, they've
got some long-armed dude all over the top of the rim.  
  
That's been a big common denominator in all those games.  
  
Q. John, Rick said yesterday you were the hardest coach to ever prepare
for.  
COACH BEILEIN: Rich was exaggerating a lot. This is the part before they kick
your butt. They try to butter you up a little bit.  
  
Q. We know that. Let's check that. Why do you think he thinks that about
you?  
COACH BEILEIN: We played against each other in the Big East and in the
tournament a few times. They are really hard for us. He's the hardest coach
that I've ever had to prepare for. How about that for a touché? It's usually
one-day prep. In the Big East, one time we played them where we had a two or
three-day prep, and it was at West Virginia. Usually it's one or two-day prep,
and it's really hard.  
  
So styles may be different and just getting your kids to understand certain
concepts, but he's done pretty well prepping for us. He's got a pretty good
record in these preps.  
  
Q. Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman, talk about where he's come from where he
walked in the door to where he is today now.  
COACH BEILEIN: When he first came to us, he was all into working hard, but did
not probably know that he's so talented that he had another level he could
develop to. He was one of my original tuxedo guys that played the game in a
tuxedo.  
  
He was fast. He was quick. But he wasn't going to dive on the floor, wasn't
going to take a charge. He was one of those guys that just had to continue to
learn that he had another level of play in him. He'll still drift to that at
times.  
  
That's the biggest improvement. His passing, first year, had 26 assists, the
whole first year. He played a lot. Now he's got 65 or 70. He was a 30-percent
shooter. Now he's a 40-percent shooter. I'm looking forward to what he's still
going to be able to do in this tournament.  
  
Also looking forward to him, as he goes into the senior year, he reminds me,
for the young people, Randy Smith of Buffalo State and the Buffalo Braves.
He's this elite athlete that if his full focus is on I'm going to utilize all
the God-given talent, he's got even another level for himself.  
  
Q. Derrick said that one of your sayings is it's the players, not the
plays. I'm wondering at this stage, how much is this about execution? How much
is it about players making plays?  
COACH BEILEIN: Louisville is scheming against some things that we do, so you
can't say let's go hoop, right? They'll be sitting on things that we do. Now
you have to change some angles and things like that.  
  
With the 30-second shot clock, as we continue to evolve as a program, that's a
big focus to make sure we both recruit and teach guys to be players more than
run plays. Remember, no shot clock for Coach B when he first started, and then
45 seconds, then 35 seconds, then 30 seconds.  
  
You keep evolving. The more it evolves into the NBA type of game, the more
that there's five seconds to go, seven seconds, what are you going to do? You
ain't running another play. You've got to be able to have a player make a
play. That's where we've evolved more and more.  
  
I saw a young man awhile ago that played for Pete Carril back before the shot
clock. I said you could control the ball for three or four minutes until you
got your shot. It's so far from there right now. We've evolved, and we got to
evolve more.  
  
Q. Coach, is it silly to suggest what you guys went through on the plane
has helped you play better basketball? Is it coincidence, a galvanizing
force?  
COACH BEILEIN: There are different things that happen through the season. You
don't know until the end. We hope this isn't the end. That was one of the
significant moments in the season that got us to go to another level maybe of
appreciation and a sense of urgency of how your life can change quickly.  
  
We've had some bad losses. They're all close ones. I think the only team --
South Carolina is the only team that really took it to us. Illinois a little
bit on the road. But we look back at a play here and there, and the games we
lost might have been defining moments for us.  
  
Our Ohio State game at home, they're a good team, don't make any mistake about
that. Our Virginia Tech loss at home, I thought that would cost us the
tournament. Two home losses to two good teams, but we didn't have the grit we
needed at the end of those games to win. And I didn't coach that grit well
enough.  
  
I think we've showed that. If you want to talk about maybe that one little
extra step we needed, I know it was for me.  
  
Q. John, going back to what you first touched on about shooting and
scoring and the way the game is now, how has that changed what you have to do
or try to do defensively, how difficult it is to defend people?  
COACH BEILEIN: Every day is a new -- it's geometry. It's not calculus, but
it's geometry because every way -- what Rick is running right now, and I
haven't watched one bit, I'm one game at a time in the tournament. Saddi
Washington has been watching all week. We had a guy watching Jacksonville
State as well. They're doing something we haven't seen all year. We've seen
parts of it. We haven't seen it all year.  
  
These angles and the way people keep evolving, like I said, with the advent of
the old watching teams on film, it's becoming more like football every day
with the way people can move people around and give different looks and do the
same thing.  
  
Your kids have to recognize it without huddling up every 30 seconds. So it's
opened up this game, and all of a sudden, new officiating rules where you're
not plugging guys and things like that has made the game a much higher scoring
game.  
  
I like it. I think it would be very hard to play if you didn't have shooters,
though? Because everybody would plug in there, and you wouldn't have anybody
open. So we always try to recruit guys that can shoot or we think they are not
far away. They just need to work a little bit more on it.  
  
Q. Coach, you were talking about the evolution of the game and how it's
more of a players' game now. Do you think that that may contribute to the
separation of the elite Power Five schools from the mid-majors and maybe the
reason there are fewer upsets in the tournament?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think this year, I guess that wave of upsets is probably over
right now, or it still could happen, I guess. But no, I think it's more of an
aberration than anything. Every year, it's going to happen. You're going to
have some. You're not going to have some. No.  
  
I think, if anything, it will go the other way because of the attrition to the
pros because of transfers. You take a whole bunch of juniors and seniors who
are mid-major players and play a bunch of freshmen who have people calling
them about the NBA the next day and they're in the NCAA tournament, it's
really hard.  
  
So you just stay tuned. This March Madness will always be March Madness. Some
years, it will just be madder than others.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on the players making plays rather than running
plays. What about time and score considerations? How does that factor in on
when to do something, when not to do something?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, that's because of the shorter shot clock right now,
that's been a thing. We've had a couple of times where we really played out of
our minds and had these 20-point leads against really good teams with ten
minutes to go.  
  
You think a coach feels good? That's the worst time for a coach because you're
knowing you don't want to keep just running and gunning because maybe you're
going to -- two 3s, three 3s, it's a 12-point game with 9 to go. It can happen
in a blink of an eye. It's the sweet spot, just like football again. We just
don't have as much time to think about it.  
  
Or it's third and three. Am I going to pass this one and get incomplete or am
I going to take more time off the clock? That's the tough thing for us because
you don't see as much pressing right now because you're relying on that clock.  
  
But getting those shots, when do you stop sending guys to the offensive boards
and send them back to protect? You usually can hang onto the lead. But we had
a game with Purdue this year, I mean, they scored two -- we were up 18. They
scored two old fashioned 3s and two 3-point plays in like a minute. It was
six, just like that. We had had some pretty good shots, but they didn't go in.  
  
I think you've got to be very careful about when you pull the plug. People can
come back so quickly.  
  
Q. John, in your experience, when one of your teams comes off such a
good shooting display, 16 3-pointers, do you figure they'll be confident and
do it again or do you worry it's not going to be there? The other team is
clued in on it. Do you worry it's fool's gold?  
COACH BEILEIN: I worry about everything in life. That's a bad question for me.
16, I'm not saying we're going to go make 16 again. I'm not thinking that. I'm
thinking if we get good shots, let's go and if we can shoot 35 to 45 percent
from three, we're going to be in a lot of games.  
  
But we've got to get those shots too. People take away your 3s, that is
another issue. So then you've got to drive the ball and say we're not doing
it. We've got to drive it. They're out and extending. Now we have to drive by
people or run different action to get things going to the rim or passing
action to the rim.  
  
So I think, even though people will think we're this 3-point shooting machine,
I think we're really flexible at doing what we need to do to be able to be in
position to win a game.  
  
Q. John, how far do you think we are from the college rules embracing
all of the NBA rules, the 3-point line, the shot clock? At what point do you
think that will happen?  
COACH BEILEIN: We're certainly trending that way, Myron, but I hope we don't
go to the 24. I think there's a certain element there that these kids -- the
action is going to be more up and down, right? The NBA guys aren't going to
classes all day long, right, and they're not getting back at 2:00 in the
morning and having 8:00 calculus class or chemistry class or sociology class.  
  
I hope we've got to keep the beauty of this thing. It's in a good spot right
now where it is. Because of our new strengths and basketball, our technology,
because of those strengths, these kids, their time demands are even more in
flux.  
  
So I think when we go to that, I think that now it's more times up and down
the court, up and down the court, more times in practice up and down the
court. I think it's dangerous to go too much in that level.  
  
But I think we've got to still put our kids in position so they're ready for
the NBA. That's the key thing. But I think we can do that in a gradual thing,
just like the minor leagues in baseball. They're not ready in the minor
leagues, but it won't be long before they're ready. Put them in position to be
in that position.  
  
Q. John, I think you've faced a Pitino-coached team four times in your
career. I wonder what you find is the unique challenge to prepare for his team
and are they much different than they were in the '13 title game?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think they've been very similar in all the times. I even
faced them when I was a Canisius coach when he was at Kentucky. So you're
always prepared for multiple defenses because they're going to come out.
They're going to play full court pressure. Sometimes they're going to trap.
Sometimes they're going to run and jump.  
  
They're going to play hard pressure, sometimes soft pressure. You're going to
see some type of full court just soft stuff. And you're going to see a matchup
zone, regular zone. You're going to see regular man-to-man, switching man-to-
man. We've seen all those things. In a one-day prep, it's hard. It's hard for
both teams.  
  
That's been pretty consistent with Rick, and I think that he's about the same
age as I am. And we sort of got into the game differently to where we are just
by coaching nomads a little bit.  
  
The Dean Smiths that we got the clinics, the John Woodens that played multiple
defenses. John Wooden used to press. Dean Smith always had a multiple defense.
Those were the clinics that we went to that and I went to. That helps you
evolve as a young coach.  
  
So he's kept some of that. We used to be 1-3-1 zone and back to a man. We used
to change more than we do now. I like winning more, so we stop playing so much
1-3-1. Everybody got used to the 1-3-1. It used to be big, and then people got
used to it.  
  
Q. You've only had a day to look at film for Louisville, but what are
your thoughts on number 22, Deng Adel, the small forward?  
COACH BEILEIN: I like what I see from him, because his length is incredible.
He can shoot just enough where you have to guard him. He's a perfect
complement to the two guards. His length is really, really good. I think they
played him on guards before as well, so very versatile player.  
  
Q. Derrick Walton now is a household name in a lot of college basketball
fans' households. I'm curious as to -- especially over the last month or so,
he's been picked up. So has it been a situation where Derrick has just been
exposed and now people are becoming familiar with him, or has he always been
this good?  
If he's been this good, what do you attribute his play recently to?  
  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that his evolvement as a player, his evolution as a
player, has really spiked this year. Where you've seen the biggest spike is
that he wanted to win so badly. He's had a lot of help with that, where he's
got a great staff.  
  
I think that Billy Donlon has had a great influence on him. Greg Hardin, who
has counseled the Tom Bradys and the Desmond Howards of the world has spoken a
lot with him about him getting everything he can out of the blessings he's
had.  
  
Actually, I think people starting to switch man-to-man and say my 7-footer or
my 6'8" guy can guard their point guard, I think he took it personally and
said, wait a minute, I got a lot more to my game because that was part of
where this whole thing started is where people thought they could just guard
him with a big man in a pick-and-roll situation. And he said, all right now
Coach just wants me to shoot it or drive it. That's really been helpful.  
  
The young man has worked hard. We wear these Catapult system on our back that
measures how hard you worked that day in practice. And his was leading every
practice every day the first month of the season. It was like 1,100. We try to
not let him get over 500 or 400. Halfway through practice, he's at 500. We
have to shut him down. He's a worker and that's been the other component of
his growth.  
  
Q. John, Zak, D.J. and Derrick were talking about how importantly you
treat turnovers in practice. Can you talk a little bit about Louisville's
pressure defense and how turnovers may play a key in the game tomorrow?  
COACH BEILEIN: This is a part that we have to take care of. It's a game of
possessions. Because we have a lot of skilled players, we can accept some of
the fact we might get out-rebounded. If you out-rebound us by six or seven and
we have seven less turnovers, we all have the same possessions.  
  
So that's very, very important. If you're out-rebounding us and we're giving
it back to you, we're in trouble. We have to make sure to take care of the
ball because if you're going to trap us or try to turn us over, we're one pass
away from a basket.  
  
So I think we probably work at pivoting and passing as much as anybody in the
country. The kids are coming in -- because it's just old school camp stuff. I
mean, if you had a fourth grade team, you teach them how to pivot. It seems
like we get a lot of players that don't know how to pivot. Now they can pivot
out of that pressure and their defense can create our offense.  
  
Louisville's thing will be their defense going to create their offense. We
can't let that happen tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, John.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Kentucky athletes are here, and let's go right to
the questions.  
  
Q. Isaiah, Markis McDuffie was talking quite a bit about facing you in
some of the New Jersey Sate Title games. What do you remember from him and
from those games playing him then and now?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: When we were in high school, we played against each other a
few times in the state championship and things like that. I'm just looking
forward to getting out there and playing against him again.  
  
Q. A lot of the Wichita players were talking about how you guys are the
five star guys, sounded like there was a chip on their shoulder about it. I'm
sure you guys encounter that a lot. How do you deal with that? Do you deflect
it or kind of stick out your chest and say darn right we are?  
EDRICE ADEBAYO: We're just here to play basketball, stick with our teammates
and just be together.  
  
DE'AARON FOX: Like we said, we're going to play basketball. I'm not worried
about what anybody says right now.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: Honestly, just taking it game by game. Was prepared for the team
yesterday, and now we're prepared for Wichita State and worried about
ourselves and worried about what we've got to do. That's how we feel.  
  
Q. De'Aaron, a couple weeks ago, you were asked about what aspect of
your game you were spending the most on in practice and you said at the time
it was your decision making. Can you kind of assess how that's been going and
how important do you feel like that is to the success of the team?  
DE'AARON FOX: It's going to be extremely important, just being able to take
care of the ball, help my team get into scoring positions, things like that.
When I cut down my turnovers, I feel like we have a greater chance of success.
And that's just with any player on the team if we're not turning the ball
over. We're getting more shots, have more opportunities to make shots, more
opportunities to get offensive rebounds and get second chances. I was focusing
on mine, but when I'm making good decision, I feel like the whole team has
been making good decisions.  
  
Q. This one for Bam. Coach Marshall, before you guys came on said that
he's going to be throwing several bigs at you to stop you. You're averaging a
double-double in March. Also, the Wichita players seem confident you're not
going to have 18 rebounds against them tomorrow. What do you make of their
confidence and what do you see of Wichita State's big guys?  
EDRICE ADEBAYO: I've got to go out there and play hard and stick with my
teammates. They've got confidence, and we've got high confidence too.  
  
Q. De'Aaron and Malik, it's often said that freshmen almost become
sophomores this time of year as you mature. How much have you guys changed
from the guys you were when you came in this summer to who you are now with
this team?  
DE'AARON FOX: Coming in, we didn't know much about it. I can speak for myself.
I didn't know much about it, how to run a team just yet. But as the season's
gone by, I've learned. I've learned a lot of things. And being a freshman
isn't an excuse anymore. Like you said, we're basically sophomores now. We've
got to go out and play.  
  
MALIK MONK: Just like he said, I didn't know too much about it. We're here
now. We're comfortable with the system. We know what we need to do, so we've
just got to play.  
  
Q. Even though Wichita State does not have that Power Five conference
kind of brand about them, they've done so much in the tournament in recent
years. What's your perception, just as fans of college basketball, when you
think about that program, hear about it, see them play?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: I don't know too much about Wichita State. Our concern is us.
We focus on us. As long as we go out there, play with energy, play hard and
play Kentucky basketball, I think we'll have a great chance to win.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: Just pretty much reiterating what Isaiah said. We haven't seen
them this year. We focus on ourselves. We don't even get to see a game. Parts
of what you do watch doesn't even factor in on how you can form an opinion on
someone. Like I said, just worry about ourselves and worry about what we've
got to get done.  
  
Q. Malik, how would you describe how tough it would be to defend you
guys when you, De'Aaron and Bam are producing at a high level?  
MALIK MONK: It's pretty hard to guard us anyway. But just with all of us
producing, it's going to be hard. But, I mean, like I said, we've got to play
basketball and just worry about Kentucky, and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. For Bam, it's related to an earlier question, when a Wichita State
player in the locker room says about your rebounding, it's getting shut down,
Gregg Marshall says he hopes you're in good shape tomorrow because you'll need
to be. Does that affect or impact you at all when you know there's a certain
focus from a team that's going to be on you particularly, Bam?  
EDRICE ADEBAYO: No. I just go out and play my game, have fun with my
teammates, just listen to Cal and listen to my teammates.  
  
Q. For any of you, Coach Cal last night was griping about playing a game
at midnight. Does that really bother any of you guys, or is that just
something about an old man griping?  
DE'AARON FOX: We're all young. We ain't tired at midnight. I mean, they had to
play at midnight too so it was just whoever brought the most energy. I mean, I
don't think you should, but we were all right.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: It's just how the committee does stuff, so you can't really
worry about it. You've still got to take it game by game. Regardless, you have
to play the game, come out there, bring energy. That's all you can do.  
  
Q. Isaiah, just getting back to the games against St. Anthony's, do you
remember anything about McDuffie, what stood out about his game in high
school?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: He's a good player. That's all I really remember. He's a good
player.  
  
Q. Derek, what do you remember of the 2014 tournament game with Kentucky
and Wichita State?  
DEREK WILLIS: Just thought it was coached real well. I thought they were in a
lot of really good schemes. They had some wing, small forward player, Early.
He was a really good player. We just played really good together and came out
and came down to it. They got a nice shot off at the end, but came away with
the "W", just how it went. Just a dog fight. We came out on top.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
MICHIGAN - 92, OKLAHOMA STATE - 91  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening statement from Coach Underwood, and
then we'll open it up for ten minutes for anyone. Coach?  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: A tremendous amount of credit to Michigan. They're a very,
very good basketball team, played extremely well today.  
  
You run into so many problems with trying to defend Michigan, and John does a
great job of spacing the floor. They have so many shooters.  
  
It gets hard to take everything away from them. I thought the first half, we
were very good at defending the 3-point line, trying to keep them in front of
us. We did a great job on Walton the first half. He only had 7.  
  
But, again, the second half was -- you go 11 of 15 from the 3, that's hard to
do in a gym by yourself. And they hit some hard shots. Give them credit. I'm
very, very proud of these young men up here.  
  
This group has been through a lot this year. When you talk about the death of
a teammate, when you talk about a trip to Maui and going 10-2 in the non-
league and starting 0-6 and then a great run to turn it around, I think it
speaks volumes to the character of our locker room.  
  
I couldn't be prouder of a group of guys. It's never great to have a season
end. I thought we could have made some noise in this thing. Today, we just
weren't good enough, and give a lot of credit to Michigan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach or the players.  
  
Q. Jawun and Phil, seemed like the game sort of got out of your control
about four, five minutes left. Everybody is scoring every possessions and you
had three or four possessions where you didn't score. Do you remember that
stretch and what do you think went wrong during those possessions?  
JAWUN EVANS: I just felt like we kind of got confused at times. But also, we
just were trying to figure out who we wanted to score the ball. So that's what
happened.  
  
PHIL FORTE: We just had a few lapses on defense. And when you play a team like
Michigan, you can't do that. And when you get into a scoring match, and you
don't score, obviously they're going to make a little run.  
  
Q. Coach, how difficult is it to keep your team motivated when the other
team is just draining 3s that are somewhat ridiculous at times?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: It's what we do. We do the same thing. We see it every day in
practice. We weren't the number one offensive team in the country from an
efficiency standpoint.  
  
It's one of those deals, we shot 55 percent in the NCAA tournament and just
lost in the first round. The game is evolving into this. This goes against
basically every stereotype you know.  
  
It's one I've got to grasp, out-rebound an opponent 40-21 and lose. The game's
changing. The 3-point line is changing that way. We saw teams in our league
that did the same thing.  
  
I think it's a tribute to what we try to do. We're everyday guys who try to
play every play. And no matter what the consequences, we could have very
easily folded. As long as there's officials on the court, time on the clock,
and they're keeping score, we're going to keep fighting.  
  
This team, I'm proud of. We're resilient and, again, these two seniors deserve
a lot of the credit for that.  
  
Q. For Leyton, both teams got off to a sort of a slow start. It wasn't a
wild game early. What triggered to get both teams' offenses really going?  
LEYTON HAMMONDS: I just felt like defensively, when you get stops, get a
couple stops in a row, it kind of gets your offense going. Especially with us,
we're really well in the first seven seconds of a shot clock. Once we get a
stop and a defensive rebound and let Jawun do his thing, that's been our
motto. We got a couple stops in a row, three stops in a row. Then you kind of
start feeling it on offense. Once the ball goes in, you start getting your
rhythm.  
  
Q. Brad, you went to a zone for a few plays, and you didn't stay with
it. You did a lot of -- looked like you switched every screen most of the
game. Was that what you were going to do no matter what? How did you feel
about that defensive front?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: In the Big Ten tournament, Derrick Walton took 51 shots that
were not break-away steal layups. 45 of them were jump shots. And so switching
was going to -- you know, they were the third percentile in the country in
post-ups.  
  
So we weren't overly concerned with that. It was a matter of trying to stop
them from shooting in the paint and step-in 3s. We wanted to force them to
dribble if they wanted to go up Mitch, so be it, and/or Leyton. To their
credit, they made some shots. If you get into a rotation game with them in
terms of hedging ball screens or doing that, you are going to lose because
they pass it so well. They play so well together.  
  
I felt pretty good about it. We worked on it a great deal and, for the most
part, the only thing that hurt us in the first half was Wilson had six
offensive rebounds or three offensive rebounds. But, like I said, there's a
little give and take when you play Michigan.  
  
Q. Jawun, Jeff had a really strong game in terms of percentage. I think
he was 6 of 8 shooting, but he didn't get a lot of shots. Was Michigan doing
anything to take him away from getting shots? Why so few shots for Jeffrey?  
JAWUN EVANS: I feel like they played Jeff kind of good in a way. But, also,
just wasn't that kind of night for him, I guess. I can't tell you. Can't tell
you why he didn't have as many shots as he should, but just one of them
nights.  
  
Q. Phil, looked like they were committed to not letting you shoot. You
started putting the ball on the floor, found a couple of 3s off the dribble
and also in the paint took some shots. Was it a decision that, hey, you just
have to find some shots out of your normal comfort zone?  
PHIL FORTE: Just trying to make a couple plays, just kind of taking what the
defense gave me and just seeing how tight they were playing me and kind of
trying to use it to my advantage to attack them.  
  
Q. For Brad, was this the kind of game, the way it became, where you
just almost had to score every possession? Looked like a Big 12 football game
out there. If you punt, you might lose. If you miss today, you might lose
because everybody's scoring so much.  
COACH UNDERWOOD: It's pretty much what I expect. I think they're eighth in the
country in offensive efficiency or ninth, somewhere right in there. We're
first. And I like when we play with tempo. It suits this team.  
  
Phil doesn't get a ton of looks because everybody fears him in spaces and that
creates opportunities for those other guys. Leyton played with a couple fouls
early.  
  
But, yeah, we score a lot of ways, and tempo was good for us. You sit there
and you look. I talked about the rebounding difference. You talk about 50
points in the paint and you lose. The game's changing. To their credit, when
you make 3s, you've got a great chance to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Oklahoma State.

### [Donovan Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32043)

### [Mangok Mathiang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33182)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Louisville - 78, Jacksonville State - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement with Coach Pitino, and
then we'll go to questions for anyone.  
  
COACH PITINO: Thank you. First, I want to congratulate Jacksonville State.
They never stopped. We had relentless pressure on them. They never stopped,
kept staying in the game. Really happy for Ray because he did a terrific job
in his first year. They have very good basketball players.  
  
I was very impressed with Donovan Mitchell. I've been trying to get him to
focus on other things other than scoring. If it's not your night because
you're the main target to do other things. And tonight, he wasn't necessarily
on, but he had ten rebounds, five assists and three steals and a blocked shot.
So, to me, he's come a long way.  
  
Normally, if he missed shots, he wouldn't do that. That's great. Mangok played
great offense and tried to put Norbertas Giga in the NBA.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Donovan, you had career high rebounds. You matched your career high
in assists. Does that take the sting out of missing your first 11 shots?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: I guess. I mean, I wasn't really focused on that. You know,
Coach told me about maybe eight minutes left that the guys are -- all five
guys are keying in on me, so I kind of made it a point to jump stop in the
lane and create points for my teammates. Once I started doing that, I started
to get more comfortable. Realizing the games that we lost that I didn't play
well, I was forcing the issue and not really playing, doing other -- excelling
in other parts of my game.  
  
So I made it a point to kind of go to the glass and get my teammates a shot
and play great defense.  
  
Q. Mangok, you've been very efficient your last five or six games
scoring the basketball. Is that something you've been working on? A lot of
people are surprised. You've been going over right and left shoulders,
scoring, hitting free throws. Are you concentrating on that now?  
MANGOK MATHIANG: Coach has made a big point of trying to go play inside-out.
And it's been working out pretty well for me. A lot of guys that are not
expecting me to make a move in the post and going up and scoring.  
  
I mean, it's working out pretty well for me and for my teammates because I'm
kicking that out as well.  
  
Q. Mangok, second chance points today was 24 to 3. Do you have a sense
that even if your shots weren't going down that you would be able to keep
getting offensive rebounds and eventually they would go in?  
MANGOK MATHIANG: I mean, Coach, back to Coach again, he's made a big point of
us just crashing the glass offensively all the time, 90 percent of the time.
It's worked out a lot for us today. I wasn't grabbing a lot of them, but I was
tipping some of them out for our guards to actually give us a second chance.  
  
A lot of it went in, and sometimes we turned the ball over. Every time we go
to the glass offensively, it's very hard to guard us.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino, do you feel the shot selection was better in the second
half or it's better execution in the second half?  
COACH PITINO: I thought the shot selection was good in the first half because
the first four paint touches were pointblank range at the rim, and Jaylen and
Mangok just missed it on pointblank range. One was a dunk, missed dunk. The
other three that they normally make.  
  
I mean, Mangok has come a long, long way. People don't realize that he's
broken the same foot twice and been out a long, long time. About a month and a
half ago, he started coming around and being the old Mangok where he drop
steps both shoulders, goes up and under, does a lot of really good things.  
  
He's a veteran. As you can see, he's not a young, spring chicken. He's 35
years old. No. He's only 24.  
  
Q. Coach, did you notice any sense of urgency going into this game after
the loss to Duke?  
COACH PITINO: You know what I've found? I don't know why, but it happened to
Villanova last night, when you're a low seed, you come out a little tight
because you're supposed to win in the minds of everybody, and the players --
you know, usually we don't miss dunks in pointblank range. We didn't guard the
3 well tonight, but they banked three of them in, and they made another 3 with
one second on the clock.  
  
So, you know, when they shoot 50 percent, go 10 for 19 from the 3 and you
still win by 15, you have to take it. That being said, we're playing against
the Golden State Warriors on Sunday. So I've never seen -- I watched the
second half. I've never seen shooting like that since I've been a coach. It's
incredible the way they shoot the basketball.  
  
And it looks like it's going in the moment it leaves the hands, so it's going
to be a tough task for us.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino, you answered my question. They had 15 shots and 36
points, almost 2.3 per possession. UCLA leads the country at 1.2. You're going
to have to guard them all. What are you going to do the next 48 hours to get
your team ready for that kind of arsenal? It was unbelievable the second
half.  
COACH PITINO: It really was. When you have a great point guard, who you've got
to contain and if you help, so -- look, we know how good Michigan is. This is
a very inexperienced team. We're down two scholarships. Our backcourt's a
little thin. Show you how inexperienced we are, one of my players said there's
a lady in the huddle stealing our plays, Tracy Wilson. They thought she was
giving it to the other team. I told Donovan, she's not doing that.  
  
No, it wasn't him. But, look, we know what we're in for. It will be the
toughest second round matchup I've had since I've been in this business.
They're a great basketball team. I've seen them in person lose to my son.  
  
But since that point, seeing them in person, they are an entirely different
basketball team. And they're lethal, and they're on a great run right now. I
think it will be a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Coach, it looks like Kevin Keatts got the NC State job. Your thoughts
on what he'll do there.  
COACH PITINO: Are you sure about that?  
  
Q. Per ESPN's Jeff Goodman.  
COACH PITINO: Well, I spoke to him before I came over here, and at that point
it wasn't a done deal. So I don't know what to say. Jeff is focusing in on
that, but I spoke -- when I left for the arena, it wasn't a done deal. So
maybe it got done. If it is, they've hired one helluva basketball coach
because he's absolutely great as a recruiter as well as a coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you've gone up against John Beilein a couple times before. How
does this year's team compare to teams you've faced in the past?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's actually more than a couple. I don't know how many
times, but we've always had bizarre games. I'm not sure if he was at West
Virginia when we won the Big East championship at that time, but then he had a
group -- talk about shooting, we had seven guys. Our seventh man, Otis George,
had a stress fracture. We played no man. We couldn't press the whole season.
We just played two-three bumping zone, and his team made 11 3s before half.
And his son made two from the logo in Albuquerque, from the Wolf.  
  
And we actually -- at halftime, we were fortunate enough to win in overtime.
We played them in the Big East in the quarter semi-finals and finals. We
played them in a great game in 2013. My respect for him as a basketball coach
is off the charts. His teams are fun to watch, well coached, well drilled. He
will turn it over. It's going to be a heck of a game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Scoochie Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28633)

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wichita State - 64, Dayton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Dayton. Coach, will make a
statement.  
  
COACH MILLER: Congratulations to Wichita State with a terrific team, all
they're advertised and more. Their depth, their length, their ability to
rebound the ball is all spot-on.  
  
I was really proud of our team. I thought that was one of the hardest played
games we've been in a long, long time. And I think it was anyone's game for a
good portion, and you got to give them some credit for some timely shots,
rebounds, and then we sputtered.  
  
We sputtered with about seven to six minutes to go and just had a hard time
scoring, but I think everybody has a hard time scoring on them. But a couple
of these guys next to me and two more that aren't here, what they've meant to
our program and how their legacy will be laid out, it's something special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Scooch, what was it like hearing your name, Scooch, as you walked off
the floor the last time?  
SCHOOCHIE SMITH: It was a good feeling, a little bitter sweet. Had a terrific
journey here with the rest of my fellow seniors, and it was real good. But
proud of what we accomplished, all four of us, and we're not living for
ourselves. We're living for the kids back at home from where we come from,
giving them faith. Where we come from, people don't get this opportunity to
play four years of Division 1 basketball in the NCAA tournament. So we're just
living for everyone else back home as well.  
  
Q. Archie, I don't know if you heard Gregg Marshall, but he closed by
saying that he believed Dayton deserved a better draw than this. Do you have
any response to that?  
COACH MILLER: Like a 4 seed, like a 4 or 5 seed maybe. 30-some wins and you
look at the numbers across the board, I mean, every coach studies the
analytics. They're a team that can beat anybody on a neutral court at any
time, and I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't pushing towards another
second weekend. They're a great team, and they're really well coached, maybe
as fun of a team to prepare for as we've had.  
  
Actually, it was a lot of fun to be in the game playing against them because
you kind of want to stack yourself up against sort of how they do things to
see how your stuff works. We battled. We battled really hard. We were right
there.  
  
Q. Coach, Xeyrius struggled today, probably his worst game of the
season. How do you get him to bounce back from this?  
COACH MILLER: It will be motivation. A year ago, Xeyrius didn't get in the
game. If he got in the game, it was probably a couple minutes. You saw him
grow up month by month. Wouldn't have been here without him. He'll turn
himself into a much more diverse player is a big key from him.  
  
From a size perspective, you saw older guys in there tonight. That's what he
needs to look like physically. When you shoot the ball at that size how he
does, you can really start to see the blossoming of what we can be with him as
years go by.  
  
He didn't have a great night, missed some open ones, but he played hard. He
really did. He played hard. Guy shoots 45 percent from 3 on the year as a
sophomore. Compared to what he did a year ago, he's got a great, great future
because he's a great kid, and he works very hard.  
  
Q. Coach, Kyle didn't do much on offense, but he just laid his heart out
there on defense. What does that say about him?  
COACH MILLER: All these guys, Kyle's a special kid. He's been a special kid
from day one. He's won I don't know how many games for us by never scoring a
point. When you have guys like that, you know, those are the true team guys.
They never care about scoring points. I thought he battled tonight.  
  
I looked at Frankamp's numbers, and I think Landry probably made some timely
ones in the second half. But, I mean, he's a big reason why we were able to
contain their perimeter. He did that for us all night. Just a winner, man, one
of the best guys I've ever been around.  
  
Q. Coach, is it different preparing for a game as the higher seed versus
the lower seed?  
COACH MILLER: No. The numbers are the numbers. They go out the window right
after they call your name, and then you start preparing to play a game.  
  
I think these guys will tell you, I don't think we've ever approached a seed
in our lives. I think we've always approached the team because we feel like we
can beat them, felt like we could win tonight. We just didn't.  
  
Felt like if we would have advanced, these guys would have been ready to try
to do it again. That's the hallmark of a team that believes in themselves more
so than anything else. I think the culture that these guys have helped create,
it's going to be hard to carry the torch for everybody behind them every year
like this. They've set a serious standard in a way to do things. There are no
excuses ever made. I think regardless if Wichita State was a 4 today and we
were a 10 or a 12, at the end of the day, you've got to play the game and
that's how we approached it.  
  
Q. For the players, coach mentioned you sputtered in the second half.
From the 14-minute mark to the 2-minute mark, you were 1 of 16 from the floor.
What was it about Wichita State's defense that made it so hard to score on
them?  
KENDALL POLLARD: They're a real connected defense. They were tight and playing
aggressive. We just couldn't make shots. We're a pretty good offensive team,
but the ball just wasn't falling for us tonight.  
  
SCHOOCHIE SMITH: Of course you've got to give them credit because they're the
ones defending, but I think it's more about us. We just had to step up and
make shots, and a lot of people on our team, they couldn't get their shots to
fall, couldn't get a flow. That's just sometimes how the game goes.  
  
But we played hard enough to stay right in the game.  
  
Q. Scoochie, no player wants to go out, obviously. If you do go out, do
you want it to be like a game like today where it's a scrap and it's a brawl
like you guys had with Wichita State today?  
SCHOOCHIE SMITH: Makes you feel a little better about yourself, going out
giving it your all. But as a competitor, you never want to go out on the
bottom. So it was just a bad moment, but we did so much in my four years being
here, we revived Dayton basketball, and I couldn't be happier.  
  
Q. Archie, I know you just lost, but your name's been linked to the
Indiana job. I just wonder what your thoughts were. I know it's close.  
COACH MILLER: No thoughts.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH MILLER: Thank you.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wichita State - 64, Dayton - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Wichita State, and we will open with an
opening statement from Coach Marshall, and then we will take questions for the
coach and the athletes. Coach?  
  
COACH MARSHALL: First of all, I want to praise Archie Miller and the Dayton
Flyers and those four seniors for all they've done for that university, for
that program and for college basketball the last four years. It's been longer
than that for Coach Miller.  
  
But those dudes are warriors. They're tough. Scoochie Smith was incredible
tonight with 25 points, but I'm also really proud of these young men to my
right, and they made the plays to help us beat a very good team.  
  
Q. For any of the players, it's been a while since you've been in a
hard-fought, close, tough game like this. What was the reaction to it and how
did you overcome that?  
ZACH BROWN: You're right. It was definitely something a little brand new to us
from how we've seen in the Missouri Valley. But I don't know. We just grinded
it out. It was a tough game. Dayton Flyers are an amazing team. I've been
watching Scoochie Smith since high school.  
  
All these other dudes he's been playing with, they had vets on a team that's
won a lot of games. It was really hard fought. None of it came easy.  
  
The only thing we were able to do is stop their runs, stop as many runs as we
could, execute when we needed to, just maintain the lead for as long as we
could. But all in all, it was a big grind. And I'm proud, proud of everybody,
like coach said, for overcoming not the deficit, but overcoming just the
challenge of being in a close game.  
  
Q. Gregg, they went 8 for 29 in the second half. What adjustments did
you make, if any, defensively?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, they scored two real quick baskets in the second half.
We blew a switch one time, and they got an easy one. And then Shaq Morris went
for a steal and gave Pollard a dunk. After that, if they didn't get it in
transition, our half court defense was incredible.  
  
Once we built the lead, I said all along, they're an elite transition team,
and they were getting it out and spraying it up and attacking before we could
get our defense set. They're really, really good at it, but I doubt they're
any better than the two teams that are playing right now.  
  
So we'll have to continue to improve and get back and set our defense because
we're pretty good once we're in a set defense.  
  
Q. Gregg, I'll ask you the same questions I asked the players. You've
always prided your program on toughness, but there have been so many lopsided
games. Did you have any doubts about how your team would react to a tight game
like this?  
COACH MARSHALL: I didn't doubt. I was disappointed in the first half. I
thought we were playing passively. I thought we were not executing. The three
words that I talk about, verve, vigor and vitality, we didn't have those
things.  
  
We played with much better energy and passion in the second half. We were
tremendous on the glass. I think we were plus 19 on the glass against a
veteran, tough team.  
  
Even though we turned the ball over way too many times, we blocked eight
shots. I mean, we were -- one stretch, I think Markis McDuffie and Rashard
Kelly, they were just pinning things against the glass.  
  
Big play was Landry Shamet's block in transition where Kelly sprinted back and
got the defensive rebound. That was a huge play.  
  
Q. This is for Coach. How important was the bench tonight?  
COACH MARSHALL: Our bench has been key all year. I mean, we've gone ten deep
all year, and we will continue to go ten deep. I thought even Austin Reaves,
who only played four minutes, was probably a season low in a game he's
participated in hit two big free throws. Everybody that played contributed,
ten of those guys, and the six guys that did not play, and I've got two in the
stands. We can only have 14 on the bench. I've got two in the stands. They all
contributed to this win as well.  
  
This is the true definition of a team. These guys love each other. I don't
follow them. I don't have the Instagram, but my daughter does. She follows
them. She showed me some of the things they posted going into this game and
what it means to them. It would bring tears to your eyes if you knew them.  
  
Q. Rashard and Zach, you went to a different lineup the last six minutes
with you three, Marcus and Rauno, looked like a good defensive lineup. Why was
that effective the last stretch of the game?  
RASHARD KELLY: It was more so just what we needed at the time, some length to
bother their guards. And Rauno is a mobile five-man. He was able to hedge and
get back. They were heating us up at first. We had to dig deep and get some
stops. It was the match-ups and lineups coach went with, and it followed
through.  
  
ZACH BROWN: I got to agree with Rashard. They had guys like Pollard and a lot
of big guys that can move really well. And when Shaq got in foul trouble,
Rauno really stepped up and made some big plays which people wouldn't think of
big plays. But we go back and watch film, we're like, yeah, Rauno, you was in
the right position. Rashard, you're in the right position. You made a winning
play.  
  
And we just do what we do all year, just try and guard our man the best we
can, be in the right positions where we need to be, and Coach made the right
decision, like he usually does, in putting the right lineup in.  
  
Q. Landry, it was really hard for the guards in the first half tonight
to find openings, to get Conner open, to get you open. Were there adjustments
made that helped free that up a little bit in the second half?  
LANDRY SHAMET: We tweaked a few things in the second half. The first half, us
guards just -- me personally, I just didn't play very well. I didn't play good
enough to have us a lead or whatever. And we tweaked a few things in the
locker room as far as offense goes to try to get Conner some open looks and
really kind of manipulate their defense a little bit. So we just tweaked a
couple things.  
  
Q. Zach, shooting like this tonight, does that come under the category
of all the extra time you spend after practice paying off in a situation like
this?  
ZACH BROWN: Yeah, it is. Every day, just about every day, I try to get in as
many shots as I can after practice. I got to thank Matt and Gregg, Tommy, all
the managers that really stayed in with me, all those extra hours of me just
staying behind and getting up as many as I can, different types of shots.  
  
One thing I wasn't -- I haven't really been good in this year was shooting
while moving. It's been kind of tough for me to shoot, you know, off of
screens or anything instead of just shooting stationary shots. So, yeah, I'd
say it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. Hard work pays off, just like
Rauno said.  
  
Q. For Zach and Landry, it's hypothetical at this point because they're
playing now. If you get a chance to face Kentucky, what would it take to beat
a team like that?  
ZACH BROWN: It's going to take a lot. It's going to take a lot. We've
definitely seen them play. Everybody's seen Kentucky play this year. They have
guys that can take you off the bounce at any time. They're really good.
They're really good defensively, and they get out in transition so we're
really going to have to get back -- it's going to be a grind. It really is.
They're not going to back down, just like we're not. It's going to be a
classic game. We're all excited for it. We can't wait.  
  
Q. To follow up on the question for Zach and coach, we talked about this
yesterday, Coach, Kentucky is obviously known for producing NBA guys. Your
Final Four team from a few years ago produced three NBA players. What's the
difference in philosophy between you and Cal and how you're getting these guys
that get to the NBA and maybe Zach or one of the players can answer that as
well?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, the guys that they bring in are a little more ready made
for the NBA with the size, athleticism, and he gets them better, and he gets
them prepared for the NBA as well as anyone.  
  
Ours take a little more time in the incubator and developing and working with
them and developing their bodies and their skill-set and teaching them to play
angry.  
  
The bottom line is it doesn't matter how you get there. As you mentioned,
we've had four, five in the last couple years, and we've got a couple more on
this roster. You may not know it yet, but you will in a couple of years
because we've got no seniors.  
  
Our guys don't normally do it in one year or two years. They do it in four
years.  
  
ZACH BROWN: I don't know. You know, Kentucky produces NBA players. Everybody
knows that. Wichita State guys like Ron, Fred, Tekele like I said before,
we're shooting at 300. It came from hard work, great coaching.  
  
I see those guys when I was a freshman, and even last year, I saw Ron and Fred
constantly working, Tekele constantly working in the gym before me 6:00 in the
morning, you know.  
  
Like you would think that all these guys are really talented and a lot of
people are, but it's really just a grind. They'd be in the gym just as much as
we are. And they're getting better just like we are, so I would say just with
that.  
  
Q. Gregg, that lineup to kind of close the game with these three and
Rauno and Markis, why did you hit upon that? Why was it as effective as it
was?  
COACH MARSHALL: I liked the lineup defensively. Once we got the six to eight-
point lead, they were going to attack us pretty hard off the bounce. Zach was
doing a great job. Markis was doing a great job and Rashard and Rauno. And
Landry, obviously, we could switch a lot of the ball screen action with that
lineup with a similar size. I just -- I thought, also, that that was a good
rebounding team. I didn't know they were going to block as many shots, but
they did.  
  
And I would like to finish by saying that, once again, I think Dayton deserved
a better draw in this tournament. I'll finish with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow.

### [Ray Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23465)

### [Norbertas Giga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33180)

### [Tyrik Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33181)

### [Malcolm Drumwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33102)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Louisville - 78, Jacksonville State - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will begin with an opening statement from Coach Harper and
then take questions for anybody up here. Coach?  
  
COACH HARPER: First and foremost, just awfully proud of our guys. I think the
entire country got an opportunity to see how hard they play.  
  
Unfortunately, today, we didn't -- the game was determined by our inability to
rebound the ball. It wasn't because of a lack of effort. Their length and
their athleticism caused us some problems.  
  
But it was definitely not a lack of effort, and I told the guys in the locker
room, couldn't be more proud. First trip ever for Jacksonville State to the
NCAA tournament. I think we represented our university, our city, and the LVC
in a class manner, which we said we would. And the bar's been set. Hopefully
we can do it again here some day soon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Ray, obviously, Giga had a great game. Can you talk about what he
showed the country today?  
COACH HARPER: I think it's the first time in a long time, and these guys will
tell you, I don't say anything that I wouldn't say to them in my office, that
I saw him after practice, and he and Coach Richardson was getting shots up
constantly.  
  
I think it showed today that he's got a ton of ability. The sky's the limit
for him. Now we'll see how hard he wants to work in the off-season and how
good he really wants to be. The same goes for the two sitting right next to
him. They're very talented.  
  
But this game is about getting better, and that's what we did as a team, and
that's what we've got to do as individuals now in the off-season.  
  
We got a taste of it. Let's see how much these guys really liked it.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could comment on the shirts, the Create Yours, is that
like a slogan or a philosophy you had this season?  
COACH HARPER: No. That's from Adidas. Each of the  
  
Adidas teams are wearing those. Create your own destiny is us. Again, guys, we
were picked 12th out of 12 teams in our league, and we're here playing today
and had a chance. I mean, we were right there, had the game down to nine, and
the ball kept getting bobbled around.  
  
There's a lot of possessions, but that one was key. I felt like we came up
with that ball somehow. We were gaining confidence with each possession. I
just felt like one of these guys would make a play, and we'd get it to six or
seven.  
  
We talked about yesterday let's get this thing under the four-minute mark with
a chance to win it, and let's see what happens.  
  
Q. Norbertas, can you just again talk about what you had going out there
today, what you saw, how you were able to do what you did today?  
NORBERTAS GIGA: My teammates kept finding me. I kept shooting. The ball kept
going in. Although I think we did a good job in the first half, we gave too
many offensive rebounds. That's what kept them in the game.  
  
I think we fought, which is -- Louisville is a good team, and I think they're
going to go far this year.  
  
Q. Ray, they had Adel on Malcolm today, and it looked like he had some
struggles with that. Can you talk about that matchup and how much it meant to
you offensively?  
COACH HARPER: I thought Malcolm played awfully well. I mean, he had 12 points,
6 assists. He only turned it over twice. We asked a lot of him and Tyrik. I
looked at him in the huddle one time. He wasn't going to tell me that he was
tired because he didn't want to come out of the game, I know that, but their
pressure is tough.  
  
He fought it. I couldn't be more proud of the way he played. I mean, he
competed his tail off. He can tell you he got tired. He might tell me the
truth now. He knew if he told me the truth, he'd probably come out.  
  
I'm proud because I know what Malcolm's about. I don't know how tall he is,
but I know he's got a big heart. The same with the little guy down there on
the end, he's got a big, old heart, and I love guys like that.  
  
Q. One thing that everyone knows about Louisville is that they are
defensively sound. It seemed like the press proved pretty difficult as well
today. Can you talk about the challenge of Louisville's press and maybe what
you did, Coach, to collaborate or to go against that in your offensive
strategy?  
COACH HARPER: There were a couple of stretches where we didn't handle it. It's
all about just pressuring the inbounds pass. I thought we missed over the top
a few times. I think you got to pop them over the top.  
  
We didn't do it. We got Giga one time over the top. But for the most part, I
thought we were pretty good. We had a couple of violations. G forgot he
couldn't run one time. He thought he was still playing over in Lithuania or
Latvia or wherever, where they can do whatever they want.  
  
I just told you, you couldn't run. Anyway, the guys were good. I mean, again,
Malcolm was the one. He and Tyrik had to take it out and face that pressure. I
thought they made good decisions. We talked all week about don't panic. We'd
rather get a five-second call than have a live ball turnover because that's
where they turn them into points.  
  
Yes, seven points off of our turnovers. I would have taken that before the
game. The one stat that jumps out at you is they beat us 24-3 on second chance
points. We shoot 50 percent from the field, 53 from the 3, all numbers I would
have taken prior to the game.  
  
I would have told you, they're not out-rebounding us like that. Even though
they're a great rebounding team, I would have never thought that.  
  
Q. Malcolm, as a veteran player, who was back from last year and coming
back next year, can you talk about the foundation you guys have laid for
beyond this year?  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: We have higher expectations. We plan to come back and plan
to win some games. So we'll be back.  
  
Q. Tyrik, you were one of the few guys that was able to attack the
basket. Can you talk about that a little bit as well?  
TYRIK EDWARDS: Every day in practice, Coach Harper talked to me a lot about
taking -- like when I got bigger players on me, like use my speed. So that's
what I was doing.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what's going through your mind at the first
time-out when you're up 10-2, 8-0? What's running through your mind at that
point?  
NORBERTAS GIGA: Just stay focused. Don't get caught up in the moment. Just
stay focused and stay together.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: We knew they were going to make a run, so we just had to
stay poised. We knew they were coming.  
  
TYRIK EDWARDS: Like Malcolm said, I figured they were going to make a run.
They did eventually. I felt like we had to stay calm and keep playing like we
were.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about Tucker's job on Mitchell? He
didn't score until like maybe the last two, three minutes of the game.  
COACH HARPER: I thought we did a good job on him. He got in the paint late,
and they're terrific offensively. They run a lot of misdirection. They're
good. They're very, very efficient in the half court. I thought our defense
was pretty sound for the most part.  
  
They got us early in the second half with some duck-ins. But for the most
part, I would take how we played defensively. These guys will tell you, our
defense is not about one-on-one defense. It's a team game. We have to cover
for each other, and I thought we did that for the most part.  
  
We gave up some middle drives, which hurt us late in the second half. For the
most part, we were pretty sound defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH HARPER: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Isaiah Briscoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30621)

### [Edrice Adebayo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32938)

### [De'Aaron Fox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32317)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Kentucky - 79, Northern Kentucky - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Calipari has joined us in the interview room. We're going
to get started right away.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Folks, can you make this really quick. It's 12:30. A college
kid shouldn't be playing at 12:30. The old man that's coaching their team has
to watch tapes tonight. Can you just ask a couple questions? We shouldn't be
playing this late, but that's another issue for another day.  
  
Q. John, what did you think of your team's performance in light of the
SEC tournament seemed to be an uptick?  
COACH CALIPARI: We'll be fine. I mean, you get up 18 and, you know, again,
it's 1:30 in the morning, and we're playing. And then you have to give
Northern credit. The thing they did all season is make 3s. And what I said at
halftime, the one thing I'm worried about is they missed a bunch of 3s that
they normally make, or the game would have been closer. And then late in the
game, they made them all. So they made the game close.  
  
Hat's off to John and the job he's done at Northern and their program and
school and, you know, it was -- the first one under the belt. We'll be fine. I
mean, we know how tough the next opponent is. Wichita is tough physically.
Veterans, they play hard. They're a very, very talented team, and we know
that, and we're going to have to play better to be in the game with them.  
  
Q. What about Bam's performance? How much did he sort of get you guys
over the hump?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, again, what's great about him is he's making free
throws. And our whole thing was we're going at him. We knew they'd trap, which
they did.  
  
But he still ended up getting balls, and they fouled him. Just the stuff down
the stretch. You know we use clock. We grind it out. We threw two quick passes
away, like what are you doing, which gave them a chance. Well, that's
freshmen, so I will tell you this is all a learning curve.  
  
We know we've got to play better, no question. I expect that we will.  
  
Q. Coach, was there one particular thing that frustrated you? I noticed
that as the game was going on, you seemed to be coaching this as if it was a
tie game or maybe you were down?  
COACH CALIPARI: Because I'm looking at all these games to try to tell them I
wasn't just worried about this game. You're worried about playing in this
tournament and how you're going to have to play to win. And you can't just
think that there are certain things you can do in each round that goes by is
tougher and tougher and tougher.  
  
So I was coaching them to say this is not how you do this. We talked after the
game. But I want them to enjoy the win. They'll be sleeping here in another 45
minutes, but they can enjoy it for another 45 minutes anyway.  
  
Q. De'Aaron, number 30, Lavone Holland for them, an important part for
them. What did you see from him? Obviously, he kind of gets them going or
could get them going if he finds a rhythm.  
DE'AARON FOX: He was a very good player. He was great off the ball screen. He
was able to rebound for them. He didn't turn the ball over much. We tried to
pressure him. He handled the pressure pretty well today. He scored the ball,
and that's what we knew he was going to do. We just tried to contain them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions?  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Thank you very much.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Kentucky - 79, Northern Kentucky - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Northern Kentucky, and Coach, we'll ask you to make an
opening statement and then go to questions.  
  
COACH BRANNEN: Obviously, we got the draw. We knew we had a tremendous
challenge on our hands. I talked to our guys about whenever you're in a first
round tournament game, whether it be an NCAA tournament game or conference
tournament game, your intensity and how hard you play will be more impactful
than if you advance.  
  
A lot of times, the best teams typically advance once a tournament goes on.
For us, it needed to be a situation where we out-competed Kentucky. I'm not
saying we did that. The first half, it went back and forth a little bit. I
thought we didn't quite get our legs underneath us. The first media, had a
little gassed, and had to get control a little bit.  
  
From there, we did a great job of executing our system and doing what we do.
Just didn't make shots. We were the best shooting team in the Horizon League
the entire season. Tonight was not our night from the 3-point line. I'd liked
to have seen what happened if we had made a few more.  
  
Q. Coach, getting within a possession there in the first half, and then
De'Aaron Fox has six straight that sparks a 13-0 run for them at the end of
the first half. What do you recall of that period there? It seemed like the
legs did get under you a little bit, and then he kind of helped push that.  
COACH BRANNEN: We talked about that, taking a hit. Kentucky is elite. We knew
we'd take some hits and knew they'd go on the runs. When you play a top team
like Kentucky, you can't let them have 18, 19-0 runs. The way to stop that is
A, making shots, and B going down and getting a few stops. Our guys showed
tremendous character and toughness to come back from that. That could have
ballooned to 20, 25, 28. It didn't. That speaks to the guys to my right.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think of Carson's toughness, specifically, going
in as guys that were bigger than him throughout the second half?  
COACH BRANNEN: Throughout the season, that's who he is. That's our second core
value. Carson's moved the needle toughness wise as much as anybody else in the
program. I knew he'd have a great second half.  
  
Q. Drew, you and Cole, as you guys were leaving the court, you had your
hands in the air and were cheering on with the crowd in the stands. Would you
tell us a little bit about what you were feeling at that moment?  
DREW McDONALD: After I went through the line, I went over and just went to
thank our fans. And the weird thing was when I got over there, I was clapping,
they were thanking me. I saw people saying thank you. It just hit me, I looked
up and I saw my dad specifically, and he gave me a thumbs up, and that's what
put a tear in my eye really, just to realize the impact we've put on our
community and the university as a whole. It just -- it struck me. And I just
can't thank Norse Nation enough.  
  
Q. Lavone, yesterday, you said there was no fear with you guys,
regardless of who they were, what the name was. It showed tonight. Can you
speak a little bit about the way you guys tried to attack them offensively and
defensively just with that no fear?  
LAVONE HOLLAND: Really, just the no-fear thing comes from what Coach said,
toughness. We feel we're a tough-ball club, and we show it every night.  
  
Q. Coach, what did it mean to have Lavone seemingly willing you baskets
in the first half and continuing that in the second half?  
COACH BRANNEN: He's dynamic, so his ability to break off the bounds, put it in
the lane helps our offense, helps guys like Drew and Carson. Puts them in a
position to score. He's a great point guard. Lavone has gotten better from the
day he's gotten here in every facet, from his toughness level, to his
consistency level, to his commitment level to his teammates.  
  
When you're like that, you're a joy to coach. I can say that about a lot of
our guys.  
  
Q. Coach, with your team being such a young team, how is this experience
going to benefit you for the next year, two years, three years?  
COACH BRANNEN: It's huge. We become more hunted. We were picked seventh in the
preseason. Didn't have any great expectations going into the year and had a
great year. In order to have success in the postseason, you've got to be there
and get a taste of it. They've got a taste of it. Guys with teams that advance
have been here before and experienced it. We'll take stock in it when we get
back. We've got a tremendous group coming back, and hopefully they'll continue
to buy into what we're doing and continue to be committed to each other as
much as they were this year.  
  
Q. Carson, what changed in the second half? It seemed like you and even
Drew were able to find some seams in the paint and get inside?  
CARSON WILLIAMS: At halftime, Coach just mentioned to me that I didn't seem
like myself on the court. So I think I agreed with him. So in the second half,
I came out with more of an attack and toughness mindset, and that's what made
the difference.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's tough in the immediate aftermath, but you talked
about what this could mean for your team. Can you put a finger on what this
whole experience, the Horizon League tournament, the way you guys played
tonight has meant for Northern Kentucky, for the campus, and for a lot of
students who are believers in Norse Nation now that maybe weren't even as much
of a month or two ago?  
COACH BRANNEN: Our goal when we took over of the program, we had an
opportunity to bring these young men in, guys in the locker room, were to
bring a championship to this community and to do it -- our saying inside our
program is we want to be a championship caliber program comprised of
championship caliber people. We've done it through recruiting, through the way
these guys train themselves.  
  
What it's done is galvanized the community, a community with a huge basketball
community with Xavier, Cincinnati, Kentucky, all teams that have advanced in
the NCAA tournament. They've gotten behind this team.  
  
The league is one of the top mid-major leagues in the country. With that, we
have to continue that momentum. The only way to do that is to continue to get
out, win championships the way we have, continue to recruit and get these
young men in front of our community. They represent Northern Kentucky the
right way. This is prehistorical to do it. Only two teams have done it since
1970.  
  
Q. Lavone, can you describe the experience of going up against De'Aaron
Fox and how you were able to get success against him?  
LAVONE HOLLAND: De'Aaron Fox, he's a good player. But for me, it was just more
just playing my game, playing how I know I can play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.

INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
MICHIGAN - 92, OKLAHOMA STATE - 91  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin right now with an opening statement from Coach
Beilein, and then we'll go to anybody for questions.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Seeing play Sunday, it gave us some good prep time. That prep
time didn't make me feel any better knowing the weapons that we were going to
be facing. If somebody would have ever said that we're going to give up 91 and
we were going to win, I wouldn't have thought that was going to happen.  
  
We had enough firepower to withstand their incredible offensive talent and get
enough points. Just really compliment Oklahoma State. They had a great year.  
  
Really, I didn't know Brad Underwood at all. I have huge respect for who he is
and that program. The Cowboy fans should feel lucky with the direction the
program is going. Really happy for our guys. We had to make shots. Early in
the game, we settled way too much. This is like seven games in a row,
everybody switching every ball screen. We're used to it, but we settled a
little bit.  
  
Their pressure bothered us early. Once we settled in, we were fine. Really
proud of these kids and looking forward to playing the winner of this game
right now.  
  
Q. For Duncan and Zak, what's it like playing with a point guard who is
operating on Derrick's level right now?  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: It's a lot of fun, first and foremost, to know you've got
that rock that you can always count on. He's been so good, and we go as he
goes. So hopefully, he's got more left in the tank.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: He's a heck of a point guard. He makes things easier for all of us
because he attracts so much attention to himself, which frees up everyone
else. He's been on a tear, and I know he's going to continue to do it.  
  
Q. Derrick, you got off to a little bit of a slow start and then
obviously got it going. What changed for you? Also, after you hit a 3 from the
top of the arc to put you up 6, you seemed to be turning toward the crowd,
saying something, what was that?  
DERRICK WALTON: Just playing with a lot of emotion. That's all it really was.
And Coach B said it perfectly, they pressured us and took us out of sets. We
haven't played a team that got up into it in a minute. It's hard to emulate
that in practice. With their athleticism, it's hard to emulate. In the second
half, I settled down, I just wanted to make the right play consistently.  
  
Q. Coach, this question is for you. Oklahoma State seemed to be able to
press you guys and cause some issues allowing maybe the ball to go out to the
3 in the first half. What were they able to do with the press causing your
offensive struggles?  
COACH BEILEIN: They were trying to slow us down and make us change in the
middle. At the same time, we had 19 assists and four turnovers. So it just
took us just a little bit out of our rhythm. And then the shot clock's going
down. And we just, at that point, I just thought there's five, six times,
everybody in the country was saying they got to stop settling, including me
and including them, but we did it.  
  
And we learned from it, and it didn't happen in the second half. So we just --
shooting the ball from 3 is part of our package, and we can do that, but we
can also drive it in there too and throw it in.  
  
But today, we were really good at hitting the open man. Derrick's 11 assists,
overall 19 assists, that's a big number with only four turnovers especially.
We valued every possession.  
  
Q. John, if you could talk about what your team gains from going through
a last minute like that, where you have to hit the free throws, all that
pressure, and you have to face pressure defenses and stop everything that was
involved in that last minute.  
COACH BEILEIN: That's the world we've lived in. You go back to that tremendous
game against Northwestern just two weeks ago, last second game. Nebraska's the
only one that doesn't get there. Nebraska, maybe Illinois has got a good
enough lead.  
  
All the other games, it's been two or three minutes to go. Anybody can win.
For us to execute our press offense to get it inbounds is very difficult. When
they still have four fouls to go and you've got to inbound it four times from
a similar spot, you only have so many inbounds plays. That was close, and we
got it done.  
  
We weren't great with our energy at that. These guys heard about that, but
those are all the things that I think, hopefully, will come to help us in the
road ahead.  
  
Q. Zak, you tied a personal best 16 points for a tournament game. These
games already mean so much given it's one and done. Given you're playing here
at home, does it mean anything to you? Does it add anything to the game like
this?  
ZAK IRVIN: It's always nice being able to come back home, playing in front of
your family and friends. Most importantly, I'm worried about us winning. We
were able do that this afternoon. We've got to continue to play well.  
  
Q. Derrick, when you go through a 1 for 6 first half the way you do and
you come out and hit your first five 3s in the second half, what is it about
your mindset that allows you to completely forget about the last shot and keep
firing away?  
DERRICK WALTON: Just my mindset, I just tap into the fact that I know I've
worked really hard and trust my mechanics for the most part. Halftime, I
talked to one of my good friends on Team Doc, and I changed my shot a couple
times. It's just the mindset and the trust these guys have in me, it makes me
go out and just play much more free just knowing they have a lot of confidence
in me.  
  
Q. For Zak and Coach Beilein both, in a game like this, it seems like
there's pressure on every possession to score. Most basketball games, it's no
big deal. If you don't score today, the other team's on a run because they're
scoring. How much does that change your offense or is it fun to get into a
game like that? You feel like everybody's making it so we can keep making
it?  
ZAK IRVIN: Coach touched on this earlier. It's ability to settle down and get
into a flow and rhythm. We settled too much on offense. Once we relaxed and
were able to play our game, I think it helped us out.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: I continue to say the 30-second clock, that 5 seconds made a
huge difference in who we are. So we find ourselves simplifying things a lot
more. They were taking away some things, running quick hitters or just playing
off ball screen reads. So I think that's the way the game has gone.  
  
I may be -- over that time, I have evolved a lot as a coach, seen 43 years of
a lot of change. We continue to embrace that to be able to play downhill, but
do it with shooters as well. But that's a big part of our game plan, one-on-
one, and guarding one-on-one will have to continue to improve for us, but
we've got to keep working at it.  
  
Q. Derrick, what's it like dealing with Evans? Have you gone against
many point guards that quick?  
DERRICK WALTON: I think he emulated a lot of quickness that we play against
every night in the Big Ten. I think he emulates a lot of guys in the
conference I play against, just quick, downhill guys. The difference between
the Big Ten opponents and their opponents is he has the ball so much. He puts
a lot of pressure on the defense.  
  
I think he's a really good player. But like I said, I think he emulates a lot
of quickness that's in the Big Ten as well.  
  
Q. Coach, regarding Zak, it's been well reported that he's a leader on
this team. How does that transition happen at this level, at this collegiate
level? How does a player go from a freshman in a new circumstance to four
years later being a moral center for this team that could be counted on?  
COACH BEILEIN: We can write a book on this one. This whole time, he's
unflappable. Periods in the sophomore year, he lost his backcourt. The
sophomore's supposed to fill in the blanks. Now the sophomore is one of our
most experienced players.  
  
We learned so much through that. He learned so much from that. What has
happened, what I've seen, he had a year right now where when we weren't
playing well, right, he was not confident in what he was doing.  
  
He was unflappable through it all. All of a sudden now, if you check his
stats, he's shooting about 50 percent overall and from 3 during these last
five games when it really counted. I had several questions about this. When do
you turn to somebody else? I said I'm not turning to anybody else. We've got a
team. Zak Irvin is in there and will take shots because he makes shots. We
have a lot of confidence in him. I wouldn't do that if he hadn't shown extreme
selfless leadership during the entire four years here.  
  
Q. John, you got control with about four minutes left when Oklahoma
State went three or four possessions without scoring. I think they scored
twice in six possessions. Forte missed a couple. Evans missed a drive. Do you
remember that stretch and were you doing anything different or just played
good defense, and they missed?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think when we did force them to miss, if you look at the
numbers, they got offensive rebounds. That was a big thing when they could get
it. It's very difficult when you've got a downhill driver like that, he can
throw anything off the board. The natural rotation is to go to the level of
the ball.  
  
Guy's got a running start to come in. I think that was a huge difference in
the game was their ability to -- those 13 rebounds, I betcha they were -- I
can't say where it was, but I'm sure 20 points easily just going downhill. So
it wasn't any magic.  
  
Now, sometimes, the ball just bounces your way off those rebounds. Maybe
sometimes we do box out a little bit. But overall, we limited their
possessions that we had earlier in the game, early in the half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Phil Forte, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32181)

### [Leyton Hammonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32860)

### [Jawun Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32182)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Phil Forte, Jawun Evans and Leyton Hammonds, the
Oklahoma State student-athletes.  
  
Q. Phil, you played in a lot of NCAA tournaments, but you guys hadn't
won one. How important is it, I know being a senior, you want to win for your
own team. How important is it for OSU to get back in the winning business of
the NCAA tournament?  
PHIL FORTE: Obviously that's your mentality coming in. Being 0-3 is something
in the back of my mind. More importantly, it's about us moving forward, about
our team winning one game and trying to advance.  
  
So we know we have a good game coming up against Michigan, they're very
talented, and we'll definitely have to be dialed in defensively.  
  
Q. Leyton, the balance that Coach Underwood has tried to strike, I know
practices all through the season, kind of a grind to them. Now you get to this
point, how much is he encouraging enjoying the moment while you still get
ready?  
LEYTON HAMMONDS: I mean, he's just trying to let guys know that this is the
best time of the year. This is what we work for in the summer. This is what we
worked for throughout the year and kind of enjoy the moment.  
  
I mean, this is wonderful, playing in the tournament like this. This is the
best college basketball tournament in the country, and it's a business trip,
but at the same time, you've got to have fun with it. This is basketball, the
game we love. Trying to have fun with it, but also be locked in.  
  
Q. Juwan, when you play a team that you don't know a lot about them, you
just watch them on TV. How much unknown is there even after the scouting
report in terms of who they might match with who and who you guys want to
match up with, those kinds of things?  
JAWUN EVANS: It's something you've got to go in the game prepared for. They
might have to change up some of their plays and stuff like that. So you've got
to go in and prepare for it, look for the worst, stuff like that, just got to
go out and play basketball.  
  
Q. Phil, I think it's fair to say most of the national attention has
kind of been on Michigan. Do you guys feel forgotten at all or paid any
attention to that?  
PHIL FORTE: Rightfully so. The circumstances they had to go through, they've
handled it very well and kind of made it a national story. The way they played
in the Big Ten tournament, they're one of the hottest teams in the country, so
coming in, we just have to try to focus in on our game plan and just take it
four minutes at a time and really try to focus in on what the coaches are
telling us.  
  
Q. Leyton, no matter where you guys win, zero games or six games in this
tournament, your career is about finished. How important is your legacy that
you and Phil and the veterans have left behind? How important is that to
you?  
LEYTON HAMMONDS: It means the world to me because, I mean, I'm trying to teach
the freshmen that it's not just about basketball in college. You've got to
learn how to become a man. I feel like Coach Underwood did a good job
predicating that to us and just helping me feel and Phil just try to get in
those guys' heads that regardless of what goes on, on and off the court,
you've still got to wake up every day and be a man and live throughout your
actions.  
  
So just trying to leave my legacy, being a good person on and off the court
and just trying to be a man.  
  
Q. Phil, back to the other point. Is being an underdog kind of
overlooked? Are you comfortable with that role?  
PHIL FORTE: We've been in that situation before, playing in the Big 12. We
play a lot of good teams. So it's not anything we're really worried about.
It's more just us going out there and playing the game that we're capable of
playing and making sure we go out and execute the game plan that the coaches
draw up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined Coach Underwood. Coach Underwood, if you'd
like to make a general statement and we'll open it up for questions.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: We're excited to be here. There is nothing more exciting than
March Madness and being with a group of guys that are extremely resilient.
They're very, very high character young men. I couldn't be prouder to be here
with them in terms of this season has been an interesting one in terms of it's
had some ups and downs.  
  
We've got a great opponent in Michigan, who obviously is coming off a
tremendous high, winning their Big Ten championship and look forward to the
opportunity and relish the challenge. The NCAA tournament is very special to
me, and I look forward to what should be two very good teams going to battle
tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Jawun, this is obviously your first taste of this. What are your
emotions as you've gotten ready for tomorrow? Has it been hard to kind of keep
yourself from getting too excited?  
JAWUN EVANS: No, not really. I just take it as just another game, you know,
just coming out here, just having fun, just playing my game. I'm glad to have
another game with my teammates.  
  
Q. Jawun, similar to what I asked Phil and Leyton, what would a victory
do not just for your team but for the overall program at Oklahoma State
basketball?  
JAWUN EVANS: It would be a great victory for us. Of the times we have been
here, we fell short. I feel like a victory will keep us going, keep us playing
hard for the next seasons.  
  
Q. Coach Underwood, you mentioned the other night on your teleconference
about how well Juwan is playing and all that stuff. Now that you've had a
chance to look at what Derrick Walton is doing, have you seen any similarities
between the two or are they different players?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I think they do it in a little bit of a different manner, but
it's hard to argue with his numbers. Of late, I mean, he's 20 points per game
in the Big Ten tournament. He's doing it in just about every fashion,
transition. He's doing it in the half core. He's hit jump shots. He's
finishing at the rim. Juwan does all these things.  
  
I've said this, and I believe this, Jawun makes his teammates better. That's
the definition of a great player. Their guy does the same thing. And, I mean,
he makes his teammates better. He is the driving force for their team, and
he's got great leadership skills. That's been very evident, watching him on
film, getting in guys' faces when he needs to and challenge them and pat them
on the butt when they need it. Sign of a very good player.  
  
Q. Coach Underwood, the teams have taken different approach to guarding
the pick-and-pop game. Do you think that they remind you of anyone and what is
the risk/reward of switching every screen with them. What's the risk/reward of
and the conditions of trying to do something like that?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: They do a tremendous job of reading whatever you do. I think
whatever way you choose to guard them, it's to a certain extent, you pick your
poison. Teams that have switched can give up rebounds. Teams that don't force
you into rotations and you're talking about four guys or five guys on the
perimeter that have great spacing.  
  
That's what makes what they do so difficult is John does an incredible job of
spacing the floor. They force you an extra step or two because they can shoot
it, and then you've got a guy like Irvin who is a very good driver. So you
pick your poison with whichever you choose, and you've got to make it
difficult and not allow them to be as comfortable as they want to be, and then
you've got to contest shots.  
  
Q. Brad, I asked your players something similar. OSU's only got one NCAA
tournament victory since Eddie Sutton's last year. How important is it not
just to get here but to start winning again in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I think we have a long history at Oklahoma State of success
in the NCAA tournament. And obviously, Coach Sutton's Final four runs, you go
back a little further into the Coach Iba's time and winning national
championships. This should not be a foreign place for Oklahoma State
basketball. The history of our program proves that out.  
  
I think, at different times, programs go through little lapses or whatever it
may be, but we're excited to be here. I think you go into every game with the
opportunity to win it. I think no matter whether you have a 16 seed or number
16 by your name or have a ten like we do, you have a great opportunity in
today's basketball world, and I'll look back to my team last year.  
  
We were a 14 and beat a three. It's a great opportunity. And Oklahoma State
belongs in the tournament and we should be happy for us, not something that
just happens every so often.  
  
Q. Phil, I remember seeing you underneath the arena after the game in
Omaha a couple years ago, and obviously, a frustrating time for you. You look
back on that time and think about what was going through your mind at that
time about whether that might have been it, if you weren't -- because you
weren't sure about what was going to happen after that. Do you remember that
time?  
PHIL FORTE: Yeah. You know, any time you lose in the NCAA tournament, it's
your last game of the season so you always remember that moment very well. I
think the hardest part is it's the last time we'll ever play with that
specific group of guys, that specific team. That's the end.  
  
So this has been a great ride. I don't know if I've ever enjoyed playing with
a group of guys as much as I have with this group this year. I think it's just
about playing one more game with this specific group and these guys, these
teammates. That's what's motivating us to win this game.  
  
Q. Jawun, along the same lines of what I asked Coach before, how much do
you know about Derrick Walton? Do you know him at all? From what you've been
able to watch on tape, are you similar? How do you think your guys' games
compare?  
JAWUN EVANS: Like Coach said, he gets his teammates involved. He goes to the
high guy. If he needs to score, he scores when he's needed. So we have similar
games also. So, I mean, I don't know him like personally.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Thanks, fellas.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Donovan Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32043)

### [Deng Adel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32872)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from Coach Pitino and then
take questions from the student-athletes. When we're done with them, we'll
dismiss them and go back to the coach.  
  
COACH PITINO: We're excited to be in Indianapolis. It's a short trip for us. I
know our fans will be excited about it. This is a great venue for college
basketball, and we're super pumped to be in the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Donovan, can you count how many different defenses you guys have
played during the course of the season and how many of those you feel
confident in?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: There are a lot. There are a lot of different forms of it, I
should say. They're all pretty much strictly zone, but there's different forms
of it. I couldn't really count on my hand, but there's definitely large
amount, surplus of defenses we've had and we've used throughout the entire
year.  
  
Q. Donovan and Deng, since you lost in the ACC tournament in Brooklyn,
what have practices been like and what have been the focus?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: We looked at that loss, and there were many times where we
just were complacent when we got the lead, kind of let up. We fouled a little
bit. So in practice, we came back and just came out with tremendous energy.
Deng led a bunch of practices with his energy and the way he talked and Mangok
and guys who have been there. Coach is always on us talking on defense, and
defenses wins championships. And that's been the main focus throughout the
practices.  
  
DENG ADEL: For us, it showed us the urgency we have to play with because we
went up there for one game and had to go back home. We kind of felt how bad it
felt to lose in the first round and go home. Approaching practices, we just
came with a lot of energy, just keying in on the little stuff that lost us the
game and just listened to Coach.  
  
Q. Deng, when you have team that has so many guys who shoot the three
well, what are the keys to defending that, not giving them open looks?  
DENG ADEL: I think just playing with hot hands and taking away their attempt,
we know they're a great shooting team. But we have a lot of size and length,
and we can switch on a lot of different occasions, and we just have to make
sure we play with a lot of energy and on the catches, be there on the catch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to wait for Coach. We'll continue with the student-
athletes and come back to Coach.  
  
Q. How is the urgency different when you're playing in elimination games
than during regular season? Do you feel any differently? Do you prepare any
differently?  
DENG ADEL: Well, if you lose, that's it. In the regular season, you always
have another game you can bounce back off. If you lose, that's it. We're going
back to workouts.  
  
It's going to be tough for our guys, especially the seniors, guys like Tony
Hicks at the tournament level, it hurts for them. We make sure we go out there
and just play for our brothers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Okay, guys, you're dismissed.  
  
Now for Coach Pitino.  
  
Q. Rick, Ray Harper was in here earlier and said that you saw more
defenses from his team than he's seen. I think his exact quote was he's seen
some that I don't even know we do.  
He also credited you with being -- having the ability to figure things out
like no one else.  
  
What is it about your approach to postseason, particularly, that has made
you so successful, even a higher winning percentage than regular season?  
  
COACH PITINO: Well, we try to build to this point all season. As I've stated
many times to the Louisville media, we started out a very inexperienced
basketball team. We had our leading scorer coming back was nine points a game
in Quentin Snider. This is the most difficult team I've coached since being a
head coach in terms of teaching fundamentals and all the nuances that make a
defense successful or an offense successful.  
  
The great thing about these guys, they're so willing to learn. We kept getting
better week by week. In the last ten days, I've seen significant improvement.
That's what you want going into the tournament is you want to build up to
improvement going into March.  
  
I think these guys are ready for the challenge. We didn't get too down about
the Duke loss. We just worked on the things we needed to work on.  
  
Sometimes it's a good lesson because you're so fired up to go to Brooklyn, and
all of a sudden, it's over. You're returning home. We wanted to stay an extra
day and practice and experience New York a little bit, and we just headed back
and didn't get a chance to do that.  
  
So it is a good experience when you lose, and you have that feeling of
emptiness.  
  
Q. Rick, you guys have a much better seed, obviously. How do you try to
make sure your guys have the proper urgency, the proper motivation to beat a
team you're a big favorite against?  
COACH PITINO: We don't pay any attention to lines or seeds. We just pay
attention to what the other team runs, how to stop it, where they may be
vulnerable for us to score.  
  
We know enough -- you know, this year, a long, long time ago, and I took his
advice, God rest his soul,  
  
Howard Gar-Finkel said to me, when I just became a young head coach, he said,
let me tell you what Everett Case used to say when you have an inexperienced
team. I interrupted him and said who is Everett Case? He said I was a birddog
for him back in the day at NC State. He said take an inexperienced team, put
the toughest schedule you can muster to them, and you'll know come March if
you have a good team, if they survived that schedule.  
  
We played the number one ranked schedule in that year and the kids have
survived and made that competition, made us better, but along the way, we gave
the same effort with every single opponent we have played. I think the guys
have tremendous respect for Jacks State. We don't talk about where they're
seeded. We just talk about what they do well.  
  
As a coaching staff, we have great respect for what Ray does. I've coached
against him many times, and they're very sound defensively, very sound
offensively. And they're shooting the ball great, much better than at any
point in the season the last four games.  
  
Q. Coach, you have five assistants in this tournament with teams. Is
Mike Balado ready to take the next step? His name's been mentioned with
Arkansas State. Is it fair to say he's ready to make the jump?  
COACH PITINO: I have a philosophy with assistant coaches. I've had it for a
long time. I had it with Hubie Brown when I worked with him. Back then, it was
one assistant on the bench and Richie Adubato was faxing me all the plays of
the other team. Every practice, Hubie challenged me to act like a head coach.
And every day, he'd come to me and say what do you have for me today. He
wanted innovative ideas, new things to come up with, new plays. He wanted new
ideas and God forbid if you didn't have an idea behind that.  
  
I do the same thing with Ralph Willard, Kevin Willard, Mik Cronin, Tubby
Smith, now Kevin Keatts. I'm leaving out Reggie Theus. I said Mik. All these
guys, I challenge them to act like a head coach, bring new ideas every single
day.  
  
Even with my son, I never forget this, we were getting ready to play Florida,
and he said, dad, is it okay if somebody takes a scout before that game? He
said, my eyes are bloodshot. I need to focus in on that. I said get Visine.
You're doing every scout and don't say it again.  
  
I was so tough on my son to do every single scout, which I've never done
before, the same way Hubie was on me. I think it pays off because Mike Balado
right now is at the same level as all the guys I just mentioned because he
came in a very hungry, enthusiastic, hard working coach, and now he's learned
a certain point to take over his own job.  
  
He's more than ready. I just want him to make sure -- I don't want him to
leave. I want him to stay, same thing with Kenny and David. I want to make
sure he takes the right job because certain guys sometimes take the wrong job.  
  
It's a long-winded answer.  
  
Q. Rick, you guys missed out on this last year. What's it like to be
back?  
COACH PITINO: It's always my favorite time of year. When I was in the pros, I
missed it terribly. All the guys on the bus in the pros were talking about
what team they're picking. It's just an exciting time of year.  
  
You realize it's Russian Roulette, anybody can beat you on a given night. You
don't shoot well. They shoot great. You can get beat.  
  
It's not always the best team because it's not a series, so it's a lot of fun.
So many prognosticators picking. My wife texted me this morning and said this
person's picking you to go to this, this person -- I said yeah, I just worked
out at the Y, and somebody was telling me we were going to go far. That guy at
the Y is every bit as good as the people you just mentioned.  
  
So everybody's got an opinion. Nobody's ever right. Nobody has that bracket. I
think ESPN's up to ten million brackets right now, and I always tell a funny
story, because when I was in the pros, I did a horrible job with the bracket.
We had a neighborhood in New York, everybody filled out their brackets and
this guy, Angelo, won the bracket because Angelo picked Valpraiso to go far
because you get so many points to go with your seed. He was from Italy. He
thought Valpraiso was an Italian university. That was when Drew was making
those shots. It's a matter of luck. It's a lot of fun.  
  
It's the most fun time because Super Bowl is very big in our country, but it's
two teams. If you're not a fan of those two teams, you want to tune in and
watch it, but there are so many fans of every school waiting to be Cinderella,
waiting to get to the Final four. To me, it's just a magical time.  
  
Mascots, that's a good way too.  
  
Q. Rick, when you come out of a long conference season, do you change
your routine, your approach when you have only a few days to prepare for an
unfamiliar foe?  
COACH PITINO: We don't change our approach to scouting, but we change our
approach to how we address the game. And that's something between our team and
coaching staff, the way we approach it. But we don't change in terms of
scouting and preparation and what we're going to do.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
THE MODERATOR: Risk of overload if we give them too much.  
  
COACH PITINO: With this team, you don't want to give them too much. This is a
team that worked very hard, but you don't want to give them too much. It's not
their strength.  
  
Q. Coach, just big news out of the Big Ten, Tom Crean fired earlier
today. Your reaction to this time of year with the hirings and firings and how
hard it is to win in college basketball.  
COACH PITINO: It's the thing I don't like about the business when you see
someone who works as hard as Tom get fired. I thought when I took over
University of Kentucky, it was as low as it could possibly get in every aspect
until Tom Crean took over Indiana was even lower. We were on probation for two
years, but Tom Crean took over a team that couldn't win, period. He took it
from the bottom to winning a couple of conference championships.  
  
The good thing about it is everybody in our business knows that Tom is an
outstanding teacher, coach, workaholic, and he'll land on his feet. So it's
not always that way for other coaches. So Tom has done a great job at Indiana.
They were probably both ready for a change, and Tom will land on his feet and
be better than ever.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you have the number one strength of schedule.
Who is the best team you played?  
COACH PITINO: Well, interesting enough, the most difficult team for us is
Virginia. And I was having lengthy conversations with Kevin Keatts, he called
me and said I need to know how to play Virginia. I said call Notre Dame, don't
call me.  
  
But we talked at length about how we should beat Virginia. Virginia's tough
for us because you have to beat them off the bounce. You can't run offenses
necessarily. The most physically talented team, there's a lot of them. You
name, Kentucky, Indiana was great before they had all the injuries. Kentucky
is terrific. Baylor is terrific. Wichita State is terrific. We played them.
Purdue is terrific. Played them. Duke and Carolina and Virginia and Notre
Dame.  
  
I can't tell you -- Virginia's the best defensive team, Notre Dame and Duke
are the best offensive team. Carolina is the best break team, best rebounding
team. So they have so much talent that it depends on match-ups. Match-ups are
a big deal in the NCAA.  
  
Q. Rick, I'm not trying to draw parallels between Louisville and
Syracuse. They're on postseason ban, go to the Final Four. Postseason ban,
obviously you're in a better position. Talking about it being a magical time,
what did you miss the most about not participating a year ago?  
COACH PITINO: Well, it happened late, so we didn't anticipate it, all the
penalties. We played this year without two scholarships, basketball players.
It's made our backcourt really -- our backcourt lacks depth.  
  
One of the difficult things about the game against Duke is Snider and Donovan
were taken out of the game because of phantom fouls, like Barry from North
Carolina was taken out with a phantom foul. Those things happen both ways,
against you and for you.  
  
We don't have depth, but the difficult thing about last year was our culture
as a basketball team, especially in the humility department, was changed
tremendously by Damion Lee and Trey Lewis. That's what hurts. Those guys
transferred to Louisville to play in the NCAA tournament, and they never got a
chance to play.  
  
But they did change the culture of our basketball team becoming a very humble
group.  
  
Q. Rick, Tim alluded to your postseason record. Aside from talent, is
there one thing in particular in your experience that you feel like a team has
to have to do well in this tournament?  
COACH PITINO: Well, different teams that you coach, when I coached the '96
team at Kentucky, the most important thing was to just keep them grounded and
humble because I felt the only way we could lose with that team was to beat
themselves.  
  
With the 2013 team that won a championship, I felt we had to confuse people
with our defenses. So every team brings different things to the table. This
team is far different than any team I've coached.  
  
And the thing I'm trying to do with this basketball team is get them relaxed,
get them to have fun because there's very few of these guys who have competed
in the tournament. Though the schedule has prepared us for the competition,
suddenly they have the media around, they're talking constantly, they're
looking at -- they turn on ESPN and everybody has an opinion.  
  
So the time is different for these guys, and they're not used to it. We went
to a Final Four in '12, and those guys, like Villanova is today, are so hungry
to get back because they tasted that in their mouth. This team hasn't tasted
that yet. It will be interesting to see how they respond tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't know if you've gotten to know John Brannen at all, but
up at Northern Kentucky, maybe from afar, taking a first-year eligible
program, nine wins a year ago, to the tournament this year, again, I'm not
sure if you know him, remember him playing against your '96 team under Billy,
but just thoughts on the job he does or how difficult that is.  
COACH PITINO: Enjoy him. He'll be gone if he gets one win. No, I'm kidding.  
  
You know, it's not easy. It's just the same as Grand Canyon's going through
now. It's not easy to build a program that way, and I'm really impressed with
what he's done. It's exciting to see for Northern Kentucky.  
  
It must be really exciting for them to be playing the University of Kentucky
in some forms, but it's a great tribute to those guys. They're going to get a
big taste of the NCAA tournament, play against one of the premiere, storied
traditions in all of basketball. They're from the same state. It's going to be
very exciting for them. He's done a fabulous job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Dayton. We'll have an opening statement
from Coach and then take questions for the players. Coach?  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: First, it's great to be back. For these guys, their fourth year
in a row. To be in Indy and to play in this facility with the other teams that
are participating here is really, really exciting. We're really excited to get
started. Wichita State is a fantastic team, and we have our work cut out for
us. But at this time of year, I think everybody pretty much anticipates
everything being hard earned.  
  
We prepared hard, and we're excited to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Scooch, do you feel like you guys, after a long grind all season, an
A10 tournament and now coming here, is this a chance to hit the reset
button?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Yeah, for sure. This is one of our goals we wanted to
accomplish coming into the season and just make it this far is a blessing. We
want to put it all out there on the court starting tomorrow night.  
  
Q. For any of the players, the past experience you've had playing in the
NCAA tournament, how do you think that can help?  
KENDALL POLLARD: Experience in the NCAA tournament is terrific to have. All of
us have played in the tournament, and we're going to try to go out there and
share some of our leadership with our teammates.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just being strong-minded with the guys and being together I
think will go a long way. All of us here have won games in the NCAA
tournament, and we know what it takes to win. So just having that, I think
we'll be fine.  
  
CHARLES COOKE: Just as Scooch said, knowing what it takes to win this time of
year. It's tough to win games, so you've got to go out there and play hard and
do what we do best and do what we've done all year.  
  
KYLE DAVIS: I think just being able to lead the team. We have experience from
the upperclassmen just teaching -- the underclassmen stepping up and being
ready to play in big-time moments.  
  
Q. Scoochie and Kendall, how do some of the wars you had with Rhode
Island and other teams in your league prepare you for the battle you might
have with Wichita State?  
KENDALL POLLARD: Those two teams you mentioned, they're very physical. They
rebound the ball, and Wichita State is the same way. So we'll go in there and
be tough-minded and rebound the ball, roll it up with them.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just watching film of Wichita State, you play two teams like
Rhode Island and VCU, mix them together, a team like Wichita State, being
battle tested throughout the conference, playing the teams they play gets them
prepared as well.  
  
Q. For all the guys and you too, Arch, what was your first memory as a
kid watching an NCAA tournament game and saying, wow, I want to do that some
day?  
KYLE DAVIS: To be honest, I don't have no memory, you know. I really wasn't
thinking about it. But when we first stepped on the campus, me, Scooch and
Kendall, our dream was to get to the NCAA tournament, and we did our freshman
year, and look at us now three years later.  
  
CHARLES COOKE: I know for me, definitely, always watching basketball, seeing
some of the best college players come in and win games and do big things, it's
definitely a special moment, and it's a blessing to get here.  
  
We're just trying to capitalize and do the best we can.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just going through all these years, watching basketball all my
life, it's been a dream of mine just to play on this stage, and I don't want
to take it for granted. It's not one specific memory that I have, but these
memories I do have the past few years have been real good ones.  
  
KENDALL POLLARD: For me, I think I was watching a tournament game, Marquette.
I used to follow Dwyane Wade when I was younger. I think they went to the
Final Four that year. That's the only memory -- that was my first memory, NCAA
tournament.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: There's a lot of memories. Been watching a lot longer than
these guys have, but I think Duke/Kentucky with Laettner's last shot, I can
remember the whole game, sitting down, watching it at home. That type of
environment, that type of feeling, you want to be a part of that.  
  
Q. Kyle and Scoochie, if you could, Wichita State's 3-point shooting,
what kind of challenges does that present? Is there maybe a team you've played
throughout the year that is kind of similar in that aspect?  
KYLE DAVIS: We did a lot of scouting and 3-point is a challenge for us this
game. We've worked on it hard all year and defended a lot of teams that had
good 3-point percentages, and we know what we have to do to get the job done.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: I'm not sure there's a team I can think of that reminds me of
Wichita State in terms of 3-point shooting. But I know if we do what we have
to do, we'll be right there to win the game.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about Wichita State's seeding. Has that
added a little bit of a chip to your guys' shoulder at all?  
KENDALL POLLARD: No, not at all. The seeding, it is what it is. And they're a
good team. We're a good team. So we're just going to go out there and play. It
don't matter about the seeding.  
  
Q. Dayton fans travel well. How aware are you guys of a crowd at either
an away game or a neutral site when the Dayton fans are there?  
CHARLES COOKE: Definitely, you know, when Dayton fans come to the game, you
see nothing but red when you look around the stands, and Dayton fans really
travel well. They give us a big boost at home. They give us a big boost on the
road. Neutral site, so it's a great thing to have Dayton fans at the game,
whether you're up or you're down. For a home game, they definitely give you a
boost. I'm looking forward to seeing all the Dayton fans at the game for sure.  
  
KYLE DAVIS: Flyer faithful have always been supporting us since day one and
especially in the NCAA tournament, so I expect them to be out here, full-
fledged Dayton colors rooting us on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas.  
  
We'll continue for Coach.  
  
Q. Archie, one of the challenges of being an accomplished coach is your
name gets attached to some of the openings that are out there. Illinois is
open. Indiana opened today. How do you handle that, the buzz of being attached
to some of those things?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I'm not attached to any of that. I think everybody else
attaches me to them. I think it speaks volumes about how we do things at
Dayton. That's the only thing I concern myself with.  
  
Growing up as a player, we were taught to eliminate noise and distractions and
bring your best to the floor every day and sort of treat that with our players
the same way. It wouldn't be right as a coach if you were thinking about
anything other than them. That's all I really concern myself with.  
  
Q. What challenges does Shaquille Morris present to your team?  
ARCHIE MILLER: A lot. A lot. He's a terrific player. When you look at his
points and rebounds per minute played, I'm not sure there's a guy that's been
more effective in his time on the court.  
  
They're so deep that if he played on another team, he'd probably be getting
close to 20 a game. Because they're so deep and they're so spread out with
their minutes, he doesn't have the numbers, but he would. He does a great job
of, obviously, establishing himself in positioning.  
  
He's a great offensive rebounder, and he's in a system and a style with
terrific -- a terrific scheme around him where you can't really just load up
and try to put all your eggs in one basket. So he's going to present big
challenges, as the rest of their players are.  
  
There's a reason they've won 30 games. He's a big reason why, and I think
he'll be a big focal point of the game when he's in because he's so efficient,
so effective. And with our size, the way we've done things, they have the gift
of a little bit in terms of being able to really work around him.  
  
So we're going to have to be -- at the end of the day, we're going to have to
be very tough-minded. We're going to have to be as disciplined as we can, and
we're going to have to work very hard early in possessions to try to make sure
he doesn't get everything as easy as he would. It's a difficult challenge.
It's a difficult challenge for any team.  
  
Q. Coach, when you saw the draw, how much of the concern about Wichita
State was their depth?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Their depth is as good as any team in the country, and it's
evolved through the course of the season. I think they've done a really great
job of changing things from November to December and then into January. And
now I think they've figured it out, what rotations and lineups work best.  
  
They have a lot of different guys to beat you. There's not one guy in the game
that can't have a major impact in the game, whether it's scoring or rebounding
or obviously defending the way that they do.  
  
I think the overall depth, their ability to stay out of foul trouble, they
don't really get bothered by those things. So it's a unique team to play
against.  
  
Typically, we're a team that gets fouled a lot. Being able to get teams in
foul trouble is something that's important. They can sort of withstand a lot
of that stuff and keep coming with very, very good players and bodies. So
their depth is probably something that we haven't seen that type of team in
the past, just the ability to keep coming bodies at you.  
  
I think that's probably a little bit why they're so successful, they really
don't take the foot off the pedal. They have so many guys coming in and out at
the same level. That overall, over 40 minutes, is one of the reasons I think
they are so dominant in terms of being able to really extend leads late in
games or take an eight-point game and bang it to 20, is just because of the
overall firepower that just keeps coming.  
  
It's probably the most impressive trait of their team is how they've been able
to navigate that amount of bodies to be that effective over the course of the
year.  
  
Q. Archie, have you talked to Sean about last year's Wichita State game
in the NCAA tournament? Did he give you any advice?  
ARCHIE MILLER: He doesn't have any advice, none. He didn't have any advice
after that game. I watched the game, for part of it anyway. I haven't seen a
team do that to one of Sean's teams maybe ever. I think that was the most
impressive thing about it.  
  
I've been following Wichita State as a head coach since I got the job. I
thinks my second year when we were really getting ready to get started and
trying to get our feet on the ground, I believe that was their run to the
Final Four. I watched them go through, I believe, Gonzaga at the time who was
a 1 seed, beat Ohio State, if I'm not mistaken in that Elite Eight to go to
the Final Four. They kind of motivated me.  
  
They motivated you to say to yourself, like, wow, if those guys can be that
tough, they can play that hard, they can have that type of culture, that's
something that you have to really rely on and say if we can create something
like that, maybe we can get there.  
  
I think I just told Coach Marshall when I saw him a couple minutes ago, I
mean, kind of look at Wichita State as a program that gives a lot of places
like ours the faith that they can play with anyone. They can beat anyone. And
I think their game last year was great evidence against Arizona that they
don't really care who they're playing.  
  
We try to be the same way. I think being here for our fourth year, there's a
reason why.  
  
Q. Archie, you and Gregg share a similar dilemma in that Power Five
schools aren't exactly excited to face you in a nonconference season. What's
the solution to that, to make it easier for schools like yours and Wichita
State to get those opportunities in a nonconference season?  
ARCHIE MILLER: That's not easy. One, I would say that our home venue and their
home venue, very similar places that there's no advantage in many ways for
those schools to come and play us in home at homes, okay.  
  
Secondly, I'm sure Coach Marshall and myself would also -- we started a lot of
series on the road to go get those type of games. And whether you're in an
exempt event like they were in the Bahamas or we were in Anaheim this year or
Orlando together a year ago, you're trying to find ways to put yourselves,
whether it be neutral situations where you can get them on one-shot deals or
tournaments or send yourself on the road a few times and maybe get one back in
return.  
  
But it's difficult. It's difficult. I think it's getting more difficult. As
the years go by here within one year, 2 years or 3 years, it could become
almost impossible because as Power conference teams continue to do their
leagues and look at their leagues, they're going to play 20 games in a
conference season.  
  
Then the next thing you know, all Power Fives will be playing 20 games in the
conference season. If you're in the ACC and you're playing 20 regular season
conference games and you're in an exempt event and you've got a Big Ten
challenge game, where is that game coming from?  
  
It's a unique challenge. I'm at a great place with a great administration.
We're on the front end of things trying to be creative as we can. I think
being able to be in situations where we play neutral site games or going on
the road a couple times maybe too many, I think doesn't matter.  
  
You just have to be able to put yourself in those situations. I think our
leagues are also key to the future, and I think the Atlantic Ten has done a
nice job of being a multiple team league bid during the time we've been there,
whether it's been 6, 5, 4, 3. I don't think that will change. We have
opportunities in our league with good quality opponents as well.  
  
Scheduling is always hard. I think it continues to get harder and harder,
though.  
  
Q. If you would, would you describe just how basketball was ingrained in
you growing up in a basketball family?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah. I mean, I've known nothing else. I think Sean's ten years
older than me, so it wasn't like we have this sibling rivalry type of thing,
being that he's ten years older than me and I was the tagalong for a long
time.  
  
Being a tagalong at the age of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 years old, when you're able
to watch halftime performances or All-American camps, through him growing up
and then obviously when he went to college, at that point in time, I was
starting to get into middle school and junior high. That's when basketball
became bigger than life, watching him play at Pitt and my dad being my high
school coach all the way through and having an opportunity to play college
basketball.  
  
Since I can remember, basketball has been a part of the daily routine. And I
guess some guys are born into houses with doctors, lawyers, whatever it may
be. Our conversations were very simple. It was about getting better. It was
about competing. It was about learning how to be a great player and all those
conversations have probably turned us into coaches without us really realizing
it.  
  
It was a unique house to be a part of. I think if you look right now, in 2017,
look at some of the successes that we've had post-playing career, you can
really attribute a lot of that to growing up in the house that I was in.  
  
Q. Coach, with guys like Scoochie and Kyle and Kendall that have so much
game experience under their belt, what does it do for you as a coach just to
have that luxury of guys that have that much experience?  
ARCHIE MILLER: You don't panic as much in tough situations. I think what comes
with those guys' experience, I think a lot of times what people attribute it
to is the big wins and all that.  
  
I don't think that I look at it as all the glory moments. I've watched these
guys grow up. I've watched them fight. Most of our best moments, we haven't
been the prettiest of games. You're down with 30-some seconds to go or you hit
a buzzer shot at eight seconds.  
  
I just remember all the plays they were involved in throughout the course of
the battle. You watch a guy like Scooch and watch his maturation, how good he
is at the end of the games for us.  
  
You watch guys like Kyle and Kendall, being a part of at an amazing run with
four to go. Those are the things I remember the most. It gives you as a coach
confidence that as you walk into that environment tomorrow, you hope it's not
too big. At the same time, you know throughout the course of their career, if
you just let it happen and keep going with them, they'll find ways to keep you
right there.  
  
We talked a lot about it last night. There's a lot of people that go back on
those guys' careers or our tenure together, and they think about some of the
tournament runs and all that stuff.  
  
If you really start to show some of the clips of the games that they've been
involved with, they have been really hard-fought, ugly, find a way type of
moments that they've had to come through. It hasn't been like all this
Hollywood stuff.  
  
I think as you look at them, you appreciate the fact how much they've been
through. You appreciate how much they've given of themselves in terms of their
effort. But they really are about winning too, and I think that's the thing
I'll remember most about them.  
  
You feel confident, not that you ever feel good, but you feel confident at
some point in time that they'll make something happen for you.  
  
Q. I'm curious, when the entire bracket came out and the draw came out
for you, were you able to take a quick look at what John Brannen was able to
do at Northern Kentucky? I'm sure you know him a little bit from scouting
Alabama years ago when he was on that staff. Just any thoughts on him or maybe
what you've seen out of a first-year eligible program to get to this point?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Number one, John did a fantastic job this past season. Where he
started at, where they're at right now is a credit to him, his staff, and what
they've been able to establish. Got to know John a little bit through our
Alabama competing days when he was there.  
  
Then when he was named the head coach at Northern Kentucky, being right down
the road, stayed in communication with him pretty well. When he won the
conference tournament, I texted him right after the game, just
congratulations, man. What an awesome, awesome opportunity.  
  
He's done a terrific job. It's not easy to go to a place like Northern
Kentucky right off the bat, especially in the Horizon, which is a very tough
league. They've taken advantage sort of their draw.  
  
You can tell even last year when they were playing, he had an identity about
him. They had a system. They knew what they were doing. This year just carried
right over. He did about as good of a job with a team this season as any coach
in college basketball.  
  
The fact that they're in the tournament right now, I mean, I think that speaks
volumes.  
  
Q. Coach, just read recently that you -- before every game, you like to
put a number 5 up in the top corner of the whiteboard there. I was wondering
why, what that means to you?  
ARCHIE MILLER: If you're in our locker room and you're a part of our program,
you sort of can look each other in the eye and probably saw all of us at our
worst moment, whether that would be looking at me as a player or looking at a
player as a coach or looking at a coach to a coach.  
  
Probably the worst moments that any of us have experienced together, we kind
of saw the worst of one another. I think that being here today, win or lose
the game, for that room to be sitting here today after May 12, many cases, a
lot of places wouldn't pick themselves back up.  
  
I put that number up on the board for one reason. Steve was an interesting
guy. He had a big impact on a lot of people, and he's sort of in the locker
room. He was the locker room. In many ways when you're going through scouting
reports and preparing for games, you want to win, you want to lose. Every once
in a while if you think back, take a deep step and say, wow, where were we?
Imagine if that wouldn't have happened? Or nothing's really guaranteed if I
leave this locker room right now. I don't know who's going to do what or
what's going to happen.  
  
So you put it up there as a perspective for everybody to look up there, see
it, and let's go out and have a good time. I hope that I can write that number
up there for a long time. But, in particular, this group has been affected by
it the most.  
  
You don't ever want to think about you move on from something like that, but
you do. But at the same time, I think you have to take a deep breath every
once in a while and just say hey, man, everything's okay right now. Things are
good, regardless of how you feel, regardless if the game didn't go real well
or it did go well.  
  
You've got to take it day to day and do things together. That's the thing I'm
probably most proud about this group is it was a hard road to get up off the
ground, a lot harder than I ever anticipated, not just for our players, but
our staff personally. And to be able to be here now, that's a good thing for a
lot of people. It helped us.  
  
Steve was a big impression on a lot of these guys. They won't forget him for
the rest of their lives.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Archie.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Thank you.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Wichita State with us. We're going to take an opening
statement from Coach Marshall, and then we'll go to the players. Gregg?  
  
COACH MARSHALL: We are glad to be here. We feel like we're playing well, and
we know we have a tremendous challenge in front of us, starting tomorrow
evening with Dayton. I've enjoyed coaching these guys tremendously all year.
It's been a really fun season for us as we've watched this team blossom and
mature and develop right in front of our very eyes.  
  
So we're excited, again, with the opportunity. We're glad it warmed up a
little bit today. It was pretty cold when we got in last night, but it's a
beautiful day, and we're ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Conner and Zach, do you guys feel disrespected by the seed? What was
your reaction when you found you were a ten?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: We were a little surprised, but we knew we'd have to play
good teams all tournament, so we're excited for the task at hand, and
hopefully we can come out and play well. Like I said, we knew we were going to
have to play a good team every round of this tournament.  
  
ZACH BROWN: Like Conner said, we were surprised, but the committee make the
seeding for a reason. The only thing we can do is come out and play and do
what we do.  
  
Q. Markis, what do you think of Dayton? What challenges do you think
they bring to your guys?  
MARKIS McDUFFIE: Dayton is a great team. They push the ball well in
transition, and they're very athletic. They're in the A10, a great conference.
They play a lot of great teams, a lot of tough teams. We're just going to have
to come out and play tough in order to win.  
  
Q. Zach, what have you seen in the development and growth of Shaquille
Morris? You've been with him now for awhile. How far has he come as a
player?  
ZACH BROWN: It's actually pretty amazing to see the transition from freshman
year to all the way to the product you see now, just his body, his mindset.
I'd say his position has gotten a whole lot better, a whole lot more active on
defense, being more aggressive towards the rim instead of fading and really,
really just being a monster in there.  
  
What he's done has completely helped us out throughout this whole season. To
me, I'm very proud of him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Further questions for the players? Thanks, guys.  
  
Question for Coach Marshall.  
  
Q. Gregg, what do you remember about John Brannen from the Marshall
days? Did you have him pegged as a coach at that time?  
A. John Brannen, very, very hard worker, number one. He was the last guy to
leave the gym, tremendous skills. He could shoot it and pass. He had a quirky
jump shot and he'll laugh when he hears me say that, but it went in.  
  
And his fifth year, after transferring into Marshall, I was the first-year
assistant coach, and he was an all-conference player. He was an all-tournament
player in the southern conference, our last year in the southern conference,
and we came within a tip-in at the buzzer of UT Chattanooga, a team that
eventually went to the Sweet 16 of going to the NCAA tournament, something
Marshall has not done in awhile.  
  
Coach D'Antoni got real close this year playing in the championship game. I
watched that game. I was pulling for them.  
  
John Brannen was cerebral, Rhodes Scholar candidate as a graduate, and did
not know he was going to get into coaching. I thought he would go into the
corporate world and be very successful there, but had followed his progress
and his coaching career.  
  
He obviously latched on with Anthony Grant, which is a great move at VCU and
then Alabama. We've played against each other several times with high stakes,
just really like John and his family. Got to know them as well. They're a
wonderful family. He's obviously a fantastic young man and a great coach, and
that program is now in its first year eligible for the tournament, second year
for him as a head coach, and here they are.  
  
Q. Gregg, Archie Miller mentioned that he watched that Wichita State
2013 Final Four that provided a little bit of blueprint that a program similar
to yours can play that way, get to those places.  
How often do you hear that from other coaches, and I guess that would be
satisfying to hear that you've provided that kind of map for some of those
schools?  
  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't hear that that often, but it was nice to hear that
from him in our coaches' meeting today. This is a guy who has been
inspirational in his own right. He was an inspiration to play in the ACC at
North Carolina State.  
  
He's not the biggest guy in the world, but his heart and his talent supersede
his size. Now he's doing it on the coaching level, so he's obviously been an
inspiration to others as well.  
  
It's nice to hear him say that. That was a magical run, and it's something
that we followed up with the undefeated season and then the Sweet 16 and a
couple more wins in the tournament. So it was the impetus of what we're doing
today.  
  
Q. Gregg, Cal was just here and said the selection committee did the
best job seeding he's seen in the last eight years. What do you think?  
COACH MARSHALL: I'll defer to Cal on that. They're probably more likely to
talk to him about seeding and where he wants seeds to be than they would to
me. They don't call me and ask me anything. They probably don't care that I
disagree with the seedings.  
  
It's a great tournament. I'm kind of used to the short end of the stick, if
you will, on the seedings. But that being said, we usually wear the dark
uniforms, and we've won nine games in the last four years. So as Conner
mentioned, we're going to play great teams in this tournament regardless of
where they seed you. I've enjoyed watching the games today, and there's been
some great games with lower seeds either coming close to winning or winning.  
  
We know we've got a challenge tomorrow. The seeds could easily be flip-
flopped. Still you're playing a great team and a well-coached team and a team
with veterans and seniors. They've had their success in the NCAA tournament as
well. It should be a tremendous game. Whoever wins gets the winner of
Kentucky/Northern Kentucky.  
  
Q. How big of a wave of momentum are you guys riding into the
tournament?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think we're playing very well. I don't know how the, I
guess, 11 days, maybe 12 days since we've played on Sunday in our Valley
championship on CBS two Sundays ago, what's that going to be? 12 days now.  
  
We've tried to keep them fresh mentally. We've tried to give their bodies some
rest physically. But in the end, we haven't played anyone else for 12 days. So
the layoff, it will be interesting to see how that affects us.  
  
Dayton's had some time off too. They probably had a week off. But the bottom
line is you've got, again, two good teams, and we feel like we were really
starting to peak in late February, early March.  
  
Hopefully, we can carry that over into mid-March.  
  
Q. Gregg, you've obviously talked a lot about some of the scheduling
challenges. Archie Miller has had similar problems. Power Five teams aren't
lining up to play you guys. What's the solution? What's to be done to make
sure we have more of those match-ups in a nonconference season?  
COACH MARSHALL: It's a great question. I think you'd have to mandate that the
Power Five teams have to play X amount of games on the road. They've got the
money with the TV and the Bowl games and all that to do basically what they
want.  
  
If they never have to leave their building or go play anyone, it's gotten
easier for us in the past 4-5 years. For instance, this year, we scheduled
Oklahoma, and we scheduled Oklahoma State. We're in the Bahamas tournament.
Next year, we're in the Maui tournament. We're going back to the Bahamas
tournament in 4 years.  
  
We're playing the best that we can, but we would like a few more of those. I
sympathize. We play Tulsa home at home, St. Louis home at home. Those are
regional rivals that generally are pretty good. But a couple of them had bad
years this year. That's hard to predict when these schedules are made 2 and 3
years in advance.  
  
But we played Colorado State on the road, another good team. We want to play
the best that we can. We try to go to the best exempt tournaments possible. We
play the best Power Five or BCS schools that will play us home and home, and
we're continually looking at that.  
  
But something we're trying to work on extending the series with Oklahoma.
Coach Krueger's been awesome. Maybe we can schedule something with Dayton.
Maybe that's the way to go. Maybe we can schedule something with Butler. We
practiced in Hinkle Fieldhouse today. Those are probably the answers.  
  
But I think the BCS, Power Five teams, that don't have to go on the road --
and then they also have the opportunity for quality wins, but many of them get
a lot of quality losses as well.  
  
Q. You've been openly critical of Shaquille Morris during parts of his
career at Wichita State. What do you think was the trigger that got him to
play in a way that you're now fairly satisfied with?  
COACH MARSHALL: I would say I'm more than fairly satisfied. Shaq is one of
those guys that kind of got away with some things in high school because of
his immense size and strength.  
  
He was like the bully on the playground, and it's not just the basketball
court that we've had to push him, Bob. It's in academics as well. But I also
-- I want to clarify that I've told him many times this year as he's made
steps towards being the student and the player that he can be, how proud I am
of him and his maturation process.  
  
He's come a long way. As a coach, the way we try to do it, we try to develop
the person, the student and the player. He is a great, shining example of a
guy that's come a long way in all three of those categories.  
  
Q. Every year, your name comes up when there's coaching vacancies and,
obviously, that's kind of happening again this year. I'm wondering with those
frustrations or challenges with scheduling and seeding, could that ever be a
tipping point for you to go elsewhere? Are those things you consider when
you're getting offers?  
COACH MARSHALL: Not really. First of all, I don't know what you're talking
about. No one's talked to me or no one's talked to anybody that represents me.
There's been no discussion of any of these jobs. In fact, I don't even know
what jobs are open, to be honest.  
  
There's a lot of action that takes place every day and every week, it seems.  
  
We value the life that we lead. Whether we're taken care of, we've got a great
administration at Wichita State. They've been very, very supportive and
generous and kind to my family. I've got -- not just me, but I've got my
family and I've got my players.  
  
We think we've got something really good going, so I don't really worry about
it. I think it's very humbling to have your name mentioned with these jobs.
Sometimes, I listen. Ultimately, maybe I'll take one. But right now, we're
very, very happy where we are.  
  
The City of Wichita is a wonderful place to live, and it's treated my family
and a lot of people very, very well. We're very content. But at the same time,
we don't bury our head in the sand. I've said that before. We listen. Maybe
there will be a time for to us make a move, but I don't know when that's going
to be.  
  
Q. Going back to the scheduling topic, at this point, I mean, the way
that the committee has treated you guys a couple years in a row, does it
become something where you feel like maybe the Missouri Valley is being
disrespected or you need to pursue other conference options? How do you think
that can be remedied on the league side of things?  
COACH MARSHALL: You know, that's beyond my decision making level. That's a
presidential deal as far as conference affiliation. I just think there's a
little bit of a movement, it seems, by the committee to squeeze out the non-
Power Five. I really feel that.  
  
And then if they're going to allow a lot of these Power Five teams in, then
they're going to place them against one another in the tournament. I mean,
we're playing Dayton. Gonzaga played -- who did they play? Who did Gonzaga
play? VCU plays somebody. Winthrop played Butler. I mean, it's amazing. South
Dakota State.  
  
They want to weed out the non-Power Fives as quickly as possible, it appears.
When I left the room, it was Middle Tennessee was up nine against Minnesota.
There's a lot of quality basketball being played at some of these places.  
  
I'll go a step further. There's a lot of bad basketball being played in the
Power Five leagues.  
  
Q. Gregg, can I get your reaction to Dave Stallworth's passing?  
COACH MARSHALL: I was going to say something at the end if no one asked me
about that, Bob. Perhaps, and I didn't get a chance to see him play for the
Shockers, but I did get a chance to see him play for the Knicks. One of the
greatest, if not the greatest Shockers of all time passed away last night,
Dave "the Rave" Stallworth.  
  
Our sympathies go out to his family. He was a tremendous gentleman and a true
fan of the Shockers. In my first 6 or 7 years as the head coach, he would be
at games, just about every game.  
  
As his health started to fail, he was there less and less. And we knew about
his illness. We sent a card to him early in the week. We'll be playing this
tournament with a heavy heart because he was a true gentleman and a wonderful
representative of Wichita and Wichita State University.  
  
Q. Gregg, you suggested about weeding out the Power Five, and I'm
wondering what is the incentive to --  
COACH MARSHALL: The non-Power Five.  
  
Q. Big distinction. The non-Power Five. How much of that do you think is
wanting marquee teams, more money making possibilities for TV and the TV
contracts?  
COACH MARSHALL: That could be the case, Jerry. I really don't know the answer
to that question because I don't study the Nielsen ratings and all that.  
  
But, to me, this tournament -- obviously, there are a lot of people that only
know the top 10 or 15, 20 teams in the country. They only know the Kentuckys
and the Dukes and the UCLAs. That's all they know. They don't know the Wichita
States, the Middle Tennessees, the Daytons.  
  
They kind of dismiss us, if you will. But when the tournament comes around,
that's what makes the tournament so special. Now, I'm not going to take
anything away from the wonderful game that Villanova and North Carolina played
last year. I know I was on the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed watching it
as a spectator.  
  
I just don't think that weeding out the non-Power Fives is going to help the
interest in those brackets and people that fill out the brackets and people
that have interest in the underdog or the team that's supposed to not win that
wins and makes it to the second weekend or the third weekend, like Butler and
VCU and we've done recently.  
  
Q. You mentioned about your team peaking or starting to peak late
February and into March. What did you see that told you -- I mean, what's your
approach to basketball as a team and what was working so well?  
COACH MARSHALL: Jerry, we've been able to score the basketball very well this
year. We can strike you from all five spots on the floor. That has not been
our problem. We've scored over 80 points 20 something times this year.  
  
We continue to get better defensively. Our numbers, our analytic numbers, and
whatnot continue to improve defensively as the season went on. They weren't
quite as good as last year, but last year was hard to improve upon. We were
the single best defensive team in the country.  
  
So as we started to get better defensively, Shaq Morris got healthy from a
mid-season thigh injure, and I was finally smart enough to hand the ball to a
freshman point guard, Landry Shamet. That took Conner Frankamp off the ball,
and he could concentrate on scoring. Those three things I think along with a
couple of guys like Zach Brown and Rashard Kelly accepting their roles on our
team and becoming great defenders and energy givers, and it's been a nice
experience for me as a coach to watch our team. It's almost been like time
lapse photography, watching a flower bloom. That's what it's been like to
watch our team develop into a cohesive juggernaut, if you will.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Ray Harper and players, Greg Tucker, Erik
Durham and Malcolm Drumwright. Coach, we'll take comments from you.  
  
COACH HARPER: First, we're excited to be here and these kids have worked
awfully hard all season long and picked 12 out of 12 teams in our league, so
excited to be here. Looking forward to a huge challenge tomorrow afternoon
against University of Louisville.  
  
Q. For all three players, just some initial thoughts about Coach Harper.
What has been his recipe for success for you guys to turn this thing around
the way he has, and for you to be here now?  
GREG TUCKER: I have to say just, you know, preparation, you know, working hard
every day, coming ready to work, doing your job every day, doing whatever it
takes to get ready.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: Just believing in us, telling us to come in and work hard
every week and get better day by day.  
  
ERIK DURHAM: I'd have to say patience. He says it's a marathon instead of a
sprint, so just be ready when that time came.  
  
Q. All three of you, can you talk about, as guards, dealing with
Louisville's press and what the keys will be there?  
GREG TUCKER: I think probably the most -- the biggest thing probably just be
patient with it, not try to force things up the court. Just hit the open man
and be strong with the ball.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: Not do anything too complicated, stay poised and just
don't try to hit a home run.  
  
ERIK DURHAM: Definitely stay calm. Don't try to do too much you're not used to
doing, limit turnovers.  
  
Q. For the players, how would you describe the way in which Coach Harper
challenges you ever since he started with this program this year? We were
talking a little bit earlier, sometimes he can be a little hard on you guys is
what he says.  
GREG TUCKER: He's definitely been tough on us throughout the season, but it
was all worth it. It prepared us for this moment and helped us to get to this
moment. So I'd have to say he's been tough on us, but it's really been tough
love, to be honest.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: Just tough love, just wanting us to be good and
challenging us. Really just tough love.  
  
ERIK DURHAM: Definitely tough love. After big wins, he'd be right there in the
gym, getting after us. He'd let us know we got another one, so don't get too
high.  
  
Q. Malcolm, can you talk about early in the year, with the new coach and
his style, how long did it take you guys to get adjusted? Because it seems
like you're a different team than you were the first, maybe, month and a
half.  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: I would say we played well the first game, so I guess it
probably took the whole summer to kind of understand things.  
  
Q. Greg, 15s versus 2s have had success, four victories in the last five
years. What gives you confidence you can join that group?  
GREG TUCKER: Well, we're confident in the way we prepare every day. We feel
like we're going to be prepared. We believe in each other. Everyone is in the
locker room with us, we're all going to believe. We are going to go out there
and play the hardest to our ability.  
  
Q. All three of you, this is a new experience for Jacksonville State and
a new experience for you guys. Can you tell us what's been the experience so
far and what stood out to you about just the preparation for all this, the
hype around this and getting here and everything?  
GREG TUCKER: The only thing, like the preparation has really been the same. We
still are going about things the same way. We're still very intense about
things. But as far as the other stuff, we're not really getting into the hype.
We're staying grounded. We're just trying to take it one day at a time at
practices, just keep being better, keep doing our jobs.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: It's exciting. We came here to play basketball, and that
is what we'll do.  
  
ERIK DURHAM: It's been amazing. But we don't feel like we should be done yet.
We're going to keep working hard and maybe make that happen.  
  
Q. You know, kind of reflecting on my first question, what have Coach
Harper and the three players out there, what have you learned this year in
terms of coach and player relationships and coaching styles?  
COACH HARPER: Well, again, we're an entirely new staff. All these guys, we --
I thought the importance of playing some road games would help this basketball
team. I was out of my mind when we played 15 of our first 16 on the road. But
I just watched this team come together. Any team that had a chance to be a
part of it, it's about chemistry. It's about playing together. It's about
being one. It's not about being a bunch of individuals.  
  
We still talk about it to this day. We don't point fingers. We take
responsibility. We all make mistakes, and we own up to them.  
  
Again, as a coach, you can talk about it, you can teach it, you can preach it.
But, ultimately, it's up to these young men to whether they accept it or they
don't.  
  
They accepted what we were trying to instill in them. And I think because of
them, not anything us as a staff, but these guys, we're still playing today.
They'll be remembered forever. They're the first team to ever take
Jacksonville State to the NCAA division one tournament, and you always want to
leave some type of legacy, and you are going to leave some type of legacy.
These guys here, especially our two seniors, have left a mark on this program
that will never be forgotten.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Greg, do you want to talk about relationship with coach?  
  
GREG TUCKER: I just wanted to say that, you know, when he first got here, we
had a talk, a long talk. He told me what he expected of me. Once everything
kind of got rolling, we just we kind of just meshed and gelled together. He
talks about keeping the team, keep everyone together as a brotherhood. That's
what we did. That's helped us get to this point.  
  
MALCOLM DRUMWRIGHT: I love him. Just going to be honest with you, he's tough
on you and I appreciate that. I just love him as a coach.  
  
ERIK DURHAM: You know, I love all three of these dudes right here. We had to
learn how to buy in for coach, for all three of us. And it worked out for the
best for us. He's been a blessing to my life and to this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about being the first year, what did you feel like when you got
there, like what you saw. You had some experience, but you knew it was going
to be a big transition, kind of the process early in the coaching for you
there.  
COACH HARPER: Well, again, we watched them early, and we knew there was a lot
of work to be done and in a lot of different areas. I give Greg a lot of
credit for allowing us to get a strength coach there in July. It totally
changed what we were doing.  
  
Malcolm, for example, is 160 pounds. And by the end of the summer, he was 184,
and he was muscled up. So there were a lot of things that needed to be done,
but that was a necessity.  
  
They needed to understand -- I'm not saying they didn't work in the past. It's
not that. But to get to the level we are today, you have to take it to another
level with your work ethic, and it can't be do it one day and not do it the
next. It's got to be constant.  
  
That was the most difficult thing, to get those guys -- we'd have one good
practice and then a not so good practice. And I kept telling them, it's why we
haven't won more than two in a row all season, guys, because you can't string
them together. I watched them over the last month really get better. Their
work ethic got better. Their buy-in got better. Because of it, we were playing
pretty well down the stretch.  
  
Q. Ray, can you talk about how you've sold them on possibly being the
ninth 15 to beat a 2?  
COACH HARPER: Honestly, we really haven't talked about it a lot. We talked
about what we need to do -- we don't talk about wins and losses. We really
don't. We haven't from day one. I was watching TV last night, and Belmont beat
Georgia. And I told people, Belmont's a really good basketball team. It's
going to make some noise in the N.I.T. I think they should have been an at-
large team, but never even got in consideration. They were 15-1 in the league,
won 25 or 26 games. So why aren't they playing? I don't know.  
  
But we didn't talk about beating Belmont. We talked about the process, do your
job. The winning, losing takes care of itself. If you get caught up in, oh,
we're going to lose this game, or oh, what do I have to do to win this game --
no. What do you have to do in this defensive possession to be in the right
position.  
  
And that's who we are. I firmly believe, when you get caught up in the final
outcome, I've had teams lose games that I was more proud of them than teams
that won games because they played the game the right way.  
  
You come up on the short end in this business sometimes. It happens. It
doesn't mean you're a failure. And irregardless of -- as long as we play the
game the right way, we play hard and we play together, I'll take my chances
every night.  
  
Q. When you were at Western, you got to see Louisville three times.
Thoughts, initial impressions, what makes them so difficult and how are some
of the ways, without giving away trade secrets, about how you try to fight
that?  
COACH HARPER: First and foremost, the guy calling timeouts is going to make it
difficult. He's as good as it gets in this game at Louisville. When you watch
what he's done, not just at Louisville, but every stop, he adjusts to every
team.  
  
He may be an all-zone team one year, then all of a sudden, he's a pressing
team. Now he's a half court. He can figure things out like no one else. I'd
love to have the opportunity to sit and talk to him at some point about how he
does it.  
  
And then you cannot simulate in practice how hard his kids play, and that's a
credit to him. We played them three times in my previous stop, and it's just
how hard they play and how competitive they are.  
  
Tomorrow, what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to rebound the
ball, and we're going to have to take care of the ball. And we're going to
have to throw in some shots too. Hopefully we can throw in a lot a long-range
3s. That would be nice.  
  
Q. Ray, you mentioned that you and Rick Pitino have gone against each
other before when you were at Western Kentucky. Do you guys have relationship,
or is it just shaking hands before and after games?  
COACH HARPER: We have some really mutual friends. We used to text a little
bit. And Rick has been -- would text me. They had a kid leave the program a
few years ago, wanted to know if we had any interest in him transferring.  
  
We're friendly. But are we friends that talk on a daily basis? No. But Bradley
who sets on his bench is from Louisville. I've known Father Bradley forever.
He has some friends in Owensboro, Kentucky. That's about it.  
  
Q. Following up on the point you made earlier about Pitino's
adaptability and, played all man against Notre Dame, plays a lot of zone, what
do you expect going in?  
COACH HARPER: The unexpected. I mean, help me. I don't know. Someone said that
we play four, five different defenses. He's seen some that I don't even know
we do. I didn't know we played that many. I asked one of my assistants, are we
really playing this many zones and this?  
  
So I don't know. I tell you what I expect, I expect a team that's going to
come right after us, right from the get-go, right from that opening tip.
They're going to try to set the tone. They're going to be the bully, and we'll
see if we allow them to bully us.  
  
Q. Ray, what did you think Sunday when you saw with your history, being
from the state of Kentucky and the coaching against Coach Pitino, what did you
think when you saw that pop up on the screens?  
COACH HARPER: That we better get busy and get prepared for some pressure.
Yeah, he'll have his guys ready. The good thing was we had finished our
tournament the previous Saturday. We gave our guy as couple days off. And we
spent two full days working against nothing but pressure. I just felt like we
were going to see someone early that would do that, whether it was Louisville
or West Virginia or whomever.  
  
So we worked a lot against that. So, hopefully, that gave us a couple extra
days' head start.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, overall, how would you think your team copes
with pressure?  
COACH HARPER: With pressure, they've been okay. At times, they've been really
good. And we haven't had a lot of teams that just come after us for 40 minutes
like Louisville's going to. I think our lead is more man-to-man, half court
type teams. We had a couple teams try to press us, and we handled it pretty
well and got out of it. So we'll see.  
  
Q. Coach, this has been talked about, the first time ever Jacksonville
State being here. You've been here today. Does that help, the fact that you've
got experience with the tournament?  
COACH HARPER: I will not score one bucket tomorrow. So probably not. But at
the same time, this is huge for our program, as you know. You've been around
the program for a long time. When I got there, I said you've got to walk
before you can run.  
  
Well, we're up jogging. Hopefully, this can spring board this program to not
where we win a championship every year and we're playing in the NCAA
tournament every year, but where we have a chance.  
  
Because, like I said earlier, there's times where you play your tails off and
you just come up short. And, unfortunately, it happens. And that's why I said
I think Belmont should have been given consideration to be in an at-large team
this year. If you look at the N.I.T. right now, Oakland went on the road and
beat Clemson. Belmont goes on the road and beats Georgia.  
  
The one common is all those teams are going on the road. They don't get home
games. And I'm sure Belmont would have loved to have played Tennessee and
Vanderbilt at home. But they're not going to do it. So until they fix the way
they pick the 68 teams, it's hurting the guys -- Illinois State, I feel bad
for Dan and that team. I know him. I think they should be in the tournament.  
  
Maybe they'll figure out a way to award some of the teams that win 26 and 27
games over the course of the season. I think it would make for a better
tournament.  
  
Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Derek Willis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30793)

### [Mychal Mulder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33113)

### [Dominique Hawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33001)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Kentucky, and we'll have a
statement from Coach Calipari, and then we'll go to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: This is a team that I'm really proud to be coaching, a young
team, but you're also seeing three seniors up here who carried their weight,
took over this team when they needed to, were able to step back when they
needed to. Servant leaders, all three of them. They've had a big impact on the
year, and it's just fun to see young guys come together with veterans and
figure it out together. This team is slowly becoming that team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maybe Mychal or Dominique might be able to speak to this. Coach
Brannen, coming from Alabama, I know he's in charge of some perimeter play out
there. Kind of curious, as you look at NKU and their guard play, perimeter
play, and you see some things from your history and looking back, a style of
play, I guess, if you will, or how do you kind of see their guard play coming
from their coach on down?  
MYCHAL MULDER: We haven't watched a whole lot of film. Talented team from what
we have seen throughout the year. A team that we respect. They're in our
state, and it's great to be able to play them in our first game of the
tournament.  
  
But they look like a talented team, and we're excited for tomorrow.  
  
DOMINIQUE HAWKINS: Like Mike said, we didn't watch a lot of film on them, but
we're definitely going to respect their guards. They've got great guards,
athletic, can get to the rim. We're really excited to be able to play an in-
state team. Hopefully, it will be a great game.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Can I just say something? We spent a lot of time on ourselves
right now, and the stuff that they've watched has been personnel tape. We do
all that stuff, and they'll watch 15-20 minutes of tape on everybody we play.
So please don't take it as disrespect. That's just how we do this.  
  
Q. Mychal and Coach, Mychal, I think there's 26 Canadian guys in the
tournament. Just what does that say about the level of Canadian basketball? I
think the last Canadian guy to win a title was Kyle Wiltjer with Kentucky, if
I'm not mistaken.  
Also, Coach, if you could kind of add what you've seen coming out of
Canada.  
  
MYCHAL MULDER: It's a special thing for me personally. I take a lot of pride
in that. Canadian basketball seems to be on the uprise. I was fortunate enough
to be a teammate and close friend with Jamal the last year. To be able to
share that experience with him, coming from the same area, it's really special
to us. We take a lot of pride in it, a lot of pride in our country. To see
Canadian basketball growing and a lot more Canadians coming through the NCAA
and into the NBA and stuff like that is great to see.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: When he had senior night, we sang the Canadian National
Anthem, which was really neat, by the way. I love Toronto. If there are any
players in Toronto, I will go up there myself to recruit them because I think
that's one of the great cities in the world.  
  
Q. Derek, your improved defense the last ten games has been remarkable.
Why? More concentration? Where did it come from?  
DEREK WILLIS: I think it's just coming down to the postseason. I want to crack
down on a lot of things, try to limit the defensive lapses that I would have
in the earlier part of the season, even towards the middle.  
  
So kind of have a little bit more sense of urgency this time of the year, and
it's kind of last go-around. So, like I said, just want to limit all those
lapses and make the most out of the games and carry on with the experience
that we have.  
  
COACH CALIPARI: Tell him the truth. You got engaged and your fiance said you
better start guarding people. All of a sudden, he's gotten better.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: I try and do -- ever since I got engaged, I've been playing
better, and we've been winning. Hopefully, it keeps going.  
  
Q. Dominique, what has this ride been like for you, from high school to
now, helping Kentucky pursue another national championship, all the
opportunities you've had with the team?  
DOMINIQUE HAWKINS: It's been unbelievable. This season has been my best
season. A group of guys that actually wants me to be successful is what
motivates me. My teammates want me to do good. I want to do good for them.
I've got the whole state of Kentucky behind me. Kentucky kid. Everybody's
rooting for me to do good.  
  
Q. Dominique, what are your memories playing against Lavone Holland in
the state championship game, and I think his AAU teammates as well, thoughts
on him and the memory of the awesome game that you had?  
DOMINIQUE HAWKINS: I remember a lot about that game. I know Lavone, like you
said, he was on my AAU team. He was a great player. I don't remember much
about state. I remember the last shot is what I remember right now and us
winning.  
  
Q. Derek, what do you tell the young guys as they prepare to get into
the NCAA tournament, all of the hoopla, media and everything, to stay focused,
what do you tell them?  
DEREK WILLIS: A lot of it is just kind of leading by example. A lot of the
games we've been in, especially the SEC tournament, I feel like that was
definitely a good learning experience for us being in that kind of
environment, leading into this weekend.  
  
So just being out there, staying calm. I've been there in past seasons.
Whether I was playing or not, I at least got to watch it. Then with last year,
I had a little bit of experience with the rounds we've made it in.  
  
So like I said, just having that past experience I think kind of gives me a
little edge over the freshmen. Then, again, they're all helping each other
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Thanks, fellas.  
  
Continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you all have been able to win games without Monk taking it
over in the second half midway in the season. What's one of the reasons for
that and is that a reason you think you have a chance to go far in this
tournament?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, there's a couple things that have happened. Early in the
year, we didn't know who we were. We were just flying up and down the court.
Other teams didn't know who we were.  
  
As the season went on, we had teams that said one thing, you're not letting
them run. We had to learn to play in the half court. We had to learn to grind
it out.  
  
Bad shots lead to bad defense. Like wow, you're not guarding. Wow, you take a
bad shot. It's a breakout layup. The second thing is we got down 18, 19, 17 in
different games and came back and won, learned we could do it. We also got up
22, 23 and look around, it's a 3-point game. So there were so many things we
had to learn.  
  
The other side of it is we learned to learn with Malik going one for 10, 2 for
10. He learned to play going 2 for 10. You're not going to go 2 for 20. Go 2
for 10 and rebound the ball, defend, do other things to help us win.  
  
We learned to play without De'Aaron Fox. We beat Florida without De'Aaron Fox.
We learned to win without Isaiah Briscoe because Dominique played so well. We
learned to play either with Wenyen, go small, go big. This is one of those
experiences. It's always a process with us because they're new teams.  
  
We have the youngest team in this tournament, so it takes time to really
figure things out and learn. But we've learned to win a lot of different ways.  
  
Q. I'll reiterate the question, Coach. What have you seen from John and
what he likes to do?  
COACH CALIPARI: I have watched the tape, okay? So the games that I've seen,
their tournament games, the UIC game, they run their stuff. They have a five-
man that can shoot threes. Their guards are not afraid. They'll shoot 3s.
They'll fly up and down the court. They run good stuff in the half court. They
space the court. Their pick-and-roll stuff is good. Their man-to-man is more
of a let's make sure you're going to take a tough shot, and we're going to
rebound and run.  
  
They do play a 2-3 zone. I've seen a little bit of 1-3-1. Run good out-of-
bounds plays on the baseline. John's done a good job. They've won 25 games.
This is a legitimately good team.  
  
Again, I'm just hearing scores. I'm not really watching games, but I'm hearing
scores, two-point game, one-point game.  
  
If you expect in this tournament, to try to bury somebody, it's hard. It's
hard. You're just trying to say let's play as well as we can play.  
  
Teams this year, many teams had house money against us, not supposed to win.
They're not expected to win. We were expected to win. They're throwing balls,
shooting bank shots, hook shots, runners, ball's going in. Who is that guy? He
just made three 3s. Those are his first three 3s of the season. That's his
first, that kind of stuff.  
  
So you've got to come in this, let's worry about us. Let's play with energy,
knowing this team is good enough, Northern, to beat us. Let's be at our best
and see what happens.  
  
Q. John, you've been the overwhelming favorite when you guys were
undefeated coming in here to, like, this year where you're one of a collection
of teams that certainly could win it. What's more challenging?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, I'd like to be undefeated coming into this again. That
would have been better. Every year, you come in, it's different. I remember
when we won our conference tournament by 25 and our reward was to have to play
Ohio State as the 1-1 seed. If you're lucky enough to beat them, beat North
Carolina with seven pros, good luck to you. Have fun.  
  
And Brandon Knight made a shot at the buzzer to beat Ohio State, and we ended
up in the Final Four. I can remember when we were seeded 8, 8, 8, and we ended
up having to play Wichita State, who was undefeated.  
  
And then, all of a sudden, Aaron Harrison's bombing balls at the buzzer, and
we marched to the final game of the season.  
  
So we've seen -- been doing this 30 years now. You may not know this, I'm not
the 32-year-old coach anymore. So you just go in with an open mind about every
game.  
  
For us, I have a different team every time we walk into this thing, so I don't
know what to expect other than try to get my guys in a good frame of mind.
Don't be afraid to lose. Don't be afraid to miss shots. Don't be afraid to be
aggressive. Go for it. Play to win. Don't think of anything else. Forget about
score. Just keep playing to win. If that's not good enough, it's been a heck
of a season.  
  
Q. John, has this team turned out to be deeper than you envisioned back
in October? If so, why? How does that impact going forward?  
COACH CALIPARI: It's turned out to be deeper because our seniors have played
well. Now Dom, Mychal and Derek, along with freshmen, Wenyen and Isaac, need
to step up a little bit. All these guys, it's do what you do, just be a little
bit better right now. Do what you do and try to do it for 40 minutes.  
  
Your whole day should be on preparing to play great for 40 minutes. If you hit
your C-game, you're not A. A-game, you're in the zone. You're making
everything. Now you're in the C-game. Now you're not at your best. Make easy
plays. Don't try to lose your mind. Just make the easiest play you can make,
make easy shots you can make, and then get on to the next game.  
  
So these kids, I think because we have seniors who have been experienced, it
makes us a different team, a deeper team.  
  
Q. John, what is your expectation for Bam in this tournament? What are
you looking for him to do?  
COACH CALIPARI: It's really funny. I've had big guys that none of them were
fives. Carl's not a five. He's a double-double machine in the NBA right now.
The reason is he's mad he didn't make the All-Star Game, so now he's trying to
take it out on everybody.  
  
Neither is Antoine Davis, neither is DeMarcus Cousins. Bam is not a five. But
the way, we're playing him. He's given us post presence, but he can shoot.
I'll do a drill today. He'll be shooting 3s so everybody can see. I didn't
know he can do that. You didn't know Anthony could do it, and you didn't know
Carl could do it because I didn't let them do it, but they're doing okay.  
  
I think here's a guy that can guard five positions. He can make free throws.
He can guard pick and roll. He can play in pick and roll, and he can space the
court because he's skilled. 6'10", 6'9", 6'10" in there, a beast head on the
rim and guard five positions. Value. I mean, that's a kid that goes in and has
an impact because of that.  
  
Q. Cal, what's your take on Tom Crean being out at Indiana?  
COACH CALIPARI: Just disappointed. Hard profession. It's just disappointing. I
feel for him and his family. I've been fired. I know what it's like. I know
what it is to your family, your wife, your kids. They take it harder than you
take it.  
  
Two Big Ten titles the last four years, had injuries this year, beat North
Carolina, beat Kansas, have injuries, stuff happens. But you know what? In
this profession, you're hired and you're fired. That's the two things that
happen. And you have to buy into that coming in.  
  
Whether I think it's right or not, I'm just disappointed. I'm disappointed for
him and his family. But let me say this, someone will hire him because he's
Tom Crean. He can coach. He works. Great integrity. There will be a job. If he
wants to take another job, he'll get it. If not, he'll sit out and do what I
did. I became the highest paid amateur golfer in the country for about six
months.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned obviously the difficulty of the profession. On
NKU's side, to go from division 2 to 1, with nine wins to flip that record to
get here --  
COACH CALIPARI: How about their facility, their arena? I mean, they have an
arena that I walked in and I was, like, wait a minute. What is this? And I'm
looking around like they've done it right.  
  
Their campus, the community they're building. They've got Cincinnati right
over the bridge, right around the corner from them. And what he's done, it's
an amazing thing. And that league is hard because Oakland, Valpo, you've got
-- you know, you've got tough teams in there that can play with anybody in the
country.  
  
So he -- I know the school's excited, and they should be. And I knew John when
he was coaching at Alabama, and I knew what they did then and how good a coach
he was. So they've done great, good players. Be interesting tomorrow at
midnight when we start this game.  
  
Q. John, Mick Cronin was a little critical of the pod system and the way
things are going in terms of selling tickets. You guys and Louisville are
here. It's going to be a great crowd, local teams. How do you feel it's been
structured the last few years to protect top seeds close to home?  
COACH CALIPARI: The biggest thing they're starting to become more transparent.
There were less glitches because they're more transparent. There are things
they can do to be even more transparent, the S-curve. Then move people around
the S-curve because of league, the top four seeds.  
  
League tournaments, before they start, make an announcement what they mean for
every league. For every league, this is what league tournaments mean. Make
that announcement. You can't have one team move and have another team not move
who beat the fifth team in the country and the third team in the country and
they stay. You can't. Tell us all what it means.  
  
The more transparency, this thing is going to get better. I thought they did
the best job of seeding this year than I've seen in eight years, and you're
all amazed I'm saying something nice about that committee. I'm just telling
you, I watch closely, and I keep saying, they were more transparent this year
than they've ever been.  
  
Now, let's go the Full Monty, just keep being more transparent because this is
for these kids. This isn't for coaches. If the kids ever said we're not
playing the games, you're not getting free meals. I mean, we're not coaching.
A.D.s aren't in hotels. This is for them.  
  
Whatever we do, let's just keep that in mind. The timing of the games, the
transparency, not for coaches and  
  
A.D.s, for the players to see it, so they understand why they got in and why
they didn't and why they moved and why they're playing who they are.  
  
It's about those kids. I'm telling you, I think they're moving in the right
direction. I think the committee is moving in the right direction, and I think
if they keep being more transparent next year, there were one or two seeds
everybody asked about. Think about it. Other years, there was uproars. This
year, there wasn't.  
  
Next year, the year after, the year after, if there's more transparency, the
thing will all be about the kids and the games and nothing about the
selection, which is the way it should be.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious the response on your end about your podcast a
season into it. Has it taken as much or more time than you thought it might to
get guests and do this every week?  
COACH CALIPARI: Does anybody -- no. It takes me about 30 minutes a week. Does
anybody know what a podcast is because I didn't know what it was? Never heard
of a podcast. I only did it because no other coaches are doing it. That's my
question. Any other coaches doing podcasts? No. Then I'm doing it.  
  
Now, we had friends of mine on. It's like two guys drinking coffee, and you're
a fly on the wall. There's been over a million listens. Did you hear what I
just said? People are like crazy out there. We don't know that. There were a
million listens to these podcasts.  
  
Will I do it again next year? I don't know. I'm hoping 20 other coaches do
them so I can stop doing it. Then I don't have to do it. But right now, I'm
like the only coach that does it. So now I'm done until the tournament's over,
so I'll spend no time on it, and I didn't for this. I let them hear my news
conference and my talk to my kid. That's it. I told them I'm focused on this
right now, and I'm not even going to spend 30 minutes on that, so I won't.  
  
When it's all done, probably do a couple more episodes and that's it and then
figure out if I want to do it next year.  
  
Q. Cal, you said right before this season, you thought Bam could sort of
be on a track like Carl and Anthony in that he'd get better and better and
better as the season went on. Maybe didn't look that way for a little while,
but is he kind of exactly what you thought? And how important -- you've said
if you don't have a post presence, you're a fraud.  
COACH CALIPARI: Right. Let me say this, this kid, how many of you are
frustrated he doesn't get the ball enough? Like you are frustrated, media. You
don't even have a dog in the hunt. Give him the ball!  
  
He never says a word, never says one word. One time he came up to me during a
game and said, Coach, you may want to tell them to throw me the ball once in a
while. He smiled. He and I laughed. That's the only time he said anything.  
  
He just plays. Kenny Payne at halftime, I can't believe it. Throw him the
ball! I mean, and it's not that the guys are selfish. It's that they're
playing too, and we're trying to figure each other out.  
  
But he's gotten better. Again, the biggest thing is he can guard five
positions. Look, when you can guard pick and roll the way he does, you have
great value. When you can make free throws, it means you can shoot.  
  
Now, all of a sudden, you're skilled with the ball and you're athletic and you
can fly, that's not normal. There's only one in five years like that. We've
been lucky at Kentucky because we've had some guys that are bigger.  
  
Now, they're bigger than him, but they're fours. That's what he's going to be.
He's a four. He's not a five.  
  
Q. John, something I've always been curious about. There's times this
year where you've gotten after Isaiah really hard and he's come back at you
just as hard. You see it with DeMarcus Cousins. I'm curious about take on
coach/player interaction and how that has changed from 30 years ago?  
COACH CALIPARI: I was the same way. Many times I'm getting on a kid because I
don't think he's shown enough emotion or energy, like you've got more than
this. I've got -- okay, now play that way. Just trying to get them to show
they're alive. Are you alive? Like you look like you're going -- so many
times, I'm doing that.  
  
If there's a time that I don't need it to come back, I'll say stop and they'll
stop. Short of that, I'm Italian. I'm emotional. And I expect them not to be
and they're in this game flying up and down and I'm sweating and losing my
mind and I get on a kid, but you can't say anything? Don't you say one --
what?  
  
I've had guys come back at me. I can remember back in the UMass days, we could
be more physical then. You can't be physical now. Back then, I was stronger
and more agile than I am right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you've hinted at it a little bit. Is there a challenge with an
unknown and late start, especially with how people know diets and rest and you
add in the sports science stuff? But then, I mean, it could be 9:30, could be
late.  
COACH CALIPARI: And that worries me. But the thing that worries you more is
you've got the youngest team in the tournament, and they've never been in this
tournament setting. You're trying to talk them through, but you can't. They
have to feel it.  
  
We have veterans that I can go to, but we'll see. You don't know. I mean,
that's what makes this tournament what it is. You don't know. You may think
you know, but you do not know. And teams upsetting teams, that's what the
whole tournament's about. You just don't want to be one of those teams that
gets upset. Let it be somebody else.  
  
Q. Coach, NKU's kind of in the same boat here, but what does it do for a
team's confidence to make the trip just right up 65 to Indianapolis? What does
it do to the confidence knowing that you're playing so close to home?  
COACH CALIPARI: We've played here a bunch. Indianapolis, when you talk about
sites, Indianapolis,  
  
New Orleans, you know what I mean, San Antonio, you're talking about the sites
that really are so conducive to these things because everything is close.  
  
So when you come in, it's the whole environment. It's all of it. We love
playing in Indianapolis. I mean, I love playing games up here, tournaments
games or games in general. This is a neat city.  
  
They've brought some Pittsburgh here, where I grew up, Primanti Brothers, if
you want to try your french fries on your sandwich, they brought Pittsburgh
here. So we like it.  
  
It will be good for their fans, good for our fans, easy to get to. But
Louisville, Dayton, think of the teams that are here that travel. Wichita
travels. They travel. If you have tickets, hold onto them. Don't put them in
your pocket. Hold them in your hand. They're going to have value.  
  
Q. John, I believe you said something Sunday about we're going to see if
there are any weaknesses in our defense, anything to work on. Wonder if you
discovered anything.  
COACH CALIPARI: You've just got to be prepared for what if this happens, what
if that happens. What are we going to do? You can't say if the tanks come over
that hill, guys, if you see the top of the tank, pray your rosary beads
because we're going down. You can't.  
  
If they come over that way, what are we going to do? What's our options? What
else can we do? We can't just cave in. We've got to fight. We've got to do
something. That's where you are as a coach at this time.  
  
You can't give that all to the players. I will not -- I refuse to overwhelm
them with tape of the other team or more than what we do. We'll be prepared as
coaches if we need to do stuff, but I want them to have fresh legs, fresh
minds. They're not overwhelmed with video. Let's go play basketball.  
  
Thanks, folks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [John Brannen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33123)

### [Cole Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33124)

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Northern Kentucky. We'll have an opening
statement from Coach Brannen and then go to the players. John?  
  
COACH BRANNEN: Obviously, an honor to be here. Really excited about the
opportunity to be here in Indianapolis for our school's first representation
in the NCAA tournament.  
  
For our guys, it's been an outstanding year. You hear the word Cinderella.
It's something that takes place once you get to the dance. For us, it hasn't
been like that throughout the regular season. 24-10, winning 12 of our last 14
and 9 of our last 10.  
  
We talked about all year playing our best basketball when it got to March, and
I feel like we've done that for the most part. Certainly, I know you guys will
open up the questions as to who we're playing. We're excited to get an
opportunity to play against a prestigious program like Kentucky.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Cole, I'm under the impression when you committed to Northern
Kentucky, you knew that it would be a one-shot deal with the NCAA, playing in
it. What led you to do that?  
COLE MURRAY: First of all, I committed because of the location it was in. I
really loved everything about the university. Academically, it had everything
I was looking for. The facility at the mid-major level was a lot higher than
the other schools I'd looked at previously.  
  
For me and other seniors on the roster, it was about building a program. We
wanted to bring something back to Northern Kentucky that we hadn't seen
before. For us, I feel like we've done that to this point, and we're really
excited about the opportunity that we have ahead of us.  
  
Q. Lavone, Dominique Hawkins and Derek Willis both talked about playing
against you when playing in AAU and in high school. What are your
recollections of playing against them or with them in AAU?  
LAVONE HOLLAND: I played with Dominique Hawkins at AAU. He's a good player,
fun to play with. Derek Willis is also good competition to play against.  
  
Q. Drew, I wonder if playing Kentucky, is this something that's like a
-- something you'll be telling your grandkids about some time in the future?  
DREW McDONALD: I think this whole experience in general will be something I'll
remember for the rest of my life. Just growing up, watching the NCAA
tournament, it just was a cool experience. Coming here and getting a chance to
play in it, and then a big school like Kentucky, it's just a great opportunity
for us.  
  
Q. For you guys, when did this week become about business? Obviously,
you knew you earned a berth and you were waiting for Selection Sunday. Sunday
night? When did you guys get into Kentucky, wanting to watch them or study
them? When did that turn and what has this week been like in that regard?  
DREW McDONALD: Really, after the selection show, we had a meeting with coach
and our managers and players and everybody. That's when it really started. I
mean, we enjoyed the experience of Selection Sunday. Once we heard Kentucky
and we had a meeting right after that, that's when our business started.  
  
We got into practice the next day, got in the game plan a little bit and got
more in-depth as the week went on.  
  
LAVONE HOLLAND: Really, it's been about business for us the whole year. It
really began for the NCAA tournament two days after we won the conference
tournament, we were right back in the gym.  
  
COLE MURRAY: Yeah, what they both just said. I mean, right after the selection
show, like he said, we met and we put a game plan in. This whole week, we went
after it and got prepared.  
  
Q. Cole, how much of an awe factor might there be? It's your first time
in the tournament, and they're the winningest program in college basketball?  
COLE MURRAY: I mean, you can't look at it that way. You've got to come in as
if it's a faceless opponent like we used the term all year. No matter who we
play, we prepare as if we play anybody. This week is no different. It doesn't
matter what stage we play on, who we play, where we play. We go in playing
like it's anybody else.  
  
Q. For all the players, in a normal week, if I'm a student on the NKU
campus, how many U.K. shirts do I see? Are there more NKU shirts now?  
DREW McDONALD: You'll see a couple throughout campus. At the beginning of the
year, you'll see some. As basketball season got on, we got more students to
the game. It dwindled down. I did read any student who had a free ticket to
the game or won a ticket, they are not allowed to wear U.K. stuff. It dwindled
down as we won games, and they've come to support us more.  
  
LAVONE HOLLAND: I only take class on campus right now. I don't get on campus
much. When I do, I don't see many U.K. shirts.  
  
COLE MURRAY: A few years ago, I used to see a lot. This year, it's toned down
a lot. It's been nice to see.  
  
Q. Lavone, can you tell us about a kid from Ballard playing at Northern
and now playing against U.K.?  
LAVONE HOLLAND: One more time.  
  
Q. You're from Ballard High School, now going to play against U.K.,
what's that's like?  
LAVONE HOLLAND: I think it's an opportunity I've been blessed with. I wouldn't
say it was something that I, like, dreamed about, but it is something that
I've always wanted to do.  
  
Q. Cole, there have been some 15s to beat 2s in the last few years. I'm
wondering how much you guys maybe take some, what, confidence that you can be
another one?  
COLE MURRAY: That's something that you look at, and you know what craziness
happens in the tournament. Obviously, anything can happen.  
  
Like I said before, we just try to prepare for whoever we play. We don't look
at the seeding. We don't look at the tradition of the other school or anything
like that. We just come in every day and do it like we've been doing it. It's
helped us be successful this far.  
  
Q. Just to kind of piggyback off that, how hard is it, when you look at
rosters, their roster, kids who you played AAU with, you know your class
rankings when you come out as high school kids. You know some of these guys
will be in the NBA next year. Has that been hard at all to think about
measuring up or how we'll do against that type of guy, I guess? I think any of
you can answer that.  
DREW McDONALD: I think it's kind of motivation, really. It's a great
opportunity for us. They're on national TV all the time. They get all this
exposure, and we're more of a lower mid-major team, and we don't get the
exposure that they do. So being on a national stage like this gives us a
chance to expose our talents and expose how we play as a team.  
  
It's some motivation just seeing the rankings coming out and seeing guys that
you're going to play in the NBA with. I played against several of them in the
AAU. I know what they are. We played against them, beat some of the teams in
AAUs. Like Cole says, it's a faceless opponent.  
  
Q. Cole, you went to high school about 80 miles from here. Some of your
teammates went to high school in Indianapolis. Have you talked about how
unique this experience is to have the first tournament you guys are playing,
to play it right here in Indianapolis?  
COLE MURRAY: It's pretty special to have the first tournament for this school
be in a place where I basically grew up. Us, BG, Jordan and I, talk about how
cool it is that we get to experience this back in our home state.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, for any of you guys, if you had time to stop and smell
the roses, the accomplishment of being in your first year of eligibility,
doing it or was there no time for this? It's business, business.  
COLE MURRAY: A day or two after we won the conference tournament, that's when
it really sank in, and you understand what we've accomplished, not only for us
as a team, but as a university as a whole. To see all the people it affects,
all the alumni that reach out to you and say how special it is and thank us
for what we've done. Other than that, ever since we found out who we play,
it's been business-like from there.  
  
LAVONE HOLLAND: For me, we're going to take this as far as we can. And then
when it's all over, we'll just soak in what we've accomplished.  
  
DREW McDONALD: Kind of like what they both said. We got a little bit of a
layoff after we won the conference championship, so a day or two, we got to
let it sink in and enjoy it. We got back to work. Even before Selection
Sunday, we were back in practice, working on our game, working on us. We're
going to keep fighting and see how far we can take this thing.  
  
Once it's done, we'll step back and realize how great a year we had. We have
24 wins right now. Hopefully we can increase that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. See you tomorrow.  
  
Continue with questions for Coach Brannen.  
  
Q. John, you were able to sign two first team Kentucky all-staters last
year, including Mr. Basketball. You've signed a really good player in the
current class. Did you take the job planning to emphasize in-state recruiting?
Are even you a little surprised at how well you've been able to do this
quickly?  
COACH BRANNEN: Yes, Mark. Our basis on taking on the program was two-fold; to
build the culture immediately and try to do that with the current players we
had when we took over the team last year, with a team transitioning to
division one and the new league, the Horizon.  
  
The second was recruiting. We gained traction in recruiting probably quicker
than anything in our program. It had to do with a great staff. State of
Kentucky was great at the time we took over the job. We had connections with
Carson Williams, Mason Faulkner, Lavone Holland, a guy we signed. Drew and
Cole were already here.  
  
It's a situation for us where once we gained that traction quickly, it
snowballed from there. Good players want to play with good players. We had an
outstanding first recruiting class. Whenever you take over a program, these
first two recruiting classes are important in this day and age in winning
fast. Marry that with the culture that was built the first year, you have a
24-win team this year.  
  
Q. John, specifically, about one of those in-state guys, Lavone, how
important is it to have a guy played at Ballard and was a quality high player
from Louisville and then just specifically about his game, what do you like
and how has he stepped up for you guys the last few weeks?  
COACH BRANNEN: He's been phenomenal. At the point guard spot, he's dynamic in
what he can do with the basketball. He's a big part of the run we've had and
the way we've had a successful season. Add to the fact he comes from a
successful program like Ballard, he understands winning, has been coached.  
  
More importantly, you probably saw that with the way they speak and how they
handle themselves, he's a great kid. And for me, this has probably been one of
the most enjoyable teams I've coached in my 18 years in the profession. It's
nice that it's specific to Lavone, being a Kentucky kid.  
  
Q. John, I wonder if you would buy the David and Goliath story line here
and, if so, what is the rock in your slingshot?  
COACH BRANNEN: I know you guys would like us to. It's not who we are. We're
going to go every day. We're a process-oriented group. We divorce ourselves
from outcomes. We focus on possession by possession, day by day.  
  
What you heard out of our young men today is what they believe in. And this is
a 15-2 seed. The committee put Northern Kentucky versus Kentucky. It's a good
story line, first time ever versus the greatest program in college basketball
history. It's an opportunity for us to continue to play well, hopefully. We'll
take it as that.  
  
When you're in the eye of the storm, Jerry, I don't know that many coaches
look at it like that.  
  
Q. John, could you speak to your familiarity with the history of the
program and what's your relationship like with Ken Shields?  
COACH BRANNEN: I'm from Northern Kentucky. I've got a lot -- the two national
championship finalist teams in division two were guys I grew up with. Coach
Shields calls me after every game, giving me a congratulatory message. 20
years ago, Northern Kentucky University was a school that was not a
destination school. It was where kids went to school who couldn't afford to go
to Louisville and Kentucky. It's now a destination school. We're up to 15,000
students. I could go on and on. I have tremendous love for this university and
a tremendous amount of respect for what the program has done in the past to
get us to the division one level.  
  
Q. Talk about the freshman season Carson has had.  
COACH BRANNEN: I made mention of this all year long. He started being the most
consistent freshman I've ever coached. He's probably one of the most
consistent players I've ever coached. I've been at every level.  
  
Every day, he's the same. He's hard working. Toughness is a core value of our
program. He's really increased the toughness of our program. He's really moved
the needle in a lot of different ways.  
  
A joy to coach, doesn't say a whole lot. Probably wouldn't get two words out
of him on this podium, but he's a guy who every day impacts this team.  
  
Q. John, when you guys are playing well, what is working? What is the
approach you guys have?  
COACH BRANNEN: Jerry, we're really up and down. We shot the most 3s and made
the most 3s in the league in the Horizon. We play free offensively. We'll get
up in full court defensively, but we want the game to be free-flowing with the
ball to move. And I think rebounding wise, we've been a top 50 rebound team
most of the year.  
  
From a visual standpoint, I like to think we're a fun team to watch. Most of
the people that come to that have seen that. So we'll see.  
  
Q. What or who, I guess, really caught your eye or maybe has kept you
awake this week in terms of watching U.K. and what you're going to try to have
your guys do?  
COACH BRANNEN: Three top 15 draft picks. They've got a Hall of Fame coach. I
could go on and on about what keeps you up at night. What I've been impressed
with the Kentucky team, again, I coached -- I was at Alabama for 6 years.
Coach Cal does a great job of putting guys in spots and mixing talents
together.  
  
I think probably our guys' adjustment that would be made will be the speed
because their speed doesn't show up on tape as well as it shows up in person.  
  
Q. John, you were running through some metrics about how NKU has evolved
in recent years. How big a platform is just this playing U.K. in the NCAA
tournament to sort of spread that story throughout the commonwealth?  
COACH BRANNEN: It's going to the NCAA first and foremost. Only two teams since
1970 have done it in their first year. That's a tremendous accomplishment that
our guys will get a chance to take stock in when the season's over because
it's just not normal.  
  
Now, it wasn't a Cinderella story. This is a team 12-6 in the regular season,
tied for third in the league. This is a quality basketball team. Put on top of
the fact that you get to play Kentucky, that adds to it. You'll play somebody
really good regardless of whether you're a 14 or 15.  
  
Q. There have been 15s that beat 2s in recent years. How does that play
on your mind?  
COACH BRANNEN: It doesn't play on mine because I think each game is its own
situation and each game's got its own life. Maybe it plays to -- speaks to the
confidence of maybe other teams or maybe some of my players. But specifically
to us, we've got a task at hand that we've got to be able to accomplish, and
we've got to prepare to do that. We prepared all week. It will be a
possession-by-possession thing. Really doesn't speak much to anything that
really influences us this week.  
  
Was that the answer you thought?  
  
THE MODERATOR: See you tomorrow, Coach.  
  
COACH BRANNEN: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
INDIANAPOLIS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+INDIANAPOLIS)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Beilein.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: We're thrilled to be in Indianapolis, in the heart of the Big
Ten. We have a lot of fans in this area in the NCAA tournament. Two men
sitting next to me for four years have been great representatives of our
university. They're playing as well as anybody can play, and we want to keep
playing for a long time.  
  
Oklahoma State, however, is a terrific team that has had a tremendous season,
outstanding talent, outstanding coach. They'll be standing in our way. It's
going to be a great game tomorrow. I wish both teams the best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Now we'll take questions for the players.  
  
Q. For both players, after the emotional ride you guys had in the Big
Ten tournament, how do you kind of reset, move on to this and not kind of have
a letdown after that?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think we've been on quite a wave over the past week. I know it
was a great accomplishment for us to be able to win the Big Ten tournament
championship and being able to go home, get a couple of days of rest I think
was key for us. I think now we're back, ready to go.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Just like he said, just reiterating to the guys that we
still got some things we want to take care of, reset our minds and our focus.
Just feels great to get back out and be back in a place like this with great
fans. The excitement is going to be surreal.  
  
Q. This is for both Derrick and Zak. Can you take us back to last week
and the decision to actually continue to play and fly to Washington, D.C.,
rather than forfeit the rest of the tournament?  
ZAK IRVIN: Definitely was tough for all of us, but I just think the hardest
part for our team was just getting back on the plane. Once we landed back in
D.C., we felt like why can't we just go out and win this all. Why can't this
be one of the greatest stories ever told. That was just our mindset throughout
the whole tournament. We just wanted to win and play well for our brothers. It
was a brotherhood for us.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Just like he said, get back on the plane was definitely
tough. Once we got on the plane and landed, we were able to focus our minds on
basketball and pretty much lock in for those four, five days and do exactly
what we went down there and wanted to do.  
  
Q. Zak, what's it mean for you to be able to come back home and finish
your run here? You're familiar with, you had that great shot to beat IU here
in the Big Ten tournament last year.  
ZAK IRVIN: It's nice to be back. I'm excited. It's always nice to play in your
hometown, especially with how we're playing right now. We're trying to take it
one game at a time. Like I said, it's nice to be back here.  
  
Q. Just talk about what the reaction was like on campus when you got
back and just kind of what this past week before you came here was like?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: No, not exactly. We haven't -- we've been locked in the
gym and just locked into each other. We really haven't been -- not really able
to interact with any of our students or our fans. But I'm pretty sure they
were excited. They always show us great support on social media outlets so
they made sure to let us know they were proud of us.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: Outside of class, we haven't seen many people, but they're proud of
us and are just rooting us on.  
  
Q. Derrick, how much do you know about Juwan Evans? Have you been able
to watch him from your film study? Are you guys very comparable as players?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: Personally, I do a lot of film study personally on my
own. I have a good friend at Iowa State, Monte Morris, so I get to chat with
him about point guard match-ups. I think he plays a lot like Chris Paul. He's
good at changing speeds. I think he's a good player.  
  
Q. What did Monte tell you?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I think I'm going to keep that between us two.  
  
Q. Derrick and Zak, you guys weren't projected to win the Big Ten
tournament. So then once you did win that, how much did that change your
expectations of what you can accomplish in this tournament?  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I think what's so special about our team is not about
what we're seeded as. We always focus on how we play and how we execute
things. We feel like if we do things to our best ability, we can pretty much
accomplish anything.  
  
So going out and winning the Big Ten tournament was a big accomplishment. But
like I said, it doesn't end there for us. We have bigger sights on things.
Overall, we're more so excited that we're finally able to implement things
that Coach has been preaching the entire year.  
  
ZAK IRVIN: For us, we try to tune out the outside noise and play for each
other. Winning the Big Ten tournament championship was a big goal of ours.
We're not done yet. We want to be playing our best basketball in March and
April. We're doing that now.  
  
Q. For both players, from the outside looking in, you just see a line
last week that says, the Michigan plane skidded off the runway and there was
no serious injuries.  
I don't know if you guys want to revisit that or not. From guys who were on
the inside, do you think that -- you know, was there a real fright in your
minds and hearts? Do you think that had any affect on bringing you guys
together and what happened in Washington?  
  
ZAK IRVIN: We're just trying to really move past that. We're already a close-
knit group. If possible, I think that brought us closer, especially going
through something like that, so we just wanted to come out there and play for
each other. Like I said, the hardest part for us was getting back on the
plane. Once we landed in D.C., we wanted to go out there and play the game
that we love.  
  
DERRICK WALTON, JR.: I say it all the time, I believe God is good. We avoided
something that could have been tragic. Something happened in our life and
brought us a lot closer. Like I said, we were there for a reason. It happened
for a reason. The way we responded, I was very proud of it. It's one of those
memories that will stay with me for the rest of my life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. We'll continue with Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. John, when you got to Michigan, they'd had a long drought from the
NCAA tournament. In your second year, you got there and you won a game. How
important was it not just to get there, but to win and reestablish the winning
culture at Michigan?  
COACH BEILEIN: That was the goal. It wasn't just to get there and say, okay,
we did it. It was to -- Michigan has had periods that they were a fixture in
this tournament over time, and that was the whole thing. You look at the best
teams in our league over the last 30 years, they have the -- Wisconsins, the
Michigan States have been in every year. They're just there every year. That's
where we always felt Michigan belongs, to be in that crowd.  
  
So this is seven out of nine. We're moving in the right direction. We've got a
little bit injuries and some early pro attrition got in the way for one year.
But we feel real good about that we can try to stay at the top in the Big Ten.  
  
Now, the Big Ten has changed drastically since I got there. There's 14 teams.
There's a ton of great coaches. It is going to be hard for anybody to maintain
what Wisconsin, Michigan State have really been able to do for the last two
decades. Those are the two -- the Indiana, the Purdues, ourselves, we've been
predominantly there, but not like those two teams have been there.  
  
So I think those days may be over for everybody. We'll wait and see. But our
goal is to be like that. Every year, we're in there. Some years, you're really
good. Some years, you're just happy to get in. But that's the type of mindset
we want to have.  
  
The whole goal at Michigan is to win championships. And if you compete for a
Big Ten championships, you're going to compete for national championships. No
matter what anybody tells you, our league, year in and year out, can play with
anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, when you come out of a long conference season and you're
familiar with your opponents and you come into this, is there a danger of
overloading players with too much granular information or what is your
approach?  
COACH BEILEIN: It's a balance. You have to have that. You have to be prepared
for a team that is going to be unique to you. At the same time, you can't make
yourself unique to yourself by trying to out-trick them.  
  
So they will, in two days, try to -- and we will do the same, try to guard
Oklahoma State. They'll be trying to run their stuff against our -- the
schemes in our defense.  
  
But, again, it's usually -- I think most coaches will say this, and I don't
know if I'll say this tomorrow or not. It's a breath of fresh air to get
outside your conference because at least you're not -- I mean, Coach Painter,  
  
Coach Izzo, Coach Mata. It's been ten years. It's like up to 25 games against
each other over those ten years.  
  
You're pretty used to each other, and you might try some trickery here and
there.  
  
Now it's a whole different thing. The game's opened up. I think the game may
be called a little differently as well during the NCAA tournament. We probably
get back to some of the norms they wanted to set early in the year. So should
be a lot of fun to play.  
  
Q. John, we know what changed emotionally last week. What changed on the
court to where you guys were able to go through that, win that tournament and
now reset the expectations here in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BEILEIN: First of all, we were playing good basketball the whole month
of February. It wasn't, I hear, 8 seed. We were tied for 5th. It was a
tiebreaker. We were a game out of second and third. It wasn't a crazy story
that all of a sudden an 8 is a 1. We'd already beaten Purdue once. And
Wisconsin, we ended up beating them once. So it wasn't like a Cinderella
story.  
  
What made it Cinderella was the circumstance. It wasn't just skidding off the
runway. It was full going, 150 miles an hour, we can't stop. And our kids got
-- thank goodness the plane didn't flip. All kinds of things could have
happened once we got off the plane and looked.  
  
There's that one thing. There's that one shot in the game. There's that one
play in the game that can change a season. Couple that with what happened on
last Wednesday, and I think it was what just a little bit extra that we
needed.  
  
We had just gone to Nebraska, that's had really good success at their place
and away, and it was a 30-point game. So we were really playing well down the
stretch.  
  
Q. John, you had the near scare, the near tragedy on the airplane.
You're playing a program that went through a tragedy like that. 2001.  
COACH BEILEIN: Exactly.  
  
Q. Did you think about the Oklahoma State plane crash at any point
during this last few days, even before you drew them?  
COACH BEILEIN: I mentioned it, but only to my family about, you know, I tried
not to think about what could have happened, particularly if the plane would
have got up in the air. I don't think it makes it, just obviously didn't have
enough force to get up in the air. But if it gets up a little bit, now we got
a whole different deal.  
  
So thank goodness the pilot put on the brakes. I thought about that. I thought
about Evansville. I thought about Marshall. You think about all those
tragedies that have happened in sports that really there's a lot of -- we're
just blessed. We're just blessed that it never got to that point.  
  
But I've known Eddie Sutton for a long time. I really thought about that, how
a coach goes through that.  
  
Q. John, get your reaction to Indiana firing Tom Crean today.  
COACH BEILEIN: It's an unfortunate part of your business that so many of your
friends, so many guys you coach against every day, that there's a change in
direction at the schools.  
  
So I don't know a lot about it. All I know is Tom's a heck of a coach. We had
some -- he's won some championships there, right. But I think we all
understand, given the way we are -- the way we are compensated, it's a part of
the business and we better be ready to roll with it if it happens to us or to
others.  
  
Q. Coach, now that you've had a chance to watch Jawun Evans a couple
times on film, how similar is he with Derrick on the court or even the
intangible parts of being a point guard?  
COACH BEILEIN: We're really big into we have Darius Morris, Trey Burke,
Derrick Walton. We've been blessed with point guards. We've examined that.
What he's done with assist numbers, his lack of turnovers is incredible and
his speed of the game. I compare him a lot to a kid that gave us fits. Nate
Mason from Minnesota is a really eye level point guard that can shoot it in.
That's not all he does.  
  
He's getting the ball in the basket, and he's got a great assist/turnover
ratio. This young man is special. I recruited both Monte and Derrick. There's
no wrong choice there. And that league has some great guards in it. And he's
two -- those two are really two of the finest, but really a challenge for us
because he's so talented.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, John.  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Thanks.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Purdue - 80, Iowa State - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Iowa State Head Coach, Steve Prohm, and Iowa State
student-athletes, Monte Morris, who had 18 points, Matt Thomas, who had 20,
and Milwaukee native Deonte Burton, who had 25. We'll have an opening
statement from the Coach, and then questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH PROHM: First off, just want to congratulate Purdue and Coach Painter and
their team on advancing to the Sweet 16 in today's victory. Good luck to them
going forward.  
  
You know, just the biggest thing today, on days like this, is you're just
disappointed it ends. The last thing I told the guys in the locker room, the
last six, seven weeks of the season we were playing as good as anybody in the
country. These guys were a ton of fun to be around. We changed as a team. We
grew as a team. And the hardest thing to do right now is say goodbye, because
you're saying goodbye to the winningest senior class in the history of the
school.  
  
They've done amazing things on and off the floor. That's the toughest part,
that you know at some point, you've got to say goodbye to these guys. I was
hoping I would get to coach them a couple more weeks. It wasn't in the cards.
It wasn't in the plans.  
  
And so I wish these guys well and they know I'll always be there for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Deonte, the missed free throw with 11 seconds left and the long
rebound, was that just simply a matter of it was too deep a rebound?  
DEONTE BURTON: No. I didn't box him out enough. I should have pushed him
further out and then tried to get the rebound.  
  
Q. Deonte, what about your game today? You looked like you were a man on
a mission, that you were playing for your life out there and putting the team
on your back and doing everything possible to not let the season end
tonight.  
DEONTE BURTON: We were playing for our lives. It was a win-or-go-home game. I
didn't want to go home. I tried to put everything I could into the game
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Monte, at a time like this I know it's very difficult but
you've had such a great career. There any sort of perspective or what do you
take away from the season and your career?  
  
MONTE MORRIS: I just took away from this season that it's going to be ups and
downs in life and sometimes you don't know why, but, you know, I'm in
reference to this season. We had some low times this season where people
didn't think or believe we would be here this far. Going forward just when
adversity hits you in life, you got to persevere and answer with no hostility
and be, you know, successful and that's what this team did.  
  
I take my hat off to everyone of my teammates because we stuck together and
made it this far. It was a long journey and I wouldn't change nothing or a
group of guys or coaching staff to play with.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Matt, you're from Onalaska, Wisconsin. To be in your home state
and play as well as you did, can you talk just talk about the emotions of the
evening?  
  
MATT THOMAS: It was cool for me, cool for our other three guys from Milwaukee
being back home. Down the road, 10, 15 years be able to reflect and
understand, you know, how special these four years was, especially this one
year as a senior and all the things we did and what we accomplished as a team.
It's tough right now to step back and see that, but I love these guys and I
wouldn't want to go out with a better group.  
  
Q. For anybody, what was the difference from the first 30 minutes to the
last ten?  
MATT THOMAS: I just think it was our sense of urgency. We're a resilient
group. We play with a lot of grit and toughness. For whatever reason we didn't
come out necessarily ready to go in the first half. But you know, we had been
in that situation before and that's what we talked about at halftime, and once
we got on that run, you know, we made things happen and we made it
interesting. We just were one or two plays short of capping that win off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thank you, guys.  
  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about what Deonte was able to do defensively on
Caleb Swanigan tonight?  
COACH PROHM: I mean, he just competed the second half. I mean he just
competed. He's a tough kid. Really our best -- Solomon is a good post
defender. Deonte is probably our best at times, majority of the time. He's so
strong, his lower body is so strong and athletic. He can front and still be
able to get a deflection or steal or kind of sneak around there in the post.  
  
Second half he was a lot more better and engaged on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Steve, can you speak a little bit on what the senior class has
accomplished and what it means for the program moving forward without them?  
COACH PROHM: Yeah. These seniors have been amazing. I've talked about them a
lot. I've been very open about that, about, you know, what they've meant to
this program. I asked them beginning of the year, you know, nobody really knew
what this team was going to be like. We lost a lot of really good players from
last year's team and we had some holes and some uncertainty with some new guys
coming in.  
  
I challenged them leave your jersey in a better place. Then I internally said
hey, we got to get back to the NCAA Tournament, hopefully we can win a
championship and then hopefully we can get back to another Sweet 16 and see
what happens.  
  
This senior class went to four straight NCAA Tournaments. Only ten programs in
the country have been to six straight or more. They've won 20 or more games
every season. I think only like 13 BCS level schools have done that six
straight years. Three Big 12 Tournament titles. And then you're saying goodbye
to two of the best 3-point shooters to ever come through here. And then, you
know, with all respect to Jamaal Tinsley and Hornacek, probably the best point
guard ever come through this school.  
  
They did it the right way and they represented the program the right way and
everything you heard about them was the good, you know. They weren't ever in
the news for anything else but how they represented this program on and off
the floor.  
  
And so I think this is just a special program where you have to continue to
recruit guys that can do that. If you're going to play at Iowa State and in
certain other programs in the country, you got to be a great player and you
got to have great character and toughness, but you got to be able to impact
people. You got to be able to interact with the community, interact with the
alumni, be ready to take pictures, shake hands, because that's part of it with
the fan base and the passion these people have.  
  
Those guys embraced it. It's the toughest thing about ending is, you know, I
love Monte Morris, I love Naz Long, I love Matt Thomas and Darrell, too. It's
just tough to say goodbye to those guys because those shoes are going to be
extremely hard to fill. But everywhere I've been the next guy comes along and
that's my staff's job to do is to continue to recruit the next guy. And I told
them in the locker room over the last couple weeks, I've heard from "Ian,"
from "Eja", from Melvin, I've heard from Fred, I've heard from Fizer, Jamaal
Tinsley the other day, and that's when you know you have a real program where
the alumni and the former players are following everything you do, and you
can't let those guys down.  
  
And these seniors didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, were you impressed by the way that Purdue was able to weather
the storm when you guys came back and took the lead? As many fans as you
brought out here to Milwaukee, that Purdue in kind of a road environment for
them was able to restabilize themselves and retake control.  
COACH PROHM: We got the lead 73-71, I think with Deonte's free throws, and
I'll have to look at the tape to see how Thompson got the open 3 put that
thing went (indicating) all the way around, hit the backboard and then back in
to go up 1.  
  
I can't remember what we did on the offensive end. They came back. They've got
some guys and went up 3, and then I think that's when I called timeout and
that was probably -- I should have let those guys play in space again. I think
that's what we did in the second half, we got to spread you out. Kind of how
we used to play earlier in the season, 5 out and looking to drive them.  
  
I think we just kind of got caught up in a pick-and-roll situation and ended
up turning it over, but we still had a chance. We didn't rebound that ball at
the end. But you know, game like this you can look back at a lot of difficult
things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Purdue - 80, Iowa State -76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Purdue Head Coach, Matt Painter, and Purdue student-
athletes, Vincent Edwards, who had 21 points, 10 rebounds, Issac Haas, who had
14 points, and Caleb Swanigan, who had 20 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists.
An opening statement from Coach, and then questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Well, unbelievable game. Iowa State is a great basketball team.
I think they showed that in the second half. I thought, you know, at times
when Burton was putting the ball on the floor, it was so hard because they
have so many shooters that are out there to try to give some help on his
drives. They made some 3s and some -- just some tough shots that you don't
know what to say to your guys in the huddle. I think they showed why they're
an exceptional basketball team.  
  
Our guys played a really good first half. I thought in the second half we had
some good looks that didn't go down. We had some balls at the basket. We had
some 3s that were good shots. They just didn't go down. But we hung in there.
To be able to withstand things after they take the lead, lot of times when you
get up 16, 17 points, someone takes the lead, it's hard to recover. I thought
our guys kept their poise. Got in key offensive rebounds on the last three,
four minutes and made some obviously some key plays. And it was great to see
P.J. Thompson there at the end knock down those two free throws to seal it
after Biggie got that rebound. That was a huge rebound, to be able to make
that play at that time to give us a chance to make the next two free throws
and seal the deal. Just proud of our guys the way they play, these three guys
were obviously exceptional.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Caleb, just generally what does it mean to you to be moving on to the
Sweet 16 now?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: I'm excited. I'm ready to get back to campus and get to work
and watch the game tomorrow, Kansas-Michigan State, and see who is left.  
  
COACH PAINTER: That's great. That's all we get? That's beautiful.  
  
Q. This is for any of you guys. What was the message at halftime?
Obviously you knew that they weren't going to roll over and lay down and walk
away. And sure enough, you get the big lead but they make the big run. Were
you probably ready for that? What was the tone, what was the message?  
VINCE EDWARDS: We tried to talk out all our mistakes in the first half. 0-0,
our coach said, try to tell us what they saw. I just kept trying to tell the
guys, you know, everybody makes a run. It's March, it's Madness. It happens.
We got to be able to withstand it. I'm proud of this whole team and the
coaching staff to be able to withstand that run and be able to hold on to it
is unbelievable.  
  
Q. Vince, you're a veteran. You've been around. How would you put this
one emotionally to some of the others games in your career?  
VINCE EDWARDS: You make me so old. It's just huge. I've never been past the
First Round. To be here and to be going into a Sweet 16, I can't even describe
the words that I'm feeling right now. It's crazy.  
  
Q. Issac, for you as well, what does it mean to you to be going to the
Sweet 16, and what did you learn about yourself and your teammates that you
gave up the big lead but then sustained or were able to overcome?  
ISSAC HAAS: It shows maturity. And like Vince said, we maintain our poise when
they took that lead and we knew that they had a run in them. That was it. We
managed to overcome that. And I'm just really excited to be here, and then now
it's on to the next one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Vince, what's going through your mind when they're making that run
and you're down to the last couple of minutes and you got the make some
plays?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I was praying, you know. They got going, and those guys, hats
off to Iowa State. They're a really good team. They were making individual
plays at the end. Some guys got hot. You know, we were just -- I kept trying
to tell myself stay poised, stay calm. And we were all just talking out and
kept telling each other we got this, we got this. We were able to stick it out
and win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Thanks, guys.
Congratulations on advancing to the Sweet 16.  
  
Questions for Coach Painter, please.  
  
Q. Matt, is this game pretty much the definition of survive and advance
for you guys?  
COACH PAINTER: No question about it. When we went to the Sweet 16 with Robbie
Hummel, JaJuan Johnson, E'Twaun Moore, we played Washington. They had Isaiah
Thomas and they had three guys score 20 or more against us. Same thing. We're
up 13 at the half, and you knew they were going to make the run but did it in
the same fashion that Washington did. They weren't running offense. They
cleared us out. They were making plays.  
  
Sometimes that's the hardest thing to do as a coach because you feel helpless.
You don't feel like you can help them in that regard, because if you come in
and help and stop the basketball, their shooters are so good they're going to
expose you. And if you don't, then they are going to take you off the dribble
with Burton. We hung in there, and we had to make offensive plays. You know
they were going to score the basketball. We had to make offensive plays, and
obviously we made just enough.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you rank this team with how well they execute?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought we executed and did a good job. I thought we got the
ball where we wanted to. In the second half we had some things not go our way.
We had some open looks, especially that one at the very end. But I thought our
guys did a really good job of executing and running our stuff and kind of
picking their spots.  
  
In the first half they did a really good job of picking their spots, when to
push, when to shoot quick. We were a little trigger-happy to start the game in
how many 3s we were taking. If you look at our percentages, we have good
shooters. I don't mind that.  
  
Q. Matt, on the TV broadcast they were showing the post-game locker room
and everybody is going nuts. You walked in and talked with them briefly and
said something about "for future reference." Can you give us an idea what you
said?  
COACH PAINTER: I was talking about fouling. It's a hard thing to do when you
don't want to burn your timeout and you're up 2 and your free throw shooter
makes 1 to go up 3, but if he misses the next one with seven seconds to go,
it's a hard thing to be able to say if you miss this one, you know, we're
going to foul because that's what we normally do. We do it on a time basis.  
  
But I was trying to talk to the other two guards that were there. And so
that's all I was talking about, just because if we would have missed that free
throw, we were going to foul once he crossed half court.  
  
Q. Coach, in the past -- last two years close losses coming down at the
end. Do you think your core group now that they're mostly, other than
Swanigan, juniors, do you think they built off those past -- the last two
years and kind of just handled it much better because they went through
that?  
COACH PAINTER: I think we've learned a lot. Those games that we've won in the
past, they were close games also. And the games you lose, they're normally
close games in the tournament, too. You just try to learn from your
experiences. I think it sits with them when it's always -- you know, lot of
times you don't really sit on things too much with the things that are remind
-- people remind you of.  
  
When you lose at the end of the year, you always remember that. You always
remember that last loss and how that felt. And so when you lose back-to-back
years in overtime, it sits with you, whether you miss a free throw or miss an
assignment or turn the basketball over. As a player you want that next chance
to get yourself in that position again so you can do it and not go home with
that overtime loss.  
  
Q. Matt, personally what is the significance for you to be going back to
the Sweet 16, I think since the first time since 2010?  
COACH PAINTER: I think that's right. I think that's right. It's huge. You
know, you win first round games and lose first round games. You try to put
yourself in position in the matchups. And we were in this position last year
to play Iowa State to hopefully go to the Sweet 16 and we lost. You just feel
for your players. I'm happy for our players, happy for our fans. We've hung in
there. We have a good group of guys and they're fun to be around. So I'm just
happy for those guys.  
  
Q. On the inbound play that went to Dakota Mathias, was he the one you
wanted to put the ball in his hands? He's like 85 or whatever?  
COACH PAINTER: Yes, sir. He's around 83, I think.  
  
Q. It didn't work out though.  
COACH PAINTER: No, it didn't. He's not a hundred (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. Haas had about 14 points in nine minutes. How hard was it to not play
him late and what are the thought processes?  
COACH PAINTER: 14 points in 15 minutes.  
  
Q. Was it?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah. It's still pretty good, huh, a point a minute? It drives
you nuts because you want him in the game and you want him to be on the
offensive end. And it's so hard sometimes to do it, we're so big. What
everybody thinks about that, they always think that's your advantage, and it
is your advantage. He proved it tonight when he was in there. But when they go
super small -- see, they didn't put Burton -- a lot of our talk at halftime
was Burton playing the 5. Those guys said, "Coach, he hasn't played the 5."
It's coming. They're going to flip it on us because they can't guard us down
there and they're going to make sure their offensive end is working.  
  
No matter who they put down there that they're not going to be able to stop
our big guys. They're -- now they want to expose us on the other end. It's
really hard for us because you want him in the game. He's -- he really played
well here and did some good things here today and -- but he keeps a positive
attitude and keeps playing, and we'll looking forward to playing next weekend
with him.  
  
Q. Matt, what does it mean to you that Biggie is now getting a chance to
show the entire country what he's about and how he's a Player of the Year
candidate?  
COACH PAINTER: I think today you saw it. He got the huge rebound there at the
end, and then P.J. gets the -- gets the ball to P.J. and makes the 2 free
throws, getting the 7 assists. His decision-making and his passing today were
big.  
  
Obviously he's put up points and rebounds all year, but I thought he did a
really good job of making decisions. It's great for everybody to see -- he
would be one of those guys that would be a good player if he was 5-11. Just a
very small player, got good instincts, and one of the best players in the
country, if not the best.  
  
Q. Do you feel this team has maybe resolve other teams hasn't had, a
poise?  
COACH PAINTER: We're a skilled team. At the end of games this year, even
though we missed one at the end there, we've been able to make some key
perimeter shots and been able to make some key free throws. I think that kind
of resolve and just little bit of experience of going through it and having
some struggles in the past. This year we've actually done pretty well in close
games. I think the more you can win close games, the more confidence you
build.  
  
We felt terrible about our loss in the Big Ten Tournament. We miss a layup and
free throw in the last minute, minute and ten of that game, and those are
plays that we've made all year. And so I know that's set with a couple of our
guys, and both those guys may plays for us today.  
  
Q. Matt, the Big Ten has taken some criticism, not being as good as
years past. With what Wisconsin did today, Michigan State winning last night,
what you guys did night, what message does it send about the league?  
COACH PAINTER: Our league is very good. Obviously, we have very good coaches.
Lot of times people compare it. For us as coaches and players, it's hard to
talk about it. You guys seem to get a theme, whether it's good or bad. Tell
them to go play Michigan. People that don't think our league is any good, tell
them to go play Wisconsin. They're not an 8th seed. I don't understand that.
You don't understand basketball if you put Wisconsin as the 8th seed.
Wisconsin is one of the toughest teams in the country, period. And sure they
struggled a little bit at the end. Everybody has something outside of four,
five teams where you struggle.  
  
We got a good league. You play Michigan State, you better bring your lunch. I
can talk about the teams that didn't make it that are tough. Iowa this year
was an unbelievable out. They beat us. Nebraska beat us. We have a tough
league across the board.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH PAINTER: All right.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
BUTLER - 74, MIDDLE TENNESSEE - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Butler Head Coach, Chris Holtmann and Butler student-
athletes, Andrew Chrabascz, who had 15 points, Kamar Baldwin, had 13, Kelan
Martin, 19 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists. We'll start with an opening
statement from the Coach, then take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Really proud of our guys. We beat a really good team in Middle
Tennessee. We got so much respect for how Kermit's team plays and how they
compete. And we saw it in film for the last, you know, 36 hours and impressed.
I loved our guys. I loved the fight they showed possession after possession.
And players win games. We've got really good players and they had a heck of an
effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Andrew and Kelan, just to get through this round after losing the
last two years here, is there a big sense of relief?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I mean, for sure. Before the week started, we knew that this
was a one-week-at-a-time thing, one day at a time, even. Getting past today
with a W and going to this one, we knew it would be a big challenge. Getting
the W today it is a relief. We're not done yet. We're going to have to focus
for whoever our next opponent is coming up.  
  
KELAN MARTIN: I agree with Andrew. I think we know that Winthrop and Middle
Tennessee was tough. It's tough games throughout this tournament. Nothing is
going to be easy, and it's just one game at a time, one possession at a time.
I think for us staying together was the biggest key to our victory.  
  
Q. Andrew, you seemed to get more touches in the second half than the
first. Was that something that was discussed at halftime, was that a point of
emphasis, or was that just kind of the way that the things evolved?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Just how they evolved. People finding me in open areas,
coaches making great calls. I mean, when they find me in the sweet spot, I
have to be aggressive or I'm making a fault to the team passing it out.  
  
Especially with the way they weren't helping off too much with Avery sitting
right in front of me, that's an unbelievable shooter, obviously. Opened the
floor completely. It definitely was a huge factor for us.  
  
Q. Kamar, Giddy Potts scoreless tonight, 0-7 on the heels of Keon
Johnson, 7-19. I know it's not just you, but you've primary duty on those
guys. What went into your preparation with this matchup, especially with two
days going into it?  
KAMAR BALDWIN: Just make them take tough shots the whole game. It was a great
team effort. It took the whole unit to keep those guys in check, and we were
able to do that both games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelan, you guys had gotten into some foul trouble there in the second
half. You had to switch off on Williams a couple times there and Upshaw a lot
can. You just talk about your defensive and the way you had to step up
there?  
KELAN MARTIN: They're not your typical big men. They both are like 3s and 4s,
so I think me and my team stepped up defensively and we just tried to make
them take tough shots, like Kamar said.  
  
Q. Kelan, you I think had been urged for the last three seasons by Coach
Holtmann to influence the game more than on just by shooting, and we saw that
in multiple ways today. Is that something that you're like mindful of
everyday? Does it come more naturally? Just kind of how did that whole process
work? Since you're coming off the bench in February, you're efficiency ratings
have been extremely high.  
KELAN MARTIN: Just a mindset, a want -- you got to want to defend, want to
rebound. Then just doing other things an scoring, impacting the game in other
ways. I think I've been doing that coming off the bench since February, like
you said. Just, you know, bringing energy to the game, you know, and I think
I've been doing that. That's why we've been advancing, you know.  
  
Q. This question is for any of you guys. Middle Tennessee State never
had the lead tonight and part of that was due to the hot shooting you guys had
early. Just generally speaking, how different is it to play with a little bit
of an advantage from the beginning so that you don't have to chase for 35
minutes the way that they did? How different is that feeling? Because I'm sure
at times you guys have been in both spots over the course of your careers.  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I mean, we know how explosive they are at the same time. So
we're never relaxed in those moments. Like you said, we were shooting really
well, but we know that the only way you're going to win in these games is
making sure your defense is on point. So, making sure we were focusing on
that, and even when they made the run late in the second half, we knew we had
to gather back together. And like I said, the game is not in our hands by any
means until the final buzzer goes. That was a big thing for us.  
  
Q. Sorry if you've been asked this yet -- before, but did it take a
little while to get used to that defense? They were 1-3-1, it morphed into
2-3, did all kinds of different stuff. Did it take awhile before you felt
comfortable attacking it?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Yeah. We've seen 1-3-1, but nothing like that honestly.
That's way more extended than we were seeing. I know I was a little sloppy
with it today, but once you got comfortable with it, you look over the top of
it a little bit more. That's when we were able to find open opportunities in
the corners especially and penetrate. But, yeah, it's something very unique
and definitely -- you can practice it as much as you want, but once you see it
in a game, it's something completely different because they practice it over
and over and over again. We were luckily able to adapt pretty quickly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thanks, guys.
Congratulations on advancing to the Sweet 16.  
  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Chris, if you had to identify one or two or three things that led to
this outcome, what was your checklist?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We made shots, for one. You know, things look different when
you make shots. I think that opens some things for us. I knew we were going
the make shots against their changing defense. I thought defensively we were
really solid. I thought our zone really helped us, kept them out of the paint
some, and that was important for us. But I thought our man and zone were both
really effective.  
  
And then I thought our guys played with great resilience like they have all
year. We've got really good players who play with the right mindset and
respond to the adversity in the game with the right maturity. And I think we
need a resiliency against a team we really respect.  
  
Q. Coach, did you like -- what was the big thing for Andrew in the
second half, the way that -- at times he took over the game?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We went to him some on the low block a little bit more. We've
done that the bulk of -- you know, we've tried to close games playing threw
him in the last seven, eight minutes. It's not too different. It's hard to
maybe do that the whole game because teams change how they guard them and
stuff, plus we placed him at the 5th, which helped us in a mismatch.  
  
Q. Chris, you -- I think, you mentioned three times in the news
conference yesterday that Middle Tennessee was a Final Four and kind of the
trendy pick to win. Did you get -- kind of deliver a similar message to your
guys? Seemed like you were trying to get them back in the underdog position,
which this program has traditionally operated well out of?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I was just reading my phone. I was just reading what people
were sending me, honestly, David. I had a coach friend of mine send me a clip
yesterday of CBS Sports Network saying we weren't good enough to be beat them,
we didn't have good enough players to beat Middle Tennessee.  
  
I would like to call those guys out. I would love to. I won't. I didn't show
that to our guys, but to say it burned me up, it absolutely did. Did we say to
them that there was no question that they were the trendy pick to beat us?
Absolutely. You know, I mean -- you know, as I said earlier to our team in
there, as the late Joe Cornet said, we're still here.  
  
Q. Chris, how did you feel -- how did you feel like you needed to
massage the foul troubles that your guys had? I know you went to a zone after
a couple of guys got in foul trouble.  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah. The hardest stretch for us was when AC got -- when
Andrew got two fouls earlier in the first half, because he is a guy we play
through so much and he's great at reading things and solid defensively. So,
balancing that was critical. And then we had that kind of rough stretch in the
first half where he was out. That was a concern for me, but getting to the
half with him with two fouls was critical. And then I think the zone did help
us because they were going to just throw it inside on us if we didn't mix it
up a little bit.  
  
Q. Your players talked about it, but was there anything specific were
you doing on Potts? I know Savage was in his shirt most of the game. He looked
really, really frustrated. They were trying to run him off screens. I think
that's only the second time in his career he's been held scoreless.  
COACH HOLTMANN: He's a really good player. He's a really good player. I think
our guys just made him work, just tried to make him work, be where he was at,
find him in the zone or man, had great awareness of him. You know, 30, 22, and
20, man, are they really good. I got a lot of respect for how they play and
how hard they play, the whole team, how Kermit coaches those guys. I got so
much respect for what they bring to the game. To get -- they're 31-5. There's
no way they were a 12 seed. So, to hold him scoreless was big.  
  
Q. As the game played out and Potts was not as much of a factor as
Middle Tennessee would have hoped, were you able to do anything defensively to
adjust and focus more attention in other areas, perhaps that you thought might
have helped you?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Not necessarily. I think we just tried the stick to the game
plan. We didn't do a whole lot of stuff. We trapped the post a few times
because we knew they were going to go there. It wasn't real effective, to be
real honest. No, he's a guy that can get 8, 9 on you in a real hurry. We
didn't feel like at anytime we really took him out of the game. We tried to
stay as highly detailed with him as possible.  
  
Q. Chris, when you have that quick turnaround, how much of a challenge
is it to face a team that kind of plays a difficult kind of defense? What did
you do to prepare besides the experience you had against Xavier?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah. I'll tell you, Bob, our staff did an outstanding job
with these two game plans. They really did. I can't say that enough. Terry
Johnson, Ryan Pedon, Mike Schrage, and Emerson Kampen, Brandon Crone, they did
a terrific job preparing this game plan in a really simple way against a
complex defensive team. And that was really our approach is we wanted to be
simple, more than anything with a quick turnaround. And we tried to get as
much in yesterday as possible and so that today they could play with a free
mind.  
  
I told them, hey, by noon today the game plan is going -- you're going to know
it backwards and forwards. You're going to be able to relax until tip and play
with a free mind. Our staff did a great job doing that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? All right. Thank you. Congratulations.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: That's right guys.

### [Reggie Upshaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30720)

### [JaCorey Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33128)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Butler - 74, Middle Tennessee - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Middle Tennessee Head Coach, Kermit Davis, and
Middle Tennessee student-athletes, JaCorey Williams, who had 20 points, 9
rebounds, Reggie Upshaw, who had 12 points, and Antwain Johnson, who had 19
points. We'll have an opening statement from Coach and then questions from the
student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH DAVIS: First of all, I can't express, as I told our guys in the locker
room, how much fun that they brought to Middle Tennessee fans and myself
personally, how they represented us, you know. 31 wins is an unbelievable
feat. We're all heartbroken. We wanted to get back to our home state in
Memphis and play in the Sweet 16.  
  
Butler played terrific. They came in 15 for their last 50 from 3 and just got
off the a great hot start, and I thought they were physical. We kind of chased
them the whole game. Kind of chased them and fought it and fought it and
fought it and got it back to one possession game, and they just made a big 3
when the game was 3.  
  
They just kind of tonight beat us in some of the areas we won a lot of games.
Terrific year for us, and these three guys right here played really well
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Antwain, 19 points. What was key for you tonight?  
ANTWAIN JOHNSON: It wasn't any way different. I was just trying to win.  
  
Q. Reggie, Giddy came up to both you guys after the game, he said, "My
fault." Have you been able to talk with him at all in the aftermath here?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: No. When we got to the locker room, Coach Davis, he addressed
the team and told us how he was proud of what we've done over the last year.
And after that, everybody was kind of upset with how we played and that we
didn't make it back to Memphis to play in front of our home state and our home
fans. But I haven't said anything to Giddy yet.  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: Not at all. He's kind of torn right now. Felt like he could
have helped a little more. Let him cool off, and we'll talk to him later.  
  
Q. Reggie, you close out one of the best careers ever at Middle
Tennessee. Talk about your four years and how special it was for you.  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I wouldn't trade anything that I've been through while I was
here for anything in the world, you know. Coming here, I wasn't the most
highly recruited athlete in my state or at my school or anything like that.
And for Coach Davis to take a chance on me and see something in me that I
didn't see in myself, you know, the way that he's helped me grow as a player
and as a man, it's what Middle Tennessee is about. And you know, coming here
and being a part of the different championship teams and the two NCAA
appearances, you know, I would have never imagined myself doing this.  
  
But again, I just have to thank Coach Davis and the rest of the coaches for
taking a chance and seeing something in me that I didn't ever expect to see in
myself.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. JaCorey, there in the first half you guys were letting things slip a
little bit and really took it upon yourself, you scored 6 straight points.
Talk about that run and why you thought you needed to make it by yourself.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I mean, it wasn't that I was trying to make a run by myself
or anything. I know we needed everybody to play well tonight to win. But I
just tried to go get rebounds and try to play really physical inside. I didn't
have a real physical presence early on. I tried to take it upon myself to go
inside and try to make something happen, try to spark the team a little bit,
try to get the crowd help us get back in the game a little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.  
  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. They were hitting shots from the start. In the second half they
started getting the layups off the 1-3-1. What did they do to adjust?  
COACH DAVIS: Give Butler credit, I'm almost went into a little panic stage a
little bit. We tried to cheat out. We lost assignments and just got out of our
defense. They started playing over the top. One time it hadn't happened all
year, threw it the length of the floor, the guy laid it in. We kind of got out
of character and we got it back. You know, we got it back, which was good. And
that's just something that we probably, Joe, wouldn't have played as much in
the second half but we were down and just trying to create turnovers. And you
asked our players about Giddy. I hugged him in the locker room. He was in the
bathroom by himself bawling. He thought he lost the game. He's such a critical
reason why we're here and what a great year we had. I hate it for him that it
happened on this stage tonight.  
  
Q. Kermit, you hear what Reggie has to say about his four years. What
has he meant to you as a coach in this program?  
COACH DAVIS: I told him I loved him. I don't know if I've ever had a more
favorite guy. Winning affects everything. How he's represented all of us, the
fans love him. He'll be able to come back to Middle Tennessee when he's 40 and
brings his kids, and those people are going to talk about not only the wins
but what kind of person he was and how he carried himself. Yesterday or
Thursday he broke the all-time winning record for 99 career wins, which is
unbelievable, and two NCAA wins and maybe four championships.  
  
Like I said, he impacted winning better than anybody in the history of our
school. But the way he carried himself, he means an awful lot to me.  
  
Q. Within the first couple minutes, it looked like there were sometimes
where the guys were a little loose with the ball handling and at times some
bickering in the first half. Was it maybe nerves that got to them a little
bit? Did you think that's what contributed to the little bit of lack of
composure?  
COACH DAVIS: I don't think there were nerves at all. Our guys have been in a
lot of big games. We were loose with the ball, though. Tyrik Dixon, our
freshman, had a great year. He only had one turnover. The ball didn't move
right, you know.  
  
Our team is a real competitive bunch. You haven't seen our team very much,
those guys are competitive with themselves. They love each other a lot. They
play with a great edge and toughness. It's something that happens, you know,
people who come to our games have seen it. It was not nerves at all. Maybe a
little frustration, you know. Our team just didn't play with the identity that
we played with most of the year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. Just looking forward, Kermit, obviously you have some good players
coming back, Walters and Giddy and Antwain. Can you think about that right
now?  
COACH DAVIS: You know, I think about it everyday, Joe, I really do. We lose --
Reggie and JaCorey, it's hard to replace those two guys, but I like the base.
We've had a great recruiting year early. We're going to sign a player or two
maybe late. I do. I just think -- like we said, this will be a year that we'll
look forward to, the sustainability of keeping our program going forward. It's
going to be a tough task. Our guys will reflect on the year, and in a couple
weeks, we'll get back at it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Naz Mitrou-Long](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33188)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by the Iowa State student-athletes, Monte Morris and Naz
Mitrou-Long. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Monte, Coach said yesterday, which I'm sure he said before about you
this season, you're the best point guard in the country. What's your response
to that?  
MONTE MORRIS: It's an honor, first off, and, you know, without my teammates,
none of this recognition is possible on my end. But like I said, it's an
honor. I take my hat off to him saying that, you know, it's a pleasure and
blessing.  
  
Q. Both you guys, how do you go about stopping a team like Purdue with
so much size in the middle? What kind of stuff can you guys do to take away
that advantage?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: With their size and their height and their ability, no
one person can do that. They've been a force down there all year long. We've
been watching them, especially with the Big Ten Network, we were able the see
a bunch of their games.  
  
So you know, it's not no one man on our team going to be able to do much. It's
a collective effort. That's been our defensive principles since Coach Prohm
got here. We definitely have to lean on one another like we have been all year
to do our best to help the big fellas down low.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'll ask both of you, Monte first, is there a difference in
styles Big Ten, Big 12?  
  
MONTE MORRIS: I say the Big Ten got so many teams, it's a variety of styles at
you. Some teams like to bang in and some teams run. Purdue is more of a post-
oriented team. And our defense is going to have to be good, our post defense
and rotation. I think Purdue give us more of a slow-it-down pace and play
through the post.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: I'd agree with Monte. Having as many teams as they do,
they're not able to play everybody twice. There's a lot of different styles
there. I definitely say the Big 12 scores a lot more. And we're able to play
everybody twice, so we get a little familiar and you can still see the
scoreboard the way it is and what it combines for every night, that goes to
show we score the ball a lot more than the Big 12.  
  
Two different styles of basketball, but they're both great league, great
styles of basketball and we got a lot of respect for the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Monte, just to follow-up, are you the best point guard in the
country?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: Yes, he is.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: Definitely.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: I had to get there and say that.  
  
Q. I'm sorry, what did you say?  
MONTE MORRIS: Definitely.  
  
Q. You are.  
MONTE MORRIS: Yeah.  
  
Q. Where does the confidence come from?  
MONTE MORRIS: I don't know. It's just something I carry with myself. If you
don't believe in yourself or feel like you're the best, why are you playing
this game? And I put in the work and overtime this summer, with the guys and
every guy on our roster for like we're the best on the court at times. So we
just got to carry that swagger so we can play with it.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: I definitely feel like he's the best point guard in the
country. And the reason I feel that is because you want a point guard who
doesn't turn over the ball, who controls the tempo, who scores when you need
him to score, locks up when you need him to lock-up and makes everybody
better. Not only is that, he's as humble as can be. If he was a cocky
individual, I would be honest, I would say I didn't like him, but he's not.
He's everything but that, and that's why everybody on our team loves him,
including staff, the whole Cyclone Nation and community. He gives respect
where respect is due to other opponents and other point guards, but Monte is
the best point guard in the country and one of the best point guards, if not
the best point guard, to play in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Besides the size obviously when you watch film of Purdue, what stands
out to you, what pops off the screen?  
MONTE MORRIS: They're big. They're real big, physical. I think we had a lot of
that on film with them just being active in gaps and getting a lot of
deflections. And I just think they're coached very well by a great coach. That
goes a long way, also.  
  
Q. What makes Deonte so good in transition?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: He's just a mismatch nightmare. He's not a big man. He's
a guard that just so happens to be playing the 4 for us because he's about 280
and he moves like he's 200. He's a special player to have on your team, and I
mean, he can knock it down from the mid-range area, from behind the 3 and
he'll go up there and finish against 7-footers, doesn't matter. Not only that,
man, we got to give a lot of credit to him because we challenged him at the
beginning of the year to be more of an assertive passer. He's taken that upon
himself to do that, and he hits guys in the right spot to get some alley-oops.
He does it all. That's why he's a great attribute to our team.  
  
Q. Monte, the point guard on the other side, P.J. Thompson, what have
you thought of what you've seen?  
MONTE MORRIS: He's a solid point guard. He runs the team. He's always playing
at a great pace. Got to do my best slowing him down. He can shoot the ball
pretty well. I got to be -- pick and choose and be wise when I go gamble and
things like that. I know he can definitely make me pay. So tomorrow night we
got to play Cyclone basketball and trust the scouting report we have, and
hopefully we come out victorius.  
  
Q. Going back to their size for a minute, as guys who will have an
opportunity to slash the basket at some point, what goes through your mind
when you see 7-2, 290 that might be waiting for you?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: You want to get out of their way. You don't want to be
in any type situation where you end up on SportsCenter. We got to respect
their height and understand they're a presence down low and be smart with the
basketball. If we can get in and maybe draw some contact or maybe draw them
away from the basket if we're going to the basket, that's awesome, you know.
But I mean they're a step in the paint, it's like it three people there. So
again we respect their height and the way they use their big men. We got to
find ways around it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Monte, couldn't help but notice the tremendous fan support in
this building last night. I'm sure you hope for that tomorrow night. How much
a difference can it make at tournament time?  
  
MONTE MORRIS: It can be a -- it can determine the outcome of a game. Honestly,
our fans travel in packs and they always been able to travel, Kansas City,
they travel for like a home game. And I know tomorrow night it will be more
people than it was. We just happy we got the best fans in the country that
come out and support us whether we winning or losing. Just shows what type of
tradition this school has.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right. Thanks,
guys. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
Please welcome Iowa State Head Coach, Steve Prohm. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. In your wildest dreams, did you think here
you'd be that the point with this team just seemingly on, I don't know, cruise
control? And is your job actually easier coaching these guys at this level
right now because of the chemistry and the way this team has jelled, eight
guys team?  
COACH PROHM: My dream, I did think we would be here. Dream about it all the
time. I pray about it all the time for this team and for our guys all the
time. And so in that regard, yes. In the moment at times, no. Because we were
struggling at times. You know, sometimes a really good coach I admire and
respect, some of the times senior laden teams can be tough to coach at times.
And the biggest thing with this team was trying to figure out the best way to
play with the losses, with Nader and McKay and trying to play like we were
last year, but that wasn't best for this team, and also trying to get
everybody to stop being selfish and playing for each other. If we could do
that, the end result would be a lot better. Then you're mixing some of your
transfers and got to get them to be selfless.  
  
So it's easy coaching right now. You win with great players. We've got the
point guards, probably one of the best players ever played at Iowa State, and
you've got the winningest senior class with Naz and Matt Thomas and Deonte
Burton, who is grown up as any -- as much as any player I've had in my six
years as a Head Coach from one year to the next.  
  
And so right now I think they're very easy to coach, very fun to be around,
and they really understand what this thing is about.  
  
Q. Steve, how well do you know Matt at all, and when you watch them,
what do you think of the coaching job he's done with this team?  
COACH PROHM: I know Matt more or less just to say, "Hey, Coach, How are you
doing?" See him on the road, speak, say hello. I don't know him very well.
Followed him from afar for a long time, you know, Southern Illinois, obviously
because I was at Murray, that was close by, and then the job he's done at
Purdue I think has been outstanding. He just won a Big Ten Championship. I
think they've won 27, 28 games. He's done a really good job there. He's
obviously one of the best coaches in the country. We just have two different
contrasting styles of basketball that we coach, and everybody does it a little
bit different.  
  
He's in the Big Ten. They're physical and tough and big up-front. They play
traditional at times. Those two big post guys, start Edwards and play four
guards basically with Swanigan and Haas. He's done an outstanding job and
obviously lot of respect for him and their program.  
  
Q. Coach, you had said last night, I think after the game, Monte is the
best point guard in the country. I just asked him. He agreed with you.  
COACH PROHM: He should.  
  
Q. Why do you say that about him?  
COACH PROHM: Oh, man. I mean, I could go on. I could talk about him for a long
time. I think first and foremost the reason why we're at the level we're at
right now over the last six, eight weeks of playing really good basketball is
because he's taken his game to another level, and not just on the offensive
end but on the defensive end. Taken pride defensively. You look at how many
near triple doubles that he's had. Last night he has two rebounds and we're an
assist rebound short. Our last couple home games he was an assist shy, rebound
shy. There's only 15 in the history of the Big 12. He almost had a second one
and third one.  
  
He's our leader. He's great in pick-and-roll. Doesn't turn it over. I can go
on and on about why he's the best point guard in the country. All time -- he's
going to be the all time assists to turnover ratio leader in the history of
college basketball. He's Iowa State's winningest player. Already been to two
Sweet 16s, won three Big 12 Tournament Championships. All time assist leader.
His character is outstanding. The one thing that exemplifies him the best,
he's great with kids. He's great with my son. I appreciate that. Then he sent
all the Hy-Vee, local grocery store in town, sent sent water back home. Lot of
pride in Flint and the situations they fight back there. That's why I probably
was most disappointed about him not being a Bob Cousy Award Finalist. Not
about the five people they picked. They missed out on an opportunity to really
award somebody extremely, extremely deserving of the award. Will be fun to
follow him. He's going to have a long time in the NBA because of his IQ and
his ability to be a winner.  
  
Q. You mentioned this, this looks like a very contrasting style, mix of
styles between you guys and them. Is that how you see it? And then what do you
do to negate or make it difficult for them to utilize their size advantage
inside?  
COACH PROHM: It is contrasting styles. It is from a standpoint, I guess, of
how we try to score. Both teams average right around 80 points a game. Both
teams shoot the 3-pointers very well. I think they're 40 percent. I'm not sure
exactly where we're at. We do shoot the ball really well. And so from that
standpoint, from the numbers statistical standpoint, we're very similar.  
  
We do it different. The biggest thing for us to win this game is we've got to
be the tougher team on the defensive end of the floor. Not about offense.
We're going to do offense what we do. But can we extend their catches, can we
have great ball pressure, can we defend the post and not give easy post
touches for Swanigan, Haas, and then can we rebound and finish plays?  
  
Our toughness -- I watched the first half of Vermont's game. The game was
close because I thought Vermont played with an edge. I thought they played
with great toughness. And that's how we got to play, and we got to have the
same mentality we had when we played West Virginia the other day.  
  
Q. Coach Painter mentioned Burton might be the difference. You had
mentioned he's kind of grown up since you had him here. He's a unique player
just when you look at him, right? He can just do a lot of different things.
They joked he was 280. I don't think he's that big.  
COACH PROHM: He's 265.  
  
Q. Why is he a potentially tough matchup for teams?  
COACH PROHM: Skill level and versatility. Skill level, versatility, and then
when he's really locked in, his toughness level and athetisism throws him
over. I compare him to the jump Abdel Nader made from his junior to senior
year for us last year. He made that jump maybe even more so this year because
we had to have him. For us to be great, I told him all the time, you got to
max out. We can't be great. That's why sometimes I would -- you put up with
some of the -- everybody jokes about shot selection with him and at times, but
you put up with some of that because you know you had to continue to work him
and coach him because we need him. If we were ever going to max out, he had to
be at his best. His ability to shoot the 3. He spent so much time this spring
and summer working on his game. His ability to be a mismatch. Want to play
really big, obviously we'll have a mismatch with him. Then he's been great in
all big games for us. He was huge in the West Virginia game, in the
championship game, and he made big plays down the stretch the other day
against Nevada.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, how does the gauntlet of the Big 12 and having to go to
Allen Fieldhouse and other places, how does that prepare your team for
tournament time?  
  
COACH PROHM: It prepares you tremendously because you're going into Allen
Fieldhouse, you're going to Morgantown, sell-out crowds, the physicality, the
coaching, the guard play in this league is so good. You know, you look at the
Big 12, I think we've been the number 1, maybe this year number 2, the last
four years, number 1 or 2 in RPI in the country. Right now we're 3-1 in the
tournament. We got a couple playing tonight, Kansas and Kansas State. It
prepares you very well because it is extremely hard to win on the road. You're
going against teams that are extremely well-coached and going against several
NBA guys everyday.  
  
Q. Steve, let's assume you don't sleep well tonight. Will it be because
you're uptight about Purdue or will it be more nervous, excited
anticipation?  
COACH PROHM: Just anticipation. Anticipation, just thinking about different
things. But not a nervousness or not -- I think we play better, I feel better
when I have that -- those -- if you don't have that -- I don't ever think I'm
ready if I don't have that little bit of nerves and anticipation jumping
through your stomach and your body.  
  
It's a great time of year. We're fortunate to be here. I'm blessed to be here.
And if it's sleep, it's just because my room is next door to the weight room
in the hotel and they're treadmilling when they drop the weights, I can hear
it. Outside of that, I'll get a couple good hours of sleep.  
  
Q. For good reason the conversation about Purdue is about Swanigan and
Issac Haas. The complimentary pieces that they have, especially offensively on
the perimeter, what have you seen of those guys?  
COACH PROHM: If those guys weren't good, they wouldn't be very good because
you just help off those guys and you double or you'd sit in the paint on
Swanigan and Haas. But with the way Mathias shoots, Carsen Edwards off the
bench, we tried to recruit him a little bit when I first got to Ames. You
know, with those guys and their other perimeter guys, their ability to make
shots, if they had a bunch of non-shooters, their whole team would change. But
they all can make shots. That's why they can put so much pressure on you. Are
you going to double, can they get it out of the double too quick? Now they get
ball reversal 3. If you're not going to double, you got Swanigan and Haas, you
got to guard 1-on-1 and you got Edwards kind of a mismatched guy like Burton.
It's a lot more than Swanigan and Haas when you really research them and talk
to other coaches. You got to defend the 3-point line as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Purdue student-athletes, P.J. Thompson and Vincent
Edwards. Questions, please.  
  
Q. For both of you, when you look at them on film and when the coaches
talk to you, how are they similar to your guys' style, and more importantly,
how are they different from you guys stylistically?  
P.J. THOMPSON: I see -- I think they're a lot different. They start four
seniors, four guards. They've been through it, they play in a really good
conference. They have a lot of guys that can make a lot of plays. I think
that's similar. We have a lot of guys that can make a lot of plays and beat
you as well. They play a little faster, and I think we're inside out and
they're more outside in.  
  
VINCE EDWARDS: Yeah, pretty much to say what he said. We're different in
certain areas. They start four seniors and four guards and just the way they
play. They actually make a lot of plays. They run some simple sets that seem
so simple, but they got a lot of guys that can make a lot of plays. It makes
them that more effective. They play well together.  
  
Q. What does Coach Painter do well, what makes him so successful, both
on the court in terms of how he schemes in basketball and off the court and
how he relates to you guys?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Off the court, especially, he gets it. He remembers what it was
once like to be a college player, be in our position. Lot of times when we
have problems on or off the court, we're allowed to talk to him and he's
really open about it. That's a good relationship that coaches build with their
players. And then on the court, he just tries to help any way he can. If he
sees something, he'll let you know and keep his X's and O's sharp. He let's us
know if he see openings. He does a really good job for us.  
  
Q. I don't care which one of you answer this, but have you played -- who
would you compare Monte Morris to against guys you played against this year?  
P.J. THOMPSON: He kind of reminds me of Derrick Walton. He will really score
the ball. He can really score the ball, but he's patient. He doesn't rush
things. He doesn't turn the ball over a lot. When he really needs to make
plays, he does it and he does a really good job of getting his teammates
involved because he plays with a lot of good players that can make plays as
well. He gets them the ball in the right spots and they knock it down.  
  
Q. Who is better?  
P.J. THOMPSON: I don't know.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
P.J. THOMPSON: Really good players. Playing really well at the right time.
Derrick Walton has had a good game today. Monte Morris has had a heck of a
career in a big conference. Made big time shots and big time plays.  
  
Q. This Iowa State team has a lot of fire power. What are you guys
looking to do on defense?  
VINCE EDWARDS: Containment. It's been with us all year. They do a lot of --
like I said, they really don't even run that many sets. Looks like it, they
run a lot of sets, but they have guys out there making plays and they make
plays off the bounce. We got to do a good job of dribble containment and not
overhelping. They have a lot of shooters on the outside make you pay. You got
to make them make tough shots. Even though it's something they do very well,
that's just things you have to live with, but you got to keep them out of the
paint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Both of you, please start with P.J, what will you guys need to
do well tomorrow night, what will make the difference in the game?  
  
P.J. THOMPSON: You know, it's a short turnaround with games. There's only so
much you can do as far as preparing for the team. And Coach always says we
always as a team can control what you can control. And that's what we do on
our offensive end and our defensive end. We're not going to get every set that
they run. We're not going to know every out-of-bounds play. But we know what
we want to do as far as defensive scheme and what we want to do offensively.
Control what we can control and playing how we played all year, and you have a
certain mindset and toughness entering the game, and I feel like it will give
you shot to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Same question, Vincent, please.  
  
VINCE EDWARDS: Just like P.J. said, at this time it's quick turnaround. Got to
be ready to go. Our Coach will do a good job of scheming everything they
scheme up for us. Allow your defensive principles on what the coaches go
through. And we can't let Purdue beat Purdue. We can't turn the ball over. We
got the take care of the ball and give ourselves a chance.  
  
Q. What do you get from Issac Haas? What do you expect from him when
he's on the floor, and how much development have you seen and what do you
think he gives you when he's on the floor?  
VINCE EDWARDS: We expect as a team, we expect Issac to be dominant when he
gets in and he's in the low post. It's tough for him because he gets handled a
little differently than most players would in the country because he's 7-2,
almost 300 pounds. He has to be strong down low and establish his presence in
the paint for us because he's huge when he's down there and he's doing what he
does best, finishing over either shoulder or dunking the ball, just having
huge games for us. That's huge for us as a team. Helps us that much more.  
  
Q. Vincent, do you expect to draw the Burton assignment and what do you
do to limit him?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I just got from coaches today that I will be starting on him.
Honestly, he's a good player. I think teams have kind of matched him up as if
he's a big. He's really a guard. He's not the tallest guy in the world, but
he's really strong. He's athletic. He knows how to get his shots off. He's
explosive.  
  
So, you know, you got to guard him, make him make tough shots, and can't let
him have anything easy. He has to earn every shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right. Thanks,
guys. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
Joined by Purdue Head coach, Matt Painter. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Matt, for those of us who don't see a whole lot of Iowa State, what
are their strengths, how do you attack them?  
COACH PAINTER: I think they have great balance. Obviously, their point guard
is one of the best points in the country in Monte Morris. Just quick, fast,
skilled, can make 3s, sets up his teammates, can make a pullup and get to the
basket. Just a good all-around player and an experienced player.  
  
I think the thing that jumps out for them is just the quality of their team
but the experience also. They start four seniors. You don't see that all the
time now in college basketball where you have that many quality seniors that
have been together for a long time. Couple guys obviously for them on their
front line can cause a lot of problems, especially Burton. He's a mismatch guy
that can drive the ball and shoot it. But just a very skilled team, Naz and
Matt Thomas are two really good players that can shoot and make plays and
cause a lot of problems because they have some good size, they have good
quickness, athleticism at a high skill level.  
  
Q. Is this -- on paper this looks stylistically as a big difference
between you two guys. Is that your assessment, too? You guys seem to work
inside out, where they are more perimeter oriented?  
COACH PAINTER: We do have good perimeter and interior play. We also play
inside out with our perimeter, guys make some plays at the end of the game
after we got doubled. In the half court, that's what we want to try to do. We
have some guys that can break you down and make some plays.  
  
But from a style standpoint, we both score around 80 points a game. We led our
league in scoring. I know they were right up there. And so we both put points
on the board, but they both probably come in a little different variety. We
don't only score the ball on the interior. We have some guys that can really
shoot on the perimeter, and Haas is probably our only guy that doesn't shoot
on the perimeter, rightfully so at 7-2. Everybody else can shoot and shoot 3s.
And so it makes for a good balance when you have good size and good skill.  
  
Q. Matt, are you committed to staying with Ryan Cline in the starting
lineup, or have you given any thought to going with Carsen?  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously, he started, I think, after the Penn State game when
he hit those two shots. We'll stay with Ryan Cline. He hasn't really got on
track. We play through our bigs, and so people do stick with him. And then
it's big kind of back and forth with those guys throughout the season. They
both have played well. Cline has played well for us, you know. You know,
without him, we don't win the Big Ten Championship. That was a huge win at
Penn State.  
  
Carsen Edwards has been one of the best freshmen in our league, his ability
the make plays and shots. I'm happy with both our guys. I like our rotation,
the eight guys that we have, and being able to bring Carsen Edwards and Isaac
Haas and the experience of Spike Albrecht off the bench, that's three quality
guys off the bench. And I think that's what makes for a good team.  
  
Q. Every time Haas steps on the floor, he's going to be guarded by
somebody that's smaller than him. To the same extent in certain games
Swanigan. What is the process of explaining to those guys and working with
them to avoid frustration when maybe they're victims of their own size in
certain situations?  
COACH PAINTER: Don't impose the frustration. Don't do it to yourself. Legally
post up, legally set screens, legally block out. Help yourself. I think
sometimes you get picked on as a big guy, whether you're a -- you're watching
high school guys, because that's probably the worst. High school officials are
the absolute worst at dealing with big guys because they don't see very many
of them.  
  
You just don't see guys like Haas a lot. So they're used to reffing the 6-9
240, 250 pound guys. The 7-2, 300-pound guy, he has some moments where it's on
him. There's a lot of moments where it's not, and they're just not accustomed
to it. They kind of get duped by people that take those hits or falls or flop
and things of that nature.  
  
So we just worry about coaching him, and that's what we've really try to focus
on, staying in our line lane. I need to coach and he needs to play and they
need to officiate. But if anybody needs any assistance, he needs to let me do
it. It is frustrating for him at times when there's calls that are made and
you go back and watch the tape and it's guys taking some flops and they're not
calls and you get picked on a little bit.  
  
He's been really good for us and he can change the game, and I know he's
looking forward to playing tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Spike and all his experience, everything he's been through, what are
some of the best lessons and experiences that he's passed on to the younger
guys and kind of ease in on what you have to instill in them?  
COACH PAINTER: For me it's difficult because I'm not -- I think the best
lessons are when coaches aren't around. He has a lot of experience and he
knows what's going on. I think for him, like dealing with Carsen Edwards is
probably the one thing that jumps out for me because he was around Trey Burke
and he saw how talented Trey Burke was and how good he was. But he also knew
Trey Burke is a different player going from his freshman year to his sophomore
year and making those improvements and those hard lessons that you make. And
obviously he led them to the -- Trey led them to the championship game.  
  
I know -- I think he's pretty good for Carsen and pretty good for all our guys
because he's been through it and there's a little bit -- anytime -- if anybody
ever played in this room, you always think something is wrong with your coach
or something is wrong with your program or something is wrong with that. He
gives that point of reference to where like, hey, you guys got it pretty good,
especially with their coach. Their coach is a great guy (laughter). Seen a few
guys actually listen in the back. You're just sitting there. There you go. I
appreciate that.  
  
So, I think those are always -- I always felt that when I played for one of
the best coaches ever and one of the best guys ever, I would go back to my
apartment and think he was crazy. I'm playing for one of the best coaches in
America who treats you fair. He's on you. Gene Keady was on you. You still
have that thought.  
  
As a coach, it's good to have some people around to say, hey, man, you got it
pretty good here. This is a pretty good situation. Nothing is perfect. I don't
care where you go to school or what program you're in.  
  
Q. Matt, with Caleb, does anything he do at this point surprise you? And
when you look at his mobility, what is the secret, strategy workouts that he's
doing or just him growing up and kind of getting acclimated?  
COACH PAINTER: He's made strides every year. He made a huge stride from
freshman to sophomore year. Nothing really surprised me. He just needs to let
things come to him. He's very confident and he's very talented, but when he
let's things come to him, he's more productive. He's always going to rebound,
but the other part, his passing is so good and I thought that really help
helped us at the end of the game last night. He got blocks at the end of the
game. He passed and had some assists. One time one was a hockey assist, one
was a direct pass. They were huge plays for us. He helps us in a lot of ways,
not just by scoring the basketball. And when he plays that all-around game and
let's things come to him, you know, that's when he's at his best.  
  
Q. Matt, a couple years ago when you had those couple losing seasons in
a row here at Purdue, what kind of changes did you make? How did you get the
program back on track?  
COACH PAINTER: First and foremost, I mentioned it, it wasn't a school district
for us. You recruit guys into your program and you have to have a plan with
what you want, and I just didn't think we had enough skill in our program. I
didn't think we had enough guys that were about winning. Guys will be about
shots, guys will be about minutes. If you just get some guys that are
unconditional and just want to win -- too many people are asking about who is
in my position or not in my position. When you sign those guys and they never
ask those questions, they just want the opportunity, they just want to play
and they're about Purdue winning, we had to get to that. We had to get -- and
get to a more skilled guy. Obviously we were fortunate to sign some size and
some really good players, but it was also the other guys that we got, P.J.
Thompson, Dakota, Ryan Cline, the guys that are just sharp shooters that
spread out the court. Obviously getting a guy like Carsen Edwards, very, very
so fortunate to get him out of Houston, that gives us athleticism. He's a good
kid and works hard and likes basketball. Just getting those guys -- obviously
Vince Edwards comes in very, very versatile. He fits that bill, also from a
basketball family. He gets it. He's from a great high school that has a lot of
history, but it's about winning and that's hard sometimes to decipher in
recruiting because you get told so many things by so many people.  
  
You got to figure out for yourself what's at their core, and that's what we
tried to do. And I really believe less is more. Right now we have eight guys
in a rotation, but we have the right eight guys. And recruiting, it's more
difficult. You guys write stories. It's hard. It really is to try to get
things figured out. You can see if guys can run and jump and play, but you
don't see the adversity set in, who are they when the adversity sets in. Then
when you sign them, you get everybody. You get the whole crew with them and
who is going to be there to help them when adversity sets in, and that's
important, too.  
  
Q. Matt, when we talked to Biggie, we were very fortunate if we get five
to ten words in response. Have you seen a side of him that we all haven't
seen? Does he ever really open up to you or to the guys in the locker room?  
COACH PAINTER: He opens up on his own terms. He's not going to pass out that
trust. You're going to have to earn that trust through time and being around
him and him feeling comfortable with it. And he's about playing the game and
winning. He's a good teammate, good guy. It's not a bad thing that he doesn't
want to talk to the media all the time. You grow up in their society, a lot of
those guys, they form their form and identity on social media. They're quick
to tell you how they are. You guys have formed his identity on his production
and how he's played and carried himself. He's a good student and guy. He likes
basketball. Keeps his nose clean. I think it's a pretty good story, especially
where he came from.  
  
He's reserved. There's no doubt about it. He's private and that's okay. We
want him to be himself. I don't try to form my players's opinions. I allow
them to kind of grow on their own.  
  
Q. Matt, like yourself, Steve Prohm followed a legend of sorts at Iowa
State. What was that process like, that situation like for you, and how do you
imagine it is for Coach Prohm?  
COACH PAINTER: Your transition, do you have players in play? Lot of times you
get a job because they struggle. He's fortunate to get a job and somebody was
successful in front of him and left some guys on his team. And so for us, we
started our program and Coach Keady had left, Carl Landry and David Teague
ended up being All Conference. Carl is from Milwaukee. But that's how we got
our start in our transition. Really bad my first year because both those guys
tore their ACL. The next year we're able to go to the tournament and then go
to six straight NCAA Tournaments. That was our start. If we didn't have David
and Carl, we signed a couple freshmen and those guys' fifth year and Chris
Kramer and Keaton Grant, underrecruited guys that were really good players for
us. We're able to build from there.  
  
Then the next class we signed, JaJuan Johnson and Robbie Hummel. When you
follow that for me, I played for him, but I was only his assistant for one
year. That's your blueprint. You know how to run a program. You know how to do
those type of things. Lot of times guys can coach but do they know how to run
a program? That was set in play by me by Bruce Weber, Coach Keady, how to
handle things socially, how to handle things academically, how to help your
players through a lot of different issues they have to go through. I was very
fortunate to have those guys as my mentors and people that I've been around
and worked with closely.  
  
Q. Do you ever have to tell Caleb to stop working out or not do -- what
kind of message or example did he say that set forth other guys on the team
that he's doing all this stuff in addition to --  
COACH PAINTER: He's driven. He was 400 pounds when he was an eighth grader. Go
in there and see him -- he skipped a year of high school. Lot of times people
tack on a year of high school and go five years. He went three years. He's
driven to play in the NBA, but yet he's already a professional. He works at
it, comes early, stays late, puts in his time. Sometimes he jumps over the
fight because he's really competitive but what he says is good. Sometimes the
delivery is a little different, but that's how he is. When he gets emotional,
I like it. You can always knock those guys down a notch. You can't ramp them
up. So for where he was and how he's gotten there, he's earned everything.
Sometimes guys are just blessed. Obviously he's blessed to be 6-9 but also
have the gene he's got to really watch his diet, really got to work out extra
and help himself, so he's got to stay on top of those things.  
  
Q. With Burton's ability in transition, how does that tax a defense
differently than maybe a team where only the guards are threats in
transition?  
COACH PAINTER: Lot of times when you play through your trailer, right there it
opens up. We all see that as the trail 4 comes into play, can stick the 3, can
drive the basketball. But where they're so good Morris will push the ball and
you got to guard the wings so the ball goes left or right to one of those
wings right away, you got to be there to knock out that perimeter shooting.
Then if they pinball that thing real quick from the point to the 2 back to the
4, he just starts wheeling and dealing. They'll shoot a 3, go left and spin
back right and vice versa, and it's hard. You got stay in a stands. You got to
have the proper close out. You got to almost try to get him into a pullup. But
what's crazy about it, he can make pull upset, too.  
  
When you get to that point, it's like the lesser of all evils. Keep him away,
don't foul, don't let him get a layup or rhythm 3. Once he puts it on the
deck, don't give him an angle. That's hard to do. Obviously, it's why you're
asking the question. He's a mismatch nightmare. It's hard to handle him. And
so you got to try your best to get your defense set so at least you're
approaching him without closing out, approaching him, and you're already on
your line if that makes any sense.  
  
Q. You played Haas and Swanigan early in the first half and they
struggled. You stuck with it in the second half. Are you going to be able to
do again against Iowa State, or you going to force that upon them even with
quickness with Iowa State?  
COACH PAINTER: They didn't struggle. He fouled and I had to take him out. He's
fine. Those guys can play together. We go into the game, you got to make some
adjustments to how some things got called. He got his first foul and got the
quick second one. He's got to adjust right there, not get that second one so
he can stick in the game.  
  
No, they're a good team and long and athletic. The thing is you look at the
roster, one guy is listed at 6-4, 6-5, 6-8. They're good shot blockers.
They're athletic. You saw the plays, whether getting steals or blocks. They're
quick to the basketball and quick to their spots. For us, we just have to play
our game. And the first half we struggled. We turned the ball over 8 times. We
didn't give ourselves a chance, but yet we still had a 1-point lead. Second
half we have 2 turnovers and it was a lot -- it was better for us because we
were more efficient and giving ourselves a chance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thanks.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Butler student-athletes, Avery Woodson, Kelan Martin,
and Andrew Chrabascz. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Andrew, watching the Middle Tennessee State game, they run a lot of
1-3-1. How do you go about attacking a 1-3-1, and how much of that have you
seen this year?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: We've seen a good amount of it. We saw it against Marquette
for a little while, Xavier runs it a little bit. But, I mean, we face a lot of
athleticism this year as well, and they have that. They're trying to cause
havoc with that 1-3-1, tight pressure. But at the same time trying to slow you
down a little bit. We just have to make sure we space the court well and just
get the ball moving.  
  
With the 1-3-1, there are going to be open opportunities. They do it because
they defend it so well. So we just have to make sure we find the open guys and
keep the ball moving.  
  
Q. Andrew, what kinds of challenges do Williams and Upshaw, their
forwards, particularly present to you guys, especially when they have the
ball?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I mean, neither one of them is traditional big men. They're
both very, very skilled. I mean, Williams dribbles the length of the court
sometimes, Upshaw does the same thing, brings the ball up from the rim. Both
can shoot 3. Like I said, very, very versatile. So, we just have the make sure
we play team defense.  
  
It's not going to be -- I mean, there's 1-on-1 situations, but at the same
time we need to make sure we're in the gaps helping each other out. Rotation
really good and stuff like that. We're -- it's going to be a challenge.
Obviously, they're a very, very good team, but we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. Avery, Middle Tennessee is kind of in the spot where Butler once was
of being the so-called upstart Mid-Major, trying to make a run in a
tournament.  
When you were following Butler, is that the way you perceived them, and do
you think that has changed? Or does Butler almost still get perceived like a
Mid-Major even though you're in the Big East?  
  
AVERY WOODSON: Honestly, I didn't look at Low-Major, Mid-Major, or High-Major.
I didn't see the difference. I thought Butler was a pretty good team and so
was Middle Tennessee. I don't put them in a class as Low-Major, Mid-Major,
High-Major. They can play against anybody and beat them.  
  
Q. Avery, back to their 1-3-1, they do some different things out of it,
falling into the 2-3, maybe trap a little bit. The Minnesota guys before the
game described it as weird. How would you describe it?  
AVERY WOODSON: Weird. I think they play really, really hard. I don't think
it's weird. It's 1-3-1. Marquette plays it, Xavier plays it. We've seen it and
are familiar with it. We just have to be sure with the ball, be smart with it,
and not turn it over.  
  
Q. Andrew, back to Williams in particular, does he remind you of anyone
you've seen and how unique is his particular skill set?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Honestly, at the 5 not many people we've seen like that. I
look at him more as a 4 man, other than the fact he's got the size, got the
length to compete with 5 men. But at the same time, like I said, he's very,
very skilled, very, very versatile. He's very consistent with his mid-range,
get into that and get to the hoop and being physical.  
  
So, I mean, we're going to all be up for the challenge for that one, and we
just have to bring our hard hats with him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kelan, to get you involved, how do you see this matchup
tomorrow night and what's the key for you guys winning?  
  
KELAN MARTIN: I agree with both of what they said, but it's going to be a
tough matchup. It's similar to a Big East team. Going to be very physical,
have a lot of guys that can play different positions. They have a lot of
athletic guys. Their 1-3-1 matchup is something we've seen in the Big East.
Their guards like to shoot pullups. It's going to be a fun game.  
  
Q. For Avery, during the regular season when you happened to have a big
game and you made a number of 3-pointers, did you notice in the next game or
two right after that overcompensation by other teams to try and do more to
stop you than maybe they typically would, and do you anticipate that tomorrow,
given how well you shot the ball yesterday?  
AVERY WOODSON: You know, each team is different. Most coaches like to stick to
their principles defensively, and that changes from game to game, whether they
help off of me or not.  
  
It changes from game to game.  
  
Q. Andrew, Tyler Lewis made a big impact the other day. When he plays
like that and getting in the seams and getting other people involved, how does
he change the dynamics of a game?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Huge. Offensively, he's such a weapon for us. Like you said
yesterday especially, he was penetrating really well, reading -- coming off
the screens really well, figuring out if he was going to get to the hoop or
find the open guy. His aggression is very, very important for us. We have to
make sure that, like we said, we have to find opportunities for him to find
us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. This is for Andrew, I probably asked you about this before, but you
were recruited in the Horizon, A-10. You played four Big East seasons. Have
you detected any difference in the way that Butler is perceived? Seems like a
lot of things have been the same, but you just kind of wonder if away from the
Butler bubble, if Butler is seen any differently.  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I mean, not for me. Like you said, when I was getting
recruited or I wasn't getting recruited yet, still in the Horizon league. They
made two runs to the Final Four, and that was a huge reason why I came here
because of the Butler way and the Butler tradition of just being so good this
time of year. By the time they were in the A-10, that was huge for me. And now
being in the Big East, it's been just some of the best basketball I've ever
been part of.  
  
Yeah, looking forward to it, and hopefully we can come out with a great focus
going into the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Avery, when you were at Memphis, can you describe the landscape of
Middle Tennessee basketball? In comparison to the whole basketball picture in
the State of Tennessee, where does Middle Tennessee fall into the casual fan's
awareness for the State?  
AVERY WOODSON: People were very aware of Middle Tennessee State. You know, I
had one of my friends went to school there, and he was telling me how good the
basketball team was. So, people in Memphis, Knoxville, we all knew that Middle
Tennessee was a team to be reckoned with. And last year I wouldn't even call
it an upset. They played very well against Michigan State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck tomorrow
night.  
  
Joined by Butler Head Coach Chris Holtmann. Questions, please.  
  
Q. How do you go about attacking the 1-3-1 that Middle Tennessee throws
at teams?  
COACH HOLTMANN: It's pretty unique in what they do and how they play it, and,
you know, we try not to overcomplicate things. We want to stay aggressive. I
think our spacing needs to be good and our decision-making with the ball needs
to be good because they are great at turning you over.  
  
And listen, I mean, there's no question, this is a Final Four caliber team
we're playing. I heard people say that, but when you're coaching your own
team, you don't have a chance to really watch other teams as much as you'd
like to. Now that you've had a chance to study them, there's no question
they're a Final Four caliber team. This is as good as any team we've played in
the second round in my tenure.  
  
Q. Chris, even though Butler is four years in the Big East, you're still
relatively small private institution, do you sometimes get people referring to
Butler as a Mid-Major? Does it matter? Middle Tennessee is obviously kind of
in that role that Butler once was in. But I got to wondering that sometimes
Butler hasn't completely shed that label or if it even matters.  
COACH HOLTMANN: I don't know that it really matters. I don't get hung up on it
much. I think guys understand how good our league is. And usually the league
affiliation to some degree puts that moniker on you one way or the other.  
  
You know, we're trying to play quality basketball. So it's -- I think when --
we've been ranked in the Top 25 the last three years. So, I think that that
speaks for itself. But obviously, you know, two really good teams, which you'd
expect in the second round.  
  
Q. When teams often play one defense the whole game, there's generally
going to be a set of guidelines about how each coach wants their players to
attack that. What are the tenants or important elements when teams change
defenses frequently throughout a game versus staying static for 40 minutes?  
COACH HOLTMANN: You're relying on your principles at that point, sharing the
ball, having good spacing, moving it. They're really athletic. I mean, they
are a really -- and they play extremely hard. Kermit, they're well-coached,
play exceptionally hard, and that allows them to be active defensively and do
what they do defensively.  
  
You know, I think that more than anything we're relying on our principles. We
want to be simple in our approach and let our guys kind of play with free
minds. It's a quick prep for a really complicated defensive team. So, for us,
let's make sure our guys play with some freedom.  
  
Q. Coach, as we watched yesterday's games play out, a lot of the lower
seeds, while they may not have won, were very, very competitive. How much has
the landscape kind of closed in in college basketball?  
COACH HOLTMANN: You know, I think there's great parity, as we've seen. Most
people are picking Middle to win this game. It says something when they won 31
games. They're terrific.  
  
Before the tournament even started, I think people were picking Middle to come
out of this pod, or whatever you want to call it, and I get that. You look at
their body of work, and it makes sense. They're a Top 25 program.  
  
So, I think when you get into this thing, you realize that -- we haven't had
the kind of 2/15, 3/14 kind of upsets yet that we've had in the past, 4/13s
that we had maybe last year. That's been a little bit unique, because you
normally see that more this time of year. There's a ton of parity.  
  
Q. Chris, JaCorey Williams in particular, how unique of a player is he?
Have you seen anyone quite like him this year and what kind of a challenge is
that for your bigs to deal with him?  
COACH HOLTMANN: He's a load. Their bigs are outstanding and they are just
outstanding and their mismatch issues for everybody they play against. And
their team defense is so good that you can't really exploit -- it's not like
they're small on the interior, but it's hard to exploit them inside because
their team defense is so good.  
  
Listen, there's a reason he posted the numbers he posted this year. He and
Upshaw are just tremendous talents, and they're not the only ones. They've got
obviously other very good players, and it's the reason they're sitting at 31
wins.  
  
Q. Would you mind recounting again what kind of impact Woodson and
Savage have had since joining the starting lineup?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Certainly a needed one. I don't think it's just been them. I
think that our guys that have come off the bench have helped us, Kelan Martin
and Tyler Lewis have helped us in a lot of ways as well. You saw that impact
yesterday.  
  
But our guys understood there's seven, eight guys that could start. We went in
the year knowing that, and guys accepted that and accepted their role. And I
think our guys are very comfortable in the roles that they're in right now,
whether they're coming off the bench or starting.  
  
Q. Down the stretch yesterday when Upshaw was having some of his success
against Minnesota, a lot of times he wasn't dunking into the post until later
in the shot clock. How does that tax a defense differently than if he just
started out there every possession and fought for position?  
COACH HOLTMANN: They're really physical in what they do. I think they're the
most physical team we play, and that speaks to their duck-ins and just their
whole mentality. They're the most -- we play a lot of physical teams in the
Big East, but they're certainly one of the most physical teams we played all
year. And they play as hard as anybody we played all year. I think you can put
them up there with anybody we played the entire year, the elite teams we
played, and they're as good as anybody. That's why I said they're a Final Four
caliber team, and their physicality has a lot to do with their success.  
  
Q. Chris, Coach Davis was in here last night, and he mentioned that his
goal was to get his program like Butler's, in terms of the stability and
particularly the post-season accomplishments. I'm wondering if you guys know
each other and whether he said anything like that to you?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We know each other just from being on the road. I got a lot of
respect for Kermit. He's been a really good coach for a really long time. I
think people, when you post the kind of seasons he's posted, look at his last
five years, goodness gracious, I think he is getting the recognition that he
rightfully deserves and has earned. It's been very impressive.  
  
You know, I played him when I was an assistant at Ohio. We played one year,
and that was when I first kind of got a better understanding of how they play,
how physical they are, how tough they are. And we've seen each other on the
road a little bit, but we haven't spoken much.  
  
Q. Coach, when you say that most people are picking Middle Tennessee
State to win, what are you basing that on? Something you've seen, read, what
you've been told?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I've read plenty, yeah. I've read plenty of -- some of it has
been sent my way. Your head is to the ground here, and you're not necessarily
reading everything that's out there because -- but people -- I've had friends
that have sent me plenty of stuff. It was before -- honestly before the
tournament started, people were picking them. And like I said, I think it
makes sense given what they've done. So, it's going to be a great challenge.
We understand that.  
  
Q. Chris, with all that being said about Middle Tennessee, did they kind
of get snubbed with their seeding this year?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I don't think there's any way in the world they're the seed
that they were. I didn't think that going into it -- I don't really know how
all that works, and I don't pay attention to it, and I think the committee
does a difficult task very, very well. There's going to be some seeding issues
at times for sure. They're as good as any team I've seen at that seed in a
long, long time. That's clear.  
  
Again, you don't win 31 games without being the kind of a caliber team they
are, and I've said they're a Final Four caliber team and I believe it.  
  
Q. Chris, when you have faced the 1-3-1 against Marquette and against
Xavier, what kind of success did you have, what did you like about the way
your team attacked it, and what concerns you moving forward?  
COACH HOLTMANN: We didn't have any success against Xavier last year when they
ran it. It bothered us a lot. Now, our team was a little bit different at that
time. But we really struggled against it.  
  
And, you know, Marquette has run it similar although their defense is
different. I think their athleticism and length and how hard they play make
them difficult to attack.  
  
But I think we've had some good moments against it this year. To be honest
with you, we haven't seen it a whole lot, Bob. We've seen other defenses, but
we have not seen anything similar to this the entire year.  
  
Q. Did you know Tyler Lewis when he was at NC State at all? Did you have
any knowledge of him, or were you just given a tip about that he was looking
to move or --  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah. I knew he and his dad a little bit. I was an assistant
at Butler my first year, and someone had said that he was leaving. And once it
became official, I pursued it and -- I did know him a little bit. More than
anything, I knew people who knew them pretty well. Obviously his dad is in the
business, runs a scouting service. So, I had spoken to him a few times but
didn't know him super well.  
  
But Tyler came to our program when it was needed. We had struggled our first
year in the Big East, and to get him on a transfer was kind of a shot in the
arm because we had struggled with some point guard play and we knew we were
going to lose one, a really good one in Alex Barlow. He was an important
recruit for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Thank you.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Middle Tennessee student-athletes, JaCorey Williams,
Giddy Potts, and Reggie Upshaw. Thank you for joining us, guys. Questions,
please.  
  
Q. For Giddy, how do you guys react internally in the locker room when
people talk about your seeding, when they say you're an underdog, a Cinderella
team, especially after season you guys had?  
GIDDY POTTS: We really don't consider that game as an upset or anything you
want to call it. We just going out there and played our game like Coach told
us to and we came out a big win. And the seeding and stuff, I think that stuff
is just out the window for our team. We just go out there and play the game
that we love and enjoy it.  
  
Q. One of the other two guys to answer the same question, please?  
THE MODERATOR: JaCorey.  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: To touch on what Giddy said, we didn't really pay attention
to the seedings and the upsets or what's an upset or not an upset. I mean, I
don't know. People had us favored to win the game, some people say it was an
upset. I was kind of confused with the media. I was trying to focus on the
game, try to win the game, defend and rebound the best we could. And we
defended and rebounded well and we won the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Reggie.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I wouldn't say that we get caught up in the seeding or anything
like that, because, I mean, last year was a perfect example of, you know, us
just going out and playing the game. You know, that's the same way we
approached this game yesterday as far as, you know, just going out and trying
to execute what Coach Davis was calling and the different defenses that he was
throwing out, you know, in between transitions and stuff like that.  
  
Q. For Reggie and Giddy, what has JaCorey done this year in terms of
vocal leadership? What has he added other than what he does on the court?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: He just added experience. Anytime you can come from a High-
Major program and sit out a year and, you know, use that year to really make
your game better, appear become a more mature player, it does nothing but help
our team.  
  
And you know, JaCorey, he really embraced what he did last year, and it's
coming to light now with how he's playing. And as far as being the vocal
leader he is, I'm not really the most vocal guy at times and Giddy, he's never
really that vocal. JaCorey is the guy, if we need somebody to kind of spark
the huddle or just during the game when the 5 that are out there huddled up,
he's always the one guy you always hear his voice the most.  
  
GIDDY POTTS: I just think this guy right here, he's grown up as a man and --
on and off the floor. He helps guys in so many ways, and he just give our team
a spark when he's in the game, and when he's out of the game, just having the
vocal presence in the huddle and also stuff like that.  
  
Q. JaCorey, kind of talk about, Butler seeding aside, what you guys are
expecting to see and what kind of game we can expect to see on Saturday.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think you got to see two well-coached teams that focus on
defense and a lot of help defense by both teams, they rebound. From watching
film, their bigs, they're not conventional bigs, don't roll to the rim, they
can stay out and shoot the ball. They actually play their offense mostly
through one of their forwards, great passer, kind of hard to try to double-
team him because he knows the exact guy to hit.  
  
It's going to be a tough task, but I think you'll see a physical game, both
teams trying to play very good defense and both well-coached teams.  
  
Q. JaCorey, can you talk about or describe what it was like last year to
watch the tournament? I know you went to St. Louis, I believe on your own, and
can you just kind of go through the details of how far a drive it was, what
did you do in terms of lodging, all that kind of stuff.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: From Murfreesboro to St. Louis, four-and-a-half, five-hour
drive. I made it four and a half, kind speeding, kind of excited to watch
these guys play. There was no question I was going to go to the game no matter
how far it was. I don't care if it was 10, 12-hour drive. I wanted to show my
teammates I was there to support them. I was just as excited as they were to
play in the game. I felt the excitement, but I'm pretty sure these guys felt
way more excited than I was because they played in the game. I was excited for
my team. I thought I kind of helped it a little bit. I was on the scout team.
So I kind of went at Reggie and Giddy all year long on the scout team trying
to simulate other guy's play. I kind of had fun doing it. I enjoyed watching
these guys get the win last year.  
  
Q. Any of you, have you talked among yourselves or thought at all about
you guys are sort of in a role that Butler used to be in often as being from a
smaller conference and underdog team trying to make a run, what do you guys
think about that?  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Reggie and come down the line, please.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: At the beginning of the year, Coach Davis always, whenever we
have our first team meeting, he'll explain how we're trying to be a national
program and how us being a Mid-Major team, you know, we look up to teams like
Butler or VCU or the teams that are considered technically Mid-Majors but
really nobody really considers them that way. But we embrace that role of
being where they were a couple of years ago and being in that smaller
conference and kind of shocking the world or having a lot of upsets in our
background.  
  
You know at the end of the day, we're a confident group and we'll play against
anybody.  
  
GIDDY POTTS: Just like Reggie said, Coach explains everything at the beginning
of the year and just tells everybody that they have something to prove this
year and everybody take that as something that we can play for and have a chip
on our shoulder, and everybody basically took their role and played and we
came out as big team in the NCAA.  
  
So, I think that Coach is the guy that tells us what we need to do and how we
need to do it. That's a big key.  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think for me and our team, I think it's like honor playing
against a team like Butler because we want to be so much like their school. To
watch their school grow from seven years ago up till now is really incredible
the way the school has grown. Can't really call them a Mid-Major. They're kind
of like Gonzaga. They're so effective in the tournament, it's hard to compare
them to a major school. They play like a major school. To play this type of
team and knowing that Middle Tennessee is trying to trend upwards to try to
kind of be like Butler is a big honor for me and my teammates. We're trying to
help get on the map a little bit.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, can you sort of describe what it's like to play in a
league where you may have to win the conference tournament to get, and how
does that pressure throughout the season help you, do you think in a situation
like this where obviously the pressure just inherently is higher than it would
be in a different situation?  
GIDDY POTTS: I think we can't let any games get past us. We got to go out
there and play our game every game and go out there and be physical with every
team. Every team will give us their best shot. We got to go out there and play
our game every game.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I guess going off what Giddy said, playing in a conference
where it's basically seen as you have to win the conference tournament. We're
used to playing with that pressure. So when a team like yesterday when
Minnesota made their run where they jumped out on us 7-0, we were kind of used
to playing with that pressure having to fight back to get back into the game.
Playing in Conference USA and playing with that pressure, you have to win the
conference tournament to get back, you know, we're used to it.  
  
Q. JaCorey, what are some of the keys to playing the 1-3-1 effectively?
And when you play it well, what are some of the impacts that you see on the
other team?  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think a big key playing the 1-3-1 zone, you can't really
be complacent. I think the pressure has to be very aggressive. Our backline
has to be correct on the rotation. Basically all five guys have to be on the
same page. I think the more aggressive you are, the better it can be, and it's
kind of like a guard stopper kind of helps keep guards out of lane.  
  
They can't split it because we have a guy in the middle, so active and
athletic that can move at a guard. I think what it does for the game is get
teams out of rhythm. I know a lot of these teams, these High-Major teams are
used to seeing conventional man-to-man defense. 1-3-1 kind of slows you down
and changes the rhythm of the game.  
  
Q. Reggie, yesterday the crowd was behind me and your crowd and I could
hear them yelling lots of instructions to you and what kind of stuff to do.
And I'm wondering, after you hit the 3, kind of turned and pumped your fist
towards them, is it a lot of family in your crowd or are they very vocal group
usually at your games?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I mean, I consider all of the Blue Raider Nation my family. So
whenever anybody is trying to yell out instructions or anything like that, you
know, it's all for best. They just want to see us win. Everybody thinks
they're a coach while they're watching the games and know what the best thing
to do is. But you know, at that point I was just trying to make the shots that
my team needed.  
  
I didn't hear anybody yelling anything. I guess it was too many people for me
to hear, but I was just out there trying to help my team win.  
  
Q. Whether it was Coach Pitino yesterday or Coach Holtmann today, when
you guys look at yourselves and teams refer to you as being extremely physical
and playing very tough with a lot of aggression, where does that come from? Is
that something you guys take upon yourselves? Is it from the style of
practices you have? Where does the physicality come from that you're able to
overwhelm certain teams?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I think it's from our practices. Especially early in the year,
we do a lot of rebounding drills, lot of 2-1 rebounding drills, 3-3 box-out
drills. Just all the physical stuff that you see in our games today, you know,
really started in early, early November when we were going through the grind
of just trying to make it to the first game to start the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
Joined by Middle Tennessee Head, Coach Kermit Davis. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, at all a surprise when you found out you were going to be a 12
seed? Disappointing?  
COACH DAVIS: It wasn't a disappointment because we were glad to be in the
tournament, but it kind of alarmed us going forward that, you know, we were
ranked in the Coach's poll 25th and RPIs like 35, and everybody says you need
to play a good non-conference strength of schedule. It was 18th. We won 30
games.  
  
So, what alarmed us is what do we have to do next year or the year after. Then
when they ranked us 48th, when you got in, you got beat in the conference
tournament finals. We think we would have. It's a question you like to ask the
committee. It's full of a lot of guys with great integrity. So it is something
that was a concern. But it was about matchups, and obviously our team was
excited about being in.  
  
Q. Kermit, you've answered this -- you've answer this before, but how
important is it to your program to establish itself as another Butler or a
Gonzaga or Wichita State, VCU?  
COACH DAVIS: It's been a goal of mine for awhile. And when I took over 15
years ago, you know, Gonzaga, I used to be the coach at Idaho. So I saw when
Gonzaga played at a place with 2200. Dan Fitzgerald was coach and then they
hired Dan Monson and the rest is history.  
  
Then I -- really I've had such a great respect for Butler from afar because
they do it at our level in such a way with integrity, with athletes and
academics.  
  
Last year to be included with Butler -- this was a stat, there were seven
teams in NCAA Tournament last year to win a game and have 100 percent
graduation rate. We were one of them. Butler was one of them, Duke, Notre
Dame, Kansas, and I think Iowa. To be on the same footing as those guys and
just what they've done with sustainability is something that we're sure
striving for. We're not there yet by any means. We got a lot of hard work
ahead of us.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys really aren't looking at the seeding going into
Saturday. They're really looking at the matchup. How have you gotten them to
kind of do that?  
COACH DAVIS: You know, I think it's been -- we've been a team that's been
favored so much this year, you know, that they've been favorites in almost
every game we've played except maybe a couple, and so it's a team that carries
themselves with a lot of confidence. We have great, great respect for Butler
and very, very well-coached, good players. Just a typical Butler team. And
when you can win at Villanova, you have a chance to win a National
Championship and they do.  
  
But I know our guys are looking forward to it. We love great competition, and
we're going to get every bit of it tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you took the job 15 years ago, did you think that you'd be in
the same spot for that many years trying to build something, or did you
envision yourself kind of moving around the way certain individuals in the
profession do?  
COACH DAVIS: You know, if you come to Murfreesboro, the quality of life is
terrific. And I've raised both of my daughters there. And when you have -- I'm
probably one of the most fortunate guys, I've only had two Athletics
Directors, Chris Massaro and I are great friends, Boots Donnelly hired me. I
have the same president that hired me 15 years ago. And the quality of life is
as good as it is. I have a special needs daughter that's kind of grown up in
that city and the people there have just embraced Allie in an unbelievable
way. That's a huge part of us being a fabric of that community. There's a lot
of different things and, plus, you know, we've got a chance to really build
it, and it's been really fun for us to see it grow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: When Chris was here, he called you guys a Final Four team. Your
reaction to that?  
  
COACH DAVIS: That's a great compliment coming from Chris, and I think he's the
kind of guy that he's just trying to, you know, kind of what he sees and
that's the thoughts on our team. That makes us feel good. We do feel we can
play with anybody in college basketball. That's not arrogant. I'm sure Chris
thinks the same thing about his team. We've got really good players, a group
that has great experience, a team that we've won in big settings before, and,
you know, that's a great compliment. And you know, and I mean this, I told our
staff and our team that today, you know, like I just said, I think they're a
Final Four team and a team that can definitely win a National Championship.  
  
Q. I was wondering what your impression of Tyler Lewis was for Butler
and also what that type of smaller point guard does when you're trying to trap
or whatever you're doing in half court?  
COACH DAVIS: His basketball intellect -- I followed him at NC State, he's got
great quickness. He's a good a passer as anybody in college basketball at the
point guard position. His assist-to-turnover ratio is terrific. I'm a huge
fan. I've watched him from afar for a long time. After you really start
watching game after game like last night and today, you have a great
appreciation of his toughness and just his ability to find guys at the right
time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH DAVIS: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Steve Prohn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33079)

### [Nazareth Mitrou-Long](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32997)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Iowa - 84, Nevada - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Iowa State student-athletes, Monte Morris, who had 19
points and 8 assists tonight. And Naz Mitrou-Long, who had 13 points. Iowa
State Head Coach Steve Prohm is with us, and he'll start with an opening
statement. Then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH PROHM: Great win. Happy for these guys, happy for our team, our
university, our program. Want to congratulate Nevada. Really, really good
basketball. Eric has done a great job in a quick time to turn that program
around. They got a lot of history, lot of really good coaches been through
there, and they're good. They can really score.  
  
That was our biggest thing we talked to our guys about at halftime. We did
have great first half defense. That probably won us the game. Not to let them
get loose in the second half. And we did at times, partly because of them and
partly because of our offense. It's a great win, and now we've got a great
opportunity on Saturday against Purdue, which is obviously Big Ten champion.
So it's a great matchup.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Monte, how tough was it in the second half during that five-minute
stretch staying on the bench when they kept cutting into the lead?  
MONTE MORRIS: It wasn't that hard. I mean, I knew the guys, Donovan, Deonte,
and those guys was prepared all year. That's why we play those games for times
like this. I was cool on the bench. We made big shots. Donovan hit a 2, Deonte
got a baseline drive. I was fine on the bench. It was the Coach's decision,
not mine. I'm not worried about whether I play or not. I make sure my guy is
on because we're playing for the guy next to us. I'm all in.  
  
Q. Were you anxious to get back in?  
MONTE MORRIS: I didn't say nothing to him at all, man. I was going to get in,
you know.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: Coach was going to bench him.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: It's not my call or nobody's call or no player's fault.  
  
Q. You guys, trying to put them away but couldn't clamp the door on
them. They started to make a little bit of a comeback. How much of that is
just trusting in your teammates' experience and knowing that someone is going
to hit that shot every time you need it?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: It's everything, you know. Understanding that we -- that
we have to stay disciplined and composed and poised. In this type of
situation, anything can happen. That one shining moment, video you see all
types of comebacks and game wins all the time. So it was our job to keep
ourselves humbled and stick to the game plan, man.  
  
That team is a great team. They're capable of doing good things. We knew the
punches were going to come. We had to make sure we stopped the bleeding
whenever the time came. It wasn't just one guy tonight. We were able to rely
on a bunch of guys to do that.  
  
Q. You were able to get up big and then withstand their runs. What kind
of statement did you think you made?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: That's everything right there. You want to be able to
have a team going into this Dance that's composed when you get hit in the
face. And that's what we did, especially when our best player was on the
bench, you know, and knowing that when he comes in the game, we're going to be
able to stay composed because he doesn't turn the ball over and he's going to
lead us to a victory. You know, he had 4 tonight, but that's something you're
not going to see again. And you know it's good to have our bench coming in and
create a great spark that really feels -- that puts us in a confident spot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right. You're
dismissed. Thank you.  
  
Questions for Coach Prohm, please.  
  
Q. Steve, how good does that make you feel knowing you were able to kind
of weather that storm with him on the bench?  
COACH PROHM: Yeah. It was good. You know, he got that third foul quick. He got
a second one because he did a good job of not letting them get an uncontested
basket and then his third one came and played for a couple minutes with 3, and
then I needed to get him out just to be safe. I was probably thinking about
the eight-minute mark. I guess he went back in about six.  
  
I thought Donovan played really well tonight. I thought he did a lot of really
good things for us. I thought he continued to grow up. It's amazing to see the
progress that he's made. And so Monte, like he said, he was into the game as
everybody. Then you had to get him back in the game. When it got 5, I thought
the little pullup, I don't know if that was in the little six-minute area, but
that pullup jump shot, post-up 7 was big.  
  
Q. That five-minute stretch with him on the bench and cut to it 4. I
don't think you looked at him to put him in. Why not? And two, that group they
banged out 7 in a row, 8 in a row. What did you see that kind of extended the
lead back out, I think, to 11?  
COACH PROHM: Those guys have been playing well. Look at the first half. Our
bench was good. Donovan was really good in the first half. His plus/minus was
pretty good tonight, off the top of my head. But then I knew it was time to
get him back in.  
  
I felt, you know -- you know, I'm not going to be pressured to play certain
guys at times. I know obviously I need Monte Morris on the floor. But he got
in there at winning time and was able to close the game for us. I thought
Donovan was doing some good things for us. And then it may have went a minute
or two too long. You know, it did get to 4, but fortunately Naz, Monte --
excuse me, Matt and Deonte made some big plays for us.  
  
Q. Steve, a team like Nevada has proven they can find any which way to
score. Was there anything in particular you told the guys to focus on, maybe
they can do this, make sure to take this away down the stretch?  
COACH PROHM: The transition defense was the first thing. I thought we were
really good in the first half. We gave up a couple uncontested 3s. Make sure
we contested every shot. Second half, you know, we had a chance to get it to
15 and we missed a layup. Sometimes it also -- if you ever go back and look at
tape, watch what a missed layup usually leads to a basket. Instead of going
15, they hit a 3 to go to 10. We never could pull it away. But our biggest
thing was to make sure we didn't give Marshall any good looks.  
  
I thought we did that for the most part and then continued to do a great job
on Oliver. Caroline did a good job driving us, getting a couple and-1s. But
for the most part we were good. We were able to answer when we -- when we
couldn't stop them, we were able to answer Matt's big 3 in front of our bench,
Naz lofted 3.  
  
We got seniors. We got guys that can really shoot and spread you out. That
helps. But you watch Nevada play, they can really score. I mean Marshall,
Oliver, those guys can really score. Caroline is very good. You've got to
continue to play the right way.  
  
Q. Seems like Monte is always trying to make a statement with every
game. With the time he was in the game, what do you think his play said
tonight?  
COACH PROHM: Same thing it says every night. The best point guard in the
country. Very fortunate to coach him. He's the winningest player in the
history of this school. I talk about him all the time. I talk about him every
interview. He knows what I think about it. Everybody knows.  
  
He's the best point guard in the country. He's a winner. He won in high
school. He's kept Iowa State -- really brought Iowa State basketball to being
relevant and being a national program. He's been an integral part of that. Now
he's got a chance to go to his third Sweet 16. How many kids can say that that
play college basketball?  
  
I love him, you know, and that's why I want to keep coaching him a couple more
weeks before he goes off to the NBA.  
  
Q. Coach, how does that first half rank as far as you go during the
season defensively?  
COACH PROHM: Yeah, we were good. My AD told me we were good, so that made me
feel good. We were good defensively. You hold them to 30 percent shooting,
contested shots. We were locked in. These guys have locked in. They bought in
to trying to be good on the defensive end of the floor, contesting shots. Naz
has really taken it upon himself to take a lot of pride in being our defensive
stopper and putting him on the best guy. He's done that. I thought he done a
terrific job.  
  
Marshall finished with 16. He had to really work for those. I think our first
half defense gave us an opportunity to extend the lead, to be up 13 to where
we can weather a little bit of a run that Nevada would make.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck Saturday.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Amir Coffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32947)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Middle Tennessee - 81, Minnesota - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Minnesota student-athletes, Amir Coffey, Jordan
Murphy, and Head Coach, Richard Pitino.  
  
If I can ask Coach to make an opening statement, and then we'll have questions
for the student-athletes, please.  
  
COACH PITINO: Well, give credit to Middle Tennessee. They were the better team
tonight. They played extremely well. I thought that, you know, when Nate got
banged up, tried to tough it out in the second half, they were able to keep
subbing and go to their bench. And obviously that got to us. We were not very
deep late in the season and that caught up to us. They -- we cut it to 4, and
I think Upshaw made a big play, hit a 3. That really hurt us. Give them
credit. We couldn't stop them.  
  
We talked about defending and rebounding. We didn't really do either one. So,
you know, Kermit does an awesome job. That doesn't surprise me. They're a
really good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, did you expect them to be changing defenses?
You knew about their 1-3-1. What kind of problems did it present as far as
--  
AMIR COFFEY: Yeah. We kind of went over those defenses in all the walk-thrus
and practices that we had, and, you know, the things with those defenses kind
of gets you late in the shot clock, kind of slows you down at first. You have
to make a play pretty quick.  
  
Q. Your team only had 4 offensive rebounds. What do you think led to
that?  
AMIR COFFEY: Out rebounded us. They boxed out and took that away from us.
That's usually something that we're good at. They keyed in on it.  
  
Q. You guys played night-in-night-out against big physical teams. Is
this a No. 12 seed in your mind?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, take this one.  
  
JORDAN MURPHY: All in all, they determine seeding. Whether they're a 12 seed
or any number of seed, I don't really know how to answer that question. So, I
mean, they're a really good team to their credit, so, I mean, I really don't
know.  
  
Q. Jordan, how much do you think foul trouble impacted the play of your
forwards?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think foul trouble affected us a lot. Reggie got two early
ones. Eric got two early ones, if I'm not mistaken. May have made us a little
bit less aggressive going down the stretch. So it really hurt us. Got 4 in the
second half late. That kind of affected us as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. How big an impact was it that Akeem wasn't able to play again for you
guys on and off the court?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Akeem is one much our main leaders, so of course it's going to
leave a big impact, volume shooter. I think he's a good 3-point shooter. It's
going to affect us in some way. Other guys have to step up. I mean, we tried
our best without him so, yeah.  
  
Q. What was the feeling on the bench after you guys brought it within 4
late?  
AMIR COFFEY: We made a little bit of a comeback and just didn't get over the
hump. But, you know, when we were in that comeback, we were excited trying to
get over the hump, trying to get it up and take the lead but just didn't get
there.  
  
Q. Richard, you got a young team --  
THE MODERATOR: Ask for the student-athletes. He'll take questions in a moment.  
  
Q. Sorry. Amir, Jordan, what do you two hope to take away from this
experience or what do you plan to take away from this experience?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Just the whole environment, I guess. I mean, this is a pretty
high intensity game. We played in games like this before. It's a different
time of year, teams are going to give you the best shot no matter what. I'll
take away that. Our guys will take away a whole lot from this experience.  
  
AMIR COFFEY: This time of year seeding doesn't really matter. Every good team
makes the tournament. You have to play hard no matter what seed you're playing
or who you're playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thanks, guys, you're
released.  
  
Questions for the Coach, please.  
  
Q. Same question for you Richard, lot of guys coming back, lot of guys
that come out for the first time in the tournament. What do you hope they take
away from all this?  
COACH PITINO: You know, I don't -- they didn't seem affected by anything. None
of it really felt a whole lot different. These guys played in a lot of games.
The only thing that felt different were the timeouts were longer. Other than
that, their approach was good. You know, we just kind of ran out of gas. When
Nate started -- he was hurt and couldn't sub guys out. That was very, very
difficult. So, probably give you a little bit more confidence that you were
there, you know, and you just know how to deal with things.  
  
But I didn't really feel like we were nervous. I thought we were ready to go
at the beginning of the game. We just couldn't get stops.  
  
Q. Richard, what was Nate's injury there, and also do you feel like
their matchup affected him in any way that early?  
COACH PITINO: You know, he hurt his hip. I don't know when he did it, but it
was in the second half. He was trying to fight through it, you know, as best
he could. The defense, their defense? I thought we were attacking it pretty
good. Shot 54 percent in the second half, which we couldn't get stops. I mean,
you let them shoot 48 percent, you give up 81 points, I didn't necessarily
have a problem with the offense, I had a much bigger problem with the defense
and the rebounding. I kind of liked the way we were attacking it for the most
part.  
  
You know, Nate had a couple turnovers, obviously, but again, when you can't
sub, really, really hard because he needed a break.  
  
Q. Coach, could you follow-up that rebounding question? What did Middle
Tennessee do that kept you guys away from getting your rebounds?  
COACH PITINO: They did a good job of blocking out. Give them credit. They were
really blocking out well, being physical with our guys. You know, some of it
is probably on us, sticking in the backs a little too much. They're a big,
strong, physical team. We were getting tired and they were -- they kept
subbing and subbing and getting sharper as the game went on. It's not the
ending you want.  
  
Q. Are you able to put this into perspective yet, given the turnaround
you had overall this season?  
COACH PITINO: I will, you know. Obviously, I will. Now probably -- now isn't
the time. I told our guys after the game, listen, this tournament is tough
because, you know, you sit there for five months or whatever and you do some
unbelievable things over 33 games. To flip it like we did, our players deserve
a lot of credit to be able to do that.  
  
I know that now going into next year -- you know, they raised the expectations
so quickly. And next year it's going to be even more, obviously when you have
almost everybody back and you got some exciting recruits coming in. Davonte
will be back.  
  
I looked down yesterday during practice and I said I looked at Jarvis,
Davonte, and Akeem, wow, it will be nice going in there with that depth.
Obviously, that will help. I've been in some tournaments before. I kind of
know the way it works. Our guys won't feel that way. But I think in a couple
days they'll be very proud of the way it is. They won't feel it now, but
eventually.  
  
Q. With the interchangeability of their two bigs with JaCorey and Reggie
being able to play from the outside and moving in, is that difficult to
replicate in terms of the flow of their offense versus a traditional team
where the guys tend to stay more down in the blocks?  
COACH PITINO: It's a tough cover. We put our 3-man on JaCorey Williams, you
know, this week because you don't have anybody who can really simulate it. I
thought Reggie was bothering him at the beginning and some silly fouls.
UpShaw, he's a talented player. There's a lot of guys at our level in the Big
Ten that want a guy like that. They're able to make plays and Upshaw was able
to do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. I know it's early, but back to Nate Mason. Do you think that's any
kind of serious injury or could it be lagging or just got banged up a little
bit?  
COACH PITINO: I have no idea. I don't think it's serious, but I don't know.
He's got plenty of time to recover. I know that. I expect him back next
October, but I don't know. I'm not sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
Q. Just curious, what happened on the technical?  
COACH PITINO: I yelled at the ref and he gave me a technical. I deserved it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Caleb Swanigan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32307)

### [Vincent Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32308)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Purdue - 80, Vermont - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Purdue Head Coach, Matt Painter and student-athletes,
Caleb Swanigan and Vincent Edwards. Coach, we'll ask you to please make an
opening statement, and then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I felt that really the difference in the game came to the
start of the second half. I thought we had a lot of energy. I thought Vince
got us off to a good start and then our ability not to turn the ball over and
give ourselves a chance in the second half. We had a couple turnovers in the
second half. We were able to maintain our edge, and I really thought that was
the difference in the game.  
  
Our guys, you know, answered every one of their runs by either going inside,
knocking down 3s, and they were a good team. One of the best teams we've faced
all year. Very, very balanced. Can do a lot of different things and just a
really good basketball team. This was a huge win for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Caleb, you've played with toughness always. It seemed like you were
especially fierce on the boards and kind of blocking shots today. Did
something get into you?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: I didn't have any fouls. I just blocked the shots when I saw
the opportunity.  
  
Q. Vince, how is this feeling different than the past couple of years?  
VINCE EDWARDS: We won. That's the difference right there. To go out two years,
just -- this being my third year, going out two years, this is terrible. To
get this and get that monkey off your back, it feels great.  
  
Q. What was difficult for you in the second half? Coach Painter alluded
to it. 8 points to start off and went on to lead the team in scoring.  
VINCE EDWARDS: Honestly, I was just getting myself -- trying to get myself
together, just trying to calm myself down. I was frustrated with myself, just
being really hard on myself. Just coming out in the second half, just told
myself to calm down and play. And my teammates did a good job of finding me
and getting the open shots.  
  
Q. Vince, this team does really well when you're aggressive. Is that
something you set out to do from the onset of this game?  
VINCE EDWARDS: It's something I have to take when it's there. Coach Painter
teaches being patiently aggressive. That's definitely something I keep in mind
and keep in consideration and try not to force anything. Take what the defense
gives me.  
  
Q. Vince, how personally did you take it, especially couple years ago
that Cincinnati game?  
VINCE EDWARDS: I mean, that thing -- both of those games just replayed in my
head all year, even though we had seasons to play. I still could replay it
almost every last three, four possessions, in each of those games. So to come
out here, I just really wanted the win. And I can tell the guys in this locker
room I'm surrounded and my coaches wanted to win. So we were able to pull it
out.  
  
Q. Caleb, just that second half for you guys, what do you think worked
well?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Just really anything we were running. We just had to execute
it, and if we run it right, it usually worked.  
  
Q. Vince, you talked about the pain of those last two years. When you've
gone through those experiences, does the mental focus become a little bit
sharper down the stretch? Granted, you guys had a bit of a cushion. Vermont
was making a game. Does the mental toughness and sharpness get a little more
clear as you go down the stretch making sure there aren't upset or mistakes to
let people back in the game?  
VINCE EDWARDS: When you have been through this as many times as we have,
especially the junior class, it sharpens you. We kind of tell ourselves down
the stretch that we've been here, we've been here, so we know what to do. We
got to be smart and execute and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Caleb, you guys have talked about how you were going to be defined by
this NCAA Tournament and kind of how it went. How important is this one?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: It's important, but after today it's not important and it's
the next game. That's just how we're going to approach it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right, guys. Thank
you.  
  
Questions for Coach Painter, please.  
  
Q. Matt, nothing to do with the game. You know Tom Cream got fired
today. Can I just get your thoughts on that?  
COACH PAINTER: You know, it's difficult anytime one of your colleagues or
anybody in your league or just in coaching, it's a tough profession and, you
know, you feel for somebody. You work hard and to be successful and you put
your best foot forward and then you want to make things work and you also want
to finish the job, keep going. When they part ways, it's a difficult thing,
but it's part of coaching.  
  
And I think Hubie Brown is the one who said you officially become a coach once
you get fired for the first time. You go into it knowing it's probably going
to happen to you at least once, maybe two, three times and -- but, you know,
it's unfortunate.  
  
Q. Matt, you had a Vermont team that kept coming at you and coming at
you. You've had guys that have had some heartbreaks here in the tournament.
Were you able to see the growth and maturity from your guys in the stretch,
every time Vermont got close they seemed to have an answer for it, sign of
growing up?  
COACH PAINTER: Sometimes, you know, playing hard and making shots and you play
hard and you miss shots sometimes. Lot of people want to know what's wrong.
There's nothing wrong. It's a really good team out there. This could have went
either way. Vermont is a really good basketball team. They made some tough
shots. They made some tough plays. We obviously made a little bit more. I
think we had a matchup on the interior. Lamb, he was giving us trouble and
they didn't make as many 3s, and Steidl going out didn't help them. But, you
know, Vermont is a really good basketball team. Our guys did show some
maturity down the stretch and making plays and getting stops and Swanigan made
some huge blocks there at the end. We came up with some loose balls. We still
had a couple breakdowns. Fouled a 3-point shooter and had a bad switch. That
cost us some points.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about, if you could, talk about Carsen Edwards. To have a
freshman that's that unflappable, that young, coming into an environment like
this and just -- I mean granted, kind of at that time good with the bad with
him, but the mindset that he has, there's no fear there. How does that rub off
on his older teammates and how important is he going into the rest of this
tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: It's great for us. Gives us somebody that can break people down
all off the dribble, can make a pull up, make a pull up 3. He gives us a
different look and gives us some speed, and combined with that skill, that's a
tough matchup. So when you can bring a guy like him off the bench and the
experience of Spike Albrecht to go along with the size of Isaac Haas, we have
a pretty good eight right there.  
  
No, it doesn't matter. It could have been an open gym game and he would have
the same numbers. The environment and things around him doesn't phase him. But
the thing I like about it, basketball is important and he looks forward to
games like this.  
  
Q. When the game started, there was obviously a feeling-out period for
both teams, given the size discrepancy. How do you think your guys adjusted to
the way that they run their offense and the amount of motion that they have,
because they did draw out the big guys at certain times.  
COACH PAINTER: We wanted to switch a little bit of it. But we also wanted to
get back on a couple of their guys. They forced us to change. We love keeping
our big guys at home, but sometimes we'll end up switching. We just had a
different matchup. We put our 5 on Wills and then we switched everything else
out and kept a low man at home if they tried to play the mismatch and post us
up.  
  
They're a good team. Anytime you have size that can drive the ball and shoot
the basketball from the perimeter, it gives 7-footers and 6-10, 250-pound guys
a little pit of an issue. You're going to have a downside no matter what you
do. It's just the fact about now you want to be able to live with that
downside, and we thought that was the best way to do it and allow us to
rebound.  
  
Q. It's a big day for Cuonzo Martin. Obviously, you've been very busy as
he has, but have you had a chance to talk to him about it and what was your
reaction when you heard the news about it?  
COACH PAINTER: I didn't talk to him about why he did it. I just texted him and
congratulated him. There's always -- you know, the place that you're at and
the place you're going, you have personal and professional reasons why you
make those decisions. He didn't share those with me.  
  
He'll do great once he gets a bunch of players, like anybody else. There is no
such thing as a great coach and average players. You got to get really good
players in a really good league. He's coached in Missouri Valley, he's coached
in the Big Ten, he's coached in the SEC, the PAC-12. He understands what it he
takes to win and -- but, you know, you got to also, you know, you got to have
the guys, and that might take a couple years before you can get to that point.  
  
Q. P.J. Thompson had an opportunity in the Big Ten tournament the hit a
free throw. He said afterwards, "Just watch, I'm going to hit a couple shots."
After that 3-pointer, he kind of looked towards the bench and shook his head.
What was it like to see him kind of get a little bit of redemption?  
COACH PAINTER: Biggy made a good play. When you're a great player like
Swanigan, being able to trust your teammates and sometimes he'll make plays
and try to step through double teams. When you get doubled, you got to pass
the basketball. I though he made a great read and P.J. stepped up and made
that shot. I thought he made some really nice plays for us the whole night. I
thought our backcourt did that.  
  
It's good, you know. It's a hard thing when you go through it and something
breaks down and you play and you lose a game, it's disappointing and hurts.
You want to get back out there and, you know, do some positive things and help
your team win and he did that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? All right. Thank you. Good luck
Saturday.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Pat Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33047)

### [Xavier Cooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33050)

### [Keon Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33049)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Butler - 76, Winthrop - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Winthrop student-athletes, Xavier Cooks and
Keon Johnson, also Head Coach Pat Kelsey. Coach will make an opening statement
and then we'll take questions for the student-athletes. Coach, please.  
  
COACH KELSEY: First, I want to credit Butler. Tip your cap to them. I think
everybody kind of knows some of the things have been talked about, Chris and I
are friends. I'm happy for him and his success and I think they're going to
really make a dent in this tournament moving forward.  
  
You know, they jumped on us early and, you know, it's a hard team to come back
on because of their style of play and things like that. So, you credit them.
Keon is the senior, and he's one of the best players in the history of this
school, and I thought they did a very good job in their game plan in trying to
contain him.  
  
But, it's a very fun team to coach. I told all those guys in the locker room
that they have nothing to be ashamed of. They should keep their heads held
high. They had a phenomenal season. In about six, seven months there will be a
banner put back up in the Winthrop Coliseum and this senior class has
reestablished Winthrop basketball to its right rightful place as a force in
Mid-Major basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. How much did their physicality impact the game and not necessarily
like their height or anything, but kind of like their girth and how solid they
were?  
KEON JOHNSON: They were a big, physical team. 45, great player, big guy. They
shot a lot of free throws. Most of the points came from the paint. So, I think
they got to the line like at least 30 times, somewhere around there.  
  
Q. You know, how were you guys feeling when you had the 7-0 run, got it
to 7 points, timeout. What -- how did you feel at that point in the game? Did
you feel like you guys could make the push?  
XAVIER COOKS: We had confidence the whole game. We had a lot of confidence in
that little run. We've been in that position before and really thought we were
going to come over the hump this time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes. All right, guys.
You're free to go. Thank you.  
  
XAVIER COOKS: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll entertain questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. How good was the ball movement for them early in the game, especially
with Woodson being on the end of that?  
COACH KELSEY: Yeah. They do a great job playing inside out, and we worked very
hard on our plan on what we were going do when the ball went into the post.
You know, the speed of their ball movement early on was faster than the moving
parts of our defense and got lost a couple times in rotation. And it let the
Woodson kid get a couple open looks, and he's already a very, very good
3-point shooter. When you give him three, four steps where he can kind of lick
his fingers and measure the wind and shoot it, he's going to make 80 percent
of those. I bet if he's back at Hinkle with nobody shooting in the gym, he's
going to make 80 out of 100 3s. You let a guy you got to run-off the 3-point
line get some looks in the first half, I think he had five 3s and that set the
tone for the game.  
  
Q. In terms of what they tried to do against Keon, was it different than
some of the things you've seen throughout the season, did they do anything new
or just a different type of player?  
COACH KELSEY: I think first and foremost this is a BIG EAST team. You know, I
played and coached at Xavier, but my family is all Xavier fans, so I watch a
lot of BIG EAST basketball, and they're some blood baths when you watch some
of those games, and it's a strong, physical brand of basketball, and we
obviously knew that.  
  
They set the tone from a physicality standpoint, and I don't think we really
met the physical challenge the way we needed to.  
  
They're a little bigger and stronger at some positions, but you have to make
up for that with your activity and your nastiness, and they beat us to some
50/50 balls. And you can't let bigger, stronger guys beat you to those balls
where it comes down, you know, to that thing there in your chest cavity. But
this is a team with a lot of heart, our team, and they fight their butts off,
and I think they made the Winthrop fan base proud.  
  
We're an eat-loose-balls team. You have to tip your cap to Butler for beating
us early on, setting the tone on some of the hustle-plays-type thing. That's
Butler basketball. I'm not here to do a recruiting documentary for Butler.
They have a brand of basketball as well, and that's about toughness and it's
about defense and it's about execution and it's about ball movement. And I
like to think that sounds a little bit like Winthrop basketball as well.  
  
Again, you tip your cap to them. They were better today. I think they got
physical with Keon, bigger, longer, stronger defenders, try to limit his
touches, you know. They ran at him off ball screens and tried to get the ball
out of his hands and you know, it worked out for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? All right. Thank you.  
  
COACH KELSEY: Thank you. Appreciate it.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Butler - 76, Winthrop - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to be joined by Butler student-athletes, Andrew
Chrabascz, Avery Woodson and Tyler Lewis and Butler Head Coach, Chris
Holtmann.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: I was proud of our guy's effort today. I was really proud of
their effort. I think they had great regard and respect for a Winthrop team
that we knew was very good and capable, and I liked their attention to detail
for the most part in the game. And I really liked their ability, willingness
to share the ball for the most part in the game. So I thought we did some good
things against a quality team. Proud of them for their effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. How did you guys think you did defensively on Keon Johnson?  
AVERY WOODSON: I think we did a pretty good job. He's a very explosive player
and can get going at any point in, time but I think we did a good job
containing him.  
  
Q. Avery, you seemed a little cold in here yesterday wearing that parka.
I wonder if you got any pushback from your teammates over there and if you
felt a lot warmer during that first half.  
AVERY WOODSON: They know where I'm from. I'm not used to this cold weather
(laughter). They had no problem with me wearing that jacket. John said I was
good so -- but the first half, I was just the end result of a great ball
movement. Our player makers did a great job of getting me open. Credit goes to
them.  
  
Q. How critical was it to kind of check their runs every time they tried
to get maybe 7-2, 7-0 run? You guys kind of knocked them back.  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: That's the big thing about the NCAA Tournament. There's
going to be a game of runs. They're a very explosive team. So, maintaining it
and controlling like how limited the run is is important. I think the one run
where they got it to 7 was a little too much, especially because it was lack
of defense and some effort plays on our end and some execution on offense
during that stretch.  
  
But like we said, we contained their big scorers I think pretty well. Little
things here and there that we got to fix before Saturday.  
  
Q. Avery, you had a pretty big game here against Marquette back in
February. Another hot shooting night today, too. Are you comfortable playing
here, obviously?  
AVERY WOODSON: I just play. I can't give you a direct answer to why, but I'm
just playing, honestly.  
  
Q. Tyler, about midway through the second half, you sort of dominating
by penetrating. Did they switch defenders? Did you get in the mood? What
happened, what switch got flicked, if anything?  
TYLER LEWIS: Well, Coach is always on me about my pace and controlling the
pace out there on the court. That's what I wanted to do, and there was a
couple seams out there and I just split the gaps a couple times. And they gave
me a lane to the basket, and I was able to make a couple layups.  
  
Q. For Andrew, couple things. What's it like when the four other guys
are playing with Tyler and he's really out there with flare and ball just
moving so fast and then also any residual effect coming off the two losses to
end the season, because it seemed like those happened like three years ago
instead of a week ago?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Those two losses those were learning experiences for us. I
mean, obviously you don't want to lose but, at the same time, especially from
the Xavier game we could take a lot away from that game. But as for our
offense, we know whenever we move the ball from side to side, get paint
touches, everything like that, that's when we're at our best. When we're
stationary playing a little bit one-on-one, that's when we're hurting ourself.  
  
Today, just like I said, I think we did a really good job just -- had good
pace with most of our offensive sets and moved the ball side to side really
well.  
  
Q. Andrew, what was it like? It seemed like they switched on a lot of
your screens, a couple times you -- Keon Johnson was trying to guard you. What
do you think they were trying to do and what was your plan when that
happened?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I actually faced that a lot with the BIG EAST schedule
switching 1 through 4. You just have to read it. I mean, some teams trap it,
some teams are sitting on your lap with the other defenders. I think I should
have been a little bit more patient or more aggressive at times, but, at the
same time, we had a lot of open looks from -- like I said, our formula is
inside out, whether it's paint touches or whether it's getting into the post.  
  
So, yeah, switching 1 through 4 just have to read it, but at the same time, I
think -- I thought we did a really good job moving the ball around today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? All right, guys, you're
free to go. Thank you. Now we'll entertain questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Chris, what did you think of what Kamar was able to do today, and how
did you think the hedging of the bigs influenced what Keon was able to do and
not do?  
COACH HOLTMANN: It was really important for the game. He's so dynamic with the
ball. I thought Kamar, you know, worked extremely hard to make it difficult
for him. He got loose a little bit there in that stretch in the second half,
but I thought he was really critical.  
  
Listen, my staff just told me that I looked terrible and looked like I hadn't
slept in a week, which was nice of them (laughter). The reason was that kid. I
mean, he is a load to guard.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the way that Tyler was able to have that four,
five-minute stretch in the second half after they made the run and how his
play influenced you guys pushing the lead back up.  
COACH HOLTMANN: His -- we've seen him do that all year, kind of come in and
make really impactful stretches, and, you know, I think it was important for
him. Sometimes there's difficult matches -- matchups for him to guard out
there, and that limits -- can limit his overall minutes. When we don't have to
-- when we can put him in there and leave him in there and he's helping our
defense, he is -- he's just terrific with the ball and terrific, and he was
terrific today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, we know what a tough business the college basketball can be.
Just wonder what your reaction was to Indiana firing Tom Cream today or if you
even knew that that had occurred?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Did that happen?  
  
Q. It happened right before the tournament started.  
COACH HOLTMANN: You know -- you know, I don't know what to say to that. I've
got a lot of respect for Tom and how his team plays. I had one of my closest
friends lose a job not too long ago at Illinois and listen, we all get into
this knowing the deal. Do I disagree with those decisions? Absolutely.
Absolutely I do.  
  
My bias -- do I disagree with the decision at Illinois? Absolutely. They don't
care. But I know how hard that guy works, and I know how committed he was to
his players, and I believe he was really close to turning the corner.  
  
So, you know, we know what we bargain for in this whole deal and everybody
wants to be here now, and when you're not here, people get upset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. How big of a physical advantage did you feel like you had at certain
positions? Because it seemed like maybe it showed up at the free-throw line a
little bit.  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah. That was important for us. I think -- it's how we need
to play. Getting to the free-throw line is important to us, it needs to be --
continue to be more important for us than what it has at times. The BIG EAST
is brutal, and it's a very physical league. But we did -- that was a big part
of our game plan is could we impact things from the paint out and offensively.  
  
So, you know, getting to the line 30 times was critical.  
  
Q. Did Kelan cramp up and is there any concern for him moving forward?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Just got a knee to the thigh or something. A charley horse.
He's fine. I think he'll be sore, but our training staff will do a great job
with him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck Saturday. One more? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Coach, does where you lost the past two years create any additional
pressure to try to get to the Sweet 16 this year?  
COACH HOLTMANN: There's pressure every time we play. We love it. If you don't
love pressure, you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time. We're going to
embrace it and have a lot of fun and cut loose and play -- we're going to play
a great team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kermit Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25105)

### [Reggie Upshaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30720)

### [JaCorey Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33128)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Middle Tennessee - 81, Minnesota - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Middle Tennessee student-athletes, Reggie Upshaw and
JaCorey Williams, and Middle Tennessee Head Coach Kermit Davis, who will make
an opening statement, and then questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, congratulations. Go ahead.  
  
COACH DAVIS: Thank you. I'd like to compliment Minnesota and Richard. He's a
good friend of mine, and the turnaround they had this year was terrific. We
beat a really physical, tough Big Ten, the team that had won at Purdue, won at
Maryland. I thought our team, you know, we got out 0-7 but we're getting balls
where we wanted. Lynch kind of intimidated us earlier. Minnesota made a great
run. Reggie really made some great plays for us in a 4, 5-minute stretch.
Balanced scoring and the key today was 37-24 rebounding. So plus 13 for us is
a big part of the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Reggie, Coach just mentioned that the plays that you made when
Minnesota was making that run, what's going through your head and what were
you doing during that stretch?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: During the timeout, you know, we were confident that we would
be able to weather the storm of their run, but, you know, in my head I was
just thinking I'm a senior leader so, you know, JaCorey was having a rough
night so I just -- Giddy was in foul trouble. I felt like this was the perfect
time for me to kind of step up and, you know, kind of shoulder the offense and
try to get everybody else going.  
  
Q. JaCorey, talk about Brandon's play there in the first half,
especially when you guys got down 7-0 and how he was able to kind of give you
guys some energy off the bench.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think Brandon took it as a challenge to come in and affect
the game. He came in and immediately did that. He gave us a great spark, got a
couple nice buckets, got a couple blocked shots off the bench. Rebounding the
ball and we had to match up with Reggie Lynch, so he was the perfect guy to
put in the game at the time.  
  
Q. Reggie, how big was Aldonis Foote today, he's an energy guy and plays
at the front, 1-3-1. How big was he today?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: Anytime you can get like Aldonis to come off the bench and
provide a spark when the starters kind of go out, that's always big, and today
was a prime example of how our bench is a key to our success.  
  
Q. Both you guys, what was it like today seeing Lynch in person and also
the 1-3-1, how much do you think that bothered them today when you switched it
out in the first half?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: Well, seeing him in person, it reminded me of our center when I
was a freshman. They had the same kind of similar build as far as just really
long arms and really athletic. I feel like the 13 was probably the reason we
won today. It kind of threw their guards off it, definitely threw off Mason.
He's used to just kind of coming down the court and creating mismatches off
ball screens, so when we were able go to our 13, back to our double fist, it
threw him off. He wasn't able to get in the paint and make plays for others.  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think --  
  
Q. Go ahead.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think Reggie Lynch really started the game off with a
great impact for their team. He's real big, hard to kind of play with him
inside, he was blocking shots, rebounding. Kind of changed the game a little
bit, went to the 1-3-1, like Reggie said, it's really our bread and butter,
kind of helped the whole team guard everybody on the court.  
  
Q. Reggie, second year in a row you guys have beat a Big Ten team in the
first round. How did this feel different tonight, or did it feel different
tonight from the game last year?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: It's really the same. The only difference was last year we were
a major underdog, and this year everybody kind of had us either winning by 2
or losing by 2. Pretty much even matchup. But, you know, we still kept the
same mindset coming into the game. We just played our game, you know, we would
be able to walk away with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thanks, guys.  
  
Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys took care of the ball really well again today. Talk
about how you were able to keep possession.  
COACH DAVIS: We're one of the top 15 teams in the country in assist to
turnovers, and tonight, 19-8, Minnesota is one of the best defensive teams in
the Big Ten. So it was a key part and they did a good job, too. Even as much
as we were trying to be active in our 13, they only turned it 8. It was kind a
well-played game by both teams taking care of it.  
  
Q. Coach, at this point in the year, how big is that all-hands-on-deck
mentality where everyone comes to play, everyone contributes in their own way,
how big is that this time of the year?  
COACH DAVIS: I thought if we had any kind of advantage, I thought the depth,
you know, we're going to play ten guys and thought all ten guys made a
contribution. You know, we got to their bench a little bit and it is. It's
what made us good. You can't win the number of games we've won, you know, with
people getting nicked up, fighting foul trouble, in and out of different games
unless you've got a strong bench. We got down 7-0. I thought Foote and Brandon
Walters, Antwain Johnson settled us back in to get in the flow of the game
right.  
  
Q. Kermit, how much did the experience last year help you guys tonight?
Very much looked like a veteran team, a NCAA Tournament veteran team out
there.  
COACH DAVIS: I don't think there's any question. Our team has had that the
whole year. You have Giddy and Reggie who were the two leading scorers in the
win a year ago. Four other guys played.  
  
So, our team, we're a loose team, we have a lot of fun, but when you blow the
whistle, that team is a focused group, great practice team. Today at game day
practice right on point, and there was no doubt in their mind that they
thought they were going to win the game.  
  
Q. Kermit, in particular the Reggie 3 from the wing, I think they had
cut the lead to 4. How big was that particular shot and what did you see from
him in that stretch when he kind took the game over?  
COACH DAVIS: He made that shot. Made one at UAB a couple weeks ago, Joe, as
you know, and then we just started trying to call some set things for him. And
even when you call set things for him, Minnesota is so good you still have to
go make plays over people. The step-back kind of the old school, 1950, you
know, off the wrong foot shot about 15 feet was really a big shot, and he just
done that, Joe. He's winning better than any player in the history of our
school. He made big shot, big play, you know, for the last two, three years.  
  
Q. Kermit, was your plan to try to attack them early and get them in
foul trouble, get their bigs in foul trouble? Was -- even though you're down
0-7, you're starting to get some fouls on them.  
COACH DAVIS: No question. Walters is a big guy. You look at how JaCorey and
Reggie play, it's really about 17, 18 feet downhill off the dribble. Lot of
things we do offensively is not sitting a guy on the post with them, but it's
driving the ball. And so really we've had a lot of success whoever we've
played, being able to spread the floor and drive their bigs, because they're
good defensive guys.  
  
And so that was the plan, and they did a good job early, Lynch did, but I
thought it affected the game as it went on.  
  
Q. Kermit, obviously the mismatch in the seeding, 5 versus 12, should
this be called an upset, especially given what you guys did last year and what
you looked like tonight?  
COACH DAVIS: I don't think so at all. I don't. We have a lot of respect for
Minnesota. Our record speaks for itself and kind of what we've done all year
long. And I think just Reggie said, it's about a pick'em game, and it was a
good team and -- but I know our players don't think it was an upset by any
means.  
  
Q. Kermit, what about Tyrik tonight, a couple moments in the second half
you weren't especially happy with a couple things. He also made a lot of plays
for you guys. What did you see from him --  
COACH DAVIS: About the first thing he kind of said back, "It was only my first
turnover." I said, "Well, you're right, Tyrik, that's pretty good."  
  
So he really had a great floor game, 5 assists, 1 turnover, a big 3 on a set
play. He doesn't play like a freshman. Got great toughness. He's kind of the
stability of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit what your game plan was to keep
Minnesota off the rebounds? You held them to only 4 offensive rebounds
today.  
COACH DAVIS: We're just a rebounding team. Obviously, it's an emphasis every
time we play, especially when you play Minnesota. I think the changing of
defenses, it kind of gets people to stand at times. And so when we go from our
1-3-1 to 2-3 zone, back to some man-to-man, and so teams don't get in a great
rhythm of offense. I think when teams get in a better rhythm of offense, they
become a better rebounding team. I think some of those changes probably
affected that.  
  
Q. How much better equipped do you think this team is to turn this
around two days later and try to win a big game?  
COACH DAVIS: Yeah. I think we're totally different than we were last year. I
loved our team last year. I just think with our depth and our experience and
the amount of games we've won, the teams that we've beaten on our schedule,
Joe, Butler, I've got -- I took this program over 15 years ago. My biggest
goal was trying to get our program to be like Butler, the stability, what
they've done, you know, all those things are things that are important.  
  
I have a ton of respect for their program. But I think it's going to be a heck
of a basketball game. I think it's going to be two really good teams, and
should be kind of a game like this one tonight, I bet.  
  
Q. Do you expect Saturday's game to be rather low scoring?  
COACH DAVIS: It's two good defensive teams. It is. You beat Villanova twice,
you've got to be a heck of a defensive team. I watched about 10, 12 minutes
live. We've done a lot of scouting on them. It's always been one of the best
positioned defenses in the country, you know, so we have to have great ball
movement.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Congratulations.  
  
COACH DAVIS: Thanks, guys. Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Jordan Caroline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32865)

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Cameron Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30556)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Iowa State - 84, Nevada 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Nevada Head Coach Eric Musselman. Nevada student-
athletes Cameron Oliver and Jordan Caroline will be with us as well. Oliver
had 22 points, 4 blocks, Caroline with 20 points, 8 rebounds. Again, Coach
will make an opening statement and then questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach, please.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: You know, we lost to a team that's really good and better
team than us tonight. I think they're the 6th most experienced team in the
country. And I thought in the first half that their experience really showed.
We start three sophomores and -- you know, but I thought the second half -- I
couldn't be prouder with the effort and the energy that they played with in
the second half.  
  
And like I said, you have to give a lot of credit or all the credit to Iowa
State. Their seniors played really, really well. I thought that was the
difference in the ballgame right now is -- was just their veterans and they
stayed composed and we really struggled to score in the first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cam, where does this defense of Iowa State put up on you guys rank as
far as the teams you've played against this year?  
CAMERON OLIVER: The defense is pretty good. You know, they held us to certain
percentages. We executed ourselves, wasn't finishing at the rim. The ball
wasn't really going in the basket for us the first half. The second half we
tried to turn it around, and we can't really play catchup ball with a team
like that.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys had a lot of close looks. Was it their length or
nerves or what was the cause of missing a lot of shots around the basket?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I would say just the nerves, really. I mean, those are shots
you make anytime. Just nerves.  
  
Q. Cam, you guys made so many great comebacks and cut it to 4 a couple
times in the second half. What was the key of not being able to get over the
top? Whenever you guys got close, they would hit a key basket.  
CAMERON OLIVER: Yeah. We couldn't get over the hump this time. You know, we
had small things, you know, small things with turnovers, and they execute off
our turnovers, then the foul calls that happened, unfortunately. But, tried
our best to fight back and played as hard as we possibly could. We couldn't
get over the hump.  
  
Q. Jordan, they shot a pretty high percentage. Obviously a very good
offensive team that can spread it out. What was the biggest difficulty in
trying to stop them offensively?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: I guess just them having capable shooters. Them spacing the
floor kind of got us a little out of whack, I guess you could say.  
  
Q. For both you guys, this is an historic season in Nevada history. Not
the end you guys wanted. What did this season mean to you and what is the
feeling now that it's over?  
CAMERON OLIVER: It hurts the way we just ended it, you know, but I couldn't be
more proud of these guys, man. We definitely had an historical season. We
worked hard over the summer, you know, through the non-conference, conference,
post-season, whatever, you know, and tried our best to do everything you
possibly can. The one thing I can say about these guys, we worked hard, we
worked hard. Didn't give up. Fought through injuries, fatigue. Anything you
could possibly name, we fought through it. So --  
  
Q. Same for you, Jordan.  
JORDAN CAROLINE: Like he said, it hurts, you know, but I love these guys. We
put a lot of work in the season and we got to where we wanted to get.
Obviously we didn't get result, but, you know, it was a great season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Guys, thank you.
Coach's questions now.  
  
Q. Eric, you said you guys struggled to score points. Marshall kind of
got off to a slow start. What were they doing defensively to him?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I thought that, you know, Naz Long did a great job on him,
face-guarded him. He's long, he's quick. What are you going to say? The guy
did a heck of a job on him making every catch difficult, making every shot
difficult. But at the end of the day, we scored 46 points in the second half
and there was a lot of really good things we did.  
  
I mean, coming into the game they do such a great job of taking care of the
basketball, and we felt like if we could cause some turnovers and we could
take care of the ball a little bit better -- we had 7 turnovers to their 13,
that hardly ever happens, and scoring 46 points against them in the second
half, I just thought we had a real struggle scoring in the first half. That
was really the difference in the game. We made enough runs in the second half,
but I mean, they're a better team than us tonight, plain and simple. And our
bench, I thought both guys that came off the bench for them, Bowie and
Jackson, were phenomenal.  
  
And like I said, there was a lot of good things. One area we're probably the
most disappointed in is the rebounding because we felt that that was an area
that we needed to succeed in tonight. And then to lose the battle of the
boards by 10 is, you know -- that's the biggest difference in the game. They
had a couple long rebounds. But they averaged ten 3s a game. We held them to
8.  
  
Again, they don't turn the ball over. We turned them over a lot compared to
what they normally do and, you know, unfortunately, we didn't rebound like we
thought we were capable of.  
  
Q. You guys have been able to get by despite limited depth throughout
the season. They almost had as many guys in double figures as you played. How
big of a difference was that they were able to roll in guys who would chip in
throughout?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Yeah. Like I said, I thought two guys in particular were
phenomenal and we kind of knew that. We talked about Jackson really being a
starter and Bowie started for them earlier in the year until they moved Solo
Young in there. They're experienced and, you know, I thought that the
difference was their experience. I think this season is really going to help
our young guys next year. I thought Josh Hall played really, really well in
the second half. Lindsey Drew did a great job for us. And look, you have to
give all the credit to Iowa State. They were -- they're a great basketball
team. The conference that they play in, they're as hot as any team in the
country. When you play against a team that's got the seniors that they do,
that has the experience that they have, you know, it's what happens.  
  
Q. You just talk about the season in general, what you guys
accomplished, haven't been to the tournament in like ten years and getting
there and what it means for the future also.  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Yeah. I mean, I think that we're proud of what we did. We're
all hurting. That locker room, we had a lot of guys crying. You know, guys are
hurting. They didn't want the season to end, the coaching staff didn't want
the season to end. But again, you know, you got to give credit to a better
team. And I think the future of the program is in great shape when you think
about all the young guys that we have and their development and growth and,
you know, Jordan Caroline really stood up tonight, and Josh, like I mentioned,
and Lindsey. Those guys are all young guys that gain valuable experience. And,
you know when you haven't been in this type of situation, you know, experience
really matters.  
  
Q. The first half you were able to get a lot of shots around the rim.
Was it nerves, adjusting to their length that they didn't fall?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: No. They had three blocked shots. I mean, I didn't think --
it's not like they have unbelievable size inside. We missed some shots we
didn't finish through contact. I thought there was -- it was a physical game
around the rim on both sides, and we were unable to finish through contact.
And, you know, might have been nerves as well. I think both student-athletes
mentioned nerves or Jordan did and, you know, I thought in the second half we
settled down a little bit, came out of our locker room with a little bit more
composure and just too big a gap playing against a team that's got that much
offense.  
  
Q. You guys do make 3s, runs, get it to 4 twice and 5 once. Is that just
their experience in veteranness (sic) to be able to come up with a big shot to
push the lead back up to 8 or 10?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: We played toe-to-toe with them in the second half, and we got
down too much in the first half. And that's the difference in the game. I
mean, we're down 13 at half and played really good the last 20 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, do you expect Cam back next year?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Cam and I haven't sat down and talked. The only thing that
we've worried about is how does Nevada compete and play against Iowa State.
And you know, we've been pretty single-minded every game, every night, and
there's no reason to talk about it up to this point because we had games to
play and, you know, we're here to support Cam in whatever decision he makes.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had a special season, special run. What's the
feeling now that it's over? This group of guys won't be back together again.  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Yeah. That's college basketball. Guys graduate and -- I mean,
right now none of us are feeling really real good. I think in three, four days
we'll look back and, you know, be really proud about what we've done. It was a
goal to make it in the tournament and we'll reassess our goals, give them a
couple weeks off and get back to work like we always do and, you know, it
hurts tonight. There's no doubt, but again, I told the team that our coaching
staff loves them and hang your heads high because they conducted themselves
the right way, and I don't think anybody will say that we didn't play with
effort, especially in the second half. So we played as hard as we could play.  
  
Q. You mentioned experience a couple of times. Obviously you can't get
NCAA experience until you've played in a game. What do you want them to learn
from this and take into the off-season?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I think there's so much to learn. You're playing on the
biggest stage of college basketball. So I think all our young guys are going
to learn a lot, just like I'm sure Iowa State's guys have learned year after
year after year they've been in it.  
  
Great learning experience. You know, hopefully everybody in the Mountain West
thinks we represented the conference well by playing as hard as we possibly
could. And again, it's a tough loss, but all you can ask your student-athletes
is to play hard and really care and that locker room really cares.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.

MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [John Becker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23477)

### [Anthony Lamb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33082)

### [Trae Bell-Haynes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33083)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
Purdue - 80, Vermont - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Vermont Head Coach John Becker and Vermont student-athletes
Trae Bell-Haynes and Anthony Lamb. We'll ask Coach to make an opening
statement, and then we'll open up for questions for the student-athletes.
Coach.  
  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. We're obviously disappointed with the loss tonight, but I
couldn't be more proud of this team, the way they battled tonight, you know,
and just gave everything they had against a really good Purdue team and feel
awful for Kurt Steidl, our senior, one of our senior leaders who is our best
two-way player and a really important piece to our team.  
  
Got injured and, you know, couldn't play the whole game for us, and that was
-- that was -- you know, I felt bad for him and it affected what we did in the
second half. We had to play some lineups we hadn't played all year, but I got
to give our guys credit, you know, they kept battling and making plays and,
you know, got to give credit to Purdue. It's a really good team that made --
they made big shots when they needed to in the second half, late into the
second half, you know. I thought, you know, I thought Vincent Edwards really
played well.  
  
Obviously, Swanigan, you know, he's going to give you the numbers he gave
again tonight. But Edwards played really well and then their shooters made
shots when they needed to. But, you know, we've had a great season, magical
season. It hurts to have it come to an end. But, you know, I'm a proud coach
up here with the way our guys have played all year and how they competed
tonight in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Trae, what did you guys do so well against Purdue in the first half
to really lead for almost the majority of it?  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: I think we just followed the game plan. I mean, I think we
did in the first half, especially we did a really good job on Swanigan and
Haas, and I don't think Edwards really got going, going in the first half, and
I think we were kind of able to stifle them a little bit. And then the
difference in the second half, I think right off the bat, I think Edwards was
really aggressive, got to his right hand and was making plays. And I think not
having Kurt in the second half to guard him, we had to put slower guys on him
at certain times and really helped him out.  
  
Q. Anthony, how challenging was it to matchup with Swanigan down low and
just the first presence of the bigs that Purdue had?  
ANTHONY LAMB: I really thought the biggest challenge was just like having to
rotate and like ball screens. I felt like I had a lot of help from the guards
coming down in. So it wasn't really that big of a problem. It was more like on
ball screens having to stay with the ball and getting back to him. That was
really the biggest. Everything else was really just offensively, really.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Trae and Anthony, thank
you. Questions for Head Coach John Becker, please.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you touched on how Kurt Steidl's big loss in that
second half. What were some of the adjustments you were trying to do with his
absence?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. So we tried to play a big lineup and move Payton Henson at
the 3 and we came in, with Dre who didn't play in the first half and tried to
play some zone to give them a different look and try to shorten the game a
little bit, and that worked fairly well. And then, you know, we just -- you
know, brought Darren in and played him with Lamb and Payton, moved Payton to
the 3 and played a little bit of zone. But offensively it became challenging
because they weren't guarding Dre and they were putting Haas and Swanigan on
Dre and just sitting them at the front of the rim.  
  
So it just became very difficult to score in the paint, and, you know, Dre's
kind of counter to people not guarding him, he slashes, cuts really hard, and
gets a lot of finishes at the rim. And when he did that, he was cutting into a
7-footer, waiting for him at the rim. Kind of took his game away completely,
and it was like, you know, they had one extra guy on defense and just became
really difficult to score.  
  
Q. John, I'm sorry if you talked about this, with Kurt, what can you
tell us about his injury? It looked like they were working on his knee. Can
you tell us anything specific?  
COACH BECKER: He jumped up and landed to contest a shot by Mathias. He landed
awkwardly. He thought it felt like his knee kind of moved to the left and to
the right, just kind of moved too much, and he knew he was hurt right away.
And, you know, they were looking at him obviously at halftime, and I think
he's with the medical people right now, heading to the hospital to get further
evaluated, you know.  
  
But, you know, it's just devastating, you know, a kid like Kurt that means so
much to this program, that works so hard and just made all the sacrifices he's
made in his career, to get with all -- with the hopes of getting to this
tournament and then gets here and has that injury happen to him just --
regardless of what it did and didn't do to us as a team and game plan and how
it made it more difficult, as a person, I feel terrible for Kurt because I
know how much this meant to him or how important this was to him.  
  
So, you know, he's devastated, you know, and for that I hurt for him.  
  
Q. With all the responsibility that Anthony had tonight on the defensive
end of the floor, what did you think of the way he imprinted himself
offensively and what he was able to do from a scoring standpoint?  
COACH BECKER: The kid is unbelievable. You know, he played great on both ends
of the court, you know. He's just -- you know, he's a really good player, and
the bigger the game, the better he plays, and played 31 minutes, which is way
more than he usually plays. He battled guys that were significantly bigger
than him, obviously and made three of six 3s, made 8 of 12 shots, and just
battled the whole game. And just, you know, I couldn't be more impressed with
him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. Sorry if this was asked already, but can you put in perspective what
this season has meant to your program?  
COACH BECKER: You know, I think we'll start to appreciate it more, you know,
once the sting of this loss goes away. But to win 29 games, to not have lost
since December 21st, to go 19-0 in our conference, you know, we've done things
that no other team at Vermont has done, that no other team in the America East
has done. You know, I think it's -- it can't ever get better than this season
as far as in-conference goes.  
  
You know, the way our guys have done it, you know, and the energy that is in
Burlington and around this program and what these kids have done, you know,
it's -- it's really exciting. And as we move out into recruiting and things
like that, it's only going to help us down the road.  
  
But, you know, this loss will sting for a little while, but we've -- a lot of
that no one will ever be able to take away from us. I'm really proud.  
  
Q. When Matt was up here a few minutes ago, he said he thought you guys
were one of the best teams he played all year, regardless of conference. Given
the league that you play in, that there's not a lot of national exposure, what
did you think about your team relative to other conferences, and did you learn
anything about your guys tonight, even as well as you know them just because
of the step-up in competition?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. I mean, I appreciate Coach Painter saying that and -- but
we are one of the best teams in the country. We played Butler, that was our
last loss, lost by 12 points. I did a bad job coaching that game. We could
have won that game. A 12-point game. It was closer than that. I watched that
film. I wished I had done some things differently because we played with, you
know, the 13th -- or I don't know what they were at that time, but one -- top
20 team in the country on their court sold out toe-to-toe. And I knew at that
point we were really good, and then we went on this -- to win 19 games in
conference. To win 21 games in row, I don't care what conference you're in,
it's almost impossible to do, to go 19-0 in a league where you play everyone
twice and got to play three teams three times and you have to win the
conference tournament to get to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
The amount of pressure these kids have been under for the last couple of
months and the way that -- we've lost to Houston by 1 point in November in a
game we had won, you know, again, we didn't win so -- but they're in the NIT,
they're a bubble team. We played at South Carolina, we played at Providence.
We played -- they ended up being double-digit games. We're one of the best
teams in the country. I was not surprised how we played tonight.  
  
You know, matchup-wise, you know, just with two guys that big, you know, it's
just -- it's hard, you know, different matchup might be different outcome for
us. That's what the tournament is for lower seeds, it's about matchups. And I
said this is a good matchup for us, not a great matchup for us. We got a great
matchup, you know, I wouldn't put anything past this team. And yeah, we're a
good team this year, really good team. I appreciate Coach Painter pointing
that out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH BECKER: Thanks everyone.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Steve Prohn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33079)

### [Nazareth Mitrou-Long](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32997)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Iowa State student-athletes, Monte Morris and Naz Long.
Questions, please.  
  
Q. Monte, lot of guys from Milwaukee on this team, but you're a Flint
guy, great basketball lineage here. Obviously, the nation is looking for you
to throw this team on your back. Can you just talk about your mindset going
into this, knowing you're on that 5 line and you got a very good 12 team
coming at you tomorrow night?  
MONTE MORRIS: The 5/12 line is always a line where they say that's where the
upsets happen. Totally we got to stay focused. We know we're in Milwaukee, but
the guys are locked in that's from here and just ready to play good for their
homecoming. We also got to play good to help them.  
  
As putting the team on my back, it's not about that. It's about going out and
playing the right way. I got a great group of seniors with me who also playing
for something. It's not just me. It's a collective group effort. It just
starts my energy and it twinkles down to Naz, Matt, Deante, how we approach
the game. If we come locked in, we should be fine.  
  
Q. Naz, I'll ask you just your mood and the mood of the team as you
approach this matchup?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: We're excited. We're very excited. It's a blessing to be
here. You know, not many people can say that they've been at a tournament
every year they've been at a school. We both can. So, you know, we're excited,
man. We have a great opponent tomorrow that we got a lot of respect for. But
we're playing the best basketball we're playing all year. We've looking
forward to getting it going in the Big Dance.  
  
Q. If each of you can address this, just playing in the tough conference
that you do, how do you think that has prepared you for what you're going to
face in this tournament? Naz first, please.  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: I definitely think that's a big factor, if not the
biggest. Our preparation all year as far as playing against the best in the
country is definitely what gets us prepared to play against other teams from
different conferences that are ready to go head-to-head and do whatever it
takes to become a national champion.  
  
Playing in the Big 12 is definitely to our benefit. We play everybody twice.
We get definitely a lot of different scouting reports thrown at us being the
focal points. We're ready to go, man. We've seen the best, played against the
best, and now we're ready to do the same thing here in The Dance.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: Getting the different styles every night from the Big 12 is
great for us and playing different types of players on different teams, they
can bring you speed one night, just versatility, and just a balanced type of
guy you might guard one night. When we play different teams in a tournament
from different conferences, it definitely give us the edge because it's not a
cakewalk in the Big 12. Not one game we played, you know, just a blowout or
boring game. Every game was electrifying and we had to bring it.  
  
Now we switch gears and play different teams in conference -- in a different
conference. It's not going to be easier, but we've seen the best of the best.
We've got to come focused and come with a good game plan.  
  
Q. Both of you, if you could both talk about what are your concerns with
a team like Nevada?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: You know, lot of people come into the tournament with a
mindset that they're going to win just because they're a higher seed. We've
been in that situation in the past. But definitely been through our
experiences and so forth. Playing against Nevada is something that we're not
taking lightly by any means. We've watched a lot of film on them as if we were
playing them in conference.  
  
We know what we're capable of. They didn't win their conference or have the
record they had by fluke or accident. They have a great coaching staff. So,
you know just keeping a even-keel mindset, approaching them as if they're the
best team we've ever played and just understand that they're capable and
they're here for a reason.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: Yeah. Just not overlooking Nevada. In our previous year,
sophomore year, his junior year, we kind of looked over UAB and thought we
would just win because we were the higher seed as a 14 seed. But God does
things for a reason and just let's you know you got to keep the same mentality
no matter who you play at this level because everybody is good, nobody is here
by fluke.  
  
Knowing that, we gain knowledge, wisdom, and going to take that experience
with us through the whole tournament.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you have one of the best 3-point shooting teams
in the nation. Nevada is one of the best at defending the 3. What do you
notice about how they go about trying to slow down the opposition's 3-point
shooting and why they've succeeded in that department this year?  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: They have a lot of lanky guys, very determined, jumping
at 3-point threats that they've played throughout the year. So we got to
credit them to their urgency on running guys off the line.  
  
With that being said, you know, I think we have a good amount of 3-point
shooters. They're not only just 3-point shooters, we're versatile. So we can
make adjustments as much as they're going to have to make adjustments to the
bunch of threats we have. You've got to give them credit for the way they run
guys off the line and make them change their game plan.  
  
Q. Monte, a lot of people have gone up there and said you're the best
point guard in basketball history. Has your career exceeded thus far what you
thought were you going to do at Ohio State?  
MONTE MORRIS: I came first for education and secondly to try to play good
basketball and be remembered there and play with a great group of guys. And my
career this far has been amazing, you know. I honestly can't -- haven't been
able to keep up with what I've been doing.  
  
I'm just extremely blessed and just have a great opportunity in front of me to
play with these guys. I'm just happy right now, and I worry about my career
and things after my senior year. And I can look back with remembrance. Right
now I'm happy I'm in this moment and just soaking it all in.  
  
Q. Both you guys, you talked about playing lot of different styles of
play in the Big 12. When you look at this Nevada team on film, is there a team
they remind you of or maybe another team you guys played this season? For both
you guys.  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: I wouldn't really say that. They're just versatile. If
anything, you know, if we played against Iowa State, that's the team I would
say they remind me of. They're very similar to us as far as having guys that
can do different things, their 4-man shoots the ball really well. They have
extremely talented guards. And, you know, that's kind of how we feel about
ourselves. That's the team that I'd say is very similar to.  
  
That's why it's going to be an interesting matchup tomorrow night. And the
team that executes and plays the hardest is the team that's going to end up
winning.  
  
Q. If you both could answer this. I think it's human nature, you would
agree, to go ahead and look at brackets and maybe fill them out yourself and
have a little fun with that. You're going to have 80 percent of the fan base
here. You're favored. I guess the idea would be if you don't get to Kansas
City, a place obviously, where you guys have done really well, it would be a
disappointment.  
Does that give you added pressure? I know you say you take it a game at a
time. At the same time, the expectations are that you get back to Kansas City
and play potentially Kansas. Can you talk about how you may be block that out,
or have you kind of processed that in your mind?  
  
MONTE MORRIS: Like at the Big 12 Tournament, we knew it was three games total
to win the championships and we know now you got to win two to get back to
Kansas City. We're going to treat every possession one by one and just knock
down 20 minutes by 20 minutes, media by media, and grind it out.  
  
Everyone knows they say they don't look ahead, but you know what's ahead of
you, but you got to stay in the moment. And whichever team stays in the
moment, I feel will be successful. And not looking forward to Purdue or
Vermont, that's the route we have to take.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: Having, like you said you think 80 percent of the people
out there is going to be Cyclone Nation. Having them behind us is everything
to us, but that doesn't rely any pressure. Win or lose, they know we're going
out there to play every possession for them. You know, we're leaving it all
out on the floor. And we've been playing this game our whole lives. Everybody
in that Iowa State locker room has been underdogs their whole lives. I know
we're favored, but I don't remember the last game that the Nation really
believed we're going to win those games. That goes back to playing in the
field house.  
  
So we're just looking to the guys to our left and right and the people that
really support us. And we're going to go out there and give everything for
them. There's no will real pressure, man. We've played basketball every single
day. Just going to go out there and give it our all and try to get a W.  
  
Q. For both you guys again. Because you're saying that Nevada looks like
a team very similar to your own, where do you see the ways in which you guys
need to play well in order to win this game? Both you guys, if you don't
mind.  
MONTE MORRIS: I think just standing gaps, being gap conscious, not giving up a
lot of inside paint points and contesting shots. Marshall, he could shoot the
ball really well. And Caroline can shoot it good and Oliver. So, we just got
to contest, you know, contest, contest, and make the shots. They're going to
give up some and make a few. You got to make it tough and make sure it's not
rhythm shots.  
  
NAZARETH MITROU-LONG: Just like he said, you know, just make it tough, make
sure they're not in rhythm. And again, if we're similar as we think that we
are, the team that executes the game plan the best is the team that's going to
come out with a W. That's just all we got to do, man, play the basketball that
we've been playing, that's Iowa State basketball and it's the best we've been
playing all year. Hopefully, the momentum continues into The Dance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Guys, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
Steve Prohm is with us. Questions, please.  
  
Q. I know this is your second year at Iowa State, but there's a long
history of players coming out of Milwaukee and having success at the school
both current and in the past. How much has that meant to the program and how
important are those guys this year to your guys' success?  
COACH PROHM: I think it's huge. Obviously, this program has had a lot of
success here. We were just talking about Diante Garrett. A minute ago I was
talking to Randy Peterson out there. TJ Otzelberger, the Head Coach at South
Dakota State. He's from here and long-time assistant here. We've got three
guys, Donovan Jackson, Darrell Bowie, Deonte Burton who have had big, big
success. Deonte and Darrell being seniors. Donovan a junior. And so the
pipeline has been very good and so hopefully we continue that.  
  
We actually signed a kid, Terrence Lewis, from this city this year. And so
it's something we can hopefully continue. The city has been very good for us
recruiting-wise. Hopefully, it's very good for us the next couple days
playing-wise as well. It's great to be in a location where their families can
come and our fans can come.  
  
Q. Coach, that being said, just talked to both Naz and Monte, and that
is, your fan base is amazing. The ride up here, they're here already, probably
75 percent of the people. The Milwaukee kids, everyone admits they're looking
ahead, they're human beings, college kids. How do you keep them in the moment
when there's a history of UAB, and you see across the way, Middle Tennessee
State picking off Michigan? How do you do that as a coach to get them to
respond to that?  
COACH PROHM: The biggest word I use a ton with them is humility. You stay
humble. I've been on the other side coming from a Mid-Major for a long time as
an assistant and the Head Coach. We've beaten teams in the past and advanced
in the post-season in the tournament. I think humility. You keep them humble.
I don't talk about that -- one time I talked about it last week and that's it.
It's not something you keep beating them over the head with. They understand.  
  
I've got great experience with seniors that understand what it takes to win
this time of year. I think the focus of this team is a lot different. I think
that they're totally tuned in to what we need to do and then we got to go
play. I heard Monte -- I like to always go back and listen to hear what our
guys are saying. The one thing he says, you stay in the moment and focus on
the moment. You stay humble, you stay focused, and that's all we're talking
about is Nevada. They're very good. We've got a ton of respect for them. They
got a couple -- obviously they got several high major players on that team and
a great coach, lot of NBA pedigrees there. If they didn't have all that, they
wouldn't be 28-6.  
  
We'll be ready to go, but obviously being in Milwaukee helps. This fan base,
I've said it since I got here, there's probably not -- you can't probably name
five, ten that are legitimately better when you talk about the way they
travel, the way they come in. Every single night, whether we're playing
Citadel, St. Mary's, Kansas, West Virginia, you're going to get 14,400 every
night, and that's unheard of really when you really look around and put on the
TV every night.  
  
Q. When you look at film of them, they hold their opposing team to like
30 percent shooting from 3. Obviously 3-pointers are a big part of your game.
What do you see on film? Why are they so successful in defending the 3 and how
do you work against that tomorrow?  
COACH PROHM: Their numbers are good defensively. Their numbers are good
offensively. That's why they're 28-6. Very good offensive players. I think Dre
really helps them defensively, very, very active, very long deflections. And I
think their team prides themselves on that getting deflections, being in gaps,
you know, trying to get their hands on balls, running at the guards sometimes
to make -- you have to make plays.  
  
So the biggest thing with the way we play is, you know, we're fortunate we've
got guys who can make shots. We want to spread you out. Spread you out, make
the extra pass. Not take quick bad shots. I think tomorrow's slot selection is
going to be key. You got a lot of people who can make shots on the floor. Are
you taking good shots or bad shots? Shot selection will be key. They're very
good. They're a good team and we're looking forward to the challenge tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned on your teleconference Cam Oliver is kind of the
difference between two teams. What are his strengths, what do you guys need to
do against them and the special abilities he brings to the court?  
COACH PROHM: They were asking me the other day what are the similarities. We
are very similar, I think, in the way we play. Both coaches give the teams a
lot of freedom. You got guys who can make shots. Got two successful teams. But
we have versatile 4 men, got good play. Our 5 men and their 5 man in Oliver is
a stretch 5. The ball screen with Oliver is going to be a key to the game
tomorrow and how to utilize him and him going inside out.  
  
So, we've got to do a great job on ball screens. We have to have great ball
pressure on him when he catches on the perimeter and make sure you contest
every shot and when he doesn't shoot. You got to do a good job of closing out
under control so he doesn't drive by you. We got to be able to get help when
you need it. You can't overhelp because you got Caroline going to the glass
every time. He's the toughness and glue to their team. Oliver is a tough
matchup. He's one of the couple major keys.  
  
Q. Obviously the rebounding number is favorable for them. Coach
Musselman said he didn't put much stock into it because of the conference you
play in them. How have you felt about your rebounding ability this season?  
COACH PROHM: Somehow we've been able to win games. We've been out rebounding
18, 19. The one Naz has done, they're plus 14 on the glass. That's been a
point of emphasis with our guys the last couple of days. When we got Solomon
into the lineup whenever it was after the Texas game, I think we became a
better rebounding team right away. He provides us a presence up there, whether
it's blocking shots, boxing out, being physical, a physicality that he
provides up-front. And so shot goes up, I think he helps us rebounding-wise.  
  
The biggest step the other night against West Virginia, I think we were right,
you know, even or minus 2 free throws. We outrebounded West Virginia that was
huge for us. We've done a better job over the last couple weeks rebounding
because we had some stretches during the year. Now we give up 18, 19, 20
offensive rebounds, get outrebounded. I think at home against Baylor we got
outrebounded by 18 to 20 but still won. We've got an elite point guard and our
assist to turnover ratio is pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: What are the challenges of playing in the last game of the day
and do you want your kids watching other games or how do you handle it?  
  
COACH PROHM: Yeah. The 9:00 start is the last one, so it makes it for a long
day. I think we played the first game the other day in the tournament, that
first to start the tournament in the Big 12. You know, we get up, eat
breakfast, go shoot around. Come over here and shoot because we have a long
day, which we normally we wouldn't do. Then we'll go walk-thru and then I let
the guys watch games, enjoy the tournament. Get the feel. Once you walk over
here, you got Purdue and Vermont going on and the energy going, you got the
crowd, it doesn't matter if it's 9:00, 2:00, 1:00 in the morning. We'll be
ready to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MILWAUKEE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MILWAUKEE)

  

## March 15, 2017

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Nate Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28499)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Minnesota student-athletes, Nate Mason and Jordan
Murphy. Questions.  
  
Q. Nate, just wanted to ask you, going into the tournament, normally it
would be a team like Middle Tennessee that people would be talking about
looking over. Do you guys feel looked over with all the Blue Raiders talk this
week nationally?  
NATE MASON: We're really not paying no attention to it. We know Middle
Tennessee is a great team. We got to be prepared to play.  
  
Q. Both you guys, who do Middle Tennessee remind you of that you played
this season?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I don't think they're like any team we've played this season,
to be honest. They have a unique team and unique defense. They're kind of in a
category of their own, kind of to say it.  
  
NATE MASON: Going off what Murph said, they got great players. They play a
weird defense. We got to be prepared to attack it on our terms.  
  
Q. Nate, this team obviously pulled off a huge upset a year ago. BIG TEN
style of play against their style of play. What have you seen on film that
might concern you?  
NATE MASON: They're a great offensive rebounding team. We're a great defensive
rebounding team. We got to come out and force our will and impose toughness
right from the get-go.  
  
Q. When you guys were going through that rough stretch during the middle
of the season, what did you do differently to turn it around, and can you kind
of describe what it was like in that locker room then compared to now?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think we had to look back mentality-wise. We have to get
tougher and better and get back in practice and work even harder than we were
to get back to what we were doing during the regular season. During that five
game skid, between then and now, I think the locker room is a lot more
optimistic. Guys have a lot of energy, really happy, too. I mean, I think
we're -- we have a good confidence level right now and trying to keep that
going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Yes.  
  
Q. Just one more quick. Nate, your fan base, obviously you can drive
here, travel, can turn this building in a quasi home court. Yet Middle
Tennessee fits that description of a team that if they've got a BIG TEN team
like you guys down, the building can turn.  
Do you think about that at all, about how this is kind of a double-edged
sword, that this building would be a very good venue yet can turn on you if
you're caught in the crossfire of an upset?  
  
NATE MASON: For sure. We're definitely encouraging all our fans to come out.
We sold out of all our tickets. It should be a pretty fun place to play.
Hopefully all our fans made the drive down. Without them we wouldn't be what
we are now. They play a big part.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Please welcome Minnesota Head coach, Richard Pitino. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, just to start, we were talking with Kermit earlier, he told a
story about going to the Kentucky Derby with your dad. Were you there at all
for that?  
COACH PITINO: I was not. Sorry.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on your season. Kermit said earlier to me that
you are loving all of the attention that Middle Tennessee is getting right
now. Are you, in fact, loving it?  
COACH PITINO: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, it's funny, I don't need to be
told to respect Middle Tennessee, probably because I was in their league and I
know how good of a coach he is and I know how hard his players play and how
good of a job he does recruiting and getting his players better.  
  
I didn't need that, you know, but with your players, you never know. But I
will say this, I don't think too many teams overlook guys in the NCAA
Tournament, you know, so, we're excited about being the underdog, been the
underdog all year. So, it will be another great opportunity.  
  
But I think Kermit is a terrific coach. I kind of always, whenever people talk
about coaches that people may not talk about, he's the first one on my list
every single time. So I got a bunch of respect for him and their team.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a great year.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.  
  
Q. Is this another typical matchup where the 12/5 just truly does not
matter? I don't want to bring up Vegas point spreads. Do you keep your kids
away from that 12/5 garbage?  
COACH PITINO: We definitely don't talk point spreads with them (laughter).
Yeah. 12/5 seeds, I don't think any of it really matters, you know. Maybe the
1 seed may have a moderately easy game. I think Middle Tennessee might be
ranked. So, our guys know how good they are. They've got some players that
were on last year's team who not only beat Michigan State but won a lot of
games.  
  
You know, so, I've got a bunch of respect for them. I think our players, when
they watch the film, know it's a terrific team. You know, they're not in my
opinion a Mid-Major team. They're a high level team. So, we know we got to
play our best game to beat them. We're excited about that challenge.  
  
Q. I know when you got there, Wisconsin had already built sort of a
pipeline into Minnesota for some of the talent and still gets a few guys out
of there.  
What do you think this year can be for you in terms of that recruiting
Minnesota, and also how hard has that been to build a wall around the state?  
  
COACH PITINO: Our state is unique because obviously we're the only Division I
school in the state for basketball. We get a lot of people from other states
who work there because Twin Cities has a lot of great jobs. So, other schools
have been able to come in and recruit the state.  
  
You know, when it comes to us and recruiting the state, we've gotten the guys
for the most part that we've wanted. We haven't gotten everybody, but you're
not always going to need everybody. You only get a certain number of
scholarships. The guys that we've targeted since we've been here, we've been
pretty successful.  
  
Jarvis Johnson was a guy who hasn't played for us, but he was a very good
recruit for us. Amir Coffey was another guy that we really locked in on and
wanted.  
  
We've done a good job recruiting the state, but when you're successful --
there's two things, success and commitment are what are going to help you with
in-state recruits. Now that we're committing to the facilities part of it,
that's going to really help. And then obviously our team being successful,
Amir being successful, Reggie Lynch being successful. Guys that are from the
state that are playing well, that also really helps in recruiting.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH PITINO: Mike likes to shout out. It's okay. Tonight we will stay in the
hotel. No different routine than anything else. We will watch film after
dinner, go over the scouting report, and then go to bed. So, nothing abnormal
than any other game.  
  
Q. What was it like when you guys went through the slump in the middle
of the season and how -- what was it like for you as a coach and what did you
tell your players or how did you get them back on track?  
COACH PITINO: Well, losing five games in a row after last year, that was
nothing. I could handle that one. We went two months without a win last year.  
  
I think last year definitely equipped us for this year, you know, because we
had lost a bunch of close games last year. And I think with Nate Mason,
Dupree, McBrayer, Jordan Murphy, they were on the court for a lot of those
games last year. So as hard as last year was, it helped us. And when it came
down to that losing streak, there was really only one game where I thought we
didn't play well and that was at Michigan State. The rest of them we had
opportunities to win.  
  
So, I think last year helped everybody stay pretty composed and poised and
believing that we could go on a run. You know, fortunately we went on a big
run. I'm not sure I anticipated an 8-game winning streak. I did think we would
break through. The guys were very, very mature about it and level-headed about
it.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you would speak sort of more broad-brush
strokes of the Big-Ten, what it meant this year, couple of Cinderella stories
with Michigan and Northwestern, some of your success, how that feels as a
member of the BIG TEN Conference.  
COACH PITINO: There's been a lot of talk that our conference is down. And I
think a lot of that has to do with we may not have a lot of teams in the Top
Five or Top Ten. But there's no easy outs. I wouldn't want to play a Wisconsin
who is an 8 seed. I wouldn't want the play a Maryland or Michigan who is a 7
or Michigan State. Those are all tough outs. You know, to go along with us,
Purdue is obviously terrific, Northwestern is terrific.  
  
Our conference is full of great coaches, really smart players who know the
game, don't beat themselves, and talented players.  
  
So, I think we've -- if we're not in the best conference, we're one of the
best. I think it shows when you get seven teams in the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, talked to Nate and Jordan and we brought up the scenario where
you have a nice fan following. This building will turn on a dime if Middle
Tennessee starts to beat you and take over a BIG TEN team.  
You reference this as just being any other game. You know that as well as
anybody, if this building turns, how are you prepared to have your kids handle
that?  
  
COACH PITINO: Well, I expect a pretty good Gopher crowd. Again, from
everything that we've heard and read, I mean, I think everybody is expecting
Middle to win. And I think Middle is really good. And I've -- again, I've
known Kermit for a long time. He's one of the best coaches in the country.  
  
So, I don't look at it like that. I don't think our team looks at it like
that. We know it's going to be a hard-fought game. And if we do win, we beat a
really, really good team.  
  
Q. Coach, how impressed are you with Akeem Springs and how he's handled
the injury? He's smiling, laughing. You can tell he still feels he has a
pretty big role on this team.  
COACH PITINO: Very impressed. He got hurt, it was kind of weird because he got
hurt and then a media timeout happened right away. I didn't really notice it
because we went right into the timeout.  
  
Then, all of a sudden, I say where is Akeem? He's back with Ben Felz, our
trainer. He comes back out and is on crutches. He knows he's done for the rest
of the season. And I said, "Are you all right?" He looked at me and said, "I'm
fine Coach, let's go win this game." Then after the game, we won, beat
Michigan State, he was, "Let's go get a ring, don't worry about me."  
  
The way that he handled that, I think is one of the reasons why everybody has
been kind of able to move on in the right way and we battled obviously versus
Michigan. He's been really, really mature about it. His family has been great
about it. It's no surprise the way he's handled it.  
  
Q. Richard, this is your first time to the tournament as a Head Coach.
What lessons did you take from your dad and Billy that's going to help you
your first time as a Head Coach here?  
COACH PITINO: You know, I think more than anything, I mean, appreciate it, you
know, embrace it. It's an awesome opportunity, but don't make it bigger than
it really needs to be. The game is really what matters. Obviously, it's my job
to prepare these guys to the best of their ability to go play their best game,
you know, so, every tournament I've been around my dad, Billy, they get looser
as the tournament gets closer, you know.  
  
So for me, it's probably just making sure my players know that I'm confident
in the game plan, excited about the opportunity, making sure they're loose but
also understand they've got to execute, you know, and play freely and just
don't be a whole lot different than we've been.  
  
When you play in the BIG TEN, you're playing -- it's different in a
tournament, but you're obviously playing in a high stake game. I think we'll
be prepared for that moment.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been a team of runs at times this year. Is there an
element of your game that's particularly good that keys those?  
COACH PITINO: I would hope it's our defense. I think we got a pretty good
defense, pretty solid defense at times, you know, so, we talk a lot about
defense and rebounding. In our league if you don't do that, you got no shot.
You know, so if we do that, we're able to get out on the break, I think we can
be effective. So, it all stems around our defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck, Tom.  
  
COACH PITINO: Thank you. Thanks.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Purdue student-athletes, Caleb Swanigan and
Dakota Mathias. Questions, please.  
  
Q. For both players, can you guys just break down Vermont a little bit.
What are the biggest matchup issues you feel like you have to deal with
tomorrow?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: They're hot right now and playing good basketball. We got to
be ready for everything.  
  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: I agree. 1 through 5, they can all shoot pretty well. They're
very mobile. I think keeping the ball in front of us and making it tough on
them in the perimeter is going to be the biggest key.  
  
Q. They have a couple guys in the front court who can step out and shoot
a little bit. What sort of matchup concern is that?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: I think lately we've been dealing with that a lot playing
Vermont's team. We've been working on it a lot. It's a problem. At the same
time, we have to flip it on them and make them hurt us in our size down low.  
  
Q. We're finally here at the end of the season. Can you guys just talk
about how you feel. Are you ready? Excited? Just anxious?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Really just ready to get on the court. Been preparing to go
out last few days. Just ready to get on the court and play.  
  
Q. When you watch them in advance of this game, does the game last year
matter at all?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: No, I don't think so. We're a different team, different
personnel. They're a different team and they're fairly hot right now, won 21
in a row. I don't think it matters very much.  
  
Q. Dakota, your team gets a lot of attention for the front court. The
3-point shot has been a huge weapon. How big of a part of your offense is the
ability to shoot from outside?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: It's definitely a big part. Takes a lot of pressure off them.
The reason we get the looks is because Issac is getting down low, that's the
way we play, inside out. We're lucky they're -- they can pass the ball and see
out of double teams and move the ball.  
  
Q. Caleb, with as well as you played this season, what has it been like
to go through the entire year with people talking about you as a Player of the
Year candidate and all of the accolades that come with such a strong season?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Trying to stay focused on one game. That's how you kind of
tune it out, make sure you're focusing on the next game.  
  
Q. Dakota, you mentioned they're different from last year. How are they
different from last year?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Anytime you win 21 games in a row, some things are going to be
different the way you approach the game. Their offense, they can all shoot the
ball. Got a lot of veteran guys on the court. They're very versatile. Even
their 4 and 5, like you said, they can pick and pop and shoot it and drive it
to the hole. Just a different matchup than it was.  
  
Q. They don't have a lot of size, at least looking at the roster. What
do you see on film in terms of things maybe you can take advantage of around
the basket?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Same thing as any game. I'm going to do the same thing. Really
doesn't change how I approach the game.  
  
Q. I know Spike hasn't played a ton of minutes this year. Can you draw
on anything from him, given the fact he's made a deep run and played in a
National Championship game? Can you offer any advice?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Definitely a lot of advice. He's been through it. Down the
stretch here the last four or five games, he's really improved and he's been a
big part coming off the bench bringing energy and poise when we need it most.
Playing in these games before, it doesn't bother him. That calming factor is
going to be huge for us.  
  
Q. Caleb, I don't know if it's been asked or not, I was wondering if you
would comment on being named the BIG TEN Player of the Year and and what that
means to you?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: It means a lot. Really, just as I said before, I'm just
focused on Vermont, haven't spent much time thinking about any accolades. I'm
just focusing on when it's the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. For both you guys, after last year's loss to Little Rock in the NCAA
Tournament, do you feel like that's one of the games that's really motivated
you this year to get back to this point?  
DAKOTA MATHIAS: Absolutely. Anytime you lose a game like that that you
probably shouldn't and the way we lost it, it always motivates you. Any loss
is going to motivate you, but especially when you end your season like that,
it hurts a little more.  
  
CALEB SWANIGAN: It's something we've had in the back of our minds until now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Questions for Purdue Head Coach, Matt Painter, please.  
  
Q. Coach, can you guys learn anything or is there anything that you are
applying to prepare for this game from the game you guys played last year
against Vermont?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't think so. Anytime you play home games, especially
really early in the season teams are trying to figure themselves out, and
obviously them going on the road and having to travel and, you know, we didn't
have one of our main guys, AJ Hammons, in that game. But from watching them
play this year and watching that game, they've come a long way. You can also
watch them early in the year this year and say the same thing.  
  
Anytime you have to play those guaranteed games, there's a lot of things
stacked up against you. I've been on both ends of that one. I'm really
impressed with Vermont's balance. A lot of time when you play teams, you play
a team such as Vermont that's had success, they've won 21 straight games, and
say we got to stop these two guys and we stop Vermont, and you can't say that.  
  
They have very, very good balance. They have guys that come off the bench for
them that have started in the past. They have guys that come off the bench for
them that are 6th man of the year this year and 6th man of the year last year,
defensive player this year, you know, MVP of their league starting, All
Conference guys.  
  
People always say experience is the most important. It's not. The experience
of having success is the most important. They feel good about themselves and
they play with that kind of swagger. That wasn't really the way I looked at
them last year when I played them. It was early and tough, but that's
definitely the way they are now.  
  
Q. Matt, what has Spike Albrecht brought to your team both on and off
the court, and is he in a position now where maybe he gets a little more
playing time?  
COACH PAINTER: Spike has been great. He's definitely helped us off the court
with the experiences he's had at Michigan and just trying to get as healthy as
he can get. Obviously he had a setback and missed some games earlier in the
year. Whenever his number has been called, you know, he's been ready to play.
I think in the last two, three weeks he's played his best basketball for us.  
  
But it is difficult. You reference the minutes. It's hard to really, you know,
be productive when you play 10 to 15 minutes a game all the time because
you're getting in and out of the game and play short minutes. He's been as
productive as anybody we've had that's been in that type of position.  
  
Yeah, there's no doubt our staff, we have confidence. If he needs to play more
for us to be successful, you know, we'll do so.  
  
Q. Matt, Caleb was pretty modest about winning the award as BIG TEN
Player of the Year. Would you be kind enough to elaborate what he's meant to
your team and your program?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, anytime you have someone who gives you everything
everyday, he puts in a lot of extra time, he's had to really work, you know,
not just improving from a basketball sense but just his body, you know. He
spends a lot of time in the weight room, spends a lot of time making sure his
diet is where it needs to be for him to have success.  
  
He moves so much better this year. He's got a great mind. He's got good hands,
good feet, knows what's going on on the court. At times he couldn't get from A
to B. That's kind of the wide body, below-the-rim-type guy. Now he moves so
much better. And so now he can take that basketball IQ along with his improved
skill level and he really puts people in a bind.  
  
I've really enjoyed being round him because it sets a bar in terms for
everybody else, in terms of basketball is important to him and he's worked
really hard to be in the position that he is, but his team won. We have a lot
of good players in the BIG TEN. He's separated himself with his consistency
but also that his team won the league.  
  
Q. What's the best way for you to attack Vermont's defense?  
COACH PAINTER: We kind of approach the game more about us instead of our
opponent. They have to be able to matchup, you know, to us and we've seen a
lot of different looks this year in terms about how people are going to handle
us when the ball goes inside. We play through our low post. Lot of people
don't do that as much. They throw it in the low post but not as much as we do.  
  
So, we know that they're going to do a good job of trying to fight us and not
let us get the catch where we want to get the catch. We got to do a good job
of preventing them from doing that and getting the ball with the deep catches.
Being ready for what they're going to do in terms of once we do it, whether
they stay one-on-one, double somebody else, scrape off the side, come weak
side. There's only so much that you can do in those situations, but we've seen
a lot and we've had some success, obviously, handling it, but we've also had
some failure at times.  
  
It's hard sometimes when people swarm you, but when they -- we really circled
those two big guys with a lot of guys that can shoot, that's been our goal as
a staff to have that compliment. So no matter what Vermont is going to do, we
take what the defense gives us and just try to be simple. I know that's
profound. Really, just be simple. If you're one-on-one, score the basketball.
If you're not, pass the basketball. Dig them in deeper or get in a rotation
and play off that rotation.  
  
Q. Have you found it at all necessary to address the failures of the
last two years with this team? Do they feel a lot of pressure, given what
happened the last two years?  
COACH PAINTER: I think pressure is something you feel when you're not
prepared. Our team is prepared. There was another team out there that won
those games that we played in. We lost them, but there was two other teams out
there that won those games and made good plays. So the people that have been
here for both of them -- we've had to sit in it. And anytime you have to sit
in it, you don't have to address it.  
  
We know what we have to do to get back to this spot and make the improvements,
and we've done that. Now we got to play a little bit better. We've got to be
one possession better than the past two years.  
  
But it is a heart-breaker. No doubt. You work so hard to get to this spot, and
it's disappointing when you put yourself in position to win and you don't. The
only thing you can do about it is fight like hell to get back here. We've done
that. Hopefully, we can play one possession better than we have in the past.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you make of Vermont's freshman Anthony Lamb?  
COACH PAINTER: He's good, he's really good. Lot of times you get those guys at
a low to mid level, you don't get someone that strong that early. They got to
develop at being that strong. So anytime you get those guys, they normally
can't take you off the bounce when they're that strong.  
  
So I've coached at Eastern Illinois and Southern Illinois. So I've got a
little bit of pulse on the guys. He can drive and shoot the ball, he can post.
He can cave you in on the glass. So, he's got, you know, big-time strength,
but he's a good player. Lot of times you get those guys that are just brutes
and strong, but they're so-so players. He's a hell of a player. He can hurt
you in a lot of different ways.  
  
Q. Coach, how important will it be for your guys to get off to a good
start and maybe tell Vermont you really don't belong in this building here in
the Midwest, maybe get through the first two media timeouts and --  
COACH PAINTER: They've proven that. Anyone who wins 21 straight games belongs
in any building when it comes to the NCAA Tournament. They have the longest
winning streak in this tournament. They've earned the right to be here. For us
sometimes when we get off to great starts, it's hurt us. Sometimes we get off
to bad starts, it helps us. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but if you
watch enough basketball, you kind of see the pendulum swing sometimes.  
  
For us, it's trying to make the right play and let the game come to us and
keeping things simple. When you look at these type of games, people will look
at one team versus the other team. And when you get on a neutral court,
there's not a whole lot of difference.  
  
We have more size than than them. They have really good guard placement. You
can go back and forth, but everybody is good in the NCAA Tournament. Nobody
messed up and kind of landed here and got lucky. Everybody has earned the
right to be here. For us, it's trying to keep it simple and really worry about
us. No matter if we were playing Vermont or the overall No. 1 seed, it's about
us worrying about us and keeping things simple.  
  
Q. You alluded to this earlier, but you guys are known for your front
court, but how much part of the game is your ability to shoot the 3 and how
key will that be?  
COACH PAINTER: It's going to be huge, because when you go into a game like
this, you don't have a lot of film watching them play people like us. You know
what I mean? They don't play a lot of people like us that play through the low
post. So you go look at their games they've played, Butler, South Carolina,
Providence, those teams aren't like us. We're a little bit different than
those guys, even though Butler throws the ball inside.  
  
But, you know, I think that's going to be key, you know, for us more than
anything is that good guard placement taking care of the basketball, taking
good shots. Like I said, sometimes we'll shoot 10 to 15 3s. Sometimes we'll
shoot over 20 3s. It's not us coming to the game and say let's take more 3s
this game.  
  
Like I said earlier, keeping the things simple. Letting the defense kind of
predict what we're going to do, and then just playing from there. I think when
you do that, you play through your instincts and then you have less turnovers
and you have higher percentage jump shots.  
  
Q. Matt, what are some of the points of emphasis as far as guarding
Vermont? What kind of things do you need to do?  
COACH PAINTER: Just keeping the ball in front of us. I think anytime they do a
good job of breaking you down and getting in the paint and getting to the rim,
now it kind of opens up because you get into rotation in terms of helping. So
I think that's probably the most important thing for us is to keep them in
front of us and not allow angles.  
  
They got to be able to score over us. When they're getting by you and breaking
you down and posting up or driving, they're pretty successful because they got
guys like Steidl and Ernie Duncan who can shoot the basketball. The other guys
are good. The other guys are definitely capable of hurting you. That's
something for us. If we keep the ball in front of us, now they don't get as
clean as looks. They're going to get some looks. You want to able to challenge
those shots.  
  
Q. They've got a lot of Indiana kids. Did you recruit any of those guys,
Dre Wills or any of the others?  
COACH PAINTER: Ernie Duncan, a little bit. We recruited Josh Speidel,
obviously. They've done a good job. You'll find some different teams across
the country that will do it, have three, four guys from the State of Indiana.
It's definitely going to help you. Like Dre wills is such a competitor. He
played hard, will come at you and defend. Tough. Basketball, you can say, it's
important to him. The whole Duncan family are basketball players and guys that
have been around it a long time coming from Evansville. Ernie is a just a good
player. He can play off the dribble, shoot 3s, he can drive it. He's a
competitive kid, good player.  
  
Q. I think when you look at Vermont's roster, Caleb has 25, 30 pounds on
any guy on their team. When you look that the type of a matchup where somebody
is either much bigger or stronger or the opposite, are there things you talk
about with that player so they don't do too much to exploit something that
looks too obvious.  
COACH PAINTER: That's a good question. When you think you have a mismatch,
it's not you and that guy. It's you versus the other team. They have built-in
help. They're going to double you, things of that nature. If it was one-on-
one, then I'd feel really good about it. Because he is a tough matchup when
you stay one-on-one. Haas is a really tough matchup one-on-one. They're going
to come with help. Everybody does something at some point to give them
different looks to try to bottle them up a little bit.  
  
We just -- I'm saying the same thing over and over, but I say the same thing.
The game, it's repetition and what happens in the low post and what happens
with those guys a lot is people mix things up, you know, they double from
different places, they do different things. And so we always tell them keep it
simple. If you're one-on-one, score. If you're not, you got to pass the ball.
Don't play through the double. When we do that, we turn the ball over. When
you have two really big guys on the court and you turn it over, they're the
last two getting down to the other end.  
  
Q. Have you picked Chris Holtmann's brain at all because they played
them early this year?  
COACH PAINTER: I watched the tape.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by the Nevada student-athletes, D.J. Fenner, Cameron
Oliver, Marcus Marshall, and Jordan Caroline. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Marcus, going back to when you were looking at a school to transfer
to, did you ever look at transferring close to home? What was that process
like, and how did you end up choosing Nevada?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: Yeah. Originally I was deciding on transferring closer to
home, but Coach Musselman gave me a call a couple months after I decided to
transfer and I just liked what he talked about. And he told me he was going to
change the program around. And as you can see, it's heading in the right
direction. So I'm glad I made my decision.  
  
Q. What has your senior year been like with this team?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: It's been great. Obviously, it's one of my best -- it is the
best college year I had as far as playing. I kind of had an up-and-down
college career. Just ending it on a good note and winning a couple
championships and playing with these guys up here and having a chance to play
in my first NCAA Tournament is great.  
  
Q. Just lastly, what were some of the schools closer to home you were
thinking of transferring to?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: Minnesota, Iowa, Creighton. I actually looked at Iowa State,
which is kind of weird. But yeah, I mean, I really don't think about it too
much. I'm happy with my decision to come to Nevada.  
  
Q. Maybe for D.J. and Cam, seems like these two teams are really similar
in kind of how they like to play and what they want to do on the basketball
court. What would you say is the biggest difference between you and Iowa
State?  
D.J. FENNER: I think the biggest difference -- I'm with these guys everyday so
obviously I'm biased -- we work really hard. We're with each other all the
time on the court and off the court. So I think we have a really high team
chemistry. Not to say that Iowa State doesn't, they're a great team. But just
knowing these guys I play with and all my brothers, we're really close on and
off the court and we play really hard.  
  
CAMERON OLIVER: Piggyback what D.J. said. We travel together every single
today on the court and off the court. Our hard work is going to be -- we
showcase that a lot. We never give up on anything we put our mind into.
There's no knocking Iowa State, I'm pretty sure they work as hard was we do.
I'm pretty sure we're a little bit harder workers than who they are.  
  
Q. D.J., you guys are obviously the lower seed. Do you go into this with
a nothing-to-lose kind of mindset, or is there a different approach you guys
are taking for this game?  
D.J. FENNER: We approach this game like we approach every game, expecting to
win and go out and play hard and give it our all, regardless if it's Iowa
State, Colorado State, North Carolina, doesn't matter, because we're on the
same basketball court, dribble the same ball, and go out there to win and play
hard.  
  
Q. Fairly close to home for you, Jordan. Are you going to have a lot of
family there? When you saw Milwaukee, what was your thought?  
JORDAN CAROLINE: You know, I was excited. It's cold, but my family can travel.
I have family here in Milwaukee, too. It's pretty cool -- we'll have a good
fan base, at least from my family here.  
  
Q. Marcus, will you have any friends or family make the trip out, or do
you still have friends or family in the St. Paul area?  
MARCUS MARSHALL: Obviously, that's where I'm from. I have a decent amount of
family coming out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Guys, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
Questions for Nevada Head Coach, Eric Musselman, please.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to Marcus's recruitment. As he was looking to
transfer, he said he was looking to go back closer to home. How were you able
to convince him to come back and join your program?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: You don't think Nevada is that close to Minneapolis-St. Paul?
You know, I think that Marcus was -- he might have wanted to stay closer to
home, but I think he also was looking for certain things. He wanted to play in
a system and a style that resembled the next level. His father was involved in
the recruiting, and I think his father was familiar with, you know, my dad's
past, so to speak.  
  
And so once -- the more we started talking, the more there was a connection
and he actually committed without coming on a visit, and then he committed
verbally and then he came on the visit.  
  
So, you know, just two people that the more we talked philosophically on what
he was looking for and what we were looking for, it's unique with a sit one,
play one, and it was -- he was our first guy that committed to us as a new
staff.  
  
Q. Must have been a heck of a phone call if he was able to --  
COACH MUSSELMAN: It wasn't one phone call. It was several. The more we talked
and his dad got involved, you know, he's a guy that, you know, to be able to
score like he has and contribute like he has with just one year to play,
because we centered a lot of what we do around him.  
  
Q. You mentioned his dad sort of knowing your dad's past. Is that from a
Minnesota connection, do you think?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Yup. Yes, sir.  
  
Q. What has he brought to your team? Obviously the stats speak for
themselves, but what as he been able to do in one year with you guys?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I think the big thing was last year, because our guys had to
guard him everyday in practice, he helped our team last year being on the
scout team. And I thought that all of our three sit-out guys really
contributed to last year's success, just like the four guys we have sitting
out now.  
  
But our guys knew coming into the year, because they faced Marcus on a daily
basis in practice, I think that they knew that they were going -- they were
adding a new guy this year that was really going to score points for us. And
the thing that makes Marcus really unique is he's an excellent passer, he's
got great court vision, and he's really, really unselfish, almost to a fault.  
  
In the Mountain West Tournament, we would go to him over and over and over. He
defers a little too often at times. We talked to him about trying to be a
little bit more selfish when we need buckets.  
  
Q. You guys have defended the 3 well all year long. Obviously, that's a
big aspect to their game. What is it about you guys that has been so
successful there and how important will it be tomorrow?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: We understand that Iowa State can really, really shoot the
basketball and they do a great job of sharing the ball and it's almost like
the ball has eyes for them. And so we're going to just do what we've always
done all year, and we'll designate who we feel their top 3-point shooters are
and try not to give up too much air space to those guys and contest the high
hand. And, you know, I don't think we do anything special defending the 3. I
think what we do do is we identify who we would like to try to pay special
attention to.  
  
But we have done a really good job of that all year, of identifying, getting
the guys -- getting to guys as quick as we can before they release the ball.  
  
Q. How crazy has the season already been for Hallice Cooke and what are
you kind of expecting for him down the road?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Hallice -- he's gone through a lot. He's made the decision to
come to Nevada. And then there was the, you know, the heart situation and
through further tests and, you know, now he's playing and practicing and he's
happy. But it was -- at one point he was basically a student coach/student
manager and had a great attitude through that really difficult time until he
was cleared to play again with his heart.  
  
And, you know, he's a guy that's become close with our coaching staff because
he's been around us a lot when he wasn't able to practice. And, you know,
we're just so happy for him and his family that he's been cleared to play,
and, you know, I think next year he's going to have a really big impact for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, how is Marcus approaching the opportunity to go head-to-head
with Monte Morris who is widely known as one of the top point guards in the
country?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Our whole program has great respect for what Monte has done
as a basketball player, and, you know, they're on TV a lot, so our guys are
overly familiar with some of the personnel at Iowa State, because, again, we
watch them on our off nights and they're always on some network.  
  
And, you know, having said that, I think Marcus gets up for every game. I
don't think that tomorrow is any different. I mean, the one thing we've tried
to pride ourselves on is just competing, doesn't matter who we play against.
And Marcus is a guy who is a great competitor on both sides of the ball.  
  
But, again, we understand Marcus as well as the other guys will have to defend
Morris and what a special player he is.  
  
Q. Speaking of Monte Morris, what kind of potential do you think he
has?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I'll probably be able to give you a little bit better feel
after tomorrow when I see him live. On film, great court vision, really
unselfish, makes other players around him better, creates steals defensively.
Can knock down the 3 ball. Excellent splitting pick-and-rolls. He's got the
whole package. Rebounds for his position. He's got a really bright future
because of he's able to do so many things well. Again, probably have a little
bit better feel after seeing him live, but what I see on tape, one of the best
point guards in the entire country.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Thank you.

### [Roderick Perkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33048)

### [Xavier Cooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33050)

  
_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Winthrop student-athletes Xavier Cooks, Keon Johnson,
and Roderick Perkins. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Keon, would you would you describe your game? We've seen snippets of
it. How would you describe your game?  
KEON JOHNSON: You know, I just, you know, my game is pretty simple. I try to
-- I don't try to make it too hard. I try to pick my shots and do what I do
best when I'm on the floor.  
  
Q. Keon, following up on that, I think you referenced Isaiah Thomas from
the Celtics several times as a guy who -- are there other NBA players that you
modeled your game after?  
KEON JOHNSON: I would say Tyler Ulis, my old teammate, Nate Robinson. All
those guys are caliber of my game. I look up do those guys.  
  
Q. If I can follow-up, how do you do that, how do you model yourself
after those guys?  
KEON JOHNSON: I watch highlights all the time of those guys, film, lots of
film and stuff like that. I'm watching those guys consistently.  
  
Q. What it's been like this week to get a little bit of national
exposure? The whole team has really been kind of -- hasn't had this kind
exposure last three years.  
KEON JOHNSON: It's surreal. I'm just enjoying the experience, every second of
it. You know, just taking it step by step, day by day, and just cherishing the
moments.  
  
Q. Xavier, What do you know about Butler and what would it take to beat
Butler?  
XAVIER COOKS: They're a really skilled team, play really hard. Had a lot of
great wins this year. And I think to beat them we're going to have to rebound
the ball recently well, guard their 4-man and guard their shooters. Play
really hard. Win the rebounding battle and shoot the ball really well.  
  
Q. Rod, how critical do you think -- I don't know if they'll be directly
matched up, Xavier and Chrabascz. How critical do you think that matchup will
be for this guy?  
RODERICK PERKINS: They're going to be focusing a lot on them. Other guys got
to step up like me and Anders and the brothers, and a lot of other guys got to
step up like we do the most of the season. Take a lot of pressure off of them
and step up and do our job.  
  
Q. I was wondering if each of you could tell me how you wound up at
Winthrop, what you knew about Winthrop before you went there, and what the
process was in going there.  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Xavier and go right down line.  
  
XAVIER COOKS: I'm from Australia. I didn't know much about the whole college,
as a whole. Growing up so far away from this, you don't know the difference
between the big schools and little schools. The main thing that stood out was
Coach Kelsey. He flew to Australia, really got to know me as a person. I knew
I was going to feel a lot homesick over here. He really made me feel at home,
provide like a family environment for me. That's really the main thing the
that came to me.  
  
KEON JOHNSON: I'm from Ohio. Coach Kelsey is from Ohio, as well. I can agree
with Xavier as far as him coming to my home town and just seeing, you know,
where I was raised and, you know, what's going on around here and just, you
know, being a coach that actually cared. You know what I'm saying? That was a
starting point right there.  
  
RODERICK PERKINS: I'm from Smyrna, Georgia. Come to here, they had a winning
tradition before I came here. Everybody welcomed me with open arms. Telling me
I had to have that same winning tradition with me. Keep this tradition going
and that's what we've been doing.  
  
Q. Keon, I think you just wrote a piece in the Players Tribune about
what you've been through in your career. Now that you're here in the Tourney,
do you feel that you've arrived, so to speak? Do you see this as another stage
to prove yourself?  
KEON JOHNSON: Most definitely. Each game you're going to improve yourself
every time you go out on the floor. But like I say, I'm just cherishing every
moment each day. And, you know, this is a big time, this is a big thing, the
tournament is a big thing. I'm right and ready for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Did the three of you have family who are coming here? And in the case
of Xavier, your father, I believe, was a professional in Australia. How does
he keep up with this and is his season still going on as an assistant coach?  
XAVIER COOKS: Their season just ended. Made it to the finals this year and
lost to Perth. My mom and dad and brother, they're all coming over here. It's
going to be a great experience to share for my family.  
  
Q. As to the others, do you have family here?  
KEON JOHNSON: My parents will be here sooner or later. They're in a snow storm
as well just as up here. They're on their way. It will be a good time.  
  
RODERICK PERKINS: Yeah, like Xavier, my parents are coming from Atlanta,
Georgia. Little bit of different atmosphere in the weather, but they'll get
used to it. Like the experience.  
  
Q. For all of you, can you think back to the first major upset in the
NCAA that you saw and really thought about, is there like an upset that sticks
with you?  
KEON JOHNSON: It's crazy that you ask that because I was -- I watched -- I
don't know if anybody remember the Duke and Lehigh game. That was a great
game. I think Lehigh, I'm not sure what seed they were. Duke was number two.
And JC McCullough is a great guy. That was a good experience to watch for me
being the underdog in a tournament. That was good.  
  
RODERICK PERKINS: Being the underdog in a tournament is big as well. I
remember George Mason making a big run in 2006. That was something special to
watch, and their grit and determination is what kind of -- the whole team you
could see it, and that's what I like.  
  
XAVIER COOKS: The Florida Coast team, that was really exciting for me to watch
the little buzz that came with them.  
  
Q. How critical will rebounding be for you guys? Because I know that's
probably -- how much have y'all talked about that this week?  
XAVIER COOKS: That's usually been a really good indicator for how the game is
going. Normally when we win the rebounding game we're in a good position to
win the game. Most of our big wins we've run the rebounding games. Most of our
bad losses we've lost the rebounding game. It's got to be important us. We've
got to make sure we have energy and box out and pursue those rebounds.  
  
Q. For Keon, the fact that you went to Illinois and played teams like
Florida State and Dayton, does that give you a lot of confidence going into
the game against Butler?  
KEON JOHNSON: Most definitely. Those are big college teams in big conferences.
Getting experience early head-on is an advantage for me right now. So I think
that was great playing those guys earlier in the season, and I think it's
prepared me for today and the rest of the season.  
  
Q. I'm curious, does it give schools like yours hope when you see what
Butler has done over the last number of years that you're kind of in the
position where Butler was many years, smaller conference, school that people
didn't know where it was located? Does that give you more of a feeling like we
can get this done because Butler has done it, several other teams have done
it?  
KEON JOHNSON: Yeah. I would say, like you said, Butler is a great team, have a
great tradition. They came a long way. So, you know, that rubs off on me. I
think my teammates as well, you know, just to have an insight of knowing that
you can do something special in a tournament and you just have to go out there
with confidence and do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you. Good luck against Butler.  
  
Questions for Winthrop Head Coach, Pat Kelsey, please.  
  
Q. Pat, what are some of the points of emphasis for your guys going into
this game against Butler?  
COACH KELSEY: Yeah. You guys mentioned it when our players were up here in
their portion of the press conference. I think especially in tournament play
and you're going against a team that has more size and length, you know, I
think it always starts on the backboard. We got to do a good job of blocking
out and eliminating their second shots.  
  
So, I think that's very important. Butler is so solid. They're one of the best
in the country at taking care of the ball. They don't turn it over, they never
hurt themselves. They execute their stuff so well. They get and they take and
they make high percentage shots.  
  
You know, so us, sitting down, bowing our neck and gritting our teeth and
guarding for 44 minutes is going to be really important. They make it tough on
you. Chris puts them many in great position schematically. You know, they know
who they are and they know their roles and they really carry those out on
every single possession.  
  
Q. Pat, how neat has it been to see Keon kind of get a little bit of
national exposure after not really having that the last couple of years?  
COACH KELSEY: Yeah. I think he's earned it. You've been watching Keon for four
years. Nothing he does anymore surprises me. The people of Rock Hill and the
fans of Winthrop and I think the people in the Big South has really
appreciated what a special, what a special performer, and what a special
player he is. And I think he's deserved the right to have some national
spotlight and for the nation to be able to see what this kid is all about,
because he is special. He's going to finish his career, when it's over, as one
of the most decorated, one of the best players in the history of our program.
And as you know, we have a very tradition rich program.  
  
So, I'm glad that the country gets to see it. He's gotten so close the last
three years, getting to the finals and us not crossing that finish line. So
I'm excited for that entire senior class because it's a special class, one of
the best in our school's history. Especially for a guy like Keon who is our
heart and soul and leader to be able to experience all of this, which is the
highest level, the greatest spectacle in American sports, some people would
say outside the Super Bowl, but I would argue that.  
  
Q. Winthrop has been very good at shooting the 3 and defending the 3
both. Is that something that you recruit to, or is that something that -- it's
a point of emphasis during practices and as the season evolves?  
COACH KELSEY: You know, we recruit that way. We identify, when we identify
guys and when we evaluate and recruiting, being able to put the ball in the
basket they tell me is pretty important in this game. We put that pretty up
high on our list.  
  
Skill level is very important, ability to shoot the 3 is very important as
well. You know, we play to our strength, obviously. We play with great pace,
we push the ball, we play an exciting brand, an exciting style, but we do rely
on 3-point shooting, because we have very killed and very good 3-point
shooters.  
  
Q. When was the first time you saw Keon when you were in the process of
recruiting him and what was that process?  
COACH KELSEY: The first time I saw him was at an AAU Tournament in Myrtle
Beach. Keon plays on one of the premiere -- or played on one of the premiere
AAU teams the entire country. When they're on their way down to the Peach Jam,
the Nike Peach Jam, which is maybe the premiere AAU event in the entire
country, they stop in Myrtle Beach every year, and I don't know if they still
do, and play sort of a preliminary tournament.  
  
Keon was a very solid performer and contributor for that team, but he wasn't
one of the main guys. They have McDonald's All-Americans on that team. So he
was more of a role player.  
  
So, I think I was a little lucky. If I would have waited to see him at Peach
Jam, he would have been maybe the 6th or 7th guy off the bench and maybe been
a complimentary guy.  
  
In that specific tournament they weren't playing their McDonald's guys as much
and resting them up and giving some of these other guys I think an
opportunity. And Keon was just magnificent that night. He's the Keon that I
get to see on a nightly basis for the last four years. He was tiny. You looked
at him and there's doubt and everybody is doubting him. But he's making play
after play and attacking the rim and finishing at the rim, finishing from
deep. All the stuff that Keon does.  
  
A buddy of mine is next to me. What do you think? He's little. I know, but
this kid can go, you know. Sometimes it's just in your gut. I'm not any
smarter than anybody else. I had probably the same reservations and the same
concerns just because he was so diminutive in his size.  
  
But sometimes you got to go with your gut, and I just fell in love with him
that day. I just loved his courage, loved his attacking mentality, the way he
plays with a chip on his shoulder.  
  
You know, rest is history. Even when he got to Winthrop he was doubted as
well. I think he was the 3rd string point guard the first month into the
season and two other players that were in front of him, one had a little
hamstring pull before our first preseason scrimmage. Another one missed the
bus on the way to go up to the preseason scrimmage, which was a closed
scrimmage. You can play a couple of those every year.  
  
I walked back on the bus, and he doesn't say anything ever anyway. He was just
sitting there with his headphones on. I said, "Keon, can I talk to you?" He
took them off. I said, "This guy has got a pulled hamstring and this guy
missed the bus. You're going to play the whole scrimmage."  
  
He goes, "All right, Coach." He had like 26-8. Never came out of the lineup
since. Kind of like the Lou Gehrig and Wally Pipp for Philly, if you will.
He's a special kid, special player.  
  
Q. How many times have you used the word "diminutive"?  
COACH KELSEY: We have a kid on our team named Mitch Hill. I have to multiply
my SAT score times two to get to his. So to some use of those SAT words is a
little bit outkicking my coverage.  
  
Q. Please don't do that again. Keon is so unusual and so unique. Have
opposing defenses done unusual things to stop him, or does he get treated like
any other point guard?  
COACH KELSEY: No. I think, you know, he's the focal point of the prep for the
opposing team, and obviously people are going to try to limit his touches and
try to get the ball out of his hands and things like that, all the things that
great players see when they're on the floor.  
  
So, he's sort of seen it all. Obviously the team that we play tomorrow in
Butler is very, very well coached. I have the utmost respect for Chris, and
I'm sure he'll have something cooked up to try to take Keon away and hopefully
we can counter that.  
  
Q. Just out ever curiosity, have you crossed paths with Chris?  
COACH KELSEY: I was talking to Brett from the Rock Hill Herald about this the
other day. He was at Gardner-Webb, my first year at Winthrop. So I got to
coach against him head to head and developed an unbelievable respect for him
then. He's unbelievable tactician and a really good coach. Got to know him a
little bit and became friends and friendly. This summer I was going up to
Cincinnati to visit family where I'm from and reached out to him about a
couple things they do. And I was watching them on film that I liked and asked
if I could come up and pick his brain for 15 minutes, half hour. He was
unbelievably gracious with his time. Come on up. And took me out to lunch and
we ended up talking for three, four hours, and just X's and O's. He probably
told me more than he wanted to tell me and I told him more, knowing what I
know now. I think it's the indication of the caliber of person that he that he
was so willing and open to share that day and even developed a deeper respect
for that.  
  
Q. The one time you played, did you beat him?  
COACH KELSEY: I think we played twice and we split, I think. Maybe.  
  
Q. I'll look it up.  
COACH KELSEY: I'm sure you will.  
  
Q. How is Chrabascz and Cook? They seem like play-making forwards. I
don't know if they'll directly matchup.  
COACH KELSEY: They're a little bit different body types. He's a little bit
stronger and wider. Xav is a little bit longer and taller, but I think they're
cut from the same swat a little bit from a basketball standpoint. They're just
players. You can't really paint their position into a corner, point forwards,
I would call them. Of that Chrab is a phenomenal passer. His assist-to-
turnover ratio is off the charts. It's a very hard matchup problem. Chris puts
him in great position. He'll take advantage of bigger guys out on the floor,
smaller guys in the post, and really makes it tough on you and makes you make
tough decisions as a coach and as a team how to deal with him because of his
ability to do so many things, score in the post. And then just like Keon has
seen every defense under the sun to try to take him away. He's probably seen
every scheme to try to lessen his effectiveness when he catches the ball in
the post, and he can pass so well out of it. So he can make you pay. And Xav
is sort of the same way as well. They're both very high basketball IQ guys
that are mismatch problems that put the defense in great predicaments.  
  
Q. When you think about some of the great upsets in the NCAA history,
what are some that immediately come to mind for you?  
COACH KELSEY: You know, the one that comes to my mind the most, because it's
most special to me, was I think in 1990 in Indianapolis at the Hoosier Dome, I
grew up an Xavier fan and my father played at Xavier, I coached at Xavier and
played at Xavier. I -- when I say I played at Xavier, I missed a thousand
career points by 912. So I was a little less than a great player. Brett has
heard that a few hundred times. The Xavier brand grew exponentially and grew
nationwide that day in Indianapolis in March when they beat Georgetown and
Dikembe Mutombo in front of 30,000 people at the Hoosier Dome. That kind of
catapulted that program to unbelievable heights and I just remember exactly
where I was sitting. I remember Tyrone Hill and Derrick Strong and -- jumping
Jamal Walker, Pete Gillen, Pete Prosser, Dino "Guardio", a mentor of mine was
an assistant at the time. I just can feel it. I can remember being there that
day and running to the car and jumping in the car and listening to the great
Andy McWilliams, the play-by-play guy for so many years at Xavier, screaming
and yelling and that's probably my greatest NCAA memory.  
  
Believe it or not, I coached and I played in the NCAA Tournament, but that was
probably the moment that made me fall in love with basketball forever and made
me maybe what we wanted to, you know, attack this profession as my career.  
  
Q. How old were you at the time?  
COACH KELSEY: 1990, I think. So that would be 15.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Butler student-athletes, Andrew Chrabascz, Kelan
Martin, and Avery Woodson. Go ahead with your questions.  
  
Q. Guys, what have you seen from this Keon Johnson on film and what kind
of challenges does he pose for you guys?  
KELAN MARTIN: It's going to be a fun challenge. He's a different player. We
haven't really seen this year. He can score the ball, he's quick in
transition, and he just pulls from anywhere. It will be interesting to see
what we can bring to the table tomorrow defensively.  
  
Q. For each of you, what has been the key for Butler this season? When
you have shot 3s well, it seems like when Butler is shooting the 3 well, like
the whole offense clicks. But is there any common theme that you can detect
that when we're doing such-and-such that's when we're making 3s?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I'd say when we're just moving -- like getting the ball
swinging side to side, when we have first side shots, normally those are tough
ones. When we're getting paint touches as well, that just sucks the defense in
and then opens up 3-point opportunities a lot more.  
  
So, doing a little bit of both of that will definitely help. But we know this
team is well disciplined, very good defensive team. We're going to have to do
a lot more just to -- we'll have to do a lot more to come back with a W.  
  
AVERY WOODSON: The key is ball movement, getting to the second and third side
and letting our playmakers make plays. And when they do that, the defense
collapse and gives us a chance to shoot open 3s.  
  
KELAN MARTIN: I agree with both of them. Second and third side shots are more
efficient than first side. Just paint touches, ball movement, and just getting
the defense shifted, just want to break them down and get our team the best
shot.  
  
Q. Going into this, what are some of the points of emphasis that you've
heard about from your coach?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: Big thing is they're uptempo, obviously. We're a very
explosive team. Very well-disciplined defensively. But big thing for us is to
focus on us, making sure that we're playing the Butler defense that we know we
can play. And we have to play a complete team with this team. We know they can
go on runs with the explosive players that they have. It's going to be a
challenge for us. We're looking forward to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
Q. I know I asked you this on Sunday, Avery, your foot feeling better?
Have you been able to practice in the last couple of days?  
AVERY WOODSON: I'm fine.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, has there been any sort of common element or tie
when it comes to the wins you guys have had over ranked teams this year? Is
there anything you've noticed that has carried through in those games
throughout the year?  
AVERY WOODSON: Obviously every game is different, you know. We have just tried
to play our best basketball whenever we face a challenge. And if that's
against a ranked team or it's not, we just come out and try to compete as hard
as we can and we know every game is different. We just try to give each and
every game our all.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on that, how did you beat Villanova twice?  
KELAN MARTIN: We just came out competitively, you know. We wanted it and we
came out together. And that was our game plan, just being together as a team,
as a collective group, be the more ready team, be the more together team. We
came out and executed well offensively and defensively. Our game plan was on
point.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If I can ask you guys, do you think it's an advantage that you
played in this building before in the BIG EAST?  
  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: For sure. But I mean, this brings a whole different
challenge with a team that we haven't seen before, and just the atmosphere is
going to be completely different it being March Madness now. We have to make
sure emotions stay even keel. 10-foot rim and 94 feet. Same court.  
  
Q. Not that you're going to share any state secrets, but do you know
right now who you're going to matchup with Keon Johnson?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: No. We're still trying to figure that out. It's going to be
a team effort on that one. He's a very explosive scorer. It's not going to be
one man matching up with him. It's going to be a team effort to make sure we
can control him as much as possible. Make him as inefficient as possible.  
  
Q. With a guy like that, do you try and blitz him, try get the ball out
of his hands?  
KELAN MARTIN: I mean, it just depends on what the coaches say. Just making him
shoot contested shots all night is our defensive game plan. That's basically
what we want, to make him inefficient, like Andrew said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Please welcome Butler Head Coach, Chris Holtmann. Butler has a fourth seed,
highest in the history of the program. This is Coach Holtmann.  
  
Q. Chris, have you seen anybody like Keon Johnson either this year or in
past years, and what kind of a coaching challenge does he pose for you?  
COACH HOLTMANN: A big one, a really big one. He's one of the most dynamic
players in college basketball. He is nearly impossible to keep in front, and
his ability to make shots makes him incredibly dynamic.  
  
You know, I think you've seen kind of, obviously our friend at the Celtics
have seen what a little guard can do at a really high level, and boy, Keon,
he's fantastic.  
  
You know, you look at it, Illinois, he goes and plays at Illinois 38 points on
15-21 shooting, 6 rebounds, 3 assists. I'd say that's a pretty good night when
they beat Illinois.  
  
Q. Chris, in many of Butler losses, your opponents shot the 3 very well.
Have you been able -- I mean, even analytics and film review, there seems to
be like a controversy overall, you know it's hard the prevent good 3-point
shooting. When you look at film, has there been a common thread or theme that
sort of has allowed the other team to shoot the 3 that well?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No. I don't think so. I think, you know, schematically we
could do some things probably -- continue to do some things better. I think
probably our lack of length on the perimeter has impacted that a bit. Really 1
through 4, you know, team -- for whatever reason, teams didn't use to shoot
the 3s much when Cam Woods was in there. So I think his ability to move and
defend was really important for us. But I think that's obviously going to be
important, but they score it in other ways too. They're terrific in
transition, too.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a lot of attention on Michigan because of what
happened and what it turned into for their results. Can you share the
experience of what happened to your team and how it affected you and your
team?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah, sure. I think that what a great story that is in college
basketball with Michigan. Congratulations to them for the run that they're on,
and thank the good Lord that they are -- everybody is safe.  
  
You know, I just think that what they probably did is what we played -- the
way we played the next week; and that is, you really play pretty free, because
it just changes your perspective on things when you feel like maybe your life
is in the balance or at least could be at risk.  
  
So, I think for us, it was -- our next game we played very well against
Providence.  
  
I think there's an element of team stuff that happens out of that where
because you're going through something traumatic together, so there is a
unifying element of that that I'm sure they experienced. It's unique to have
two of those situations in one year in college basketball. But I'm sure that
-- they're going to look back on it and remember that week, week and a half,
and in a lot of ways.  
  
Q. Coach, Cooks and Chrabascz, how important are they to each team? How
much impact will they have on the outcome of the game? They seem like kind of
similar players, even though they physically look different.  
COACH HOLTMANN: Very similar. Cooks is outstanding. I think he's a pro. I
think he's a pro. His length and size and shooting and scoring ability and
ability to block shots, I mean he's a pro. He can play anywhere in the country
at anytime, and they play through him a lot like we do with Andrew. Both guys
are exceptional passers. Both guys read the game really well. Both guys can
shoot it and drive it and they're utilized in a lot of same ways.  
  
You know, Andrew plays with his back to the basket probably a little bit more
and -- but they're utilized in similar ways.  
  
Q. Coach, how much have you seen Andrew grow from his freshman year to
his senior year? He's obviously gone through three different coaches through
his recruitment till now. Now he's become the big leader on your team.  
COACH HOLTMANN: He continues to mature and grow. We've said that from day one.
And if we're going to play well tomorrow, he's going to be a big part of it
defensively and offensively with his matchup with Cooks and some of their
other interior guys.  
  
You know, when he plays well, we really play well. When he plays well, it
doesn't always show up in stats. You know, we've beaten really good people.
Sometimes he's had statistically a pretty quote/unquote normal game, but his
impact has been enormous. He's got a huge challenge tomorrow against a really
good player.  
  
Q. Getting back to Keon, have you seen anybody like him in the BIG EAST,
either this year or in past years, or is he completely unique?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No. No. No, I haven't, Bob. He's a really, really unique
player. And, you know, he obviously he has a really big heart. He's got a
really big game and whatever 5-7, 5-8 body. He's got a huge, huge game.
There's not many guys really like him in college basketball that have his type
of size and speed and shooting ability.  
  
When I was in the Big South, these Big South guys will know, Saah Nimley was a
similar kind of player in terms of his -- how dynamic he was from Charleston
Southern. Both guys can just take over a game.  
  
Q. There's very few guys built like Keon, right? One of them happens to
be coached by two Butler coaches. Do you call Brad, did you call Brad for any
tips on how do we stop this guy, he's a lot like Isaiah?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I haven't. We've texted. I just kind of thrown myself -- the
game is different, their game is different than our game, and their ball
screen coverages are a little bit different than ours are. But I have talked
to him throughout the year about how teams try to stop Isaiah and what teams
do, and so I probably would say I have carried some of those thoughts. There's
some similar comparisons between the two in a lot of ways, how they can take
over a game.  
  
Q. I thought you might have an original idea here.  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah.  
  
Q. You being familiar with the Big South, how unusual for that
conference, would you say, some of the guys on their roster are when you think
of like Keon or Xavier or even like Duby Okeke, just physically and how they
play?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think the two -- really probably the three you mentioned,
it's a good league, and, you know, talking to one of the guys in their league
this year, throughout the year, they felt like Winthrop is as good a team from
the Big South in the last four, five years. And that's certainly saying
something because there's been some good teams.  
  
Those guys, like I said, they're very good players, and I think when you're a
6-9 like Cooks is and can pass, handle it and shoot it and move like he moves,
that's why I think he's got a chance to be to be a pro. Like you mentioned,
their size and length inside is good, it's very good. Their 4s and 5s are long
and can really move.  
  
Q. Chris, what are some of the keys to stopping a guard like Keon? And
is it a State secret as to who you will put on him?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Well, I don't know that there's going to be one specific guy
that will be on him kind of the whole game. It will rotate between multiple
guys.  
  
You know, I don't want to oversimplify it, but the biggest thing is we've got
to try to challenge him and make him work and earn it. You know, he's going to
score the ball. And obviously you look at his numbers offensively, he's pretty
efficient.  
  
But our challenge is just -- like it is, they have other really good players.
They can spread you out and really shoot you, and that's what makes them
difficult because of their ability to shoot the ball across the board.  
  
But the biggest thing is we're going to have to try to keep him in front,
challenge his ability to make 3s and make him work for everything. They're
very good in transition. They're very fast. He adds that element to them, but
they're fast and athletic across the board. So, limiting his ability to get
loose in transition is going to be important, too.  
  
Q. You mentioned Andrew has a big impact on games even if the score
sheet doesn't show it all the time. I'm going to embarrass myself. I was
surprised he was All BIG EAST because I don't see that sort of thing. Is that
the kind of thing coaches, a basketball junkie would know and appreciate what
he does because he's not scoring 20?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah. I was really happy to see that. I really was. That stuff
is voted on by coaches, I think you know that, Greg. It was great for me to
see as his coach because, you know, coaches can value things maybe differently
at times than other people do, and you know when your team finishes alone in
second place, right, somebody -- we need to have some guys on the first team.
They've earned it and they deserve it. He's helped us in important games.  
  
Andrew is the first one that will tell you if he's not completely locked in,
and there are times where he can look normal and look kind of average at his
size and some of his limitations athletically. He'll be the first one to tell
you that. His mind and his effort have to allow him to be a really good
player, and that will be important tomorrow.  
  
Q. Pat Kelsey mentioned you guys spent a lot of time together, I think
this past year. Do you regret at all having let him pick your brain for that
period of time?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No. No. I don't. I've known him for a number of years. You
know, coaching is for all of us is a life learning process. So, I think -- or
lifelong process of learning. So I think I admire guys. I probably took it as
much from him or more from him than he took from me. It was mutual.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? All right. Thank you. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Thanks, guys.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Middle Tennessee student-athletes, Reggie
Upshaw, Giddy Potts, and JaCorey Williams. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Reggie, how special is this tournament for you knowing that it's
going to be your last with these two guys who have been the core of the team
with you?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: It's very special. I think this whole season has been special
for me just because I am the only four-year senior on the team. So I've kind
of embraced this is my last, you know, kind of going out more than probably
JaCorey has. But, you know, just the fashion in which we went about this
season with being 30-4 and making it back to our second straight NCAA
appearance, it's all been very special.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, and I know, JaCorey, this is your first time
playing, how different does it feel going into this game than it felt a year
ago going into the Michigan State game, in terms of a lot of people are
picking you for this game, there's a different kind of expectation?  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I mean, obviously I didn't feel the excitement these two
guys from Michigan State last year. It's a good feeling knowing people has
confidence in us and our abilities. We've been showing we're a mature team all
year long and we're glad we got some supporters out there.  
  
GIDDY POTTS: It really felt the same to me, but I just want these two guys to
go out with a bang, and I just want them to come out and play their hardest
like we did last year and win some games in the tournament.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: Like those two said, it's kind of felt the same. You know, of
course this year we're not going to be able to sneak up on anybody like we did
last year. But, you know, I felt like we have a good team who is very mature
and have a couple good days of practice leading up to tomorrow's game. You
know, as far as just our preparation and stuff like that, I feel like it's all
been the same.  
  
Q. Reggie, you mentioned not sneaking up on anybody. Do you feel like
there is more pressure on you guys since more people know about you and people
are picking you guys?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I wouldn't say there's pressure because we're still a 12 seed.
It's still -- it would be considered an upset if we won to most people, but
for us it's not a upset. We feel like we have a good team and we know what
kind of team we are. We know who we are, and we know that we have a very
physical team. So if we just go out and do the things that we can do, then
there won't be any kind of sneaking up or anything like that.  
  
Q. Giddy, what's kind of the mood around the locker room like and how
does it compare to last year? Are you guys nervous? Excited?  
GIDDY POTTS: I think we're kind of excited, but I really haven't talked to all
the players, just been talking to them two. They feel -- they excited, but we
just coming out here to play our game like we're supposed to.  
  
Q. Reggie and JaCorey, talk about playing the Gophers front court.
Obviously Reggie Lynch is one of the nation's leading shot blockers and Jordan
Murphy was an All BIG TEN player.  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I feel like we've been playing this lineup all year. We
faced guys that were bigger than us, considered more physical before the game.
I think that me and Reggie, we play well off each other, cause some mismatch
problem. As far as guarding those two, we just have to stay solid, try to hold
our ground, do our work early in the post.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: Like what JaCorey said, all year we've kind of gone up against
bigger post players. When we played Vandy, they had Luke Kornet. And the whole
time leading into that game, we heard about how he kind of alters shots and
he's basically going to dominate us in the post. And it was a different story
when we got out there. And the same thing about UAB. They have a post player
who is known for blocking shots so we're used to playing against post players
who kind of have a name for themselves and are, you know, talked about in a
light where they change the game defensively.  
  
You know, going into this game, it's all the same. We just have to do what we
do. And since we are so versatile we'll be able to create those mismatches.  
  
Q. Is there something about Big Ten teams that you think you matchup
against their style of play, maybe the more physical style that they play that
allows you to matchup there?  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: We can play a lot of ways. We play a lot of teams, different
styles of play. For example, Marshall gets up and down the court. We can play
fast in transition. Minnesota they're trying to look for their bigs off
screens and rolls. We'll change the game with the way we defend as well. We'll
be fine playing slow or fast.  
  
Q. Reggie, you mentioned the other day trying to take this program to a
higher level from these runs. What does that mean to you? I know you're
focused on this team, you're a senior, but what do you think can be done from
last year and this year in terms of advancing Middle Tennessee moving
forward?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I think, you know, the way that this program kind of goes
towards the future is almost like when I was a freshman coming in, the year
before they had made it to the playoff game against St. Mary's. That group of
seniors when I got here, they kind of told me it's my turn to kind of take
this program to a different level. Now that I'm leaving, you know, the group
that's going to come back with Giddy and Ed and the rest of the players and
the new group that's coming in, you know, it's kind of on them to take this
program from here and, you know, wherever it wants to go.  
  
Q. Reggie and Giddy, with you guys having been with Coach Davis for a
number of years throughout the first maybe half of his time at Middle
Tennessee, you scored around .500 every season. The last five or six years,
you guys have taken it to another level. What about his program has either
changed or allowed you guys to have more success in the last few years than he
experienced when he was first starting to build the program?  
GIDDY POTTS: I think a lot of the guys are starting to buy into the process. I
think that's the key to his success and our playing ability. And I think we
just go out there and follow the scout and play our game like we supposed to,
and I think that's helped Coach Davis.  
  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I just think like what Giddy said, a lot of the guys do bye in.
The guys who try to go against Coach Davis and try to kind of fight him and
not really buy into what he's doing, those are the guys who find it hard to
play for him. But for myself and I know for Giddy, you know, it's been
relatively easy playing for Coach Davis because, I mean, he let's you play
your game, but, at the same time, he gets the most out of you with how you
play on defense.  
  
Q. Reggie, you guys are again posting 100 percent graduation success
rate this season. What does Coach Davis and Middle Tennessee kind of do to
help you guys get prepared in the classroom as well as on the court?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: They just -- help hold you accountable everyday, especially
since we've been missing so many days of class, traveling from the conference
tournament to coming here and hopefully going to Memphis next week. He just --
he holds you accountable. Everyday that we're on campus he expects you to be
in class, and he has this point system where if you're late the a class or if
you miss a day of class, then, you know, you get a point. Once you get two
points, he wakes you up at 5:00 in the morning. You have to go run.  
  
I know a lot of guys don't like to wake up that early, so for the most part
that's really the reason that everybody is in class (laughter).  
  
Q. Giddy, can you tell us a little bit about Tyrik Dixon's growth from
the beginning on forward? He's grown from a true freshman to starting guard in
the NCAA Tournament. From a guard's standpoint, how has he been an upgrade on
defense?  
GIDDY POTTS: I think he's just been doing what he's supposed to do, not being
fancy with the ball. Just taking care of it. Making the right plays. And off
the floor he just -- he stays in the gym, he work on his shot all the time,
and he's just a hard-working guy. And that's -- it shows up on the court.  
  
Q. With as popular as basketball is in the State of Tennessee and
particularly Memphis, what would it mean for you guys to get there, knowing
there's already a program there that that city is really supporting terms of U
of M? What would it mean for you to get to play in that city?  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody wants to take it?  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I think it means a lot, because we're not too far from
Murfreesboro. With being in Memphis, I think our fans will show great support,
which they have been doing all year. We thank them for that. We'll be thankful
just to be back in Tennessee. It's close to Chattanooga, close to Alabama for
me and Giddy, and it will be a great feeling to be back in Memphis.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. All you guys, if there was a team you played this year that you would
compare most to Minnesota, what team would it be?  
REGGIE UPSHAW: I'd say VCU. In VCU they have bigs that are kind of basically
the same as Minnesota in Mo Alie-Cox and Tillman. I'd say that's the main,
main team that I'd see the most resemblance with.  
  
GIDDY POTTS: About the same, VCU.  
  
JACOREY WILLIAMS: I agree with the physicality of the bigs and team's ran by a
great point guard, Mason. VCU has a great point guard, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll release the Middle Tennessee student-athletes.
Good luck against Minnesota.  
  
This is Middle Tennessee Head Coach, Kermit Davis. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Kermit, you talked about trying to be a national program a lot
lately. What does that mean to you, and where do you think you guys are on
that scale right now?  
COACH DAVIS: You know, it means a lot me. When you've been at a place for 15
years, Joe, and you've seen -- when I got there 15 years ago, it was kind of a
feeling of apathy a little bit. And at that time we were really trying to
chase Western Kentucky. I was trying to get our program to kind of resemble
that.  
  
So now later you can only be a national program if you can beat national
teams, and we're 7-5 against the SEC over last five years. We've won on the
road at UCLA. Obviously the big Michigan State win.  
  
In order to be a national program, you've got to have a fan base. We took a
big step in Birmingham last week with our championships game. We probably took
right around 3,000 people to Birmingham. And I think when a fan base starts to
follow your team, then you can kind of start resembling a national program.
So, I'm proud of the progress. We still got a lot of work to do, though.  
  
Q. You've obviously coached against Richard Pitino before. How well do
you know him and what do you think of the job he's done at Minnesota?  
COACH DAVIS: I've known Richard, I know his family. One time I was Louisville,
played in the tournament. Coach Pitino, probably about ten, 12 years ago, he
invited my wife and I to the Kentucky Derby, Coach Pitino and his wife. I felt
like I was hanging out with Mick Jagger for about four days at Churchill. He's
a really good coach.  
  
At FIU he played more like his dad's teams, pressing, undersize. Now he's
playing to the style that fits his players. Looks like a Big Ten team,
physical, guards are very aggressive, excellent man-to-man team. Yeah, I've
been very impressed with Richard at his age and what he's done.  
  
Q. Were there things that you learned during your time at Idaho you're
able to apply now once you've gotten this team back to consistent NCAA
Tournament appearances, even though there was that big gap?  
COACH DAVIS: When I was 28 years old and head coach at Idaho, went to back-to-
back NCAA Tournaments, won like 50 games. I guess this is pretty easy. This is
what you do every year. You find out it's precious. It's precious to get back
to the NCAA Tournament. It is nice, this three out of the last five years our
program has been there. I don't know if it's lessons. Seems like a long time
ago, you know, they were great moments to go to your first NCAA Tournament.
But I do think we can draw from lessons, especially from last year being here.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe building off that, lot of fans will be seeing your team
for the first time since the Michigan State win. If you can recount how did
you build off that win, what that meant for your program?  
COACH DAVIS: We lost three starters off that team, three good players. We had
our two leading scorers back, Giddy and Reggie. They're a year older and
better. Their leadership skills are unbelievable. You had JaCorey Williams,
who had the best redshirt year of anybody I've ever had in 34 years of college
basketball. When you can bring in a newcomer who is the MVP of your league,
any league, you know your team is going to be a lot better. You'll see two of
the most versatile forwards in college basketball. Play with two point 4's at
4 and 5. They can score at different levels and they're exciting guys to
watch. You'll see a team that hopefully plays with great edge and passion, you
know, and good defensively, and it's a good style of play. I guess last four
games we played we're averaging around 86 a game. Our team is as good in
transition in the open floor.  
  
Q. Because of that Michigan State win and because of what you guys did
this season, lot of people are picking you to win this game against Minnesota.
Do you feel like there's any extra pressure to pull off another upset?  
COACH DAVIS: Not at all. I'm sure Richard loves that. If I was Richard, I
would love to hear everybody say that. We're going to get Minnesota's very,
very best shot. You know, I think it's great for Middle Tennessee that our
national branding is getting better in college basketball. And for a whole
university and for people around the country to now notice us and start
thinking of us as a national program and picking us to win, I think that's
great for basketball and it shows how far we've come in the last 10, 12 years.  
  
Q. Coach, as we're pushing one day until your first game, how is the
mood in the locker room this time different or comparable to last year's?  
COACH DAVIS: This team is a loose team. I mean -- it's a fun team, but when
you blow the whistle, they fire out and they practice with a lot of energy and
passion. I think it's similar to last year. We were a confident group, too. We
had a great week of practice just like we have this week. You know, last year
I didn't know if our best was good enough to beat Michigan State. I thought we
would play well. But, you know, I think our team has a great confidence. We
know we're playing a really, really good team. I expect our team to play
really well tomorrow.  
  
Q. In terms of building branding, did you notice a large percentage of
high school students having some level of familiarity with the program on the
recruiting circuit over the past year?  
COACH DAVIS: It's not even close. It's amazing how one game in the tournament
run, even with all the winning that's gone on before that, but it really is.
From the five guys we signed in November, especially the 2018 class, everybody
seen you play. Everybody has seen us play and like where we are. And then when
you back it up like we do this year, probably in the early signing period, we
were able to beat better schools in recruiting than we ever have. Yeah, no
question it helped.  
  
Q. Your player mentioned VCU as a comp. Would you agree and anyone else
that you saw that gives you a good look at what you're going to see
tomorrow?  
COACH DAVIS: You know, two SEC teams but Vandy, as you know, built different
than Minnesota. Ole Miss is a physical team. But I think -- I listened to
those guys when they said it back, and they're right. Those two bigs are just
like that. They're anchored down around 15 feet from the goal. They're
physical, they can block shots.  
  
Then I think JaCorey said it best, Mason, he's one of the best point guards in
the country and he reminds me of a lot of Lewis with VCU. I think that's a
good comparison. Rebounding the ball probably, Old Dominion. A team that's
very physical at the 4 and 5.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you. Good luck against
Minnesota.  
  
COACH DAVIS: Thanks guys.

_Milwaukee, Wisconsin_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Trae Bell-Haynes, Anthony Lamb, and Cam Ward.
Questions, please.  
  
Q. Anthony, how excited are you to go up against a guy like Caleb
Swanigan?  
ANTHONY LAMB: It's a great opportunity. I'm truly looking forward it. It will
be like a NBA, playing against NBA caliber player. That test is going to be
the first I've had in my lifetime so far. I'm definitely looking forward to
it, and I'm happy to be going with my brothers.  
  
Q. Trae, if you could just speak to why you have had success on the
defensive end of the floor this season, what's the kind of style that you
play?  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: I just think we're really connected as a team on the
defensive end. Anyone coming in, communication is probably the biggest part as
a team. We know where each other are on the court at all times and we know
where we should be. So far this year, we've been rebounding well defensively
and guarding the 3-point line and stuff that kind killed us last season. I
think that's kind of why the communication is cleaning the defensive
rebounding in the lineup.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's get Cam involved. Just your thoughts about this matchup
tomorrow and how you feel the mood of the team is.  
  
CAM WARD: I think the mood is at an all-time high. We're all very excited to
play. We worked very hard to get here to just have this opportunity and
especially for me to come back to Milwaukee, home state of Wisconsin. I'm
really looking forward to it, and it's going to be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Anthony, what has allowed you to have success this year personally?  
ANTHONY LAMB: Personally it's been my teammates getting me in the right spots,
and just like putting the work in before the season is very important. But if
I didn't have teammates like Trae and everybody else attacking the basket, I
wouldn't have the open looks I have that I've seen throughout the year.  
  
Q. Cam, what has Anthony meant for you guys this year?  
CAM WARD: He's meant a lot. It's really hard to deny that. He's a really,
really big piece of our program and big piece of this team. And I mean, I
think the people don't know how good of a guy he really is. He came in, just
worked hard and just wanted to win it for more than just himself but for us.  
  
Q. Have you guys talked at all about the last time Vermont was a 13th
seed with TJ Sorrentine and things like that in the tournament? Does that come
up ever?  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: I think it comes up more from the people around us. And TJ
hit the huge shot, which is the story we've all heard and story we heard being
recruited here. But we don't really talk about it obviously. We use it as some
inspiration. If they can do it, we can do it too. We don't talk about it too
much.  
  
Q. Trae, will you think about taking a shot that far away from the
3-point line like TJ did, potentially and just in general in the game?  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: If under five seconds in the first half or maybe under five
seconds in the shot clock can't go anywhere, I'll take it. Maybe Cam or Ernie,
maybe Kurt, too, but not me, not me.  
  
Q. Anthony, I know you won't guard him, Isaac Haas, 7-foot-2, 290
pounds. I'm not sure how often you guys have seen a player like that. What
problems does he present?  
ANTHONY LAMB: Really like not having played anybody else of that caliber,
that's really the challenge, like not having any experience. I feel like
that's the biggest problem that it presents. It's going to be tough definitely
because like we have nobody to like match up the high wire to, but definitely
we're going to handle it as a group and we have things that can hopefully
handle him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Down the line, it's been such a great season, kind of just the
journey this week getting ready for coming here and what you'll do between now
and game time. Trae, first.  
  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: Probably play Call of Duty on my downtime at the hotel.
That's probably what I got.  
  
ANTHONY LAMB: Probably going to call my mom.  
  
CAM WARD: I room with Trae, so I'll be next to him playing Call of Duty,
honestly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Yes.  
  
Q. To win as many the games as you guys have won in a row this year,
what are the things you have to do to focus on to avoid getting complacent and
still work hard each week, even though the wins keep coming day after day?  
TRAE BELL-HAYNES: We avoided complacency, knowing we had set little goals and
we reached one and there was another goal right after. One of the first, like
as soon as conference play started, was steal as many games on the road as we
could. And we kind of went through the first half, beat Albany at Albany, beat
Stony Brook at Stony Brook. We have a chance to go 16-0. Try that. Clinch home
court. When we got to the playoffs, play 120 minutes of the hardest and best
basketball. Now, where we're at, we've got 40 minutes and completely new
season. We're going to go out there and try to win that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck tomorrow
night.  
  
Welcome Vermont Coach, John Becker. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to how your team is different than the one that
played Purdue last year in terms of matchups, personnel, and the way you're
playing and so on.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, we're a much better defensive team, have more depth up-
front and, you know, against Purdue last year they scored 107 and made 18 3s.
We've done a much better job of guarding the 3-point line this year. That will
be a big deal again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What's Anthony meant to you guys this year?  
COACH BECKER: Anthony Lamb has been tremendous for us. He's grown a lot. Was
Freshman of the Year in our conference, Rookie of the Year in our conference.
He's become a go-to guy down the stretch.  
  
One thing that's been very evident with Anthony, the moment is not too big for
him. He's not afraid of the moment. The biggest games of our season late in
the year he played his best. And even in the Championship game where he
struggled from the floor, he made 6 free throws down the stretch that were
huge to kind of turning that game.  
  
So he's a special player and really provides an inside-out threat for us and
really rebounds the ball well and -- but most importantly from a character
standpoint, he has that clutch gene, it seems. He's certainly not afraid of
the moment.  
  
Q. Coach, just talking to the guys in the locker room, has it hit them
yet the -- where they are, what they're doing? I know getting here a day early
might have been -- Kurt even saying that not yet, you know, maybe until
tomorrow.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. I think once they go out on the court, back there in the
locker room but certainly when they go out on the court and see the set-up
and, you know, finally feel like they've arrived -- we've been here for a
couple days, been over at Marquette and over at the Bucks facility, in and
around town, practicing and staying out of town. But now being here at the
site, you know, I think when they go out on that court and see the size of the
arena and see the NCAA logos and whatnot, it will hit them and I think the
excitement will start to build.  
  
Q. There was a story here a number of years about Will Brown at Albany
using broomsticks to try to simulate the length of a UCONN team he was
playing. Is there anything you do of that nature to try and imitate what the
guys might see?  
COACH BECKER: You know, we haven't -- we could try to score against a brick
wall, is probably the closest thing we could do to try to emulate the size of
Haas and Swanigan.  
  
No. We've played a pretty competitive non-conference game. We played these
guys last year. So our guys have played a lot of big games against bigger
teams and, you know, it will take a little bit of adjustment early in the game
to figure it out. You know, our guys are -- played against some high level
competition. So, we won't do anything typically to kind of try to get them
used to it, no.  
  
Q. Coach, talking to Cam yesterday after the practice at Marquette, he
really referred to it as a business trip even though this is his home state.
And seems like that's really been the mentality of this team, not just today
but this whole season.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. These guys have been incredibly focused all year, and
they've taken it one game at a time. And it's a cliche, but these guys have
done it and it's a huge deal. It separates champions from people who just fall
short. And they've been -- I asked them to really try to enjoy this, you know,
these few -- this event. But when we get on court or get in the film room,
we've got to get back to work and have a change of our mindset, and the guys
have done a really good job with that.  
  
And we'll have one more walk-thru tomorrow before the game, and they'll be
ready to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, your bench has played such a big role this season. Do you
expect to utilize the bench in this game or you've kind of slowed it down a
little bit over the last couple of games? How would you utilize DP or Cam
Ward?  
COACH BECKER: We've played nine, ten guys all year. As the playoffs came, I've
tightened the rotation. It was eight for the first couple playoff games and
essentially six in the Championship game. I prefer to play a bigger bench.
We'll have to see how the game goes. I do think in a game like this, our front
court depth should be something that we can use, you know, to get fresh bodies
on these guys, prevent us from getting in foul trouble.  
  
So, guys will get an opportunity to get in the game tonight, you know. The
guys that have been in the rotation the whole year will earn a right to play
in the game. It's just then on them. How they play when they get out there
will determine how many minutes they play after that.  
  
Q. Before the season started, you anticipate having as much balanced
scoring as you have throughout the year?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah, that's how we've always played since I've been head coach
is very balanced. We've never -- I think in all my years as a head coach never
had anyone average more than 13 points. I believe in sharing the ball. We
really preach defense and rebounding. And I understand in order to get guys to
play at the highest level on that end, they got to touch it once in awhile,
score it once a while, have a play run for them. I also think it makes it
harder for us to be scouted. And it's just kind of the culture of our program
is very unselfish. I have to actually ask guys to shoot more, you know,
because they'll pass up wide open shots to get their teammate a shot. At times
we're almost too unselfish, but I'd rather have that than the alternative.  
  
Q. How important has the impact of Dre Wills and Kurt Steidl been to
this team both on and off court?  
COACH BECKER: Those two guys came in together. They are, you know, from
opposite backgrounds to a large extent and -- but they're best of the friends,
and they have been a huge part of this program throughout their career and
especially this year.  
  
You know, I think Dre Wills has had a tremendous year as a senior and has been
the difference, has been the X factor last month of the season. He's played at
a high level, scoring the ball, which he never used to do, and really
defensively, he was Defensive Player of the Year this year. And since he's
gotten that recognition, his defense has even gotten better. It's given him
confidence in what he's doing.  
  
And Kurt, you know, has played more early in his career as a freshman, but he
hit two of the biggest shots in the championship game and to a degree saved
our season, you know, with some shots where we couldn't get anything to go.
And both those guys have been tremendously leaders off the court. They've been
the engine driving this thing. It's been a unique year in the sense that these
guys have been super focused and motivated, and I haven't had -- I've just
kind of been along for the ride. These guys have known what they wanted to do
to get here since last March, and they have -- with Dre and Kurt's leadership,
they have -- they've been laser focused.  
  
Q. How would Purdue potentially test your defense? You said you're a
different team. So are they.  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. I mean, you know, we want to be balanced inside and out,
you know, and it's going to be hard to score in there. We'll have to find ways
to score in the paint. That's what we do. You know, they have size, you know.
I think that is going -- hopefully doesn't make us one dimensional. We do not
want to just shoot 3s the whole game.  
  
I think we'll have our opportunities from 3, and hopefully we can make our
fair share, but we want -- we don't want to become one dimensional. And with
the team that big and strong, they potentially could make you one dimensional.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
Q. The inspiration from Josh Speidel, how has that impacted the team
over the course of the whole season, because he's been with you from the
start?  
COACH BECKER: Yeah. You know, I thought about this, and what Josh has meant to
us is hard to describe now that we're with him everyday and see him every day.
Other than it's, you know -- you're just motivated and inspired by what he's
doing on the side court everyday. He's running now and jumping and he's --
when our guys are running sprints, at the end of drills he's on the side court
trying to run with the group that's last of the drill or whatever. Our guys
will stop practice and cheer him on. It's just -- it's just -- he's touched
everybody.  
  
This has become a magical year. There's something happening with our program
this year, and I don't think it's a coincidence that Josh Speidel is here and
part of it and has something to do with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH BECKER: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Devin Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33059)

### [Justin Leon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33168)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida - 65, Virginia - 39  
  
Q. Devin, Coach White was saying yesterday that over the season you made
the biggest improvement of anyone defensively on the team. What's changed this
year and how do you think that helped you this weekend?  
DEVIN ROBINSON: My defense changed. I just wanted to play it now. My early
years, I didn't really believe in playing defense effectively. But I know if
you want to win games and try to win a championship, you have to play defense.
If I want to have playing time, I had to play defense.  
  
So I knew I had to step up my intensity, change my technique a little bit, and
just work on staying lower and just the little things and just wanting to
play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach White, if you would make a statement now and we'll return
to questions.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Obviously very happy. Great win for our program, for this team,
especially having defeated such a high-level program, a program that we have
so much respect for. We have as much respect for as a staff Virginia's program
as any program in the country for what they've accomplished since Tony's been
there.  
  
It was a terrific win. I'm really proud of these guys. It wasn't one guy
individually. It was a collective effort to hold a 23-win ACC team to under 30
percent. These guys really, really guarded to give us a chance. We made some
shots, of course. It's a big win for us.  
  
Q. To both Devin and Justin: Of course Virginia, like Coach White said,
one of the best defensive teams in the country. You guys got going early and
aggressive. What did you guys see that you wanted to pinpoint and attack them
while you guys were on offense?  
JUSTIN LEON: That's a good question. Really just us moving the ball, not being
stagnant, and like I was told to set my screens in space, and I think with us
doing that, it helped us on offense a little bit.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: I think we just had to get them uncomfortable and play our
tempo. We knew if we played at their methodical tempo, it would have been a
tough game for us. We just tried to stay aggressive on defense and get in
transition as best we can, and that turned to great offense.  
  
Q. Justin, you kind of came alive there in the last three minutes of the
first half, and it just sort of picked the entire tempo of the team up. Would
you talk about that. Devin, would you follow that up.  
JUSTIN LEON: I'm, like, known to give my teammates energy. That's kind of one
of my roles. I guess for me to -- it's really something that I'm known to do,
and I guess this wasn't really nothing new, like finding something to give my
teammates energy. I guess today it was just knocking down a couple of the
shots, but most of the time it's just me playing hard, and today it just
happened to be me, I guess, getting some threes.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: We always give Justin confidence to shoot the ball whenever
he's open. We call him "Fifty". It stands for 50 percent, if you know what I'm
saying, three-point percentage.  
  
Just kept his confidence up and we kept feeding him the hot hand. He brought
the energy on defense, so he deserved to knock down all the shots he did. He
got us going, and we kept going and fed off his energy, his passion.  
  
Q. Justin, you had a rough three or four games before this, even the
other night, especially offense. I know you're probably doing all the other
little things and everything. Did you ever have any lack of confidence in the
last couple of weeks?  
JUSTIN LEON: I don't necessarily know. I think my shot was just kind of off,
like I think I was going back -- I didn't think I had my technique. And Coach
White, he watched me shoot in practice, and he told me little things that I
could do to fix my form back.  
  
On a side note, I was trying to find something different. I was like maybe if
I took off my undershirt, I would probably start making more shots. So I did
it and hey.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, the UNC-Wilmington tape, Perrantes
totally, totally took over that game in the second half. What did you guys do
differently to make things uncomfortable for him the whole night?  
JUSTIN LEON: We just had to stay alert where he was at, do a lot of
communicating because we know he's bound to take over games. We just had to
stay locked in where he was at and just stick the course, stick the game plan.  
  
Q. Devin, second straight game with a hot start, seven points early.
Does it feel like your energy brings out the best in your teammates when you
start off with a hot hand starting the game?  
DEVIN ROBINSON: I think so. It definitely helps everybody get comfortable and
things like that. They gain confidence for getting assists, things like that.
So I think me getting an early start, it gets everybody going, and I'm not a
selfish guy. So I'm fired up, and I'm giving my teammates the ball. When we're
all sharing the ball, it's going to be a positive outcome.  
  
Q. Justin, two nights ago you weren't introduced when they were doing
the introductions.  
JUSTIN LEON: Yeah.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering if that inspired you in any way. And secondly,
your T-shirt, do you take it off for this game?  
JUSTIN LEON: I took it off for this game. But I mean, yeah, I realize I wasn't
introduced. I just went to the scorer's tables and told them a joke, and I was
like, "Where am I at?" I was just joking. It didn't really matter to me but --  
  
Q. This one's for Devin and Justin: Just a couple hours before the game,
Villanova lost. Did that hype you up knowing that you didn't have to face the
Number 1 seed if you won this one?  
MIKE WHITE: Be very careful with that.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: I watched the game, but I wasn't worrying about any other team
but trying to come out here and win the game. So I mean, it doesn't matter who
we play. Just going to play our basketball, Florida basketball basically.  
  
JUSTIN LEON: Just kind of like what Devin said. I watched the game as well,
but really I think we were all just focused on tonight's game, our own game,
and just trying to get a win for us and not really concerned about other
games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Justin and Devin, thank you very much. We'll take questions for
Coach White.  
  
Q. Mike, your level of pride in this team right now and the way they
played these last two games, especially as you documented before the other
game, "We got to have a win." At the end of the regular season and the SEC
tournament didn't end so well. Is there one or two things that caused this
turnaround real quick? Just talk about how proud you are of these guys right
now.  
MIKE WHITE: I'm really proud. I guess I'll get that out of the way. It's a
group I've been proud of all year. I mean, this group, we might miss some
shots. We might mess up some execution. We might have a lack of communication
or an error in following the scouting report from time to time or what have
you, but this group plays really hard. They play for each other. They play the
right way.  
  
I think anyone that would have watched us play tonight would recognize how
hard my guys play defensively. They're bought into it. They're about the right
stuff, whether they get 2 points or 12 points. They're going to continue to
guard.  
  
Yeah, it was very tough. Going into the postseason, we were in a tough place,
and we played really hard in those two Vandy losses, and obviously, they're an
NCAA Tournament team, and we had chances at the end of both of them.  
  
You take a hit a little bit, obviously, with your momentum, despite what Kasey
said, and your confidence to a certain extent. I thought we gained a little
bit of confidence there the way we started the other night. We played just as
hard tonight. We defended probably a little bit better, made just a couple
less mistakes defensively as we did those last couple games, those last couple
losses we had, but we made shots. Sometimes that's what it comes down to in
this game.  
  
If Devin and Justin don't step up and hit the shots that they hit, this would
have been a war until the end.  
  
Q. Mike, same question as earlier that I asked the players about
Perrantes: What did you feel like you had to do to keep him from really going
off?  
MIKE WHITE: They didn't give a couple guys credit that deserve all of the
credit, and that's Kasey Hill and Chris Chiozza. Those two guys have been a
terrific job all year utilizing their speed and quickness and toughness.
Again, those guys, you've heard me say it a lot here recently, those guys have
become tough-nosed defenders. They take pride in it now, and at times we can
even alternate them on really good players that are anywhere from, heck, 5'8"
to 6'3", 6'4", depending on the matchup.  
  
Despite their size, with their speed and quickness and toughness, it allows
them some versatility in guarding guys off of the ball. Virginia does a
terrific job with ball screens for London, but also setting a ton of screens
off of the ball for him as well. They have played that role for us all year
defending high-level guards coming off a million screens in SEC play, and
they've always stepped up to the challenge.  
  
Q. 17 points in the first half, 39 overall, 29 percent shooting, is that
as close to perfection, defensive perfection, as you can actually hope for?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, in Virginia's defense, they missed a few open ones. They
did. We got a couple bounces our way. That's part of it. They didn't make us
pay for a few mistakes that we made, but we reduced the amount of mistakes, in
my opinion, as well.  
  
Yeah, that's about as well as we've played defensively. We put a lot of it
together tonight. I'm really proud of the defensive effort, the focus, the
lock-in. Especially when we got up, I don't know, say, 16, we didn't have a
drop-off, and we've had that four or five times this year. We didn't have it
tonight.  
  
Q. Mike, can you just talk about Justin. I mean, obviously, he's been
kind of a roller coaster scoring-wise all year, but defensively, the effort's
always been there. Just what he's meant to this team and then to have a big
night like that.  
MIKE WHITE: One of my assistants -- he made a mistake during the game, Justin
did. I said, "What is he doing?" I think it was Darius said, "Coach, two years
ago he was trying to get to the Junior College National Championship. He's
trying to get to Hutch. Give him a break." Obviously, we were playing with a
lead there, and it was lighthearted.  
  
It's amazing how far the guy's come. It's amazing. He gets the double-double
and goes 3-of-6 from three. But this was his best defensive effort as well. I
can't remember one glaring mistake that he made. I can't remember him getting
straight line driven. I can't remember him missing a blockout. He was really
sound. And midseason he was being yanked in and out a little bit for -- he was
rebounding and making shots, actually, at a higher clip, but he wasn't
defending like he is right now. So tonight was his best game as a Gator.  
  
Q. Did you anticipate the length differential being substantial? Because
I think a lot of that had to do with maybe that 21-0 run when you guys got
out.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I thought we were longer at some positions, but they're
really, really long as well. I mean, Diakite, if that's how you pronounce it,
Mamadi, he's a terrific talent. He's so long. And Jack Salt, they started both
those guys who are both longer, at the four, five. And they've got some length
too at the wings.  
  
I think people can kind of get it confused. Devin makes us all look a little
bit longer. He's incredibly long, and he got his hands on a lot of
basketballs. He was terrific again tonight as he was in the first round.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Xavier - 91, Florida State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mack, we'll ask for you to make an opening statement.  
  
CHRIS MACK: I don't even know where to start. I'm so excited for the guys next
to me and the guys in the locker room. They earned it. Our team's gone through
a lot of adversity this year, and we stayed the course. We had a meeting at
the beginning of the year, and we talked about how tough of a feeling it was
in St. Louis in that locker room when we lost to Wisconsin. Instead of just
saying "attack", when we broke huddles, we wanted to talk about attacking and
finishing. Man, we finished today.  
  
I'm really proud of this group. The biggest thing for us going into this game
today was to be able to take care of the ball, not get Florida State out in
transition where they're phenomenal, and try to keep them off the glass. We've
been a pretty good rebounding team all year, but we never faced the size and
athleticism we saw today. We really passed the test in those two areas, and it
gave us a chance to win. I thought guys played really loose on offense, and
I'm really happy for these guys.  
  
Q. Tre, this was obviously the stage in the Tournament last year where
you guys went out. How much of a factor, how much were you guys thinking about
the Wisconsin game and kind of using that as a motivational tool here?  
TREVON BLUIETT: I don't really think necessarily we were thinking about last
year other than really we've just got to finish. Like we've been preaching all
year, we attack and finish. So we definitely wanted to make it out of this
round, but I don't think necessarily too many people were thinking about last
year.  
  
Q. To both Tyrique and Kaiser, you guys combined to score 27 points, 17
more than your season average. Did you see something that you could exploit
against Florida State, or did it just unfold like that tonight?  
TYRIQUE JONES: From the jump, I just wanted to be aggressive. If I could
finish around the rim, I finished. That was basically it.  
  
KAISER GATES: Yeah, I was trying to move a lot more without the ball than I
usually do. We harped a lot on that in practice, and my guys found me in open
spots, and I took my open shots.  
  
Q. For J.P., a little bit coming off of what Chris was talking about,
could you just talk about the last several weeks and maybe the last month or
so, just kind of overcoming the adversity you guys have undergone and just
kind of the Big East Tournament run and whatnot. I think you guys are 5-1 in
elimination games right now.  
J.P. MACURA: That's one of the reasons I love this team because all the way
down the line everybody's tough. Everybody loves to win and play hard, and I
think that we showed that this past month. I'm just excited for everybody in
this program that we're moving forward.  
  
We've really got to lock in the details going forward and just continue to
play hard.  
  
Q. Tre, this question is for you: Finally got off to a good start in the
first half, right? Was there a difference in your approach tonight, or was it
just a matter of seeing shots fall early?  
TREVON BLUIETT: I would say probably just a matter of seeing shots fall early.
I didn't really do anything different, just playing hard, playing to win, and
just trying to find the holes in the defense. Just kind of letting the shots
come to me and just following the game plan.  
  
Q. Question for you, Tre: Was it 21 points in the second half tonight
and then 18 on Thursday? Is there something about the second half in this
building that gets you going?  
TREVON BLUIETT: You know, I don't know. That's funny that you say that, but
the past couple of weeks, that's kind of what's been happening. You know, I
really don't know what to say to that. I just keep playing despite first half.
You got to flip to the next page and just worry about winning.  
  
Q. At one point you guys outscored their bench 21-2. For Trevon and
J.P., how important is it for those guys to come off the bench and provide you
that boost?  
J.P. MACURA: That's the great thing about this team is we've got a lot of guys
that can play, and if somebody's not stepping up, another person is.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, to piggy-back off J.P., we've got everybody on the team
that's a playmaker. They come in, and they affect the game in some type of
way. So to be able to have that type of depth coming off the bench will really
allow -- with the many players we have, is kind of critical for us.  
  
Q. For Coach Mack, what did Florida State do well? Obviously, you blew
them out tonight, but they were third in the ACC Tournament. They finished
second in the regular season. Obviously they picked up a lot of wins. What did
they do well as a team? What can you give them credit for?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't think they played very well, to be quite honest. I think
we had a lot to do with that. I think our zones affected them. Just watching
them on tape over the last couple days, what was very scary to me and our
staff and we tried to convey to our team was their ability to get out in
transition. We just felt like we had to somehow figure out a way to box them
in the half-court by not turning the ball over.  
  
We had, I don't want to say a season low, but probably one of our season lows
with nine turnovers. Not taking tough contested layups that can get blocked.
Trying to get multiple paint touches.  
  
So they didn't play their best, and I thought our guys played really loose and
together and followed the game plan. There's a belief within this team that we
can play with anybody when we play together and we're tough-minded, and we
were today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let the student-athletes go back to the locker
room.  
  
Q. Chris, you called a time-out with about 90 seconds left in the game
there. Was there any kind of special message you wanted to deliver?  
CHRIS MACK: No. I was trying to substitute our walk-ons. That's why I was
giving this signal. That's what I told the Florida State coaching staff. I
know the arena booed. I didn't mean any disrespect by it. Usually, you're
allowed to substitute. They said that was the first time out of the half
called, and I didn't realize that. It automatically becomes a TV time-out.  
  
Q. Is this the team you thought you had all along, even through the down
moments?  
CHRIS MACK: No. I mean, we should have had Myles Davis. We should have had
Edmond Sumner. We had a kid get homesick over the summer. I told them out in
the real world life is going to hand you lemons, and you can pout about it and
figure out how to make lemonade. Our guys, despite all the adversity they've
been hit with and the social media that tells them how bad they are and how
poor they are, they stayed with it, and they believed in themselves and our
coaching staff. It's a credit to them, and I'm just really proud of them.  
  
Q. Chris, I know you talked about addressing the Wisconsin game last
year with the guys. For the guys that were a part of that, do you feel like
tonight put that to bed a little bit as you move forward?  
CHRIS MACK: I hope so. I don't think they'll ever forget the finality that
comes with losing your last game in the NCAA Tournament. I've been to 17 NCAA
Tournaments as a player, assistant coach, and head coach, maybe more, and it's
a hard deal to take off that uniform for the last time or address your team
for the last time.  
  
But that was the worst locker room that I'd ever been in. We had a special
year, and it ended quite suddenly. I think our guys that were a part of that
team really remember that. I think there's some desperation we play with
because of that feeling.  
  
Q. Coach, just how pleased are you with your defense? That zone defense
held them 4-of-21 from three, and really negated their athleticism quite a
bit.  
CHRIS MACK: It's good for Florida State. It's not a panacea. It's not going to
work every time we put it out there. But I though it gave us the best shot to
win, to try to be able to take the ball and make them stand rather than cut,
get them going downhill. So it was effective for us.  
  
We still have to get better in our man defense. We still have to get better in
our zone defense. The further along you go in this tournament, the tougher
teams you play.  
  
Q. Coach, I know seeds can be misleading sometimes. This is your fourth
Sweet 16 with Xavier, as a 6, as a 10, as a 6, as an 11 seed. Can it be easier
sometimes when you have a team that can use being disrespected or
underestimated as motivation?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't think it's ever easier because you're going to play
tougher teams given their regular season outcomes. But I think having a chip-
on-your-shoulder mentality usually helps in sports and competitive situations.
So if it's working, count us as 11 seed.  
  
Q. Coach, could you have expected this? And like what did you see from
your players today that really surprised you?  
CHRIS MACK: No, I couldn't have expected it. I joke with our staff. It's the
first time I put walk-ons in the game in about three months. So, no, I
couldn't have expected it.  
  
Florida State is a terrific team. They did not play their best today. That was
one of the most complete games we played, and I thought our guys gained
confidence, especially early in the game, by not turning the ball over, which
has really plagued us, being able to handle their pressure and get some back
doors, I think gave our kids confidence.  
  
Q. Chris, even under your best-case scenario, could you imagine holding
FSU to two fast-break points for 40 minutes?  
CHRIS MACK: I felt they had more than that. I don't necessarily buy into that.
I know we turned the ball over, and they got to the free-throw line a few
times. Maybe they don't categorize them as fast-break points.  
  
We needed to put them in the half-court as much as we could. We probably did
the best job we could have given their personnel, the fact we only play seven
guys, eight guys at times. So, yeah, to do that is one of the reasons that
we're sitting up here with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Terance Mann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33246)

### [Michael Ojo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33068)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Xavier - 91, Florida State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Hamilton to make an opening statement.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I got to give Xavier a lot of credit because the things that
have been good to us all year in terms of getting deflections and steals and
forcing turnovers, they executed so well in the half-court, they didn't turn
the ball over. We missed a lot of that.  
  
We've been a very inconsistent three-point shooting team this year, and
obviously they knew that, and they packed it in, and we determined that if we
were going to win the game, we were going to have hit from the perimeter, and
they did a very good job of denying, of packing it in, and causing us to have
to take the perimeter shots. Obviously, tonight, we were 4-for-21. We didn't
shoot very well both nights here.  
  
This team has always been able to find a way to win in spite of maybe some of
our shortcomings, and today it kind of caught up with us. I thought they did a
very good job of minimizing their turnovers, being very patient executing on
the offensive end. Obviously, they shot the ball extremely well from the
perimeter. You have to give them a lot of credit for doing what they had to do
on a big stage like this to win the game.  
  
Q. This could be for both you guys: You faced zone defenses before this
year and have won games. Was this just a matter of you not making shots? Did
they do anything special with the zone that you weren't expecting?  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, we just didn't hit shots, and we weren't able to get
downhill to the basket. You know, it's hard to create energy when you're not
hitting the three ball and you see them hitting the three ball.  
  
MICHAEL OJO: Their zone defense is really good, like Coach said. They were
able to pack it in. They didn't want us to drive and get in the lane. Our guys
did a very good job driving in there sometimes and trying to make plays. We
missed some wide open shots. It's not necessarily about their zone. We had
some lapses on defense, too, as well.  
  
Q. Terrence, I'm sure on the scouting report you didn't think Xavier
would be shooting from three the way they did tonight. Did you feel like the
defense was lacking, or did you feel they hit some tough shots?  
TERANCE MANN: No, they just hit some tough threes. They were able to get in
the paint and create for each other and have standing wide open threes they
hit. I don't know what they shot, but they shot really well from three.  
  
Q. Michael, obviously, a tough loss tonight, but what can you say about
your final senior season and just the year that you guys had, going 18-0 at
home, getting 12 wins over top-50 opponents. What can you say about this
year?  
MICHAEL OJO: First, I'm thankful to God giving me this opportunity to come
back, like I said. Last year, the unfortunate thing happened, I had my injury.
I was able to come back this year and play another year.  
  
I'm thankful to FSU, to my coaching staff for giving me the opportunity to
play basketball at FSU. I'm proud of my teammates, thankful to them, too, as
well, just helping me, giving me this chance to make the Tournament, just to
experience what it feels like to play in the Tournament.  
  
Q. Terrence, obviously, last year's team was supposed to make this
tournament. They didn't. What did it mean for this year's team to get to the
round of 32 for the first time since 2012?  
TERANCE MANN: It's an amazing feeling. You grow up dreaming about this
opportunity. So it was amazing to see everyone happy when our name came up for
the first time. Everyone was thinking first time in the Tournament. So it was
a good experience.  
  
Q. Terrence, in your wildest nightmare scenario, did you ever envision
the game unfolding the way it did today?  
TERANCE MANN: No, you never envision losing before games. But they played
hard, and that's what happened.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Questions for Coach Hamilton.  
  
Q. Leonard, I know they're a difficult team to prepare for because of
all the sets they run and things like that. Did they do anything differently,
or was it difficult to prepare for them in a short amount of time?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think it's a combination of both. They are a team that
really, they've done a good job of executing the offense. They run a ton of
sets.  
  
Tonight I thought we got exposed with our big guys getting back screened and
not being prepared to get those -- the scheme that they had with cutting to
the bucket. That was something that these guys had not been exposed to all
year.  
  
But I think, more than anything else, we've always tried to minimize the
effectiveness of zone defense against us all year long, and we've always found
a way to hit just enough threes, enough perimeter shots to kind of keep people
at bay.  
  
Tonight they did a very good job of really, really clogging up the lane, which
really gave us no other opportunity other than to force some shots or to take
the perimeter shots.  
  
We had great looks. We had uncontested wide open threes that we normally shoot
the normal percentage, normal 34, 35, 36 percent, just enough to keep us at
bay, to keep people from being able to pack it in. Tonight it was one of those
nights where we just couldn't buy it in.  
  
And I thought they got energized -- they're a really good three-point shooting
team, and they got more energized, and it seemed like it kind of deflated our
kids when we didn't connect on those three-pointers.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the loss tonight, you still had obviously a very
successful season. Could you take us into your locker room. What was the
message to your team after this one?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I did. I thought we had a great season. Every team has some
weaknesses and some shortcomings and some strengths. I thought we did a very
good job all year long of playing to our strengths, getting out in transition,
getting some deflections, some steals. I thought that tonight we met a team
that really took advantage of the things that we were -- areas where we were
weak.  
  
I thought we learned a lot. I thought this team was very connected. There were
times I thought they were growing with the relationships, and I think it makes
you feel that the future is very bright for these guys that are returning.  
  
So I'm very proud of the effort that these guys gave. We had some amazing
wins. Obviously, we played extremely well at home. But I thought that there
were times where we were put in this type of stage and type of arena that some
of our inexperience showed. I thought there were some times where we were very
tentative. And I think a lot of it is because we have been a very average-at-
best perimeter-shooting team, and we've had to execute in so many other areas.
Tonight I thought it caught up with us against a team that really shot well
from the perimeter and we shot poorly. Defensively, I thought it really,
really took the starch out of our kids.  
  
But to look back at the season, to see what we've been able to accomplish, I'm
very proud of these guys and how they've hung in against some extremely good
competition.  
  
Q. Obviously, as the season goes on, the competition gets tougher, but
what happened down the stretch? You started off 18-2, finished off the last 15
games going 8-7.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought we played against some very good competition. The
ACC is a very, very competitive league. When you play people, especially the
second time around, they're very, very prepared, and they are improving as
well.  
  
I don't think it was anything negative on our team. I just think in the ACC
you have people that are capable of playing at a very high level, and we got
caught with some people playing very well. We lost to Duke. We lost on the
road. We lost to a very good Notre Dame team on the road. But I thought we
fought back and won some good games on the road. I think it's a combination of
playing against some high-level competition, and that's what happens when
you're in a league like the ACC.  
  
Q. Coach, you said that you ran into a team that took advantage of areas
where you felt your team was weak. Specifically, which area are you talking
about? Is it perimeter shooting?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Perimeter shooting. We had a very difficult time matching
their accuracy from the perimeter. Sometimes a team will shoot what they
normally shoot when they even get wide open looks. Today they shot
exceptionally well. First half they shot 70 percent. Second half, for a team,
they shot a little over 60-something percent. A lot of times people will shoot
at the level that they normally shoot on a regular basis. Today they shot
exceptionally well, and I thought we shot exceptionally poor.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, is this your biggest game disappointment as a
coach?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Not necessarily. I'm not disappointed. I'm proud of what
we've been able to accomplish. That's the nature of the game of basketball.
You're going to always have a game where you're not at our best and a team's
at their best. It's hard sometimes to overcome that. But overall, you've got
to give Xavier credit because they got into that magic level, that emotional
frame of mind you have to be in that allows you to be at that peak and play
sometimes even better than you normally do, and I thought they were able to
get themselves in that mindset tonight.  
  
I thought that our kids were not quite as sharp, and you've got to give them
credit for going out and playing the type of game that really kept us at bay.
Not turning the ball over, being patient on the offensive end, and then
knocking down the threes when they had them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Hamilton.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

### [Jack Salt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33162)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida - 65, Virginia - 39  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Bennett make an opening statement.  
  
TONY BENNETT: First, Florida played a terrific game. You saw a really good
defensive team play against a team that was really struggling offensively. But
you can see why they're good -- their quickness, their athleticism. The thing
that was frustrating is we really accomplished a lot this year. To end that
way is obviously what really stings. It really does.  
  
London's had such an amazing career. It's just part of life. I could hear the
Xavier guys. They were right next to our locker room. The way they were
celebrating after their big win. The thrill of victory, and then you get the
agony of defeat. You feel that.  
  
But that's life. We'll grow from it. Our returners have got some valuable
experiences, and we've got work to do, that's obvious.  
  
But, again, I want to tell you Florida played a heck of a defensive game, and
we were very poor offensively. They got some length behind. London and I
talked about it. That quickness up front and that length behind protecting the
rim was very challenging for us, and we didn't shoot it well when we got some
looks. That's what happens.  
  
Q. London, I mean, obviously, you had a terrific game the other night,
struggled more tonight. Could you just talk a little bit about Florida's
defense and how much what they did impacted your inability to get the kind of
production you wanted.  
LONDON PERRANTES: Obviously, the guards were quick. They got into the ball.
But I think it helps when they have, obviously, like Coach said, length in the
frontcourt. So if you get by that first guy, you're meeting some athletic,
tall guys in the paint. Obviously, when we got some open looks, we didn't hit
those either. So they kind of just packed that paint and basically dared us to
make a three. I think we made one tonight. I don't think you're going to win a
game like that.  
  
Q. Jack, today you and Mamadi start together for the first time, opened
up the game pretty well between you two and getting some production. You guys
combined for 6 of the first 8 points, 8 of the first 13. What do you think you
guys were doing well then? And then as the game kind of progressed, did their
size start to negate things in the post for you?  
JACK SALT: I thought the team had a pretty solid start, playing them well, and
then just their length and their quickness got to us a little bit. They were
just getting looks, and we weren't converting on ours.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Just to add to that, I think it was 19-17. Then at the 3:00 mark
or 3:03, I was looking at that, they went up 21-17. We weren't playing the way
we needed to, and then it just separated.  
  
Certainly, Jack and Mamadi did some good things. I thought we kind of had the
game going the way we wanted early, and then it separated.  
  
Q. London, obviously, not the way you expect to end your career, sitting
on the bench and kind of watching it transpire. What's going through your mind
in the last few minutes? Any reflections?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I don't even know what was going through my mind. It's a
bunch of emotions, obviously, just it was over. It was over for me. I couldn't
do anything else. To help extend that, help extend my season, my career. I was
just feeling like I couldn't do anything anymore. It was kind of frustrating
for me.  
  
Yeah, obviously, I've got to step back from it and look at the past four
years. I did some things that I could be proud of, but right now, obviously
it's tough.  
  
Q. London, when you know your career is ending like this, how much do
you try to get those other guys involved? It seems like you're still trying to
get those other guys involved. What does the future look like?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I knew my shot wasn't falling, but I was still going to try
to be aggressive obviously. My game is not to go out and play one-on-one. Even
though we were down 20, 25, I'm not the person to just try and go get mine to
go out on a high note. I was just trying to keep playing ball. Maybe some
shots would fall. Maybe we'll get some stops.  
  
I came in with the team. I'm going out with the team. It's not a one-man
thing.  
  
Q. London, I'm curious, with Kyle and Ty being younger guys, it seemed
like last year that loss, Malcolm's last game was very impactful for you. They
had a similar reaction to this being your last game. What do you hope that
they learn or take away specifically from kind of tonight, how tonight
feels?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Coach Bennett talked about it. They're going to have to come
back, and if they want to get to that next level, it's going to -- you've got
to take this feeling and put the fuels to the fire and get back to work during
the summer, during the off-season, so we don't -- so they don't have this
feeling again. Obviously, I don't want to have this feeling again. It's going
to add some fuel to my fire, too, moving forward.  
  
I know they'll be back. We've got some good young talent, and Coach Bennett is
a genius behind it. So they'll get back to work, and they'll be back for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: London and Jack, thank you very much. You can go back to the
locker room.  
  
Q. Tony, after their flurry at the end of the first half and the dunk,
you kind of just looked like you had a bemused face. I don't know what the
expression to call it. Kind of a weird smile on your face like you just didn't
have an answer on the way off the court. Do you remember what you were
thinking at that point?  
TONY BENNETT: I don't think I was happy. I'm not sure what I was thinking. It
was 19-17 with about 3:15 or whatever. We had missed some shots, but we were
battling, and then we struggled to score and then we had a few breakdowns. If
we're not shooting well, it's hard for us because we don't score a whole lot
in the post. They're potent. They get down the floor.  
  
I just said, all right, I was just trying to figure out at the half, is there
anything we can do? We started out going four guards, but I was just
frustrated because I thought we had played well enough to be at least
attached. I didn't think the game was over, but I just didn't like that
feeling of how we finished the last -- didn't score, I think, the last five
minutes, and then the last three minutes they went on that 10-0 run, and we
gave up too much and were fighting to hang in there. That's enough.  
  
Q. Tony, I think after one of the early season wins, you were asked
about the team, and you said you didn't know how good the team could be, but
you just wanted to play to its potential, whatever that would be. Do you
think, maybe tonight aside, this team got everything out of itself that it
maybe could have? Particularly with Isaiah out tonight.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, that affected us, of course. I told this team a few nights
ago they're one of my favorite teams. I might have to rethink -- no, I'm just
kidding. I still feel that way about them because we lost a lot. There was a
lot of expectations, but they did a lot. Take this game away -- and you can't
take it away completely, but to finish 11-7, to win 23 games, to make the
Tournament, to advance with the inexperience and to stay together. We went
through some of the losses. I admired that about them, and I'll always admire
that.  
  
Isaiah gave us everything he could and tried to play, but this team got a lot
from itself, and it's a credit to them. It's a credit to the coaching staff.
But then yet to end it this way, to just get overwhelmed like that the last
whatever minutes, just feeling a little bit outmatched was frustrating.  
  
But like I said, I challenged the guys that are returning. You've got to grow
from this.  
  
Q. I'm going to cheat with a two-part one: At 13-13, is that game
unfolding kind of exactly the way --  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I liked -- Jack battled, and Mamadi was good early. Yeah,
we were defending pretty well. We were hitting them with some screens, got a
couple easy ones at the rim, pocket passes, wraps. It was right. But there is
a reason why Florida in defensive efficiency is in the top five in the
country. They really defend. You've got to make some shots. I liked what we
were doing early, but they adjusted and did a good job. Then we had too many
breakdowns, then it was separated. Yeah, it was going the way we needed to go
to play against them.  
  
Q. You talked about not having a post presence for scoring and other
offensive limitations. Given that -- and I know you haven't done it yet --
evaluate what you and the staff were able to do. It seemed like almost game to
game you had to find other ways to do it. Was that fun? Challenging?  
TONY BENNETT: Against UNC-Wilmington, we went five guards and tried to attack
and made some plays. We tried it again, and it didn't work. We were desperate,
trying to find ways to get points on the board. At times we had to play four
guards. We had to use Devin at times. In the game against UNC-Wilmington, it
was five different guys playing.  
  
It was challenging. Fun? It was rewarding when it went well. It was always
such a fine line. You saw when things aren't going well against a team of this
caliber in this setting to get smacked like that is tough.  
  
But I told you guys on whatever day I hold this with open hands, and I have
to. I have to learn from it. I'm very fortunate. I look at this opportunity as
a blessing. To coach, to be in these settings. And I say, if you're going to
take the good, you have to take the hard and grow from it, and that's what I
will try to do.  
  
I probably made some mistakes in this game. I've got to go back to the drawing
board and figure out where we can tighten things up and be better.  
  
Q. Mamadi and Jack combined for 17 points and 16 rebounds.  
TONY BENNETT: I would have liked that on the front end, if you'd have told me
that.  
  
Q. If you'd have taken that going in?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I would have said it's not going to be a 65-39 game.  
  
Q. What did you think about Mamadi, makes the start?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, a couple times he had breakdowns, but it's a sophomore and
a freshman. They battled. You saw Jack's heart. He's a warrior. You saw
Mamadi's athleticism. Mamadi has to keep getting used to it. Darius at times
did some good things. I liked, at least for the most part, what I saw in them.
It wasn't a lack of effort on their part for sure.  
  
Q. When you are having an offensive game like this or lack of an
offensive game, what can you do in game? Is there anything you can do to get a
spark? What do you do this off-season knowing that you need that?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, for sure. We tried. We went four guards at times. Tried to
spread the floor, ball screen a little more. They're pretty good. We tried our
whole package really, basically different things, different lineups. Got some
decent shots, but, again, you go 1-of-15, and then their defense, it got a
little shook.  
  
You know, there's a gap. We've got to improve our program. They accomplished
some stuff this year, but we've got to get better, and we've got to continue
to recruit well, continue to develop players well.  
  
We have two guys that redshirted that I think in the future can help for sure,
but we've just got to keep growing for sure. Those young guys, Ty and Kyle and
Mamadi, as first years, invaluable experiences to play in the ACC and get the
amount of minutes they did and the opportunities to get in the NCAA
Tournament, ACC Tournament, that's important. Even though -- and probably it
should sting, and that will push those guys to work. But they had some great
moments, too, for being freshmen.  
  
That's part of using that and figuring out ways to try to get a little more
scoring, a little more shooting, all those things come into play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for being with us, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll just go straight to questions if that's all right
with you.  
  
Q. In studying Virginia defensively, what makes it so difficult to score
on them, and how important is discipline in offense going to be in this
matchup?  
MIKE WHITE: It's a huge key to the game, Kevin. What makes them good?
Everything. They're so sound. Year in and year out, they're in the top five in
defensive efficiency in the country, which would put them in the argument to
be the best defensive program in college basketball. They make you play
differently.  
  
We're a team that has had success in transition offense in space, in the open
floor, off of turnovers. They don't turn the ball over. And we're a team that
struggled at times in the half-court, and we're going to have to score in the
half-court.  
  
Obviously, we're going to try to score in transition. I don't know how many
opportunities will be there. They're extremely physical. They're extremely
sound and disciplined. They're a strong team. They're a quick-footed team.
They move great laterally. They've got good length. They block shots at the
rim. There's not a deficiency defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is it to limit London early and really push them
off of the three-point line, which is where the majority of their successful
offense comes from?  
MIKE WHITE: I've got so many numbers in my head in trying to study them in a
hurry here, you know, starting late last night. I don't believe they just take
a ton of threes, but they shoot a good percentage, of course, and they've got
a couple big-time shooters, of course, starting with Perrantes.  
  
Yeah, running him off the line, of course, but staying in front of him is very
difficult. I think he's as good as they got at getting to the foul line as
well. He's going to take and make big shots. It's a big challenge for us from
the tip, of course, is being locked in on an all-ACC guy, a guy who's really
versatile, a guy who can play the one or play them off the ball, run him off
screens, comes off ball screens, hits big shots for them.  
  
Q. Just sort of piggy-backing on that, Mike, what are your major
impressions of Perrantes and how dangerous he can be?  
MIKE WHITE: What's really impressive about him, really he's a microcosm of all
of them, in my opinion, both offensively and defensively, in that they're just
so sound. They just take good shots. They make good decisions. They don't
break down defensively. And it's led by a guy -- I don't know that he's their
leader, their captain, but he lets it come to him.  
  
I've watched games on TV where it seems like he's disappeared. He may have six
points with ten minutes, and all of a sudden, he finishes the game with 18 and
8 assists and 7 rebounds or whatever. He just makes big plays, plays with a
lot of confidence, with a lot of savvy.  
  
He did it last night. He made huge plays -- or yesterday afternoon -- down the
stretch, getting to the rim.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously, this is something else that's new to you, a second-
round game.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah.  
  
Q. But just the difference in first and second rounds and how everything
that happened in the first round, you kind of throw out because it's a totally
different preparation.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, no question, especially with the two different scouts that
we'll have. And also, Pat, with our unique situation, again, having come in
here in sort of a slump, having come in here having lost two straight, very,
very different feel.  
  
We were coming into the first-round game just searching for a win, period. I
feel like our guys have regained a little bit of confidence. Of course,
Virginia is an even better team. It's an even tougher scouting report. But
we're at least on a one-game winning streak.  
  
Q. Obviously, a ton made about Virginia's defense. Your defense is top
five in defensive efficiency ratings as well. What strides do you feel like
your team has made on that side of the ball that's been most impressive and
could help you tomorrow?  
MIKE WHITE: Probably the biggest improvements have been Devin Robinson. Kasey
Hill this year becomes an All-SEC defensive player, has really been consistent
all year. Chris Chiozza is an underrated defender. Arguably, our best defender
right there with Kasey. Has been sound as anyone in some of the decision and
lack of breakdowns, as we talk about with Virginia.  
  
Devin has become by far our most improved defender. Devin was a guy last year
that at times I was taking out of the game. He wasn't too happy about it at
times. And he's embraced that side of the basketball. He's become a better
rebounder, but he's become a much, much better defender and really turning
into a really good defender, utilizing his length. Really sitting down,
containing penetration, altering shots. Those are probably the biggest
factors.  
  
Q. Mike, when you were maybe even an assistant or at Louisiana Tech and
it gets this time of year and jobs open up, I wonder what your thought process
was and did you get consumed by, well, that's open, would I have a chance at
this? Did you learn anything from your dad from the other side about how to
handle that as a young coach and be able to concentrate on the moment without
getting ahead of yourself?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, sure, great question. I went through it there for, what,
three or four years. Even our first year, I was contacted a couple times just
because we were picked at the bottom of the league, and we made a great run at
the end of the year. Our freshmen made a huge jump, and we ended up playing in
the championship game.  
  
The advice my father gave me is, "Keep your nose to the grindstone, obviously.
Everything else will take care of itself. Louisiana Tech made a commitment to
you. You owe a commitment to them." And I did. It was simple. I loved our
guys, and it was about finishing as strong as possible, trying to get right
here. I tuned all of that out.  
  
But I know that's probably going on with a dozen guys in our industry right
now. There's a lot of good coaches out there, and there's always movement, of
course.  
  
Q. Going back to the quick turnaround, what was your routine from the
end of the game yesterday, and how much advanced scout did you have on UVA?
How do you implement that to the players in this short window?  
MIKE WHITE: We've played a couple here where we've had a quick turn. This time
of year, we're a little bit somewhat used to it. Of course, you wish you had a
month to prepare for Virginia, but we jumped on it quickly last night. Watched
film last night. Watched film this morning. Did a lot of talking about them.
We'll jump out there and utilize our hour and a half on the floor today, but
it's something that we've been through already.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously, the kids at the AAU level don't play a lot of
defense. How tough is it to get them to --  
MIKE WHITE: No comment.  
  
Q. \-- sort of change the culture when you come to a place like Florida,
where you not only expect defense, you demand great defense out of them?  
MIKE WHITE: I think there's a transition. There's a learning curve for all
high school kids and AAU kids. There's a lot of really good AAU coaches out
there and a lot of really good high school kids. But I'll use myself as an
example, as an 18-year-old kid going to Ole Miss, when I could score a lot in
high school and my high school coach needed me out there to score points, he
would let some things slide defensively, where in the SEC playing at Ole Miss,
I barely belonged on the floor.  
  
To compete with the Auburns and the Mississippi States of the world, you're
going to be held a lot more accountable at this level, in my opinion. Again,
there are definitely exceptions, but guys from 18 to 20, from 17 to 21,
there's a transition that's made, especially in terms of defense and
rebounding and intensity level, motor, all of those things. Skill level
sometimes translates a little bit quicker, but in those regards, it takes
time.  
  
Q. How much of Kasey's success this season can be attributed to the
team's success as well? Kind of what he's been able to do.  
MIKE WHITE: No question. Kasey has become the leader of this team. We have
other leaders as well. He's the strongest voice in the locker room. He's the
strongest voice in the apartments. He's got a strong personality. When he's
playing well, generally, we play well.  
  
He has embraced and bought in to our defensive schemes -- how important
defense is, how much we emphasize defense -- as much as anyone. Late last year
he really started defending at a high level. I called Devin the most improved
defender, but Kasey, his entire senior year, he has sold out to just becoming
a pest, utilizing his speed and quickness.  
  
I said it about Chris last night. Kasey's been a tough guy. This season he's
become really tough. Really tough. And he's hard to screen. He fights through
contact. He plays with a lot of energy. Other guys see that, and it spreads.  
  
Q. Two-part question: How late did you stay up last night checking out
videotape, what did you see from UVA? What jumped out at you? Part two, if
they come at you with a four, five-guard attack, what do you do in this chess
match? Do you stay with the bigs or go small?  
MIKE WHITE: I'm going to need a reminder here. First one is how late was I up?
I was up late. I was up late. I needed a little bit bigger of a Starbucks this
morning to get myself going.  
  
Q. 3:00 a.m.? 4:00 a.m.? How late?  
MIKE WHITE: No, not that late. We've got to be sharp today, and we've got to
be sharp tomorrow. At some point, you've got to make yourself go to sleep. I
will say this, interestingly last night -- I was just talking to Evan Washburn
about this, having not been in this opportunity before, I guess the positive
of not making the NCAA Tournament is you get to watch the NCAA Tournament.
Last night I had to turn the damn thing off. It was so frustrating. I wanted
to watch Florida Gulf Coast and Florida State and Xavier-Maryland. I had to
turn it off because I had to figure out how we're going to score 40 against
Virginia.  
  
Studied them very, very quickly, of course. We had a guy -- I think I dodged
your question earlier. Pre-scouting, circling back, we've had a guy for a
week, one of my assistants, Dusty May, watching Virginia. He kind of gets me
up to speed. We met last night, met again this morning.  
  
What jumps out? Just how sound and disciplined they are. Tony is one of the
best in the business. He's done an amazing job up there. They're just
extremely consistent. They play within themselves offensively. They're very,
very skilled. And then defensively, it's a beautiful thing. They just don't
make mistakes. They sit down in the stance and shut you out.  
  
Q. Tony says he expects a war of attrition, quote, unquote. Does that
sound right?  
MIKE WHITE: I hope so. I hope so. It's going to be smash mouth. It's going to
be, again, two good defenses.  
  
I'd like to credit our guys. Our guys have really defended well. We're a very,
very good defensive team in our own right. Hopefully, it's a game down the
stretch where we can find ways to score it against their prolific D a little
better than they can score against ours.  
  
Q. If he goes small, do you stay small?  
MIKE WHITE: It would depend how we're playing. Just flow of the game, who's
playing well. We've got a bunch of different guys. They're all a little bit
different. You just don't know. Gorjok Gak is a factor last night. Who knew?
Keith Stone hasn't had one of those games lately; he might be a one tomorrow.
You just don't know with us.  
  
Q. Mike, KeVaughn has had shooting slumps before earlier in the season.
How is he handling it now? And how much confidence do you have he'll snap out
of it?  
MIKE WHITE: A lot of confidence. We'll call his number early and often, and I
want him to let that thing fly. Again, your better scorers have got to step up
against a defense like this. KeVaughn is going to have every opportunity of
course. We're going to urge him to be aggressive. I'm sure he will be. I
thought it spoke to our depth and the different ways that we can muster up
points. I'm not sure we can do it that way against Virginia, but the fact that
he goes 1-for-11, I do like that he stayed aggressive.  
  
And he was fine last night. He's hard to rattle. He's one of those unflappable
guys. He's eating his post-game meal last night with a big grin on his face.
He was happy we won.  
  
Q. Some of us from Virginia are intrigued by the fact that Devin
Robinson's mother went to UVA. Have you known that for a while? Did you know
that?  
MIKE WHITE: It's a reminder to me. It is. I've had other thoughts in my head
here in terms of competing against those guys.  
  
Yeah, Virginia kid, and we've had other Virginia guys that have had a lot of
success in the Gator program for whatever reason. Obviously, we're really
proud to have Devin. He's one of the most improved players. Probably during
the course of this season, he's got to be in the argument for one of the most
improved players not only in our league but throughout the country.  
  
He's really playing his best basketball right now, and he's a wonderful kid as
well.  
  
Q. Chris said last night he's playing with more confidence now than he
ever has. How have you seen him come along even from the start of the season
to now?  
MIKE WHITE: Chris, I think I told you guys this maybe a couple months ago, and
I'll bring it back up because it's important. It's a great story: He comes
into my office one day on his own accord, and it was after our home Vanderbilt
loss. It was the day of that big meeting we talked about a bunch. He says,
"Coach, I haven't been myself. I haven't been playing well. I don't know
what's wrong. I'm focused on the wrong things." Again, here's a guy who's got
a pretty good argument to play more minutes, and he's had some really big
games, and he's not starting. But that's kind of been our biggest strength
this year is we've utilized our depth. I think Chris was a little bit hung up
on that early in the year.  
  
So he just made a big maturity decision, and he comes in and says, "Coach, I'm
going to do whatever I have to do just to help this team win," and naturally,
he starts playing his butt off. Since then, he's been the best version of
Chris Chiozza, and certainly we hope that continues. I expect him to have a
huge senior year and hopefully can have a really strong finish to this, his
junior season.  
  
Q. I know it's a smaller story and I know you referenced it a little bit
before. What did you think about Gorjok Gak's energized play last night?
Really getting on the boards, had a putback dunk. Was playing with a lot of
energy.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, definitely. He ran the floor. He's a guy sprinting up and
down the court after sitting on the bench for about ten games. You think he'd
be a little stiff. He was running up and down like a deer.  
  
He's a really talented guy. He's got good hands. He had a couple tough
catches. Had a couple big finishes. He was a little rattled at the foul line
naturally. He would have been rattled if it was a home game. Here he is in the
NCAA Tournament without much experience, period.  
  
Really happy for him. It was needed. You never know. He might get the same
opportunity or more tomorrow. Going to be a good player for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you and good luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

### [Jack Salt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33162)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Q. London, four years in a row you guys have made it past the first
round in the NCAA Tournament. You've been in every one of those. How hard is
it to get past that first round? I know seeding has something to do with it.
In three of those four games, you guys have been pushed.  
LONDON PERRANTES: First game, obviously, nerves come into play. We've
obviously been a higher seed in each of the four games. So obviously, that
pressure comes in those games. Obviously, the other team is pretty good,
especially last night. The UNC-Wilmington team was a really good team.  
  
It's always those first-game jitters of a big tournament like this. We got
those out of the way now.  
  
Q. A question for any of the players: What makes your team so effective
defensively in terms of your system and how you guys play?  
THE MODERATOR: Marial, let's start with you.  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: We work on it all year round. We continuously, every practice,
try to work on little things to get better defensively in each aspect. It just
shows out when we play.  
  
That's our identity. So when we're right, it's very effective.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jack, your thoughts on the defense.  
  
JACK SALT: Like Marial said, we do it every day at practice. We go over it on
film. It's just what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: London, anything to add?  
  
LONDON PERRANTES: That's it.  
  
Q. Marial, a question for you: You had a career high in points
yesterday. How do you spin that into some more success in the Tournament
tomorrow?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Just trying to stay aggressive. Also play within the team.
Really not to get too high or obviously not too low. Just try to come out
confident and just be aggressive and do what I can to provide on both ends.  
  
Q. London, you guys switched to five guards last night when you had
Isaiah out. How much do you expect to rely on that, and how might your game
plan change just with this matchup?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I don't think we'll see it tomorrow just because of their
size and their length. So, yeah, it was definitely needed for this past game,
but I don't know how much we'll see until we play another team that creates
problems like that.  
  
Obviously, Florida is a lot bigger of a team, and they play with some post
players.  
  
Q. London, one more time, you've been up here four years in a row. What
do you tell the young guys about just the experience off the court? You
mentioned first-game jitters, but having to do stuff like this, telling Jack
to scoot up to the microphone so he can talk. Just stuff like that. How much
do you talk to guys off the court about what to expect every time you go?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I don't really say much unless they ask. I kind of want them
to just learn on their own. Everybody has their own ways. I mean, some people
may not come up here. Some people may just be doing the media locker room
stuff. They kind of learn on their own.  
  
That's how I did it. Obviously, just looked at the older guys and tried to
learn from them. So I just want to let them do it. If they have any questions,
they can come to me. I'm always open for anything. So just let them do it on
their own.  
  
Q. London, Joe Harris and Malcolm used to talk about turning Virginia's
program around and re-establishing it as a major player again, and they passed
the torch to you. Can you talk about what it's meant to you to kind of be the
guy that's carried that on.  
LONDON PERRANTES: Yeah, obviously, I want the program to be successful. We had
the steppingstones when I first got here, the year before I got here. And my
first year is when we started to take off. Obviously, with me being the lone
senior, I'm trying to keep it going. And then next year with Marial and all of
them, they're going to want to keep it going as well.  
  
I think with this program there's always somebody that's going to be able to
step into that role or a couple people to step into that role to keep the
program going. I like where the program is heading for sure.  
  
Q. For London and Marial, Florida gets a lot of notice for its team
speed. What have you guys seen from Kasey Hill and Chris Chiozza? And what
kind of matchup problem does that pose for you guys?  
THE MODERATOR: Marial, can you start with that?  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: We've just got to make a conscious effort of getting back in
transition and just relying on our pack and what we do, just staying true to
what we've learned all season, what we've been taught by our coaches, and that
kind of works out against any type of offense that we really play.  
  
Just trying to play the pack and help each other out.  
  
LONDON PERRANTES: Obviously, with UNC-Wilmington they ran. Obviously, Florida
maybe a little bit faster and may not shoot the ball as quick as UNC-
Wilmington. So last night's game will definitely help us with that, but we've
got to make sure we get back because the guards are so fast at getting into
the paint.  
  
But, yeah, it's going to be all five. It's going to be a five-man effort for
sure.  
  
Q. Question for Marial: I know you've started games this year, but like
yesterday, do you thrive in that sixth-man role or at least coming off the
bench as an energy guy, a guy who is capable of doing what you did
yesterday?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Just trying to do what I can to provide a spark if we need it.
Obviously, I know I can score. So I just have to try to be aggressive and stay
as confident as possible. Just do what I can, whatever it is, by scoring or
trying to lock down somebody, just trying to do what I can to provide on both
ends.  
  
Q. Two questions, for Jack, what's challenging or difficult to handle
with Florida's size? It seems like athleticism is a big component there. And
for London, you guys are so much known for your defense, but your offense
really showed some things last night. What did you guys take away offensively
from that first-round game?  
JACK SALT: They're a big team. I need to keep them off the glass. They crash
hard. I need to do a good job on that, and just getting back in transition. So
they don't get anything easy, because they're long and they push the ball
fast. So it's going to be a good challenge.  
  
LONDON PERRANTES: Offensively throughout the season, we've been a little
streaky. I think it goes with our experience. We have some old guys and some
young guys that are really playing right now and throughout this whole season.
Experience is a huge thing with that.  
  
Obviously, last night we struggled at the beginning of the game and then kind
of got it going. It's all about confidence right now, and I think our
confidence is pretty high. We just want to keep it going for tomorrow.  
  
Q. For all three guys, your program is predicated on defense. With that
being said, do you take more pride in making somebody else take a ridiculous
shot or when you actually make one offensively? Which one stands out most to
you?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Defense, obviously, for us. Especially when we were playing
at home during the regular season, when we get a shot clock violation, like
our whole city knows that's what we pride ourselves in. JBJ just goes wild. I
think, when we can lock somebody down and make them take a crazy shot, it gets
our energy going and gets our spirits going, and I think that's when we're
playing our best ball for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jack, your thoughts on that?  
  
JACK SALT: For sure defense, getting a stop, making them take a tough shot.  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Like they said, just trying to feed off our defense and just
keep that going and try to get as much stops as possible.  
  
Q. Marial, you heard London talking before about being a senior and kind
of carrying the torch and the success of the program. He mentioned you as a
guy that could possibly take that torch as well next. Is there certain things
you've learned from London as a senior about that?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Definitely. There's things I learned from London, and obviously
the guys before them, Malcolm, A.G., and Justin, and all those guys. Just
trying to stay within the team and keep each other confident because we're all
needed. That's probably the biggest thing I've gotten from these guys.  
  
When I'm a senior, I'm just going to try to keep everyone as confident as
possible and make sure they're staying positive and ready to go when you need
them.  
  
Q. London, you've been through this before, the transition from the
first game to the second game in the Tournament, the one-day turnaround, and
you guys played five guards last night, but different team. You have to kind
of bring out whatever. Can you just talk about what that's like for you.  
LONDON PERRANTES: We actually had a stretch after our four-game losing streak
where we played North Carolina on a Monday, NC State on a Saturday. After the
game, Coach Bennett talked about us, if we can get into the Tournament and we
win our first game, obviously, we're going to play another game in a day or
two. So we're going to take this, and we're going to have a learning
experience from it.  
  
So we had the same type of practice we did today after the NC State game. So
we're just trying to do the same thing, and obviously we came out and had a
good game against North Carolina. We're just trying to do the same things to
help us for tomorrow.  
  
Q. London, you said five guards is not really an option we'll see with
Isaiah out. What do you expect might be different without him tomorrow?  
LONDON PERRANTES: We're going to use everybody for sure. Like Marial said,
having confidence in everybody on our team is huge because you never know when
you're going to get called on. Jarred didn't play at all yesterday, and he's
probably going to play a lot tomorrow. So just being ready when you're called
on is going to be huge for us tomorrow. Mamadi is going to play a lot. Jack's
going to play more. We're going to need bigs because they're pretty big.  
  
Other than that, something different, but we're used to it. We've played with
bigs all year. That five guards was something that we've never done before. I
think we'll probably go back to our traditional ball, maybe do some four
guards. But other than that, I think that's all I could say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have a question in the back on the aisle.  
  
Q. Coach, when did you realize just how good Trevon Bluiett was going to
be, and how important is he for your team down the stretch?  
CHRIS MACK: I've known Trevon since he was a freshman in high school, and he's
been a terrific player at every step of the way, whether it's high school,
whether it was AAU, whether he first stepped on the campus. I think his game
just continues to evolve. His confidence is at an all-time high.  
  
The way he played in the second half was special yesterday. So I've known it
for a while. Like most players, they continue to get better, and Trevon is no
different in that regard.  
  
Q. Chris, when you got some Dunkin' Donuts in you last night or this
morning, what was your evaluation of FSU once you got to see them in tape?  
CHRIS MACK: They're really athletic. They're really long. It's just stating
the obvious. It's amazing how Leonard Hamilton's teams play very, very hard
all the time. I was an assistant at Wake Forest years ago, and that was always
a trademark of his teams that they really battled on the defensive end. They
made catches tough. They got deflections. They tried to get you out of
whatever you were running.  
  
Yesterday was no different, and that's what we're going to have to handle on
Saturday if we expect to advance.  
  
Q. You'll play tomorrow one of the -- probably, I think, the biggest
center, the tallest center that you've played against all year.  
CHRIS MACK: I won't. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Thank you for correcting my grammar. What's your evaluation of that
matchup? Obviously, you guys will want to stick to your game plan, but does
that change anything in any way?  
CHRIS MACK: I think you have to be extremely smart when you drive the
basketball, and drives can't lead to bad decisions, whether that's blocked
shots or whether that's traveling violations because you get intimidated. We
have to do a great job of getting multiple paint touches and trying to figure
out a way to draw their center out on the floor. Whether it's Ojo or Koumadje,
both of those guys do a tremendous job of protecting the rim.  
  
We just have to be solid with our decision making. Easier said than done, and
can't get sped up.  
  
Q. Just take us through the maturation process of Quentin this year and
obviously in absence of Edmond Sumner, and the way he's handled everything
that's been thrown at him.  
CHRIS MACK: He's been force fed a whole lot. I couldn't be happier for Q. I
think there's nothing greater than actually getting playing experience and
being able to play through your mistakes as a college basketball player.  
  
At times when you're coaching, you obviously have to go with more seasoned and
experienced players, but we don't have that luxury at the point guard position
because Edmond went down. To see Q develop, he's always been a phenomenal
defender. Even when he was playing 12 minutes a game, I talked about it all
the time. Now he's playing 35 minutes a game. His effort and his intangibles,
his quickness, his toughness on the defensive end gives him a chance.  
  
Offensively, I think he's grown immensely. His assist-to-turnover ratio is
phenomenal. I know he didn't have a great night last night in terms of turned
the ball over one too many times and did it a couple times when they were sort
of unforced turnovers. But he's gotten tons better, and I think our team has
developed a confidence in Quentin that they didn't have when he first took
over. It's been really fun to watch.  
  
Q. Chris, maybe when you were with Skip, either at Xavier or Wake or
even you saw Sean go through the time of year when jobs are open and names are
mentioned and trying to figure out who's going to land where. I wonder what
you learned about that process and how hard it is to go through, and whether
the coaching fraternity kind of talks to each other about that during that
time.  
CHRIS MACK: Yeah, coaches talk all the time. In terms of coaches moving on, I
think everybody's different. I think everybody's situation is different. I'm
certainly different from Sean. I'm certainly different from Skip. Both of
those guys spent a long, long time at Xavier because Xavier was really, really
close to their heart.  
  
But I'm from Cincinnati. I went to Xavier. I'm in a little different place. I
also think Xavier is in a much different place than it was five, ten years
ago. The league that we're in, as I've said many times this year, is a
monster.  
  
How things play out for other coaches, I think coaches have learned that the
grass isn't always greener. We certainly have a great thing going at Xavier.  
  
Q. Have you seen it put a strain on guys, though?  
CHRIS MACK: The transition's never easy. I really -- I've been a part of one
transition when Coach went to Wake Forest. Xavier really, really cares about
our basketball program. They put the resources. They've made the commitment.
Well before me. It really started with Bob Stack and Bill Daily and the
administration who said, hey, we can use basketball to make our university
better. That foot on the gas pedal has never really been taken off, and it's a
great thing to be a part of.  
  
Q. How unique a challenge is Isaac? Have you faced anyone like him this
season?  
CHRIS MACK: Oh, wow. Probably not off the top of my head. I have short-term
memory. I can barely remember Maryland from the other night.  
  
The unique thing about him is he can do it in a variety of ways. He can post
up. He can certainly shoot the basketball from the perimeter. They throw lobs
to him. He's a terrific offensive rebounder. He's really, really talented. For
as good as he is now and as productive as he is now, I'm glad we don't have to
play him in four years because he's going to be even scarier.  
  
He's a challenge. The thing that makes Florida State unique and as difficult
as they are now, he's not the only guy. We've played a lot of teams over the
years where you can key in on a guy like that because maybe their other
players aren't near the talent level. That's not the case with Florida State.  
  
Q. Coach, just asked the guys about the video coordinators and their job
last night turning that FSU tape so it breaks it down in personnel and stuff.
How important is that for you and your staff to get that immediate feedback
and be able to implement that?  
CHRIS MACK: Our video coordinator, Ty Sampson, he's incredible at what he
does. Not only is he good at getting instant film, he's that type of guy, when
your computer goes out and you're offline, he can get it back. He hits control
X, Z, F1 and it's back up and running. He's special. He does a great job.  
  
I'm not that bad, though, with technology. I'm not going to sit up here like a
dinosaur and act like I don't know technology, but when things go offline, I
usually get frazzled.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much. Good luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jonathan Isaac](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32902)

### [Dwayne Bacon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30471)

### [Xavier Rathan-Mayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28477)

### [Michael Ojo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33068)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we could see any hands of anybody who would like to ask a
question. If you would please address your question to a specific player or
players.  
  
Q. Dwayne, when do you start looking at Xavier? When you wake up this
morning, is there stuff on an iPad? Are you having a film session? When does
that start, that process?  
DWAYNE BACON: It started last night after our game. We went back and had
dinner, and started to talk about them and what they are going to do in the
game.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players: So many people talk about how
talented this team is athletically, but it always comes with, "Well, you know,
they're young. They make mistakes." How do you balance that? How do you find
your game? Talented but they have droughts.  
THE MODERATOR: Xavier, let's start with you.  
  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: I don't know. I think we do a good job of negating that.
We feed off our defense. Coach Ham put in a great defensive system for us, and
that's what we kind of rely on. We try to make our defense turn into our
offense by putting pressure on people and being able to get out in transition.  
  
When we can utilize our length and athleticism, I think we're at our best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Michael, your thoughts on that?  
  
MICHAEL OJO: Like Xavier said, our coaches do a good job as well as the
leaders, guys that have been around the program for a while, to be able to
pass down the knowledge to the new guys. In different situations throughout
the course of the game we're able to help out the young guys.  
  
JONATHAN ISAAC: I would say there's a but to every team. We're athletic, but
sometimes we don't execute, and sometimes we make mistakes, just like any
other team out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Dwayne, anything else?  
  
DWAYNE BACON: I think they said it all.  
  
Q. Xavier, the video staff and support staff, all the stuff they do, how
valuable is that this time of year when it comes to preparing for an
unfamiliar team on a quick turnaround?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: Bobby and Coach Knight do an amazing job for us. By the
time we got back to the hotel last night, they already had stuff on Xavier put
into film, put into different segments for us. Like I said, they do such a
great job of preparing us in the right ways and giving us all the right
information that we need in order to be successful. Bobby's huge for us, and
we're lucky to have a guy like that.  
  
Q. Dwayne, I wonder if you could address last night's victory. There
were some turnovers, and you guys didn't shoot very well on the three-point
shot, missed some foul shots. So is there a recognition that you have to play
a better than you did last night to advance?  
DWAYNE BACON: I think last night's game is over. We've just got to come into
practice today, work on free throws, work on executing, less turnovers, and
get the game plan down for Xavier, and I think we'll be fine. We definitely
got to play better, though.  
  
Q. Maybe a follow up to Xavier: Does Xavier, their style, does it
resemble anybody you've seen in the ACC at all?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: Not too many in the ACC, but they kind of resemble a team
we played earlier in the year, and that was Illinois and how physical they
play. They like to run a lot of sets, and they're kind of methodical with the
basketball and moving it around and looking for the right shots.  
  
We've just got to do what we've been doing all year, play defense at a high
level, pressure the basketball and take them out of their sweet spots. If we
can do that, I think we can be successful tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Michael, what was it like playing in your first NCAA Tournament game?
And what was the biggest lesson you guys learned from last night that you can
channel the rest of the way through?  
MICHAEL OJO: It was awesome. I've been in college now five years, and I
haven't had an opportunity. To play my first time, it was awesome.  
  
One lesson I learned from yesterday is you can't underestimate any opponent in
this tournament. These are the best 64 teams in the country. The game is never
over till it's over. So you have to keep playing. Either you're down or you're
out.  
  
Q. Dwayne, same question for you: What is the biggest lesson you learned
last night playing in the bright lights of the NCAA Tournament?  
DWAYNE BACON: I think the biggest lesson for me is every team got here by
being the best team they could be in their league. The team we played last
night was a great team. Even though they were in a lower-level league than we
are in, we had to come out and execute just like if it was an ACC team. I
think we've just got to take no team for granted and come out and play the
same way we would play if it was an ACC team.  
  
Q. Jonathan, I know throughout the course of the year, Coach Ham and
those guys talked to you about the idea of being more assertive and more
aggressive. Do you feel like you did that last night, and were you pretty
pleased with the results?  
JONATHAN ISAAC: Yeah, I think I came out early trying to be aggressive. I just
like to play the way I play. I try not to force too much. I just let the game
come to me. And doing that, I think it helps our team win.  
  
Q. Xavier, this is for you: The chant I heard last night when Xavier was
playing Maryland is "Let's go X! Let's go X!" Is that going to have an effect
on your game tomorrow?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: I think -- no, I don't think it's going to have too much
of an effect. I don't really -- when I'm out there, I don't really hear the
crowd too much or the chants. I don't really focus on it too much.  
  
It's pretty cool that we're playing Xavier, but we've got a game to win
tomorrow, and that's all that counts.  
  
Q. Dwayne, just a minute ago, Trevon Bluiett from Xavier is one of their
guys, and I just wondered if you saw him play against Maryland and what are
your impressions of the type of player he is.  
DWAYNE BACON: I think he's a good player. I'm actually familiar with him
because we kind of have the same workout guy. So we kind of go through some of
the same stuff.  
  
I'm very familiar with him. I know he's a great player. He can shoot very
well, get to the basket. We've just got to come out and play him as if he was
a tough ACC player, which we have a lot of those, and which we think is one of
the best leagues in the country. We've just got to contain him like we would
any other player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Kasey Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26843)

### [Chris Chiozza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33167)

### [Justin Leon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33168)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have a first question lined up on our center aisle.  
  
Q. For all three guys, the turnaround, the one-day turnaround, it's like
a different world. Kasey, you've been through it. Just kind of have to throw
out everything that happened in the first game and start all over with a
different kind of team?  
KASEY HILL: Say that again.  
  
Q. It's a totally different animal the second round game.  
KASEY HILL: Yeah, it's different. Definitely a totally different animal. But
we got to get ready for practice and get ready for this team.  
  
Q. Chris, how would you just describe your first game playing in the
Tournament? Was it enjoyable, stressful? What was it like for you?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It was very enjoyable. It's a moment I've been waiting for for
a long time. Getting that first game out of the way and being able to win it
felt great, but we've got another game tomorrow. After we left last night, we
just was focused on this game coming up tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Justin, from playing in junior college, starting for an NCAA-
caliber team, round of 32. How exciting is it for you?  
JUSTIN LEON: It was pretty exciting, like you said, for me being in junior
college and then having a chance to play on a very big stage like this, it's
pretty heart warming, but like Chi said, you've just got to let all that go
and focus on the next game because now all that stuff is over.  
  
Q. Kasey, so many people wanted to define your career wins and losses,
how far you get in the Tournament. How do you define the four years you've
been at Florida, where this journey's been?  
KASEY HILL: Honestly, I'm not even thinking about that. I'm just worried about
what we've got going on right now and preparing for Virginia.  
  
Q. Question for Chris: Coach White talked about just the depth and the
number of scoring options you guys have, how different it can be one game to
the next. How much do you think that helps you when you're facing a team that
has a defensive reputation like what you'll have tomorrow?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: It gives us the ability to have all those options because they
can't focus in on one person. We can have a night where a guy off the bench
goes for 25 or one of the starters goes for 25 or something like that. That's
hard for a defense to prepare for because they can't focus in on one guy when
we have so many pieces that can contribute.  
  
Q. Kasey, if Virginia comes at you with four, possibly five guards due
to injuries on their side, how do you counter? Are you going to concentrate on
going inside to the bigs, or do you think Coach might make the adjustment of
putting more guards on the floor to equal their quickness?  
KASEY HILL: I'm not sure, honestly. I'm sure Coach White has a plan, but
whatever he has for us, we'll have to adjust and just go with that.  
  
Q. Kasey and Chris as well, Virginia will probably try to force you,
obviously, into the half-court set. What do you guys do to combat that?  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: We try to get out in transition as much as we can, and that
starts with our defense. They're a great defensive team, and they're good, an
efficient team on offense as well. So we're going to force them into tough
shots, get those rebounds, and get out in transition before they get their
half-court defense set up.  
  
KASEY HILL: Pretty much same thing he said, the guards rebound down. That can
get us out in transition a little bit easier. That's definitely something that
we've been trying to do, and the coaches have stressed to us to go down and
rebound, so we can start our break.  
  
Q. For Justin and Chris both, you guys had a Thursday, Saturday earlier
where you had one day of rest. Did you talk about it at all, or did Coach
bring it up at all about, hey, if we get in the Tournament, it's going to be
like this?  
JUSTIN LEON: No, not necessarily because we've played this type of schedule
before. So really, you can just say that we're kind of used to it. Like go
back to the hotel room after the game and just prep our legs and get ready for
practice and be prepared for the game tomorrow.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: We had this twice this year, so we didn't really focus on it at
that time about it being like this in a tournament because we wasn't trying to
think too far ahead. We were just focused on getting to the next game, and
that's how we're preparing for right now, just take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. To any of you guys, was the home-court advantage similar to what you
guys thought it would be, or was it different or unexpected?  
JUSTIN LEON: Actually, I thought -- I guess with me not having a lot of
tournament experience, I didn't think there was going to be many people out
there, just the fact we're in Orlando, but it was a lot. It was different than
what I expected it to be. I think it allowed us to build some momentum as
well.  
  
KASEY HILL: The crowd was definitely helpful. I'm glad that we didn't get
comfortable with it and expect for them to help us win the game. We went out
there, and we got it done, but they definitely helped us.  
  
CHRIS CHIOZZA: Similar to what Justin said, I wasn't really sure what to
expect. I mean, I knew we're close to home, so we're going to have fans there.
But you never know how many are going to come out and what they can
contribute. They had great energy last night and got us going and gave us a
little energy boost in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to open it up right to questions. If you'd raise
your hand with any questions, please.  
  
Q. Leonard, what did you like the most about what your kids did last
night? Overcame a little adversity. Overcame some turnovers. Didn't shoot very
well from the three-point line and free-throw shooting, but a whole lot of
good things happened. What did you like the best?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We're fairly consistent the way we've been all year. We're
not a great free-throw shooting team. Sometimes we have a tendency not to take
care of the ball. We kind of find ways to win.  
  
We would love to be a real smooth, solid, pinpoint-execution team, but that's
not the kind of how we're built. We're aggressive. We like to push the ball
down the court. We like to move the ball at times. We like to attack the
basket.  
  
I think what this team has done is we figure out ways to win. We have a lot of
holes in our game, but this team's well connected. They like each other. We
have great camaraderie and togetherness and esprit de corps. They're
connected. When we have to pull together, we find ways to do that.  
  
A lot of is because we play a lot of people. Probably if we play six or seven
kids, eight maybe, maybe we might be a little more connected. We might execute
a little better. But I think the strength of this team is in the quality of
our depth, that we keep guys fresh for long periods of time.  
  
So I was pleased with the fact we stayed true to who we are. We made two
unfortunate fouls -- no, three unfortunate fouls in critical stages of the
game, and we missed our free throws. It makes it look like we're a little
helter-skelter, but I think that's the aggressiveness we've been playing with
all year long, and sometimes it's kind of hard. The tempo goes down. I thought
Johnson got fouled when he stepped out of bounds, but you're going to have
those types of things that's going to happen.  
  
So I was just pleased we stayed focused. We stayed connected. And we did the
little things it takes to win. Obviously, as we move forward, we know we need
to hit better from the free-throw line, and I think we will. We've had games
where we've missed very few free throws. We were just a little inconsistent
with that.  
  
I was very pleased overall with our focus and effort. I thought we started the
game out playing with a tremendous amount of energy, and I had eight, nine
guys in the first two or three times down the court, they asked to come out of
the game. That's part of the nervousness and energy in the NCAA Tournament. A
guy like Koumadje, he never gets tired. When I saw him got tired, I knew we
had some challenges with the guys being excited.  
  
Q. Coach, after watching the brief amount of film that you have thus
far, what matchup do you see being the most distinct advantage your team has
over Xavier?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We don't worry necessarily about particular matchups going
against opponents because we switch a lot. Everybody be guarding all the
teams. It's our defensive system against their offensive system. Our offensive
system against their defensive system.  
  
They do a great job of executing. They get what they want every time down the
court. They have guys inside. They have big, physical, strong guys inside.
They have guys like Bluiett, who's an unbelievable go-to guy. He's been
consistent all year long with coming up with big baskets.  
  
They're just a very solid team, and that's evident in the fact they played
against a very good Maryland team that I think was No. 2 seed -- I mean,
finished No. 2 in the Big Ten. Is that correct?  
  
THE MODERATOR: I think Wisconsin was the 2 seed, but they may have tied.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: But they were the top two or three teams in the league. That
speaks for itself. I mean, that -- after the first few minutes, I thought they
did a great job. They controlled the game. They mixed the defenses up, and
that says a lot about who they are and what they're capable of doing.  
  
Q. Obviously, a quick turnaround for your team playing tomorrow, but
what experiences have you guys already had playing in the ACC Tournament
earlier this season, and even before that, playing in Brooklyn, how does that
help you?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We're not going to change very much from who we are. At this
time of year, we might tweak a little bit and make some adjustments to
individual players. Right now it's more just managing your rest, trying to be
mentally and emotionally engaged. We're not going to change very much. They're
not going to change very much. We've just got to continue doing what we're
doing.  
  
It's not like there's going to be any exceptional challenge because the way we
defend is the way we defend. The offenses that we have, we've just got to make
sure that we execute what we have in our game plan, and the team that's going
to win is the one that comes the closest to playing who they are and playing
up to their potential. That's what we're looking at.  
  
Q. Coach, last year FSU missed the Tournament for the fourth year in a
row. A lot of fans were uneasy and put you on the hot seat. Do you feel any
vindication for the year you've had and the run you're currently making?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I don't know who the fans are. No one told me. I got an
extension in my salary. You don't have any control over it. So I don't have
any idea what you're talking about.  
  
Q. Leonard, Gulf Coast was probably a lot better than your typical 14
seed. They're pretty talented. How does having that game, even though they
hung in there and hung in there, how is that going to help you going forward?
Do you feel like you got a better test than a 3 versus a 14 ordinarily would
get?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think sometimes when you win a game by a large margin,
sometimes it gives you a false sense of security. Obviously, we would love not
to be as stressed as we were the last couple of minutes through the game, but
the main thing is just winning and moving on.  
  
We have a tremendous amount of respect for Florida Gulf Coast. They do a great
job. They have really committed themselves to giving them the resources to
have an outstanding basketball program. They just started basketball not too
long ago on the Division I level. That says a lot about the administration,
the president, the athletic department, the boosters in the school and the
commitment they've made. So we have a tremendous amount of respect for what
they have done. We expected a very hard fought game. We went into it, and
that's what we got. We got a tough game.  
  
I think any time you can get the challenge of playing a tough opponent that
prepares you to move forward, I just feel very fortunate we were able to
overcome the challenge of playing against a team that was very hungry for a
victory.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

### [Quentin Goodin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32841)

### [J.P. Macura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30563)

### [Tyrique Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33171)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. This one's for Tre: After you guys got after some tape, whether that
was last night or tonight, it seems like there are great matchups up and down
the lineups for both teams. What was your evaluation of FSU after you got a
chance to watch them on tape?  
TREVON BLUIETT: They're a really good team. Really, really good team. Very
athletic. They've got a lot of size, play well together. They like to run up
and down, quick-pace type of game, and they're very physical as well.  
  
So I feel like it's going to be a physical game, and we've got to try to
contain them as best as possible.  
  
Q. This is for J.P., Tyrique, or Quentin, any of you guys: Was there a
moment in time in practice when you figured out Tre is pretty darn good?  
J.P. MACURA: Yeah, when I was a freshman and we both came in and I couldn't
guard him at all. Coach Mack got frustrated with me because he would beat me
baseline every time. I've done a little bit better job now. I can keep him in
front of me a little bit, but he's a great player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tyrique?  
  
TYRIQUE JONES: It started off, I think, a couple of practices in, I got
switched on to Tre. He hit me with a crossover. I spun around, and he made the
shot. I was like, damn, he's really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Quentin?  
  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I don't have really any personal experience guarding Tre, but
I've always known he was a great player.  
  
Q. Quentin, could you just kind of take us through the last 10, 12
games. Edmond goes down, and you've assumed a different role. How have you
been able to process that, and the confidence your teammates have given you
assuming that role?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: My teammates have a lot of confidence in me. I want to fill
some of the parts where Ed left off. I'm not the same player as Ed, but I feel
I can do some of the things that Ed could do. At this point in the Tournament,
I'm just trying to play to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. Tyrique, have you faced a team this year, probably not as tall as
Florida State, but is there anybody similar you can think of that has similar
height to Florida State that you've faced this year?  
TYRIQUE JONES: Probably Justin Patton from Creighton. You've got 7'4", 7'1",
6'10" on Florida State, so, no, not really.  
  
Q. What's the challenge of that, of just the height difference?  
TYRIQUE JONES: Just playing our style of basketball, tough, crashing the
glass. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Going back to the first question I asked, this one's for Tre: When
did you know you'd play at a high level and compete with the best in the
country?  
TREVON BLUIETT: When did I? I mean, just growing up, my dad has always kind of
instilled confidence in me. So pretty much ever since I started playing
competitively, I've always thought I could play with the best of them. It's
just all about going out and believing in yourself, having confidence in
yourself, and not being scared to show your abilities.  
  
So pretty much ever since I've been playing.  
  
Q. Quentin, in my estimation, I thought you've been effective at driving
at bigs over the last three to five games. Does the fact that Florida State is
maybe a little bit taller than teams you've seen? Certainly like DePaul comes
to mind. Does that change your approach in any way?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: Offensively, I feel like we're all going to have the same
mindset. We're going to stay aggressive, but we've got to play smarter.
They're a denying team. They stay out in their lane. So we've got to take care
of the ball better than we did the first game. So I feel like our aggression
stays the same.  
  
Q. Your video staff does a great job taping the game of Florida State
last night, breaking it down so you and Coach Mack can watch it quickly. How
big of a factor is it for you guys when you turn around to see a new opponent,
the way they break the film down for you?  
QUENTIN GOODIN: I feel like it really helps the team out a lot. Not going in
blind-sided. Not knowing what to expect really would not benefit us. So having
them break down film, have us watch personnel, I feel like it helps us out a
lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tyrique?  
  
TYRIQUE JONES: Like Q said, I think it helps us a lot. Just learn who we're
going to be facing, going up against, learn what they do best and how to guard
them and how to stop them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: J.P.?  
  
J.P. MACURA: I would have to agree with them. Our video coordinators do a
great job of breaking down the film, and if they show you their tendencies and
what they like to do and when they're put in certain situations, when they
turn the ball over or whatever, I think that really helps us as a team and a
staff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Trevon, anything to add?  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Just to piggy-back off of them, I think our video staff is
effective and efficient. They give it to us straight what we need to know --
their strengths, their weaknesses, everything we need to know to win a
basketball game. I think they do a great job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we have a question lined up in the front row.  
  
Q. Four years in a row you guys have made it out of the first game of
the NCAA Tournament. How hard is that to do? I know seeding has something to
do with it. Obviously, one seed playing a higher seed. But how hard is it to
get out of the first round, first-game jitters, those types of things, that
you have to deal with?  
TONY BENNETT: I think it's getting harder because of the parity, just how good
teams are. You look at how many close games there were yesterday. Today, I'm
not sure if there have been any yet. Even last year, it's a battle. A lot of
it is matchups.  
  
But nowadays, you just see the gap shrinking from high major, mid-major, BCS.
I think coaches are so good, there's more talented players, so I think there's
more to go around. Systems are hard to guard. I'm thankful for that, but,
yeah, you never take that for granted, and it's always a battle. Obviously,
you win a round, and it steps up even more.  
  
I'm trying to think when I was at Washington State. We actually -- well, we
played Florida our first year in the NCAA Tournament, and they smacked us. We
were kind of injured going in. But first round, any victory in the NCAA
Tournament, advancing is a great thing. You're obviously trying to continue
on. But to do it four years in a row is good for our program.  
  
Q. Tony, two questions: One, the difference between first and second
rounds. You have the one-day turnaround. You've got to change things up. You
played five guards last night. You probably aren't against their size.  
TONY BENNETT: You don't think we should?  
  
Q. Go ahead.  
TONY BENNETT: They were not very tall or anything like that. I understand.  
  
Q. There's a lot of things there. Secondly, what do you remember about
that game five years ago out in Omaha? How much has your program changed since
then?  
TONY BENNETT: We had some good players back then. We were banged up, I
remember. But Coach Donovan, Billy, I got to coach with Billy in the Under-19
World Championships when we won the gold medal. That was a treat. Preston
Greene, their strength coach, and Duke Werner, their trainer, I love those
guys. They're great guys.  
  
But that program, what Billy had established, they were very gifted and very
good. Similar to this team, veteran team, high-quality players, well coached.
It was, yeah, it was something in that game. I think it was close for a little
while and then separation occurred, and we could not hang with them.  
  
This turnaround that you ask about, I consider every experience you have is
going to teach you good or bad. Coaching in the Pac-10, that's what it was
when I was there, were almost predominantly Thursday/Saturday games when I was
there. You always had to deal with the one-day turnaround. Now in the ACC with
Big Monday, there's a lot of Saturday/Monday games.  
  
Everyone has different philosophies on how they prepare, where the team's at,
but I think it's important. We even used the NC State, North Carolina games
this year to tell the guys, "You just beat a talented team in NC State and now
you're playing a heavyweight in North Carolina. We have one day to prepare."
If you're so fortunate to get in the NCAA Tournament, and we talked about
that, and you win the first round game, you're going to play a heavyweight,
and you have one day to prepare. So let's use this. We kind of have mirrored
that of how we prepared, in getting ready for Florida.  
  
So your system's in place. You try to do as good of a job as you can scouting,
but I think it's important, and you want to be ready. Again, we've advanced
four times, and different years we've done different things. I think we have
the right formula, but obviously we'll find out as far as what kind of quality
we can bring to the table tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Tony, it's difficult enough to get kids in to Virginia with the
academics. When you throw in the fact that you're a defensive-minded program
and that's what your identity is and kids in AAU ball tend to shy away from
defense, how tough does that make the recruiting to Virginia, and how proud
does that make you that you've been able to recruit kids to fit into that
system?  
TONY BENNETT: I think it's always about fit. You always look for the right --
I remember when I got the job, talking to Debbie Ryan. We have a great
baseball coach, Brian O'Connor, Brian Boland tennis coach. I asked them, Dom
Starsia, there's legendary coaches that have been there. And they talk about
getting the right fit for Virginia. Kids that'll value and appreciate what
they're going to get academically.  
  
And I think the opportunity to play in the ACC. That's one of the reasons why
I chose to come from Washington State to Virginia, a chance to test myself and
our program against the Carolinas and Dukes. I didn't know at the time it was
going to be Syracuse, Louisville, Notre Dame -- it kind of changed, but the
league is terrific.  
  
What's helped us is we've had some success. We've gotten to the NCAA
Tournament. We, I think, have done a solid job, our staff has, of developing
guys. Guys are playing in the NBA now that maybe weren't even four- or five-
star guys. But they've developed. They've had success. They've won conference
championships, Elite Eights, Sweet 16s, and then they've gotten drafted and
are doing some good things, either overseas or in the NBA. So I think that
helps all of that with the recruiting.  
  
We are who we are. I think it's okay to make guys defend. That's going to
carry over for their professional career. I try to teach them to play the game
the right way and whatever gives us a chance to win. But if someone doesn't
think it's for them, I make no apologies for how we play. It's our way, and
guys can develop and advance.  
  
I'm really thankful for the players we have had, and hopefully we'll continue
to find the whole package.  
  
Q. Coach, just a question about Marial: He had a career-high 23 points
last night. Does it surprise you that he had a career high on a stage like
that was last night?  
TONY BENNETT: He, against Butler last year, really had a terrific game, and he
was such a key in that comeback yesterday because we went to the five guards,
and they were matching up Devontae Cacok, No. 15, against him. We needed to
first handle the ball screen defense, and then they switched, and he was
working hard. Then we got the mismatch on the offensive end. Marial is really
good off the bounce in creating his shot, whether it's midrange or slashing or
getting to the rim, and he added a couple threes. He got us to at least where
we could get connected, and he just went to work.  
  
We've seen him do that in practice, and I was so thankful because -- I said it
in the post-game after. He said to me -- because he was starting for a while,
then he didn't start, he wasn't playing -- that's hard on a young man. We'd
sit down and talk, and he read this book called Chop Wood, Carry Water. He
said to me right after the game as we were walking off, "Coach, chop wood,
carry water," which basically means stay faithful to the process. Stay
faithful to the little things. Don't get so consumed with what you're seeing
as the end result. That's a mature statement for a third year in college.  
  
That brought joy to my heart because he worked so hard on his game, and he's
had some valleys of playing time and opportunities, but to see him on that
stage do that and shine, and when we needed it. I wouldn't be sitting here
right now if he hadn't played like that, and a number of other guys, but I
loved it. Just to see the look in his eye and you know how that made him feel.
He's great family, great young man.  
  
Q. Tony, growing up in the game like you did, you know this time of year
is not just the Tournament. There's jobs that are changing and switching
around. As a coach at Washington State and seeing it from all the angles
you've seen it, what have you learned about how to handle that swirl? What
have you advised assistants that have been through it? How stressful can that
be when you're trying to focus on what your job is when people are talking
about other stuff out there?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I've seen -- my dad was obviously a coach, small college,
mid-major, Green Bay, then at Wisconsin. My sister was head coach at Indiana,
Evansville, Northern Illinois. I've seen the great side of the business. I've
seen the hard side of the business.  
  
I just try -- I would say just hold things with open hands. I really look at
this, this is all a gift. It doesn't mean it's always going to go great, but
just to look at it that way and have that kind of perspective because this is
just a short time we're doing this. Can I make a difference? Can I try to
pursue excellence with what I do? Sometimes you're the flavor of the month, I
always like to say when I was at Washington State. Things are going well, and
stuff gets spinning, who knows what's accurate and what's not?  
  
It's so not about that. It's about where you're at and loving what you do and
treating it as a gift and just having a peace about where you're at. That's
kind of how I look at the opportunity for your team to play in this, to
hopefully advance. I always tell our guys, can you handle the best that can
happen and can you handle the worst? If you can, then you're going to be okay.
There's no guarantees we're going to be successful. It might end, but it could
advance.  
  
I think, if you have that kind of perspective, it helps you enjoy it and have
joy doing it, and you're not strangling to death. But there's times that you
feel that tension.  
  
Q. Coach, your defensive system is pretty well renowned throughout the
country. What type of discipline does it take to kind of keep everyone on the
same page?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think, first of all, Florida is terrific defensively,
and the numbers bear that out. They spread out and slide, and they're good
defensively with their length. Our defense wasn't great yesterday, and there's
times it hasn't been good. When our defense is right, we can play with a lot
of people and be successful. When it's not, it's hard.  
  
But it just takes -- you know, young guys that come in struggle with it, some
older guys -- our defense is really a team-oriented system, and it's about
being more continuous than perhaps is natural for a lot of guys. You can't
make one effort, okay, then stop. You've got to be good off the ball. You have
to have stance and vision all the time. You have to learn, instead of being
reactionary, you've got to be able to anticipate. The good teams can
anticipate. And it's just this continuous battle.  
  
And it's a mindset, too, that we're going to try to outlast and impose our
will on the offense, which is challenging, and we couldn't do it yesterday for
most of the stretches. Then we got it right in a different way against
Wilmington. But that's kind of the mentality.  
  
And you work at it. I mean, we worked hard on our offense. We work hard on
skill development. But you don't just -- my father said -- I don't know who
told him, it's not what you teach, it's what you emphasize. Defense, you
always start at zero every game, and like every practice that's what we
assume. You've got to work at it.  
  
Q. Tony, I'm working on something on your relationship with London and
the assistance we're talking about, how much you trust him during a time-out.
What could we do here? What do you see? I want to know how long did that take
to get to that point and how special and unique is it, or is it something that
always comes about?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, when your point guard and lone senior is that guy, his
feel -- I've said it multiple times. I've coached some really good guys with
great feel. He's one of the best I've seen. His feel for the game, what he
sees, I love that. I remember as a player -- you know, my father and other
coaches, they're telling me something, and I'm like, no, I know what's going
on. I'm out here. I see this.  
  
I think you've got to be open to it. Sometimes a player, if it you trust and
respect what he's seeing, it can be a good idea. He made a suggestion at
halftime. We got a bucket right out of it to start the second half. He's not
right all the time, though, but his feel is so good. And he's played in so
many games against so many systems. He understands what I want, so that's
significant.  
  
Yeah, I'm fortunate to have that. I'm hoping a guy like Ty, he has some feel,
and continuing with just different guys. But you want that in your point
guard, and you want to be able to trust him. Some guys just have a natural,
innate ability to sense what's going to happen and have good suggestions. I
told him he could be a good coach someday if he so chooses. He might have to
cut his hair a little bit, but otherwise, he's got a great mind for the game.  
  
Q. Did it take a year or two --  
TONY BENNETT: Oh, yeah, you asked that. Pretty quick. He had that feel right
away. You could see that in high school when you watched him. Once he was in
our starting lineup, you're like -- when he was on the floor, just things
started happening. He was pretty quiet at first, but you know it when you see
it. It was pretty much his first year. Once he started doing it in games at a
competitive level -- some guys do it in practice, and then you see them do it
in a game, and you realize it's the real deal.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier that the mid-majors, it's really hard to tell
mid-majors from Power Five conferences now. A team that you have some
familiarity with in terms of playing, VCU in Richmond, they made seven
straight tournaments. Not a lot of teams have done that, especially mid-major.
What do you see with teams, especially like VCU because you watched them, but
like St. Mary's or Gonzaga, they continue to win?  
TONY BENNETT: I'm not sure they're mid-majors. With the talent they have and
the level they play at, they're playing high-major basketball, but it's very
good players, very good coaching, a culture's been established, and that
consistency, it's impressive. I was at Washington State, and Gonzaga was good
long before I was there, but I watched how good they were.  
  
We established some good stuff, my father did at Green Bay. That was perhaps a
little bit of a lower tier. I don't know, lower-mid. But I think you just need
a real solid system, and I think you need really good coaching to establish
that kind of consistency. VCU, the job they've done, is terrific.  
  
Q. Coach, what's the one element that you see on tape as you watch
Florida that concerns you, gives you a tingle? The speed of the backcourt, the
athleticism, the length of the frontcourt? It what's that one thing UVA must
neutralize tomorrow in order to get a "W"?  
TONY BENNETT: I think you pretty much mentioned a lot of them because they're
so quick. Their ability -- we always talk about the bookends of the game for
us on our defensive possession. Being able to make them go against a set
defense because they're terrific in transition. Jason Williford, my assistant
coach who's doing the scout, likened them to UNC in terms of how quick they
get down the floor. He said they are that caliber, and sometimes they even do
some things that might even be faster at times. That's impressive.  
  
But that and the way they can get on the offensive glass with their length.
They're versatile. I think they're really good defensively, too, as I
mentioned. We'll have to do what we always do. We're going to have to get it
to our kind of game in terms of making them play against a set defense, make
them shoot the majority of the shots contested shots. Take care of the ball.
We're going to have to move them. We're going to have to screen them, move
them, knock down some outside shots. Hopefully, there's some opportunistic
baskets for us in transition, but it's just going to kind of be a war of
attrition. I know they're going to try to get their style, and can we outlast
them? Not many secrets about this one.  
  
Mike's done a terrific job, good staff, the whole deal. And there will be
probably a few more Florida fans than Virginia fans is my guess. They'll be
there in spirit.  
  
Q. Update on Isaiah Wilkins? Is he feeling any better? What can you get
more than five minutes out of him? Do you need to get more?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's has been the heart and soul of our defense. He's
doubtful. Didn't do anything today. He's been such a key. He played when he
had strep throat or was kind of going through that, helped us get a win at NC
State. Helped us, turned around and played a huge role in the win against
North Carolina and battled.  
  
Yeah, he just -- I mentioned last time he was up here, this virus is hanging
on. He's lost some weight and just can't -- he pushed for about four or five
minutes, and that was it. He pretty much didn't have anything left and was
having some trouble. He's doubtful for the game. I'm not expecting him to
play. But you never know.  
  
Q. You recruited Devin as a point guard, and he's become much more than
that. How much flexibility does that give you as a coach to be able to kind of
mix and match with him?  
TONY BENNETT: And I didn't recruit Marial as a five man, but he played that
yesterday now, too, didn't he? Just the way the game's going with the spread
offenses and the four guards mostly. I say we're going to play traditional.
That really should mean -- traditional is probably four guards. It's not two
bigs.  
  
But he's played some four for us just because of injuries, the situation with
Isaiah. And then his ability -- I think his completeness and how he's
developed. He's strong physically, and he's really improved this year, and he
can handle the ball, and he's stepping out and shooting it some.  
  
So I just like his completeness and that versatility. That's the way the game
has gone, complete versatile perimeter players that can play multiple
positions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach. Good luck.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida - 80, ETSU - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Florida and welcome. We'll ask Coach White
to make an opening statement and then we'll open it up to questions.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Great feeling. This team's had a rough go at it the last ten days
or so. Been through a bunch. And then going back to -- at some point, I know
we'll stop talking about John Egbunu, but a couple weeks before then, you've
got the unbelievable misfortune, obviously, with John. This team, the last
three, four weeks has gone through a lot.  
  
So this was great for us to get back on the right side of the win-loss column.
I thought we had a really good week of practice. Our focus and our discipline,
especially defensively, was really good to start the second half, and I
thought that was the difference in the game for us. I thought we really locked
in.  
  
It feels great to advance in the NCAA Tournament. East Tennessee State was
terrific. They played extremely hard. They're really athletic. They had a
great year. Congrats to those guys.  
  
We've been there. My staff and I are very familiar with that level and how
hard it is to be here, and obviously they showed that they very much belong
amongst some of the best teams in the country, and they had a great year.
Congrats to them.  
  
Q. Before I ask my main question, what was cracking everybody up when
you came out for the opening tipoff? Everybody was laughing.  
THE MODERATOR: Devin, can you remember?  
  
MIKE WHITE: It's okay. You can throw me under the bus.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: So we was in the huddle, and we listened to the song by Migos,
if you guys know who Migos are.  
  
MIKE WHITE: I do now. I don't know who sang it.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: It's called Pipe It Up. Coach was like, "Come on, guys, let's
pipe it up. I love that song." We were like "What?" It was just funny. He just
got us going.  
  
Q. I was wondering, at the beginning, Mike, was that the start you had
really scripted out and really had hoped they would get out to?  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, probably the first ten minutes and the second 20 minutes. So
of the four parts of the game, the first, third, and fourth, I thought we were
pretty good. East Tennessee State got the better of us in that second quarter
of the game, if you will. They got it going with some -- Cromer hit a couple
hard shots. Boy, he's very, very talented.  
  
We had a couple of live-ball turnovers. We had a couple of late shot-clock
situations where we got a little stagnant, held the ball a little bit. Then I
thought we were in a hurry a few times a little bit too much offensively with
balls going through our hands out of bounds. But we settled in in the second
half.  
  
But I liked the start for sure, and I really liked the start of the second
half.  
  
Q. Devin, can you just talk about getting off to that fast start for you
personally, getting the steal and the dunk. Does that kind of get your
confidence going?  
DEVIN ROBINSON: Yeah, that got me going real early. My team, we were just
trying to play defense, and I just tried to beat everybody down the court.
Transition defense is one of their emphases and what they need to work on. So
I just try to run as hard and play as hard as I can, and my teammates found me
when I did.  
  
Q. Would you guys talk about the quickness difference. It just seemed
that you guys had the quickness at just about every position, particularly in
the second half when you turned it on defensively.  
DEVIN ROBINSON: Can you repeat that question for me, please?  
  
Q. Yeah, it seemed that you guys had a real quickness difference,
differential, especially in the second half defensively. Would you talk about
how you used your quickness and what the plan was with that.  
DEVIN ROBINSON: We just knew we had to play harder. We had to rev it up a
little bit. We got comfortable at the end of the first half, as Coach said,
and we just knew we had to take it to a new level. We just tried to be more
aggressive and get to every loose ball and just play our best basketball on
defense. It translated into the offense. That's what we tried to emphasize
when we get into the locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kevarrius?  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Kind of like he said, we've got to rev up our defense. Based
on the scouting report, we knew their tendencies, so it was all about
exploiting that as best we could.  
  
Q. This one is for Kevarrius: In your first possession of the game, it
looked like you got the ball stolen from you. Could you take us through what
happened then and how you turned it around and were able to take away five,
six steals from them.  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Coach explained it to me, to slow down a little bit. He could
tell I was a little bit sped up. And from there on, I just kind of settled in.  
  
Q. That's pretty unusual for a center. Do you practice that?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: It's not so much practice. I guess I was very fortunate
tonight.  
  
MIKE WHITE: He was piped up.  
  
Q. Coach, how was Devin able to have such a dominant game tonight? What
was he doing that was really working out there on the floor?  
MIKE WHITE: I thought he started the game by -- he said it already, just we've
challenged him all year, and he's challenged himself to get out in transition,
to really run. When he wants to, he runs like a deer. When he's in space, he's
got the ability to get his feet set and make jumpers, and he can really
straight-line-drive it, of course. He can take off before physicality and
explode to the rim, he usually finishes or draws fouls. He's a really talented
guy.  
  
I thought it started with transition offense, just running, just getting out
and running with urgency, and it really carried over through most of the game.  
  
I thought he hit a couple of big threes, if I'm not mistaken here. I haven't
studied the sheet yet. They were both second half, right? Maybe one mid-second
half. In transition again, and that's where we're at our best. So those were
big shots for us.  
  
Q. For the players, were you guys nervous at all first NCAA Tournament
game for both you guys? Certainly at the beginning.  
DEVIN ROBINSON: I personally wasn't that nervous. It's just another game to
me, but I don't know about Kevarrius.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I could say I was a little nervous.  
  
MIKE WHITE: I was, too.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: It's something new. We're playing for something much greater
than ourselves, playing for each other, and now it's like where it really
counts.  
  
Q. And secondly, the defense in the second half, they only had six field
goals through the first 17 minutes of the second half. Was there something
that you guys were doing differently, or were you just more committed on that
end or just better on that end through that stretch?  
DEVIN ROBINSON: We just knew if we played defense, it would help us on
offense. We know our identity as a team, and we knew we had to regroup
because, at the end of the first half, we slacked on defense. So we knew we
had to come out, first four minutes, the most important minutes in the game in
the second half, to make a difference. We just knew we had to come out there
and intensify our defense.  
  
Q. Coach White, your thoughts on Chris Chiozza's performance tonight
with the 14 points and 5 rebounds. And your thoughts on that as well, Devin,
little man getting five rebounds?  
MIKE WHITE: How many did you get, seven? I was hoping he beat you by one, so
he could talk smack to you.  
  
Chris was great. Kevarrius is right here so let me say, six steals, with his
activity, he had a monster block late in the game. They were chipping into the
lead, it was like eight or ten, and we had a live-ball turnover and he just
erased that mistake and that was huge. Kasey did a lot of good things. Canyon
Barry comes in and executes at the end of the game, getting himself open and
converting at the foul line.  
  
Chris Chiozza was terrific. I would say, in terms of the game ball, it would
probably go to Chris and both of these guys. Unbelievably active, utilized his
speed getting to a couple of loose balls which led to layups for himself. And
he just rebounds bigger than he is. Chris has always been a tough kid, and in
my opinion, in the last few months, he's really grown into becoming a really
tough kid. For whatever reason, he's embraced that. And defensively and on the
glass, again, this is a guy that six, eight weeks ago gets a triple-double.
I'm glad he's a Gator.  
  
THE MODERATOR: And I think you wanted Devin to answer that as well.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: I mean, I know what Chris is capable of every day. He has like
a 36-plus-inch vertical for a little guy, very athletic. So I knew, if we
boxed out for him, he could get any rebound he wants. Just for him to come
down and help us rebound where we're a little smaller, it just helped us win
this game. So shout out to Cheeks.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just talk a little bit about the versatility of this
team. KeVaughn doesn't have a good game. Barry didn't have a good game, yet it
didn't seem to matter.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I didn't think Canyon played poorly. The thing I like about
KeVaughn is he goes 1-for-11 instead of 1-for-4. He stayed aggressive. That's
what I ask him to do. He gets four assists, zero turnovers. He defended at
high level. Bradford, in my opinion -- Cromer gets all the headlines,
deservedly so. Cromer is a terrific player. Bradford may be their most
valuable player. And KeVaughn started on him and guarded him for a lot of the
game.  
  
I thought both those guys were good in different areas, not necessarily
scoring it. But that's kind of who we are. We've had eight different leading
scorers.  
  
And it takes a special group to be able to be successful while that happens.
KeVaughn's not hanging his head right now. KeVaughn is happy that we won.
Devin would be the same way if KeVaughn was sitting here right now.  
  
Q. Mike, first NCAA Tournament win you come off, and your brother's
sitting right there. Could you just take me through that moment.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, really cool. Before I see my brother, I hear my mom and my
wife on the other side screaming crazy stuff. I get to see my kids, who I
haven't seen all week. So it's really neat. It's cool to have my brother here
in Orlando. My parents and grandchildren will all be hanging out, but it's on
to Virginia.  
  
Q. Coach White, an anonymous coach called you guys faster than John
Wall. The fastest backcourt he's ever seen. How important is that to you guys
throughout the season? And not only that, Chiozza and Hill, how well they play
with each other when they're on the court at the same time?  
MIKE WHITE: They're really fast. Sometimes they show their speed and quickness
getting to the rim. Sometimes they show it in transition offense, drawing two
or three guys, getting other guys shot. Sometimes they just show it -- they
make defending a high-level player look easier than it should be, despite
being undersized because their foot speed is so quick. Kasey did a really good
job on Cromer at times. Chris Chiozza did a really good job on Cromer at
times.  
  
And this is the third year where they've played at least in spurts together.
It's a lucky thing to have as a coach.  
  
Q. Mike, how important is this for you? You've waited so long to get
your first NCAA Tournament to win the game and to get the program's name out
there.  
MIKE WHITE: It's great for Florida. It's great for Florida basketball. I mean,
Florida was going to get back, regardless of who's sitting right here. It's
really neat personally.  
  
My staff's all fired up. Hey, we got to the Tournament. We won a game. We're
ready to move on to the next one. I'm way more pleased for our guys,
especially our seniors, last go-round.  
  
Kasey Hill, everything he's been through, to get back to the Tournament and
then to win a game and advance and play his best basketball right now.
Schuyler Rimmer, Canyon Barry, Justin Leon was at junior college two years
ago, and he's starting with an NCAA Tournament team that's advancing.  
  
It's great to work with. I'm proud to coach these guys, and it's neat to have
at least one more game to coach him.  
  
Q. For the players, how pleasant was it at halftime after the way you
played the last eight minutes of the first half? Was he a nice guy, or was he
a little bit hot under the collar?  
THE MODERATOR: Kevarrius, you want to start with that one.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Well, I mean, any coach would probably be a little upset when
a team doesn't play to their capabilities. So he pretty much went back there
and studied the film. He showed us we weren't playing to our full potential. I
guess, after watching film, we all saw that. So we came out second half a lot
stronger.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: (Laughing) I mean, Coach obviously wasn't happy with our
performance at the end of the first half, but he didn't have to say much. We
knew what we were doing wrong. We watched film. We could see ourselves doing
the wrong things. We knew, if we kept doing those things, we weren't going to
be successful tonight.  
  
He just laid it out for us like, hey, if you all want to go home, lay it down
right now. If you all want to advance, these are things you need to do to be
successful. We listened to him, took that in, and came out with a big second
half.  
  
Q. For either player, both guys, the last four or five days, all you've
heard about is you've lost 3 of 4. You guys were a popular pick to get upset.
Everybody's picking you. How gratifying is it to come out and play like you
did, especially in the second half, and kind of silence some critics?  
DEVIN ROBINSON: It feels good. Knowing that we lost three or four games and we
were picked to be the first upset of the Tournament, that put a chip on our
shoulder, you know. We can't stop here. This is only one game. We still have
-- how many more games we got?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Five more.  
  
DEVIN ROBINSON: We still got a lot more basketball to be played. It feels good
to get this win, but we've still got to get back to watching film tonight and
be ready to play Saturday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kevarrius, any thoughts?  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Not really. You answered it all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Melo Trimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28602)

### [Damonte Dodd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30865)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Xavier - 76, Maryland - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started right away. We'll have Coach Turgeon with an
opening comment. Then please raise your hand with questions.  
  
MARK TURGEON: I thought the better team won tonight, the team that played
better. Xavier was tremendous the second half, Bluiett, got going. I think
they missed one shot in the second half, and we didn't rebound well in the
second half.  
  
We were up 46-40, and we just kind of went in a drought, and they got hot.
Give them credit. Then we got sped up a little bit towards the end.  
  
They played better. They deserved to win. Got a nice team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Can we get questions for the players.  
  
Q. For Melo, you saw a similar situation last week against Northwestern
second half with the drought. What happened tonight? Was it their defense? Was
it, again, their defense sort of -- your offense leading to defensive
mistakes?  
MELO TRIMBLE: We just didn't make any shots. I felt like we went up six, we
got to relax and they started hitting shots and running our offense really
well. We just couldn't capitalize and didn't defensive rebound very well and
wasn't executing on the offensive end.  
  
Q. I wonder if both players could address the development of the program
over the last three years, how far you think you've come from the time you got
on campus and where you think the future is headed.  
DAMONTE DODD: We really worked really hard, and as you can see, we made it to
the Tournament three straight years in a row. So the future is very bright for
the team, and like Coach just told us in the locker room, we've just got to
dedicate ourselves, and the guys that's coming back, they have to continue to
work hard and get stronger and just continue to get better. But the future is
really bright.  
  
MELO TRIMBLE: Just like Damonte said, made the Tournament three straight years
in a row. We had a really good year this year with three freshmen that really
carried the load. Next year the future is bright, like Damonte said. The guys
that's coming back just got to keep working, and the guys that's coming also
got to keep working.  
  
Since I've gotten here, we've just been winning, and I think that's a positive
note. I think the future, like I said, is bright.  
  
Q. Melo, how much was it their zone in terms of impacting the offense,
or how much of it was you guys, as you said before, settling for shots,
settling for jumpers?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Like I said, we didn't execute the way we did in the first half.
We got great open looks, just couldn't knock them down. Unfortunately, that's
been how it is all season. Like I said, we had great looks. Like I said, we
couldn't make any shots, and they were able to score on the other end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Melo and Damonte, if you want to go back to the locker room,
that's fine. We'll take questions for Coach Turgeon.  
  
Q. In terms of the drought tonight, second half, it seemed like this was
a trend for much of the past 11 games. Is this something just you can explain,
or is tonight an outlier in any way? I guess what happened, I guess,
offensively? Was it part of a bigger thing that you saw down the stretch?  
MARK TURGEON: If I had the answer, I would have fixed it. I think they got
hot, and we kind of got rushed a little bit. I think tonight at times we
struggled with the change of defense. Not necessarily the defense that they
were in, and recognizing it. So they were playing three different defenses,
and everybody's got to recognize it on the floor. That really hurt us more
than anything because we had some bad possessions because guys weren't in the
right position with that.  
  
But I thought we had plenty of good looks at times, and we had some really
good possessions, too. I think it was more the changing of defense tonight
that gave us more problems than anything.  
  
Q. Coach, certainly Justin Jackson was on his game tonight versus the
past few games. Was that an emphasis in practice to get him to shoot? It did
land tonight.  
MARK TURGEON: I mean, he's a good player. He had a tremendous year. What a
year that kid had. We worked hard, guys. I know it doesn't show on the
scoreboard, but the thing I was proud about this team is we just kept
fighting. It hadn't gone our way for about a month, really since Ceko went
down, we haven't been the same team. We kept battling.  
  
But Justin was aggressive and got the dunk early. I think that kind of got him
going. He made some jump shots, and they went zone. We found rhythm against
the zone in the first half because they played one defense most of the time,
and we found some rhythm against it, and he made some big threes. Second half,
we just didn't have as much rhythm.  
  
Q. Mark, Cowan was on the bench quite a bit tonight. What did you see in
his game tonight? And secondly, the experience those three freshmen got over
the course of the whole season, what's that going to mean going forward?  
MARK TURGEON: Anthony, what a great year he had, and he still played 25
minutes. When they went the 1-3-1, he kind of got swallowed up a bit. I was
trying to play big guards, but I didn't have a lot of depth tonight. He just
got swallowed up. It was hard for him to make plays. So that's why he was out.  
  
But when he was in, I thought he really played well. He had the big steal in
the second half and did a lot of good things for us.  
  
The experience that our freshmen had this year is amazing. What they were able
to do, I mean, really, I say it was Melo's team because it was, but these
cats, these three guys, I mean, what they had on their plate -- and we're
going to step back in about a week and be like, wow, that was incredible what
these guys just did.  
  
Right now it's hard because we didn't finish the season the way we wanted to
do, but we just didn't have it in us anymore. Maybe it was just they had to
play so many minutes and they didn't have the experience around them to help
them. But those guys were terrific. Really proud of them. They had great
years. 24 wins and playing the minutes they played was pretty special.  
  
Q. Mark, you spoke about Ceko's injury and the lack of depth, both
seemed to impact you the last month. How tough is it when you make those
changes and put them in hoping they're going to do something and they don't?
Maybe they gave you a little bit, but how hard is it to keep any kind of
momentum going when you go from Melo and Kevin to the guys coming off the
bench?  
MARK TURGEON: To get to where we were, our bench was terrific this year. They
helped us tonight. Even really helped us tonight. Jared had good minutes in
the first half. I thought Jaylen hit a big three in the first half. There was
a lot of things they helped us with.  
  
We just weren't the same team down the stretch. It wasn't for lack of effort.
We tried. We practiced hard every day. This team was committed. Loved being
around this team. Just couldn't get it done late.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

### [Sean O'Mara](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33138)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Xavier - 76, Maryland - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Quick note before we start, a career high 18 points for Sean
O'Mara. Coach Mack will make an opening statement.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Any time you can advance in the NCAA Tournament, you're really
fortunate. Played a very well-coached team in Maryland, a team that we had a
lot of respect for. Their guards present a lot of problems, and I thought our
zone, especially in the second half, for the most part, at least last eight to
ten minutes, did the job and kept them out of the lane for the most part.  
  
These two guys next to me, Sean played the best game he's ever played in a
Xavier uniform, which to save it for this stage is awesome. I'm happy for him.
Trevon played a heck of a second half in an Xavier uniform.  
  
That seems like the theme. So I talked to him a little bit after the game, and
hopefully we can get him going both halves. We're just fortunate to move on.  
  
Q. Congrats, fellas. Tre, this is obviously, Chris alluded to it, not
the first time you've had a little bit of a slow start in the first half and
come on very strong in the second half. What was your -- 1-of-8 tonight in the
first half. What was your mindset coming out for the last 20?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Honestly, I felt like the first half just kind of felt a
little sped up. Probably just kind of excited to be out there in tournament
time. My mentality never wavered. It was just, still be there for my team,
make the right plays, and once I just settled down a little bit, my team kept
instilling that confidence in me to score the ball. So I just tried to read
the defense, and it all turned out well.  
  
Q. Trevon, 7-of-8 in the second half. Was the basket getting bigger for
you every time you took a shot in the second half?  
TREVON BLUIETT: I mean, it may have looked like it, but it was just, once I
get a couple to go in, then you get a little rhythm going, and then everything
starts to fall in, and everything you shoot just feels good.  
  
Q. Sean, 18 bench points at halftime for you guys, 30 for the game. How
important is it for the reserves to step up in the absence of Tre in that
first half?  
SEAN O'MARA: It's huge. Tre alluded to just getting a rhythm, and I think I
got that in the first half, and to be able to have Kaiser come in off the
bench too and hit some threes, especially in the second and in the first. He
played a great game, too. Just having guys come in like that and help us,
especially offensively, it's awesome. It's a huge benefit we have with this
team.  
  
Q. Chris, when you guys were going down that stretch towards the end of
the season -- I think it was six in a row that you lost -- what was going on?
What did you do to get out of that and do well in the Big East Tournament and
then come here and win this game?  
CHRIS MACK: It's a shocking deal when you lose one of the best point guards in
the country. I thought our team responded well in the first two, three games
out of the shoot. Quentin played an excellent last eight minutes at St.
John's, and then we ended up beating Seton Hall, Creighton, and DePaul. And
then Tre goes down against Villanova eight minutes into the game. So our team
changed. All of a sudden, you have two of our best players out.  
  
So I don't think that we were as beat up as people think. We play in a
hellacious league. A three-game road trip was sandwiched by two of the best
teams in the country. And I'm just proud of our group for being able to stick
with each other and not necessarily worry about outsiders' expectations or
outsiders' perceptions of our so-called problems.  
  
We kept working. We kept battling. We knew we had a lot at stake when we went
up to DePaul, and we handled our business and did the same thing in the Big
East Tournament. I'm proud of these guys and happy for them they're able to
play with a little bit of freedom in the NCAA Tournament that we didn't feel
during that stretch you talked about.  
  
Q. Coach, you changed between zone and between man constantly throughout
the game. Also, you subbed in Malcolm and subbed in Kaiser going all the way
through the end. What prompted you to make so many changes tonight?  
CHRIS MACK: Just believing in my players. I also think that Maryland, they're
really good man-to-man offensively. Against man, they do a great job of
getting their guards in the lane. We're not playing 11, 12 guys. We're
generally playing 7, 8 guys. So I didn't want Quentin Goodin to be chasing
Melo Trimble all over the floor. So zone for us is fairly effective at times.  
  
I know some other teams like Iowa and Nebraska have had some success against
Maryland. So we're going to do what we think it takes to win.  
  
Q. Chris, what's the biggest change since two, three weeks ago? Is it
Quentin getting more confident? Is it Tre getting healthy? What are one or two
of the biggest changes?  
CHRIS MACK: I think those two are really big right there, Jeff. Quentin goes
from being the backup quarterback to the starting quarterback of our team. He
goes from playing 12 minutes to 35 minutes a game. When he was playing his 12
minutes, if he turned the ball over, you could pull him out, tell him what he
sees, what he should be seeing. And beside that, he had Edmond Sumner who
could sort of mentor him and tell him what he thinks Quentin needs to do and
help him with that experience. All of a sudden, he's thrown out there, and
he's got to play through his mistakes, and he's playing against really, really
good players. So that's one.  
  
I think Quentin has grown a lot. Obviously, Tre getting healthy. But everyone
on our team at times, like Sean and Kaiser did tonight, have stepped up, and
that's what our team needs.  
  
Q. For both Coach and Tre, you had 17 second-half points against Butler,
18 tonight. What gives you the composure to not press when you start out slow
and come back and have such effective second halves?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Coach harps about winning four-minute wars. We don't
necessarily try to worry about the game. We worry about the four-minute wars
in between TV time-outs. So we just stay poised and composed, and we just knew
we weren't going to get it back all at once. We just have to keep itching
away.  
  
I think the team did a good job of listening to that and going out there and
doing it.  
  
CHRIS MACK: We've had some experiences with that, Brad. I know against Butler
at Madison Square Garden, for instance, we got down nine points or whatever it
was in the second half. I told our guys, hey, listen -- we were down 11 at
Creighton with six minutes to go. This is a neutral floor. We should be fine.  
  
Like Tre said, we just have to sort of compartmentalize the game, worry about
the next four-minute war. Can we win that one? Can we come back from the next
TV time-out having won that war 5-2? As Tre said, we're not going to win it
all back at once. We hit some shots, and our guys played looser in the second
half.  
  
Q. It seemed like Melo was finding open looks and maybe not knocking a
few down in the first half. But in the end it seems like Malcolm and Q did a
good job guarding him. What's your assessment of how that went?  
CHRIS MACK: I think they did a terrific job. Just because you're in zone
doesn't mean you're not going to have personal, individual challenges. You're
going to face those all the time. Quentin got squared up a couple times with
Melo Trimble and I thought did a great job of cutting him off, putting his
chest on him and not necessarily let him get downhill and get an angle.  
  
Some of the pushes Maryland had to make, at least the last six, eight minutes,
I felt like there was a Xavier player that was making it tough and staying in
the play. That's usually the difference between missing those four- and five-
footers and making them. I thought our guards did a really good job in that.  
  
Q. For Trevon and Sean, what fueled that 14-0 run you had there about
midway for the second half, and what was the impact for you guys coming out of
that?  
SEAN O'MARA: I mean, I think, like we talked about before, we got the four-
minute wars that we're always focusing on. Obviously, we kind of went through
one of them. Just to keep our foot on the gas no matter what the score says,
just know what we're capable of and take care of the ball on offense. As long
as we get a good look every possession, I feel like we're going to have a
pretty good run. I feel like our defense is solid, as long as we're working
together and communicating. To be able to do that is just what we need to do
to win.  
  
TREVON BLUIETT: Just to piggy-back off what he said, just focusing on those
four-minute wars and just winning those each time. When we really have good
possessions on the defensive end, it translates to the offensive end. We try
to emphasize putting those together back to back, and I think we did a good
job just staying focused on the defensive end, and it just all translates
offensively.  
  
Q. Sean, with a game like this tonight, what kind of momentum does that
give you or confidence did you have going into playing Florida on Saturday?  
SEAN O'MARA: Yeah, we'll see who we're playing. I'm not really sure yet. But
confidence-wise, it's obviously nice, but in the end, I've kind of had
confidence in my teammates and confidence in my coaches, and my coaches have
had confidence in me. Just to be able see it come to light in this game,
especially how big it was, was just a great feeling, and hopefully I can keep
it rolling for our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [Denzel Ingram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30656)

### [Chris Flemmings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30654)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Virginia - 76, UNCW - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for joining us. We'd like to ask you to make
an opening statement.  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: First, I'd like to congratulate University of Virginia for
winning a hard-fought game. I thought it was a well-played basketball game.
When you look at the first half, I thought it was an even half. I thought we
did a great job in the first ten minutes of the half, and then Virginia did a
great job closing the half off. I thought we had everything the way we wanted
to. Obviously, when you talk about tempo, we wanted those guys to play a
little faster than they normally do, and I thought we did.  
  
I think the difference in the game is they made a couple plays towards the
end, and we missed a few chippies. Certainly, obviously, you get the result.  
  
But my team, I'm so proud of these guys. When you think about what we've
accomplished this year, winning 29 games, winning the regular season, winning
our tournament championship, and certainly playing well enough to win the
game. Though we're disappointed, when we walk out of here, we're going to walk
out of here with our heads high because the effort these guys have given me
all year has been unbelievable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you have a question, please raise your hand.  
  
Q. Kevin, just for your team to let them back in in the first half but
then to stay in the second half a lot longer than that Duke game went last
year, how much progress do you see in these two openers the last two years and
what you showed down the stretch today?  
KEVIN KEATTS: I don't think either game has to do with one another. Obviously,
basketball is game of runs, and I thought we made a great run early in the
first half, and I thought they did a great job answering the game. Our guys
expected to win the game. They played well in the second half, so did we. I
think you take a couple free throws out of it, take a couple chippy plays --
Perrantes goes up, and we've got a good stop going on, and he scoops it up and
makes the layup. I think two or three of those freaky plays, and we might be
in another situation.  
  
Q. Did you have a specific game plan to counter the Virginia defense?
And do you feel you did a good job of speeding them up and making them play
your tempo?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I did. When you think about Virginia -- and I watched
every single ACC game. Only 20 teams were able to score -- most teams scored
under 60 points. They held 20 teams to 60 and under. I thought we did a great
job. I thought we made those guys adjust to us. Obviously, they had to go
small. But you don't shoot 41 percent against a Virginia defense.  
  
I thought we did well. I thought our offensive game plan was great. I thought
these guys made some shots. It was a great college basketball game, that I
thought Virginia made a few more plays than us.  
  
Q. Chris, you had some major sequences down the stretch last five, six
minutes during the game, where you kind of took over on offense and defense.
What was your mindset as you guys tried to close the gap with you just taking
the brunt of the offense?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: Just continuing to play hard, stay aggressive, and attack,
and giving us a chance to win.  
  
Q. Virginia, obviously, they went to five guards at some point in the
game. When they did that, did you sort of feel like you guys had them where
you wanted?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I did, and I felt -- even though they were scoring against
us, I knew tempo was what we were looking for. Obviously, when you play
against a Virginia defensive team -- Tony Bennett does a tremendous job --
you've got to make them play a little fast. We had everything that we wanted
in the game today tempo-wise because they even took some quick shots that they
normally don't take.  
  
So I thought when they went small, even though they made some shots, it played
into our favor a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, with C.J. struggling, was there anything that was keeping him
off his game? How nice was it to see Ambrose step up with C.J. not having his
normal game?  
KEVIN KEATTS: I thought Ambrose was great. If you look at it, he was 5-for-5,
4-for-4 from three. C.J. had a tough game. Sometimes that happens. Give these
other guys credit. I thought they stepped up in his absence.  
  
You know, once again, what a great game. Very disappointed that we didn't win
the game, but got to be happy with these guys. I mean, you talk about these
two seniors here, they came to the program when it wasn't popular, when I
first took the job, and we hadn't won anything. Having to sit out a year -- I
told them on the way over here, walking over here, I'm so proud of them. I
love them because they've single handedly helped turn this program around, and
we're a championship program now.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys won the rebounding battle 40-33 against an ACC
school. How happy are you with your team's effort on the glass?  
KEVIN KEATTS: I thought our effort's been great. You know, just tonight, you
look at it -- obviously, we look at the 40 rebounds, but I'm more impressed, I
thought we got 14 offensive out of those.  
  
These guys have played so hard the entire year for me. You think about it. I
know I keep saying this, you don't accidentally win 29 games. On any given
night, I feel like these guys will give us a chance to win the game.  
  
I was happy. I thought our effort -- I thought we played as hard as we could
play.  
  
Q. Question for Denzel: You guys came out, and I think you and Ambrose
hit eight of your nine first threes. Just speak to the confidence you guys had
to shoot against this defense the way you did.  
DENZEL INGRAM: We just wanted to step up and hit shots. Came out with energy.
It's a big game. Just got to lock in and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Denzel, you spent a lot of the night matched up with Perrantes. What
was it like going up against him? I know you guys rotated off him a little
bit. What was it like going up against him and battling a guy who was having
that kind of a night?  
DENZEL INGRAM: It was a good game. It was fun. We made some plays, and we
tried to make plays and get stops, and that was it.  
  
Q. Question for Coach: First of all, congratulations on a great season
to you and your guys. A lot of talk about them going to five guards, and you
have a guy like Marial Shayok who ends up putting up a career high in points.
When a guy like that has a game like that against you, does it make it even
tougher to beat the team as a whole?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I thought he was great. When you look at him and look at
the score, I thought we did a great job on Guy. I thought Shayok, if you look
at it, he made some shots, made some threes, and he was able to drive us a
little bit. I thought he was great.  
  
That being said, I thought it was still the way we wanted it to be. We were
able to take all of their big guys out of the game, and that's why we
rebounded the ball so well. But I think they made some perimeter shots that
kind of hurt us.  
  
Q. This is for Denzel: I know you only had one turnover today, but that
one turnover with 15 seconds left, was that a situation where you're trying to
do too much and you turned the ball over? Is that just how Virginia was
playing that possession?  
DENZEL INGRAM: It was just miscommunication. I thought he was going to get out
quicker, and that's just what it was.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Keatts, Chris and Denzel, congratulations on a wonderful
season. Good luck to you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Jonathan Isaac](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32902)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida State - 86, Florida Gulf Coast - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's late. We'll try to be quick. An opening comment from Coach
Hamilton and then right to questions.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought both teams played very hard. I thought we both
kind of got after each other with a lot of effort. We had a little run there
where we had about five or six stops in a row, and we were able to get some
separation. We're very fortunate to hang on for the victory.  
  
Q. Leonard, a game like this where it's kind of back and forth and
you're up and they get close, what do you tell your team about keeping
composure and not letting this moment get to them?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Obviously, when we hit our free throws, we don't have an
issue. We didn't shoot free throws very well down the stretch, and if you
don't knock those free throws down, you can put yourself in a position where
this stuff can happen. It makes everything look bad.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like obviously you've got a team full of guys who
have never really been on this stage before. Every time they mounted some sort
of run to make it closer, either Isaac or Bacon, all of those guys seemed to
have an answer. What does it tell you about those players that they're
comfortable doing that in the NCAA Tournament?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We had a lot of anxious moments. I thought at the beginning
of the game everybody had that kind of nervous exhaustion, so to speak.
Everybody went in the game. After two or three possessions down the court, it
was like they were stepping in mud. That's part of being in this stage.
Hopefully, we'll be a little more relaxed as we move on in this game.  
  
Q. Jonathan, can you talk about the athleticism that your team has. This
is Dunk City, but you guys were 9-2 in that department tonight. It seems like
you guys had a little too much athleticism for them.  
JONATHAN ISAAC: They're Dunk City, but I think our team leads the nation in
dunks. That's what we do. We're long and athletic, and we dunk the ball, too.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. Obviously, it's very, very soon after your
victory, but I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the Xavier matchup. Do
you have any familiarity with the team?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think you have to give me at least a little time to go
back and evaluate that.  
  
Q. Fair enough.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Thank you very much.  
  
Q. Jonathan, this is for you: I mean, do you always warm up with dunks?
I mean, you seemed to have a lot of dunks warming up tonight. Was there a
message there?  
JONATHAN ISAAC: You mean in the warmup?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
JONATHAN ISAAC: No, that's just how we all warm up, try to get our legs ready
to go.  
  
Q. Leonard, Dwayne made some big shots for you there late in the first
half to kind of right the ship. How big was that for you guys to get those
baskets from Dwayne?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, it's obviously that he's been our go-to guy all year.
They mixed their defenses up, man-to-man and zone. Our players were
aggressively trying to get him the ball in areas where we thought that he
could give us some offensive productivity.  
  
He was very anxious. I thought he was very efficient the first half. He was
under control. He made good decisions with the ball, and we're going to need
more of that for him as we move through the remainder of the Tournament.  
  
Q. Leonard, as far as Dwayne's concerned, keeping with Dwayne, he came
in tonight averaging 19 points in his last four games; tonight he gets 25.
What is it you've seen out of him lately where he's been more aggressive and
taking those shots and carrying the team at times?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think we're a little more efficient as a team. We're not
quite there yet, even this late in the season. We have not been as efficient
through the whole year as I'd like to. We have a lot of young guys that I
thought when we went in the game the first half, I thought we had a tremendous
amount of energy, but I didn't think we executed very well.  
  
I think our veterans, the guys that have been playing the most together, they
recognize now how to get the ball in to Jonathan, and we're making better
decisions in terms of finding the sweet spots where we can score.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the growth of Jonathan from day one until this very
moment right now.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, Jonathan came into our program with tremendous high
basketball IQ, and he values all the intangible things that sometimes it takes
years to develop. He makes good decisions with the ball. He doesn't force
anything. He loves playing defense. He's a good rebounder, and he doesn't
force any shots. So those things he brought to the table. I'd like to take
credit for teaching him some of that, but he has an instinctive feel for the
game I think's very good.  
  
We've allowed him to be who he is and allowed him to grow within the abilities
he has, and I still think his best basketball is ahead of him.  
  
Q. Jonathan, you were talking about earlier in the season how you wanted
this team to be the culture change of FSU. First victory in the NCAA
Tournament since 2012. Do you feel like this is the first step in that Florida
State culture change?  
JONATHAN ISAAC: I think we took that first step a long time ago. When we first
got together, we talked about changing the culture and changing what Florida
State is about. This is just the back end of what we've done, getting to the
Tournament and being able to win a game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach and Jonathan, thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Steve Forbes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33055)

### [A.J. Merriweather](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33053)

### [T.J. Cromer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33052)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida - 80, ETSU - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Forbes to make an opening statement, and then
we'll open it up for questions.  
  
STEVE FORBES: Congrats to Florida. I thought we played an outstanding game.
They turned us over, and I was really worried about that going into the game,
live-ball turnovers. They turned a lot of those into points, and that's really
hard to defend.  
  
I thought their length and athleticism gave us problems pretty much the entire
game. They hurt us on the offensive glass, and those are big things.  
  
Then we just got beat badly at the free-throw line. I think they're like 24-0
when they shoot 27 free throws, and they shot 27. My hat's off to them. They
played a really, really well-played game.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. To get here, they battled all year long. It's a
testament to these guys up here, how hard they've battled. We battled really
hard in that game.  
  
Going into halftime, I felt good because we were only down one, and I don't
think we played great. Came out in the second half, ran a play, T.J. banged a
three, we took the lead, and I felt like we were in good shape. But to their
credit, they answered the bell, and they made some big threes. They didn't
make a three in the first half and made seven in the second. That was the big
separator, the threes and the free throws.  
  
But we're proud of what we've accomplished, 27 wins this year. Nothing to hang
our head about.  
  
Q. What did they do different after you guys finally got the lead and
they made a bunch of threes in a row? Was it just a difference of them going
in?  
STEVE FORBES: Yeah, they got out in transition. They got some really good
looks at it. I thought we did a great job guarding them in the half-court,
especially when we settled down. They started out the game 7-for-8, and then
they were like 5-of-24 or something like that to end the half. Their threes,
really, a lot of those came in transition.  
  
Q. When you talk about the difference at the free-throw line, whose
fault was that? Is that your fault for not getting there?  
STEVE FORBES: Well, I think we were trying. We were driving the ball. You
know, they did a good job, obviously, of not fouling us. We didn't do a great
job of that. That's always an issue. Especially in big games, you've got to
get to the free-throw line. I felt like they did a really good job of getting
there.  
  
Then we got to the basket a lot of times, and they blocked shots in
transition, and we didn't make the right plays, and those things add up.  
  
Q. For both players, how difficult are they in that they've got so many
options?  
T.J. CROMER: Like you said, they're just a great team, well-coached team. They
made a lot of shots, and they bothered us with their length. Like I said, just
a great and well coached team.  
  
A.J. MERRIWEATHER: Just piggy-backing on what he said, they're a well-coached
team. They're fast. They can spread the court. You can't foul them. We put
them on the free-throw line, and they made plays.  
  
STEVE FORBES: I think we did a good job on Allen, but like you said, Robinson
really hurt us, and he hurt us in a lot of different ways. He hurt us with his
length, in transition. He made some threes. He got to the basket. I thought he
played a really good game. I was impressed with him, but I thought we did a
really good job on Allen. You can't just stop one guy. They've got other
options.  
  
Q. This is for the players: You guys were all excited about getting into
the NCAA Tournament. Did it live up to what you expected, all the excitement
and the actual game?  
A.J. MERRIWEATHER: Yeah. I just played in an NCAA Tournament, you know what I
mean? When I was a freshman, we didn't get there. Sophomore, we didn't get
there. Junior, we didn't get there. To end my run here at ETSU in an NCAA
Tournament, and to play Florida, the way we played them the first part of the
game, what else can you ask for really?  
  
T.J. CROMER: First off, I'd just like to say it's just a blessing to be here
at the NCAA Tournament. Like me and my teammates say, we just try to enjoy
every moment because none of us have ever been here before, and it lived up to
the moment. We had the time of our lives here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, you can be real proud of a great season. Thank you for
joining us.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
ORLANDO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+ORLANDO)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Joe Dooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30634)

### [Brandon Goodwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33075)

### [Zach Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33149)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Florida State - 86, Florida Gulf Coast - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Dooley to make an opening statement, and then
you can raise your hands for questions.  
  
JOE DOOLEY: First of all, I'd like to congratulate, obviously, Florida State
on a win. They've had a terrific year. I told Coach Ham, it's been fun, with
the exception of tonight, watching his team, and he's done a great job. The
sky's the limit for them. They've got depth, athleticism. They can make a deep
run this tournament.  
  
Second part is, obviously, we're disappointed that we lost. I don't think it
diminishes the year we had. We're proud of our guys. We had a heck of a year.
Disappointing, but hopefully something that we can build on here going
forward.  
  
Q. Congratulations on a great season. Joe, can you talk about only 11
turnovers, which is fine against a Florida State team, but many of them of the
catastrophic variety that led to breakouts the other way.  
JOE DOOLEY: Yeah, our turnovers weren't awful, but we took some unnecessary
shots, and I thought that some of the shots that we took were as bad as
turnovers, and they created things, and that happens.  
  
Also, to our guys' defense, it's hard to simulate what they do. You can't
simulate height and length and athleticism like they have. We just sort of
never really got into an offensive rhythm.  
  
That being said, we did take care of the ball, and I thought we battled for
the most part.  
  
Q. Joe, obviously, you don't play much zone at all, but you played it
tonight quite a bit, and you played it quite well, I think. How important was
that for you guys tonight?  
JOE DOOLEY: Well, we're really concerned the first half especially, 30 of
their 40 points were in the paint, a lot of it off of driving. They were
0-for-5 from three in the first half. We played good defense on other plays.
Bacon jumped up and made a shot, and Isaac jumped up and made a couple shots
when they were well guarded. There's a reason Isaac is projected as a top-ten
pick. He's skilled. He's athletic. Sometimes we're just better offense than
defense.  
  
But the zone, I thought, bought us some time, and we were able to rest our
guys a little bit, but also change the tempo of the game a little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Brandon or Zach?  
  
Q. Brandon, you talked about the experience of being able to play an ACC
team. You don't get to play teams a lot that are in different conferences.
What was it like being able to have that competition tonight?  
BRANDON GOODWIN: Like Coach said, Florida State is a great team. They're
young, very talented. Isaac that's projected, and Bacon that can score, Xavier
-- they're all around pretty good.  
  
It was a challenge for us, but I thought we fought pretty hard. We just made
some plays that weren't smart, and you can't do that versus that type of team.
They're going to capitalize on it, and that's what they did down the stretch.
They made plays for each other, and they executed.  
  
Q. First off, Zach, Brandon, congrats on a good season. Brandon, what
was that like being out there for you in your first NCAA Tournament game?  
BRANDON GOODWIN: It was fun. Like I said, I thought we played really well for
the most part. I couldn't be more proud of my teammates for stepping up at
that stage and just battling all game. I thought we never gave up. We always
pulled each other together, and we talked to one another. So it just makes it
that much sweeter next year going in with pretty much the same guys and that
stuff, except for our two seniors.  
  
Overall, it was a pretty fun game, and we had fun for the most part, except
for the end, of course.  
  
Q. Brandon, kind of touching on what you just talked about, obviously,
you lose Demetris and Norelia. This run was good for you to build off,
building last year and building on this year. Heading into next season where
you add some pretty doggone good pieces next year.  
BRANDON GOODWIN: Definitely. Michael Gilmore, Ricky Doyle, both are great guys
that can replace Meech and Marc. Sorry, I'm a little out of it. Today just
shows that we can fight. We fought hard, and they came in second in their
league, and we played with them and played hard the whole game. So I think
that's a little bit of momentum, definitely, going into next year, just having
the prize right there and not being able to fully grab it. That definitely
makes us a lot more hungry going into next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Does anyone have a question for Zach?  
  
Q. Zach, could you just speak to your feelings right now in terms of the
entire season. It was successful, but you're in a place right now where it
looks like you're pretty bummed out even though you still have two years
left.  
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, definitely. Looking back at the season, we obviously did
some great things, some things we haven't done before, but like you said, kind
of took a tough loss. We played real hard. I'm proud of my teammates. I'm
proud of Brandon. And I'm proud of the people that's also redshirting to also
make us better. They come to practice every day, and they work hard. I'm
excited for what we have to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: One more for Brandon or Zach, and we'll get back to Coach.  
  
Q. Zach, it seemed like in the second half, every time they were poised
to pull away, whether it was you, whether it was Brandon, one of you guys hit
a big shot to kind of stem the tide and never let the game get out of hand.
Can you talk about that?  
ZACH JOHNSON: I think with the schedule we played throughout the year, we
definitely played a lot of great teams, a lot of good teams, a lot of teams
that's in this tournament right now. Just playing in that atmosphere, it kind
of prepared us for what we have to face today. If it was Brandon, if it was
me, if it was Marc-Eddy, whoever it had to be at the moment, we all look at
each other as big players, and big players make big shots when it's needed,
and we try to step up and do that.  
  
Q. Joe, could you just talk a little bit about, you guys had five threes
that went in and out tonight. It just seems like your game plan seemed to be
to try to counter their muscle and athleticism inside by making threes.  
JOE DOOLEY: We talked, and we said that we're probably going to have to make
8, 9, 10, 11 threes to be in the game because they're so big. It's hard to
finish at the rim. We're very good at points in the paint, but attacking the
paint against those guys -- on the flip side, they played quite a bit of zone
in the second half, and we weren't able to get downhill.  
  
We had some good looks. I thought Christian had a couple good ones that rimmed
in and out. Marc-Eddy had a couple of mid-range shots that rimmed in and out.
That one stretch is where they broke it open a little bit. We had that one
stretch where they were up eight or nine. We had two or three that didn't go
down that could have changed the complexion of the way it ended.  
  
Q. Joe, what's your overall thoughts on the season and the strides you
guys made? And then also, like I asked Brandon, like I spoke about with
Brandon, you've got some really nice pieces. You lose a couple of good pieces
obviously, but you gain three or four really nice pieces next year.  
JOE DOOLEY: We'd like to think we're going to -- first of all, we have -- I
think we had a really good year. Just a great year with a disappointing end.
And you look back, we hadn't lost a game in double figures since early
December. We've been in every game. We fought. We've had games where we looked
like we're dead in the water. We came back. We had games where we should have
been beaten badly, and we fought back, and we're in every game.  
  
I think it's something to build on. I do like the pieces we have coming back.
I think they'll be older. We'll get stronger. I think we're going to add a
couple pieces. I think we're trying to sustain this thing, I think going
forward we're going to continue to build on this deal.  
  
Q. Joe, once again, congrats on a good season. We noticed that RaySean
didn't dress. Is he injured? What's the status of Meech?  
JOE DOOLEY: Meech, we're having the doctor evaluate that. Obviously couldn't
come back, which was unfortunate. And RaySean tweaked his back earlier in the
week, and he couldn't go. Hopefully Meech is okay. We'd like to get him
prepared for some professional opportunities. We'll get and X-ray and have our
doctor look at it and hopefully it it's good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations on a great season.

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Darius Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33109)

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Virginia - 76, UNCW - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bennett, if we could ask you to make an opening
statement. Then we'll open it up to questions.  
  
TONY BENNETT: First, I would just like to say the Virginia family lost a great
player and a member of our program, Chris Williams, who passed away. Called
him Big Smooth. I'd never met him, but I just want to send out our heartfelt
prayers and thoughts to his family. Thankful again for what he did for the
program when he was here. I just wanted to honor him and his name and his
legacy at this time.  
  
And then as far as the game, it was a scrambled game. I teased our guys, I'm
glad we worked on our five-guard lineup all week in practice. We knew we were
going to have to play four guards, and we did talk about it as a staff, and
Coach Soderberg led the scout our last practice and said, "Do you want to get
a few reps with five guards?" I was like, "No, I don't think so."  
  
But we had to. And then these guys came up and made big plays. Good defense by
Devon, Marial, of course London -- I'm sorry. Darius. My mind is rushing.
Darius made some big plays slashing.  
  
See, that's a good senior point guard. He's giving assists to his coach.  
  
And they're a hard time to play against. Again, you'll have a lot of
questions, but that's March Madness. That's the way it is. The way we were
down and fought back, we kept steady.  
  
Q. Tony, when London went out there with four or five minutes left, what
did you think? Did you think he might have been hurt worse than he was? What
did you tell him when he went back in?  
TONY BENNETT: He fakes it a lot. I knew he'd be fine. No, I'm just kidding. I
didn't know. He's one of our toughest guys. I was worried. I didn't know if it
was his shoulder, his elbow, whatever. Sometimes you get a stinger, and I
don't know how much he wants to talk about it. I'm still not sure.  
  
But, yeah, I was concerned for him first. Like I was concerned for Isaiah, and
I said, all right, we've got to get this thing going without him. And when
Ethan (Saliba) or someone said, "London is okay," it was obviously significant
for the victory.  
  
Q. London, if you could start by revealing whatever you will about what
happened, how much pain you were in, and then shortly after coming back in, I
mean, you went hard to the basket for three really big baskets. How physically
tough was that for you to do?  
LONDON PERRANTES: It was, I guess, only thing I could call it was a stinger.
Kind of just I couldn't feel my arm for that period of time. So I was trying
to get the feeling back into my arm. It wasn't really working. So I had to
come out. And then just like a minute or so later, I started to get more
feeling in it, and then I was fine.  
  
Obviously, I wish it didn't happen, but I didn't want to come in and just be
thinking about my arm. I just wanted to get the win, and I had to do whatever
I could.  
  
Q. Marial, can you just talk about your game today. You had a good first
half, and then continued into the second.  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I just wanted to provide energy off the slow start. Personally,
I just didn't want to go out like that, and I knew my teammates didn't either.
So I just wanted to come out and provide what I could on both ends and just
bring a spark.  
  
Q. Tony, you've talked about playing the ACC this year, how it kind of
makes you adjust to all different kinds of styles. Did that even matter today
because of the things you had to do?  
TONY BENNETT: There's not a team in the ACC that's like that. I mean, I think
Virginia Tech is really hard to guard and Notre Dame, how they spread you out
with their guys. There's certain things, but it's just -- they're quick.
They're small. They have unconventional shots.  
  
Kevin does a great job. He's built a really good program in his three years
there. But that was really unique to what we have seen all year in terms of
that.  
  
Again, it was just sort of adjusting. We were switching every ball screen, and
Jack came in in the second half, and I said, no, we need another adjustment. I
thought Jack did a good job defensively. These guys knew they had to fight
defensively to handle all of their spread-ball screens.  
  
Q. Question for Coach: Marial seemed to give you guys a bit of a spark
in the first half there to help you guys get going. Can you talk a little bit
about how he got you guys going.  
TONY BENNETT: It was a game we were down, I think 11-23, and we were having
trouble, and we just said, we've just got to space and play. Come up with the
ball screen, slip the ball screen, space and play, attack. Move it if we have
something in transition. We had to get back into the game, try to take good
shots, but you needed to be aggressive.  
  
They did a good job defensively for a while, but we did it. And London, he
always has such a good mind, came up with a real good suggestion in the
halftime, and we got a quick couple good shots off of that, but space and play
was it.  
  
Marial, we went five guards, and that guy had a hard time guarding him. He's a
crafty scorer. He can create. If you've watched him over the years, he can
manufacture his own shot, and we needed it all.  
  
Q. Tony and London, down 15 there halfway through the first half. Any
panic set in? What was the mindset with you guys? It looked like they couldn't
miss and you guys couldn't hit.  
LONDON PERRANTES: I think I said it in the last press conference, they're
going to have to make tough shots for 40 minutes, and basketball's a game of
runs, obviously. They came out hot. They had their run. We had ours. And then
it was just back and forth in the second half.  
  
I think we had the last run. Obviously, we knew at the beginning that they
were going to make some tough shots. The point guard made some big shots with
a hand in his face. Everybody seemed to have made shots. So I kind of just
knew that, hopefully, they were going to start missing and we were going to
start making them, and it happened.  
  
Q. Darius and then, Coach, you can answer this too, it was clear for all
three of you guards how important it was to attack the rim, and all three of
you guys did that consistently through the game. Can you just talk about how
important that was to the win today.  
DARIUS THOMPSON: It was big. We have a team full of players who can attack and
get to the rim and make plays. We really couldn't run our offense that we
usually run. So we just spread it out and just decided to attack.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Is that enough?  
  
Q. No, you can do it, too.  
TONY BENNETT: They did a good job, as they said. We were down, and we just
knew we've got to get aggressive, and they all three did. Devon did. We had to
switch because they were starting to get easy buckets, the way we were playing
the ball screen. So we said, all right, let's go five guards. They had to hit
tougher shots for the most part, but that was to our advantage when we have
these guys.  
  
We don't have a five-guard offense we work on because we haven't done it, but
like I said, you're going to have to touch the paint, either kick it or make
plays, and even in some transition press-break stuff, I thought we had to get
some points on the board.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at London and his 19 points there in the second
half, how big was that for your team to kind of just hold that lead as you
guys are trying to put it away?  
TONY BENNETT: London knows how I feel about him, how much I trust his game,
and all we've been through. It's a big-time performance on a big stage,
something I've grown fond of watching him do over the years.  
  
It's just one game. We get to the next one, but I liked what I saw, and I was
proud of him.  
  
Q. Marial, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe today 23
points is a career high for you. Anything specific that kind of got you going
like you did today? Was it the stage? Was it just one of those days?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Just playing for my guys right here and the coaching staff and
just my teammates. We've come so close over the years, and the chemistry is
just through the roof now. So just trying to play through these guys and just
be in the moment and play as free as possible.  
  
Q. Tony, kind of a behind-the-scenes thing. How do you handle the
Tournament? Do you have two assistants scouting prospective opponents? Will
you stay and watch this game personally? How do you work this part?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, it just depends. We always -- we have two, someone takes
Florida, and someone takes ETSU, and they're working on them. We'll watch.
I'll stay for some of it or all of it, and you get to work.  
  
It's pretty standard operation for how it goes. You get these guys back and
rested and have a good prep day tomorrow, and then come ready to play because
you know, if you're not successful, it's your last game, and you don't want to
leave a stone unturned.  
  
But we've been through some Saturday/Monday games in the ACC. So we understand
what that middle day is about. We'll try to have a good plan and get after it.  
  
Yep, we've got both teams scouted, and now this will be an important scout
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have time for two more questions.  
  
Q. How happy were you with the team getting to the free-throw line 21
times in the second half?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we had to, and like these guys said, we had to attack, and
we had to draw fouls. We got them in the bonus with about -- we were in the
bonus, I'm sorry, with 11, 12 minutes. So that was important, and we needed to
because we were spreading them out, attack, and obviously we wanted to
capitalize on a few of them, but we made just enough, and we saved some for
the next game. So we'll take it.  
  
Q. Coach, Isaiah, how's his status?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he gave us --  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Everything he had.  
  
TONY BENNETT: He's a warrior. I told you what our plan was before. He had five
minutes. Sometimes you get in there and you can't get a stop. He pushed so
hard, and he's not -- he hasn't filled his tank up enough from this virus and
this sickness. We'll take it a day at a time.  
  
But then during the game -- I think it was when we tied -- he jumped up and
got excited. I don't know if it was a sinking spell or what, but it was not
right. I feel for him. I put my arm around him, and I said, "I'll never forget
your courage and your heart to try," because we needed him when he was sick to
get us into this tournament. He did it at NC State, North Carolina, Pitt.  
  
Q. He'll be a game-time decision?  
TONY BENNETT: We'll just see how he is today. I'm not counting on him because
of where he's at, but that will be up to the doctors.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck the rest of the way.
