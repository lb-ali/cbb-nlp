# [NCAA 2017 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+2017+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2017

  

### [Terry Gawlik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33020)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Terry Gawlik, chair of the Division I Women's
Basketball Committee.  
  
TERRY GAWLIK: I'd like to thank our committee members for the countless hours
they put in the process, not only watching games but meetings that we had
across the country and the meeting sessions that we had to determine and build
a bracket and the work they'll do on the road at the host institutions as
well.  
  
The committee brings into the process the knowledge gained through watching
all these games, and I believe we watched over 1200 games. And some folks had
watched between 200 and 300 games individually.  
  
So they seek input there various groups as well, including the coaches ranking
and reviewing all the extensive team data that's provided. And also the top 16
reveal that we did this year, the three reveals, was really helpful in
building this bracket.  
  
We believe we have put together a bracket that will result in a very exciting
2017 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship that will begin this
week, continuing until we crown the national champion on April 2 at the
American Airlines Center in Dallas at the 2017 Women's Final Four.  
  
Let the games begin. We can hardly wait.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Let me ask, I heard you say on ESPN about sending South Carolina out
to Stockton. If you could just expand on that, because I don't understand the
good of the game -- that's not a thing I understand as being one of the
principles you guys go by. What I thought is that South Carolina's closer to
Oklahoma City than it is to Stockton. Are you saying that South Carolina was
seeded lower than Baylor in your guys' minds?  
TERRY GAWLIK: No. You guys, as you know, the list we gave out as the seeds was
UConn No. 1, Notre Dame No. 2. South Carolina No. 3 and Baylor No. 4. That was
the true seed line in the No. 1 seed. But when the committee has the
opportunity to positively affect site attendance and improve the experience
for the student-athlete with geographic placement, that's what we strive to
do.  
  
So we looked at this long and hard. So you start with UConn. They obviously
went to Bridgeport. And you take the No. 2 team, it's Notre Dame going to
Lexington. So then the decision was do we go and take South Carolina and send
them to Oklahoma City, which would have been in mileage closer but they're
going to have a flight anyway.  
  
And we would have made Baylor take a flight as well. So the decision was to
send Baylor up to Oklahoma City and South Carolina to Stockton.  
  
Q. Just talk for a second on the last couple of teams that got in, I
know it's not one team or two teams you guys decide on it's usually four or
so. But seems like Michigan and Virginia were the two that got snubbed most
than anyone else. Talk about the last two teams that got in.  
TERRY GAWLIK: Certainly I can talk about that. We had obviously the last four
that went in were in alphabetical order, Auburn, California, Purdue and UNI.  
  
And the First Four out were George Washington, Michigan, South Dakota State
and Virginia. In particular, you asked about Michigan. They had an overall
22-9 record, were 11-6 in conference. I think what set with the committee, in
Michigan's case, they only had limited wins in the left column. They had no
top-50 -- sorry, they didn't have any wins in the left column. No top-50 wins
at all. So no top 25, no top-50 wins, and their strength of schedule was 101.  
  
They also had a bad loss to Xavier. At the time their RPI was 207, and they
lost four out of the last five games. And as you know they lost to Michigan
State in the Big Ten quarterfinals.  
  
Q. Had one concerning Maryland. I'm just curious, if you continue
through the overall process and also specific to where they ended up, does the
fact that they're a 3 in UConn's bracket represent something that they're on
the row of 3s or zero is three? And was the loss against Ohio State, in the
committee's opinion, what cost them the 2?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Again, when the committee takes a look at all these teams,
obviously we look at the overall body of work. So their wins and loss
considered, strength of schedule, RPI, et cetera. In Maryland's case,
defending the entire body of work was really, really difficult. It was tough,
because we felt Maryland didn't test themselves as the same manner as a team
we were considering at the time.  
  
They had 117 strength of schedule and that stood out to the committee in
comparison with the top 16. And they had only three games with teams in the
RPI top 25 and 13 games against teams against teams with an RPI of 150 or
higher. So those were the factors in looking at Maryland.  
  
Q. The specifics of a loss to UConn, but a very close loss, how did that
factor in? Or was that simple one game against in this case the top team?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I think you said it best. It's one game in the whole
consideration of it.  
  
Q. I just spoke this evening with Coach Fernandez from the University of
South Florida. He feels the committee may have overcompensated for geographic
favorability at the expense of some seeding. What's your response to that?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, while I don't have specifics in terms of the question that
he's asking for, what we have to realize is once we get below the 4 line which
would be 1 through 16, then we have the ability to move teams up and down a
line to allow for matchups that we don't want conferences to face in the first
and second round or hopefully in the semifinals of the regionals.  
  
But we want to make sure that we do everything possible to look at those and
make the bracket work.  
  
Q. Talk for a second about Stanford, because obviously they couldn't
play at home. Did you guys try to keep them as close as possible to home by
putting them in Kansas State? I don't know about the other 7 seeds, but what
was the thought of making them go to Kansas State for the first two rounds?  
TERRY GAWLIK: That's a great question, and you had it right on, because they
were a 2 seed the line that we looked at was a 7 line. So we vetted all folks
on the 7 line trying to be sensitive to time zones and what we thought would
work best. And you have to figure in all the other factors in building the
bracket. So Kansas State just worked out the best.  
  
Q. And secondly, I know it's a couple days off, but the weather that's
coming in through obviously the northeast right now, does that factor at all
in what you guys do as far as trying to figure out when teams will play on a
Friday and Saturday? I know ESPN is in charge of that, but do you have any
sort of pull when teams might play with potential weather issues that may
happen?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, when we had our discussion yesterday with ESPN on, or was
that today, today is the bracket. We had it this morning. My days are all
running together now.  
  
We didn't even talk weather. In fact, we've been so locked up in our room, I
looked out at the window and it was snowing here and we didn't realize that.
But, no, we don't try to manage that, to manage around the weather. I'm sure
Shorts is trying to figure things out as we speak because they're obviously
the department that handles all the travel.  
  
So we don't try to think ahead about the weather. I wish we could. But that
would be something we can't -- so hopefully, knock on wood, everything works
and all the teams get in where they need to go.  
  
Q. The last two seasons Texas was eliminated by UConn. Do you consider
this a reprieve for Texas, not to have been in the UConn bracket again this
year, and give them perhaps a better chance to wind up in Dallas where their
fan support might help the Final Four?  
TERRY GAWLIK: First, before we start talking about that, hello. I'm so excited
to be coming to Dallas for first-ever championship being held there. I'm a
native Texan so it makes it all the better.  
  
But to answer your question specifically, we do look at past competitions, and
Texas had played UConn two times. So we did look at that and factor that in
our decision-making when we were building the bracket.  
  
Q. Does the fact that Texas might be able to bring more fans, did that
factor into the decision not to put them in with UConn?  
TERRY GAWLIK: No. We can't predict who is going to win. That's the beauty of
having a bracket.  
  
Q. Only one quick question for me. There's been some commentary about
how the committee, quote/unquote, must have overlooked our diminished
conference play when they made this bracket up. Can you comment on that as any
thoughts you might have on that assumption?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I actually don't know where that's coming from, because we do
consider conference play during the season and in the tournament. It's not the
number one factor but we do talk about games, because I think maybe perhaps
they're mishearing that we don't -- when I walk out of the room, I'll put it
this way, I couldn't tell you how many teams are in from a certain conference
or not. That's not what we look at. We take the whole body of work and do the
comparisons, and that's how we build, well, select teams and seed them in the
bracket.  
  
Q. That's good to know because you've mentioned you've watched 1200
games or whatnot yourself. I know I read that. That's a lot of games.  
TERRY GAWLIK: No, no, myself, I watch -- I almost hit 300. But as a group, the
numbers that we run is 1200. So that would mean, like, there might be five or
ten of us watching one game. So Rick keeps count of making sure that we're
watching people, and we have monthly reports on who we need to watch. And,
again, I think that top-16 ranking really helped us get an early start on it
and talk about the teams early and really get people prepared more to do the
bracket once we got here to Indy and started on Friday.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up also on a specific decision that was made. Cal and
Oregon, if you could take me through that in terms of Oregon had a better
conference record. Cal did not play as well down the stretch. Just curious
what decision-making process was to end up with Cal is a 9 and Oregon is a
10?  
TERRY GAWLIK: So from your perspective, looking at the bracket, that's where
you see them now. In order to make the bracket work, we have procedural moves
that we could make within our bracketing principles.  
  
So once we get past the 4 line, a team can actually move up or down a line
because as you can imagine it gets quite complicated in order not to have
those conference matchups.  
  
And, of course, we're always sensitive to try to put teams in venues or areas
where they can get to, and their fans in particular, can get to. So that was a
procedural move in our bracketing principles.  
  
Q. The question, and I've heard other people raise this as well is, Cal
and Oregon being the same conference, what procedurally led you to Cal being
the 9 and Oregon being the 10 in those particular spots?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I don't have all that information right here at my fingertips
right this second. But when we vet those discussions, it just happens to work
out if somebody's there on the line -- remember, you can go in -- let's say,
for instance, you could go in on the 8 line and you're in above -- and we
could move you up or we could move you down to make it work. But I'd have to
go back and look at our notes and see in particular what we were, how they
were moved there.  
  
Q. Similar to what was just asked, but in terms of Drake and Northern
Iowa, what was the circumstances that led to those two being on the same seed
line given the head-to-head competition this year? And what role did that
title game play in the conversation about UNI?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, we did note as a committee looking at it that UNI and
Drake did ended up on the same seed line, and I don't recall if one was above
or below the other, but, again, the same principles could apply, move them up
or down a line to make sure the bracket works. We were tracking on all the
conference championships, all the way through the conference championships,
watching games and whatnot.  
  
So watching that UNI/Drake game, that was pretty exciting. And then we vetted
the information that we had in front of us with all the numbers and whatnot
and watching the games and went from there.  
  
As a follow-up, UNI did have the two top-25 wins against Creighton and Kansas.  
  
Q. Tell us about your challenges this year and your feelings coming out
overall with the bracket. And obviously we start play this weekend?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Now I'm a little worried about the weather. I think that might
be one of our biggest challenges. Hopefully we don't have to move some games
around. But certainly as you get on this committee and it's a five-year
commitment, it's my last year, so it's been a great opportunity to get to meet
all the NCAA people and meet some good friends.  
  
But really, for the love of the game and looking at all the teams and trying
to build a bracket and being the most fair, I think that the biggest challenge
would be, I guess, certain pinch points, you'd call them, if you will.  
  
So obviously the No. 1 seed line. That always gets a lot of discussion, who is
where and how does that shake out. And certainly the top 16 now because they
get to host.  
  
So when you're going to make that 16 to 17 turn, you better have good
information and good intel and have your decision made who is going to go in
the 1 through 16 lines. And in this case obviously Stanford couldn't host, so
that was unfortunate. So then we even had to go down to the 7 line and figure
that out.  
  
And then certainly putting the last teams in and the last teams out, I mean
that's hard. That's really, really hard. I believe we had 11 teams we were
talking about for the last four slots. So somebody's not going to make it. And
that's always hard. And people can always say, well, such and such went in and
such and such went out; how did you make that decision? And we just took the
information we had, all the stuff I talked about earlier, watching games, all
the numbers. And you have 10 people in the room that all have 10 different
ideas and you work through it and you come to a vote and build a 64-team
bracket.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. FastScripts by ASAP Sports

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 84, NC State - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by North Carolina State, Coach Wes Moore along
with Dominique Wilson and Miah Spencer. We will open it up for a comment from
Coach Moore.  
  
WES MOORE: I just couldn't be prouder of our team and in particular these two
right here. What unbelievable games. What unbelievable careers they've had.
They have big hearts. They're competitive, and they laid it all out there
today. They're warriors. They're great players. I hate that it had to end this
way. Again, it's a tough one, take a long time to get over. Like I said, it's
been a good run. Would have liked for it to last a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Did you think you had won the game with that shot?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I thought so, but the refs had other things in mind.  
  
Q. Dominique, take us through when you got the ball to the time the
whistle blowed.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Coach Moore called for a pick on whoever has the ball and at
that point he wanted me to come off the screen and go to the basket or
basically try to score because the time was running down. I seen that the post
player showed big so I knew that my man was coming. So I went the other way
and I had the lane and I just shot a layup, but the refs called a charge even
though the girl was still moving. It's on them.  
  
Q. Miah, despite the big comeback that you guys had, the fouls started
to mount, picked up your fourth, at that point you probably became a little
bit cautious, looked like Brooke McCarty was fighting her way through that, is
that what happened?  
MIAH SPENCER: That's exactly what happened. The refs already called it. They
saw the second contact but not the first and one and I guess that's what got
me in trouble.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to be on the bench helplessly after that?  
MIAH SPENCER: What would you think it felt like? It was my last year, last
game. I'm a leader on the team. To end my career like that, it hurts. My team,
they still fought hard. Dom tried to make something happen, and I thought it
was a good take. I thought we won the game with that one.  
  
I mean, Coach Moore this year has been one of the best years of my life
playing basketball. They picked us 7th in th ACC, we finished fourth, beat
Notre Dame. Won at Florida State. We beat Duke. We won at Louisville. What
more could you ask for a senior season?  
  
Just unbelievably proud of my team and thankful for a coaching staff and the
opportunity I have had to play basketball at this great university. It's sad
to end like this, but pretty sure y'all know we could have won that game, too.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIAH SPENCER: We were down big at Louisville, too. But that comes with the
maturity of our four seniors, you know? Never give up. It's something we
appreciate that you can be down 20, but I know the four seniors that we have
were going to fight back and we're going to show the younger girls what it
means to have a mentality of we're capable of beating anybody in the country.
I honestly felt like that tonight and for it to happen the way that it did.
It's real heartbreaking, but I'm proud of the way my team fought today.  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I agree with everything Miah said. It just hurts. You just
feel helpless. I'm very happy with the way we fought, gave it our all. There
is nothing more Coach Moore could ask for. Nobody should go home with their
heads down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse Dominique and Miah. Thank you very much.
Questions for North Carolina State head coach, Wes Moore?  
  
Q. Coach, seems obvious, but can you address what the foul situation did
to you at the end because you were missing Spencer and big bodies up front to
challenge Joyner Holmes on that last rebound?  
WES MOORE: You're right. We had three kids foul out and they were three key
players for us. Actually, four players fouled out. Three of them were posts,
so it did make it tough. Texas has such great size on the interior, you know.
First quarter we played man and they ate us alive and so we went to some junk
defense and obviously it worked really well in the second quarter. In
hindsight, fourth quarter maybe I should have got out of it. But I had that
first quarter in the back of my head. A lot of decisions I wish I'd have made
different and I hate that I couldn't help these kids a little more.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Yeah, they're great players. First team All-ACC, both of them.
They've done it all year. Great leaders, competitors. That's what I'm afraid
of looking ahead in the future. We got some young kids on the bench that I
think are pretty good, but they don't have that warrior mentality right now
that those two do. We're going to have to get that. They've been great mentor
and they represented this university on the court, in the classroom, in the
community. Couldn't ask for more.  
  
Q. Coach, obvious question is the charge. You're this close to it.
Dominique seemed to indicate at the end that maybe the girl was still
moving?  
WES MOORE: That's the toughest call in basketball, you know? Yeah, they didn't
seem to go our way today, but that's the tough call. Until I see the film it's
hard for me to really know. I didn't have a perfect vantage point by any means
and obviously I'm a little bias. So I'm probably not the one to ask. There
were some throughout the game, block and charges both ends that obviously
impacted the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you got behind early, fairly big.  
WES MOORE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you make any adjustments after the first quarter? Did you say
something? What went in your favor?  
WES MOORE: First of all, yeah, I said something. I told 'em we were down by
probably more than this at Louisville and we know we can overcome a deficit.
We switched to a junk defense in the second quarter, and like I said, it was
effective for a while. Fourth quarter I think we should have gotten out of it,
but I didn't think we matched up with Texas athleticismwise and sizewise. But
we might have done a better job on the boards if we would have gone man-to-man
and been matched up a little.  
  
There are things looking back that I could have done differently. The last
offensive rebound on the free throw we had a small lineup in there,
anticipating her making it. I think that's the first free throw they missed in
the fourth quarter and they shot free throws well all day.  
  
So we had a small lineup hoping we could push five shooters and push it on the
floor and ended up being a bad decision on my part. Should have had some size
in there.  
  
Q. Coach, when Miah went out, what did you sense in your team at that
point being the floor leader she was?  
WES MOORE: Critical. You know, you go from a senior to eligibilitywise a
freshman. It's a big difference. Miah has been our leader all year long. You
know, it's a tough one. Fifth foul is a tough one. You're talking about a
minute left in the game, 30 feet away from the bucket. That was a tough one.  
  
It definitely impacted us, and there again, like I said, I could have done
some things differently. So I'll definitely -- felt like the kids did a great
job. They made me very proud as they have all year and those two have for four
years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations on a great season.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 84, NC State - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas, head coach, Karen Aston, student-
athletes, Brooke McCarty and Joyner Holmes. We will have a comment from Coach
Aston.  
  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, I want to really express a lot of appreciation for
everybody that had a hand in this hosting, in particular our group here at
Texas. They do a terrific job. Most importantly, I want to thank the fans. I
thought today was a really, really terrific environment for women's basketball
and they helped us get through this one today.  
  
Lots of thanks and really, really proud of our team. I wrote on the board
ironically enough today before the game that it didn't matter what it looked
like that we just needed to win. That was a good thing to write, probably,
today. But our group never gave in. They showed a lot of resilience and
toughness and just really proud. It was a complete team effort, I think, from
our part.  
  
Q. Joyner, what did you see on that last rebound? What were your thought
processes when you saw the ball coming off the rim?  
JOYNER HOLMES: From the first shot it was great, so I thought the second one
was going to go in. But I know we do have a method on a free throw line and me
and Jada talk to each other and tell each other who is going to go first and
second and they came off my side, and I saw the defender. She didn't box me
out, so I tried to save it on the first one and it didn't go in so I grabbed
it and I put it in on the second one.  
  
Q. Brooke, you guys have been in a lot of tough games this year against
really good competition. When you're down 6 or 8 points in the fourth quarter
today did you draw upon anything from the past that, hey, we've done --  
BROOKE McCARTY: (No microphone.)  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: -- Always in every game if I didn't do my job my
teammates always had my back and they always told me regardless of what you do
go out there and have fun and the last couple of games before going into this
tournament I don't think I was having fun. I will put it as simple as that. I
don't think I was having fun. Today it was really fun and we had a great time
and seeing the look on my seniors face and letting them know this is not the
last game although we all didn't have our best game we were going to pull it
out for them.  
  
Q. Brooke, one of the plays of the game late you stole an inbound pass,
play of the day from a defensive standpoint. Talk about what you saw? What was
your job, and how do you cut it off like that?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Well, when they were taking the ball out they were trying to
get it to their point guard. I just read her eyes and I knew that whoever was
there guarding her was there until, I knew if I could get a tip, at least
maybe we could get the ball or I could get the ball and give it to them. I
think it was adrenaline rushing in that moment and knowing what to do.  
  
Q. Brooke, just as big of a play seemed to be that tipped foul. She's
got four fouls, at that point are you trying to engage her to get that 5th
foul?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. She was great tonight. She really did great for
her team, but we knew that she had 4 fouls. So I tried to engage with her as
much as I could and get her that 5th foul.  
  
Q. You said you weren't having any fun. What did you do mentally to get
out of -- I guess if it was a funk or whatever to get back to having fun?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I just listened to my teammates talk to me. Some games I
didn't fully hear them. I wouldn't tune them out, but some games I wasn't
happy with myself or my teammates. So I think I put off listening to them and
them holding me accountable in practices and holding me accountable for
whatever is going wrong and I listened to them and I went into practice with a
different mindset. Ever since then I think we all pulled together and we've
been playing hard and we pulled it out today.  
  
Q. Coach talked about how huge the crowd was. How big was that for you
guys your last game here this season to go out like that?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Me personally I think the crowd was great. I know coming in
here at the beginning of the season we didn't have that much fans. We brought
a lot of people along with us and I love playing here and I'm sad that we're
going out not playing here anymore. But I love the crowd and I thank them for
everything they've done for this us this year and they travel with us, so it's
great.  
  
JOYNER HOLMES: They've been great. Today was a great atmosphere. Who wouldn't
want to play in their own center in front of that great crowd? Hearing them
our there and cheering for us, it was a great turnout today and we fed off of
them as much as they have fed off us and we thank them for being the energy
booster for us.  
  
Q. Brooke, I think you may have the play of the day. But would you take
us through the charge? What did you see her doing and your positioning on the
floor?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Give credit where credit is due. Spencer and the Wilson kid,
they did great. They played their game and executed to a tee, but I knew after
multiple plays of them going downhill and sometimes (indiscernible). I just
knew that her going downhill as fast as she was coming I could have blocked
the shot, but I just didn't think that was the right decision at the time and
just letting her body fall into mine and I took the charge and I don't do that
often.  
  
It was a surprise for me. So when I took it and I fell and I looked at the ref
I thought they called a block at first, but I looked to the ref at my right
and he called a charge and it went from there.  
  
Q. Brooke, what does it mean for this program to get to the Sweet 16?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's a standard. We come in and work hard every year
and just this past year stringing along these Sweet 16s, it's the standard
here. This is what you do. So you come here to do this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse Brooke and Joyner. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you address -- I asked Brooke about trying to engage Spencer.
That's the sort of play she has been making for you all year, coming up with
the three-point shot, drawing that fifth foul. What has Brooke McCarty given
you?  
KAREN ASTON: She's definitely kind of a calming force for our team. You say a
little engine or whatever it is you want to call her, but that's kind of what
she is for this basketball team. I think that sometimes she tries to
facilitate and do what a point guard's job is. But I think she has grown in
the sense of understanding what is the moment where she needs to make plays.  
  
She didn't really understand that at the beginning of the year. At the
beginning, I think she tried to do too much and then as the year has gone on
she has grown into knowing what moments are best for her to shoot and really
-- I don't want to say take over, but definitely make plays when they need to
be made.  
  
Q. The size and the quickness and their strength. Talk about the ups and
downs, and did you see someone that you know will be great one day?  
KAREN ASTON: I'm assuming you're probably talking about Joyner the most of all
and definitely the other two had an impact on our game today for sure. But the
roller coaster for a freshman is pretty normal. I've never seen one that
doesn't ride the roller coaster. The thing that I've probably been the most
impressed with about Joyner is that she has never backed down from the
expectations here at Texas.  
  
In particular, the expectations that everyone had for her. She had the
typical, I would say, moments where she got some hype and then had to learn
how to handle that and stay focus and had then she went through the moments of
I'm tired and I've never been this tired before in my life and I don't know
how to get through this.  
  
But I still have been impressed with how she has handled her freshman season.
Lots of expectations. She came in here as Player of the Year from a high
school perspective. Some people go into situations where they might have
expectations, but the window of opportunity isn't there for them to have
impact like she did. She stepped into a role that was very much needed in our
team. We hadn't had a power forward since Neka graduated, really, and for her
to step in and take that responsibility I've been impressed with. Sure there's
moments when you want her to be better and more grown but she has handled it
pretty well.  
  
Q. Karen, can you address getting back into the Sweet 16? Third straight
year. Brooke called it a standard. I guess that's what you wanted when you got
here?  
KAREN ASTON: Most definitely. There were some steps that had to be taken for
us to get to the level of consistency in the way that we do things, call that
culture, standard, whatever it is that you want to call it. But most of it
comes with recruiting and most of it comes with recruiting student-athletes
that have that standard.  
  
You can have it as a coach and Texas can have it as a university and as an
athletic program, but when you recruit players that that's their personal
standard to be the best they can be then it helps you get to where you need to
be from a program perspective and she along with many others that we have on
our team have a personal standard.  
  
Q. You guys shot lights out first quarter, couldn't miss. But then the
second and third quarter things went south. How were you able to marshall your
resources and get 'em back especially with those two guards going against you
guys?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, the first quarter was really special for us, and then we
got into that good 'ol foul trouble that we seem to get into every game. I was
really proud of our young kids and the way they responded. They made shots and
made plays and then I thought the second quarter they got a little fatigued.
If you notice I had to use timeouts where I am not accustomed to using them
and that was to get them a break and get them to breathe for a second. And I
think when they got fatigued that's when they stopped paying attention
defensively and that's where they got their guards going and flip to the other
end. He went to the box and one on Brooke, and we avoid that defense when
Ariel and Brooke are in together.  
  
Speaking to the question you asked the players, there wasn't anything that we
hadn't seen this year. We'd seen that before, but the second quarter I thought
we responded with too many quick shots, not trying to get the ball inside
where we could have. Then I thought that we got into a little bit better
rhythm in the second half with an understanding of how to guard and then we
went to the triangle on Brooke and Ariel. But we did a better job of getting
them in the action and those are things I think we learned along the way in
the Big 12. Everybody threw us junk. I shouldn't say everybody but a lot of
people did. We had to handle it. That experience paid off today.  
  
Q. In the locker room when you were talking to the players you said you
can tell by the look on their faces that they were going to win and you've
said that before in a lot of close, big games. Where do you think that comes
from?  
KAREN ASTON: Today it was collective. There's times when I think it's Brooke
and Ariel or times when it's Bri and Kelsey. Today it was pretty collective.
There was engagement with all of them. They were all really encouraging with
each other. Nobody had negative body language, anything like that.  
  
I think it was maybe led by the older players, but I definitely think the
younger players at times this year have kind of felt sorry for themselves when
things weren't going their way and today they all kind of carried a different
mindset like we're just not going to let each other down and that's what
happened in postseason play.  
  
I haven't said anything about North Carolina State, but they were special
today. Those guards were really good and we couldn't help ourselves from
fouling them. We just couldn't adjust to them going downhill, Joyner said it
best. Then when we talked at timeouts about making them make extra passes and
being in help we just couldn't get there in time. I thought we made some plays
down the stretch. Audrey, Kelsey, Joyner, our posts finally made some plays
and helped us out.  
  
Q. You guys were 11 of 12 from the free throw line in the final quarter.
Talk about how big that was for you.  
KAREN ASTON: We've definitely grown up in that area. That was an achilles heel
for us quite a lot of the season. That old saying, I think Jody told me that,
don't talk about it. If you're not shooting free throws well, ignore it. It
will come around at some point. We did stop talking about it. I noticed that
about two weeks ago that we were starting to shoot free throws more
consistently.  
  
Q. Joyner said that people may have been surprised she drew the
charge?  
KAREN ASTON: It's probably the first one of her life. Let's be real.  
  
Q. How do you think she did on that play?  
KAREN ASTON: I looked at it in the locker room because obviously there were a
lot of calls that, I mean, you just look at 'em and in the heat of the moment,
I mean, who knows, you know? Blocked charge is a really hard call. The game
was probably hard to call. I would have to say that. But I did look at it and
she was set. She was definitely set.  
  
Q. You've had some really good defensive minutes from Brianna Taylor
going up against some of the best guards in the country and you were setting
offense and defense. Talk about your role players and how they did?  
KAREN ASTON: They were the difference in the game. I feel quite responsible,
really, for not managing them better in the second quarter. They got on that
run and it's kind of fool's gold sometimes and they kept shooting shots that
were quick and not great ones.  
  
I should have given them some more tools in the second quarter for us to be
better. Again, I thought they got fatigued, too, and they stopped playing
defense. That's where we lost -- we lost our lead defensively in the second
quarter, but you can't -- I thought they were all huge. Shug was confident
today. She looked like a confident basketball player and I've just been
waiting on that, because she is such a special player. Nobody has really seen
the real Shug yet because she did come in off of an ACL and she is going to be
a special player at Texas.  
  
Lashann gave us big minutes. I thought Jada gave us really good minutes in the
first half and then the last, but definitely not least I thought Audrey was
huge for us. She got a couple of offensive rebounds and she sort of -- I
thought our post players kinda stood around a little bit too much and Audrey
was the one that we were able to point to and say, okay can everybody else
give the same effort that she is on the boards? And all of the sudden she
started scrambling and getting offensive rebounds and I thought the hustle
plays and the scramble plays were huge for us and Jordan gave us good minutes.
Everybody that came in gave us something.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started. We are joined by the North Carolina
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing Texas on their home court? Sunday game,
probably a big crowd. How did playing on the road prepare you this year?  
MIAH SPENCER: That prepared us a lot because the teams that we've beaten on
the road were Florida State and Louisville and they both have great home
crowds. I feel like that prepared us for tomorrow and what's to come, but we
have to limit them, contain the dribble drive, box out, contain the dribble
drop and not let them get too comfortable. We have to control the tempo and do
the little thing to win this game on their home court.  
  
Q. Dominique, what is the challenge -- (No microphone.)  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: With Texas, like what Miah said, to stop their transition. I
feel like they're a very fast team, as soon as they get the ball they're
pushing and everyone is running, and the post player is running. So limiting
them to one shot and stopping them in transition would be the two biggest
keys.  
  
Q. You're on the road in an environment like this. What are the keys to
(no microphone.)?  
MIAH SPENCER: We know that we're going to go through adversity. We know we
aren't going to get the calls we might want to get. We know that shots might
not fall, but we have to stick together and not get down on each other or
ourselves.  
  
We have to stay together as a team to overcome the crowd that's going to be
there tomorrow. I feel like that's the biggest part, just knowing that there's
going to be adversity. We can overcome it, though, because we've been in this
situation before.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Dominique, you want to add to that?  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: She nailed it. Just to stay focused as a team. I know the
crowd is going loud and try to sign in and listen to Coach Moore the best we
can.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, I feel like we have a chip on our shoulder, like I said
the other day, because we didn't make the tournament last year not because of
the seeding this year. I feel like we had good quality wins to host, but the
committee probably thought differently. At this point, like we all talk about
it's one game at a time no matter where we're playing at. We've beaten great
teams on the road. We've been down on the road and came back and won those
games. Right now we're comfortable with the position that we're in. We've been
in this situation before.  
  
Q. Dominique, a tournament like this, quick turnaround, it's be not like
playing in conference where you get familiar with people. How difficult can
that be to have that tournament run of playing Auburn one day and Texas the
next?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I think it's very difficult, but that's when focus comes in,
just watching film, trying to read the scouting report, trying to understand
the scouting report, try to go through everything in practice and try to
understand everything even though I know we're not going to get through
everything with two hours.  
  
But just have faith in our team. That's what it comes down to and just believe
that we have the ability to beat anybody if we run our sets correct and play a
great team defense.  
  
Q. When you guys are coming out of high school, how much does playing on
television play into where you want to go? Is that part of the condition of
wanting to go somewhere?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: For some players, yes. Some players wanting to go to a
school where they can get a lot of playing time. Depends on the person and if
they want to go to the next level after college, then a certain type of school
they go to is key because they get a lot of exposure and opportunities to be
seen by scouts. I feel like it depends on the player and their motives.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's everybody's dream that's at a
Division I level. We've been working hard all our live. Us two especially I
know we have put in so much work to be where we are, and honestly we weren't
given -- we weren't McDonald's All-Americans or anything.  
  
So we definitely know we have to work for what he want, and yes, it's a dream
to be in the WNBA and to be playing with great players. So I would definitely
say yes.  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I always tell people if it is God's will for me. I'm not
going to sit here and stress on it.  
  
Q. How do you size up Texas' backcourt?  
MIAH SPENCER: Like I mentioned earlier, McCarty is really quick. So we have to
definitely slow her down on transition because once she gets going with a full
head of steam she is either going to the basket or making you help and setting
up her teammates. So we have to definitely pay attention to her and containing
her. She is also a great shooter.  
  
So making other people score is probably going to be the biggest thing for us,
but they have great players. But like I mentioned, limit them to one shot and
contain their transition and box out. We will win the game if we do those
three things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We will take questions at this point for North Carolina State head coach, Wes
Moore.  
  
Q. Coach, you won the fist round, now you get to play next on their home
court. Your team has demonstrated you can win. You've beat some good teams on
the road. What's the mentality for this road game?  
WES MOORE: We don't talk about home or away. We want to focus on the game plan
and what we're trying to accomplish out there. We're excited about it. We know
we've got a big challenge ahead of us. Texas, obviously well coached,
perimeter, very athletic, inside, got great size that concerns me. They're,
again, a tough match-up, no matter where you play 'em and obviously here on
the road will make it a little bit tougher.  
  
Q. You mentioned match-ups, any particular one that you want to shut
down? Their speed?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, you start with McCarty. She makes 'em go, leading
3-point shooter, 2-to-1 assists in turnover ratio. Does a great job of getting
out and pushing it. Ariel Atkins can shoot the 3 really well, can get to the
rim, great offensive rebounder. They will try to post their wings up some. So
that's tough. Holmes, tough match-up, great size, can take off with the ball
in transition and go coast-to-coast with it. Lang, again, great size there,
tough match-up. So, again, like I said, a great team.  
  
I had the chance to see them on TV a few times during the regular season when
they played Florida State I thought McCarty took over the game. It was
unbelievable what they did and other games I've watched on film since in
preparation, seen other people step up as well. Very good team.  
  
Q. Tournament situations are a little bit different, quick turnaround
games, running up against opponents that you're not familiar with. How big of
a challenge is that for you as a coach coming after a game like Auburn where
they had full-court press?  
WES MOORE: Thankful it was that way. I'm glad we had three days to prepare for
Auburn because they play a little bit different style, obviously with the
forty minutes of pressing and trapping and zone, so glad we had that time.
I've got a great staff. They had probably six or seven games clipped and ready
for me immediately after our game yesterday. In fact, that's why I left after
the first quarter. I let the staff stay, but I went back and started watching
what we had on film. Staff did a good job of having things prepared so it gave
me with us playing so early yesterday, plenty of time to look at that. We
watched film a little bit later last night after dinner and all.  
  
The thing is, you know, they're most of the time playing a lot of man-to-man
defense and doing things that we have seen most of the year, so I don't think
it will be that big of a changeover. I'm more worried about their personnel
than I am necessarily their style.  
  
Q. Obviously, the game is on ESPN nationally. When you are recruiting
high school basketball players at this level do you find that high school
players -- is one of the major factors to where they go, is it will they be on
television and is that a source of recruiting for you if you're on TV a lot,
do you sell that?  
WES MOORE: I don't think there is any doubt. They like having exposure and
especially if they're away from home a little ways. It's easier for their
families to see them play. I think about all of our ACC games were accessible
in some way or another whether it be on ESPN or whether it be on ESPN3, an
app, whatever.  
  
So we're fortunate in that respect. So this time of year I guess it is being 1
of 32 teams playing and getting that exposure. I think this time of year
people are really tuned into watching games and with the March Madness frenzy
and all that, so no doubt in recruiting it's a big factor.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Well, we've got four seniors so that helps. Then we've beaten some
good teams. You know, you beat Notre Dame, you beat Florida State on the road,
you beat Duke, Louisville, we've had some good quality wins. I think that
gives them confidence. Like I said, also we've got four seniors that last year
we were a little disappointed in the selection process, and I think they've
had a little bit of a chip on their shoulder, and the only way you can prove
people wrong is going out and performing.  
  
So I think they're excited about the opportunity. We know it's a great
challenge, a great program on their home court. But this team has experienced
winning under those circumstances, so I do think they will be confident.  
  
Q. The intimidation factor minimized because you have played on big
stages before? Do you expect them to have any sort of --  
WES MOORE: Not really. I think yesterday we had one or two feel it a little
bit, first game, coming out. But I think it helps now having game under their
belt. As you mentioned, in the ACC you're playing great teams every night just
about. So hopefully that confidence is there and we definitely have tried to
preach to 'em that we can compete at this level.  
  
Q. Coach, running down your resume you've made the NCAA Tournament a
lot. A win tomorrow I think would be your deepest run. Any personal drive
there?  
WES MOORE: No, I mean, again, I think you worry more about the process and
just getting your team prepared. Obviously, when you're at a mid-major like
UT-Chattanooga, which I enjoyed 15 unbelievable years there, you're usually
going to be a high seed in that situation and have a tough match-up and
usually on the road.  
  
We were fortunate to get by the first round, but, again, it's more about one
game at a time. I know that's boring, but one game at a time. Let's don't get
caught up too much. Just go out and prepare and play the best we can, let the
chips fall where they may.  
  
Again, this is where you want to be. This is what you work for all year. Had a
good coaching friend remind me night before last, this is what you've been
preparing for all year. Go out and have fun now. You hope that the players can
relax and have fun.  
  
Q. Coach, a little away from the game tomorrow. A lot of people
criticize women's basketball because UConn is dominant. They say you already
know who is going to win in your viewpoint. Is UConn good or bad for women's
basketball?  
WES MOORE: You know, first of all you look at the ratings, it must be good.
I'm told that even if they're in a situation where they have a 40-point lead
people want to watch 'em. From that standpoint it's good. I grew up in Dallas.
I'm a Cowboy fan. You either love 'em or hate 'em, but, still, they draw a lot
of attention.  
  
Connecticut is the same way. Geno has done an unbelievable job. People say
it's on cruise control now, but when he went there who wanted to go to
Connecticut to play basketball? He's put them on the map and built that
program. Now it's up to the rest of us here in the world to figure out a way
to compete at that level. It's tough. Again, I think this process we have now
of teams hosting and all that, I think sometimes that's a factor, too, as far
as we're wanting parity. We're wanting to get new teams up there. I think
sometimes the home court and all that is a factor in that, too.  
  
No, I think, gosh, you gotta respect and admire what Connecticut has done and
the rest of us gotta find a way to catch up.  
  
Q. Anybody from the old neighborhood coming to watch?  
WES MOORE: Had several come in for yesterday's game. I had a sister leave at
3:30 in the morning because they live a little north of Dallas, but I had a
lot of -- probably, I don't know, 15-20 people come down, probably have a few
more tomorrow. Like I said, I grew up in Dallas. I love Texas, talking about
the state of Texas, and I do like Texas football, also! Got to see Mack brown
yesterday. Talked to him a minute. That was neat.  
  
Again, it's exciting to be here. I guess my last year at Chattanooga we went
to College Station and played. Two out of the last three NCAA trips have been
to Texas, so maybe the committee is looking out for me in that respect. Let me
go home a little bit. Get some Mexican food and brisket, you know?  
  
Q. Mack gave the team a pep talk yesterday, I don't know if you --  
WES MOORE: Did he? I failed to mention it to him. I brought up the Bowl game
when I thought Vince Young was a man among boys. Unbelievable performance. I
forgot to mention to him I saw the last Red River rivalry game in the Cotton
Bowl when they played Oklahoma in the last game. So hopefully he used his best
speech yesterday and doesn't have anything left for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Back to the women's basketball issue, UConn if they go to the Final
Four this year they will basically play four home games.  
WES MOORE: Kentucky has an opportunity to do that as well.  
  
Q. For the sport of women's basketball, do they have to get away from
--  
WES MOORE: I think so. I think so.  
  
Q. What could be done?  
WES MOORE: I don't know. Again, I may be in the minority here in saying that,
because, again, I could benefit from it some day if they ever let us host. We
could benefit from it. Okay?  
  
But I do think it's tough. I think what makes men's March Madness, madness are
the upsets. That's what everybody loves, you know, when a 12 seed knocks off a
5 seed. It's a whole lot tougher to do when you got the top 16 teams hosting.
It happens. No need in crying about it. There are upsets and people do pull it
off, but I do think it's tougher.  
  
Going back to the example of baseball. Baseball let's people host the
regionals or whatever, but I don't think the home field advantage in baseball
is the same as the home court advantage in basketball. It's a factor.  
  
It's tough. You work all year for this moment and some of your kids maybe work
all their lives for this opportunity. I think it ought to be on a level
playing field. Again, there are people that don't agree. There's a lot of
coaches at the BCS Bowl that wouldn't agree because they want that home court
advantage. I do think it makes it tougher for upsets. It makes it tougher for
parity going back to what you just said. People that are on TV now in the
finals, 32, Sweet 16, they're getting that exposure. They're helping,
benefitting from it recruitingwise.  
  
So that keeps those teams going year after year whereas if you maybe opened it
up you might have, you know, some other teams able to get into that circle and
make it -- again, get that parity we keep talking about.  
  
Q. Why do you think that in women's basketball there are fewer upsets?  
WES MOORE: That's what I said, most people are on their home court.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: I think it's a factor, yeah. The men, you're playing on a neutral
site court. Again, I haven't ran the numbers. I would just say that I think it
is a big advantage, but it happens. That's why we're here. Anything can happen
on a given day and hopefully you can overcome the road game.  
  
Also, one other final note. I went to high school at R.L. Turner in
Carrollton, Texas, and that's the home of Keith Moreland. Y'all know Keith
Moreland? I was hoping I might get to see him sometime at the baseball stadium
and I was glad he's in town. I'm a big fan and followed him with the Cubs and
he was a broadcaster there for a year or two. I followed him closely and
pretty neat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas student-athletes, Brooke McCarty and
Joyner Holmes. We will open with questions.  
  
Q. Brooke, I'm sure you got to see some of their game yesterday. It
looked like guards were the strength of their team. Talk about challenges of
their North Carolina State guards.  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think they can score in all positions. You said the guards
are leading their team, but I think they can all score in every position on
their team and we just have to stay disciplined on defense.  
  
Q. Brooke, (No microphone.)  
BROOKE McCARTY: It's great to get past the first round. UCA was a tough team,
and it's March Madness. There are a lot of upsets, so we can only be
celebrating for a few minutes then we have to be focused on the next game. So
we are focused and getting ready for NC State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Joyner, Coach said you have been practicing well the past few days,
between the tournament and now. What kind of a change have you had?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I know going into the tournament we have to have a different
mindset than we came out of the Pac-12 tournament with. So going in,
practicing hard and everybody keeping everybody accountable for any layoffs
and stuff that we have in practice. Everyone is going to keep each other
accountable, and keep each other lifted up. So I knew we had to have a
different mindset going into the tournament.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOYNER HOLMES: No, like we said, just taking it one game at a time. Like
Brooke said, UCA was a tough team and we all played hard and we ended up
winning. So taking this one game at a time, doing the scouting and getting
ready for the next team we are about to play.  
  
Q. Brooke, one of the advantages for the top seeds in the women's
tournament is you get to play on your home court. Did it last year. Got it
again this year. How big of a difference is that for you also knowing that
your opponent tomorrow on the road picked up big wins against with big teams.
They're battled tested on the road?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's another opportunity to play in front of our fans
and friends and family. It is just a great atmosphere when you get to play at
home. You work all season to play at home. Getting a play here for us is a big
thing, just getting the opportunity to get to play in front of our family and
friends one more time. NC State has had some significant wins on the road, and
I think we have to focus on our game plan and I think that will be good are us
going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Joyner, in high school you obviously never played past February. Was
it a physical challenge to play into March and if so what did you have to do
to energize yourself?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Like you said, I never played past February. It is new to me.
I've adjusted pretty well. My teammates have been telling me to take it all in
and enjoy the experience, so going in with a different mindset, like I said, a
different mindset to practice, a different mindset to the games. It's been
tough, but we have been able to do so much recovery as we can.  
  
Q. I would like to follow up. Physically how have you held up with the
longer season, being able to run up and down court game after game later in
the year?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Our be strength coach is always talking about recovery, eating
right, taking care of our bodies and getting rest. We focus on that and being
a young player here I didn't focus on that when I was back at home. So making
sure I really pay attention and tune into what he's saying and doing the
things that he's asking of me.  
  
Q. Joyner, what was that first tournament experience like for you going
into the first tournament game, after getting that done does it make it easier
for tomorrow?  
JOYNER HOLMES: The first experience? Talking about yesterday? It was great. We
had been practicing for quite some time now so it was great to get out there,
and like Brooke said, play in front of our fans and on our home court because
we have practiced to play here all year. Going into the game yesterday we had
a game plan and we executed and we actually pulled out the win. So going into
tomorrow's game we have a different game plan, so taking it one game at a time
and not trying to look ahead.  
  
Q. Joyner, you're going to have a very different physical match-up
tomorrow. What challenge does that bring?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Knowing that majority of the four players that I've been
guarding they're versatile. They can pop out and shoot the three now, so
making sure I stay sound and stick to the scout and play very well. That's one
thing to focus on is playing to my opponent's tendencies.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOYNER HOLMES: I think right now that is our motto beside hashtags and stuff
we have, but I think taking it one game at a time and not looking ahead has
been great motto for us because when we take it one game at a time we don't
look ahead and we focus on the team we are about to play and execute the game
plan and if we win or whatnot we move on from there.  
  
Q. Was there any celebration after yesterday's game?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I think it's a little bit of both. We celebrated a little bit
but got straight to doing recovery things and getting our bodies ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's always good to get all of your players playing
time, especially a first round in the NCAA Tournament just so they can get a
feel, new players and players who haven't played at this level. I think it was
good to get them playing time and it was good for -- not saying that UCA
wasn't a good team because they were.  
  
We followed the game plan and when you follow the game plan and execute like
you're supposed to it opens up for other people to get playing time and I
think that was good for our players.  
  
Q. Brooke, you played (No microphone.) Does that benefit you at all
knowing that you've done this before?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it kind of gives you an idea of what you have to work
for and how hard you have to work just to get past any game, first round,
second round, whatever. But it also teaches to you stay in the moment.  
  
We have to focus on tomorrow's game because we're not to the Sweet 16 yet or
anything like that, so we're focused on the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.) How did that come about? How do you flip that to,
okay we're at home, we own this court?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that we just had a rough patch, and every team in
season goes through it. We're past those losses but we know that right now
it's win or go home. Just playing on our court and going out there and
executing and playing together, we have to focus on that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies.  
  
We will open is up for questions for Texas head coach, Karen Aston.  
  
Q. Different physical match-up for your team. Did you have to say to
them the rebounds aren't going to come as easy, defenders are going to be
faster than we faced in the last game? Talk about that.  
KAREN ASTON: I don't think you have to explain that to our team. The schedule
was -- aside from Big 12 play the schedule was tough enough that they
understand the level of play that we're playing at and they understand the
moments. There wasn't a lot of conversation about this is going to be tough or
it's going to be tough or anything like that.  
  
I thought our players did a really good job yesterday, even though there are
things we could have done better when you look at some of the scores and you
see teams struggle, and half of our team, almost half of our team had never
played in the NCAA Tournament game. When I reflected last night when I got
home I thought, you know, the freshmen didn't look that bad for it to be their
first game. They played in the moment yesterday, and I thought they did a
pretty good job of that and they understand what's ahead of them tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think the thing that the schedule did and does for you,
including Big 12 play, is that I'm not sure that there will be team that we'll
play obviously starting with the team we played yesterday and the one we'll
play tomorrow that we haven't seen something that you can compare it to.
That's the thing I like about playing a variety of opponents and really tough
opponents is that when you run across a team in NCAA Tournament play that
maybe you haven't seen that style or whatever. It becomes tough. I'm not sure
that there is a style that we haven't seen or a type of team that we haven't
seen this year. I think that's a benefit that we can give comparisons for our
players.  
  
Q. There has been talk about yesterday's dominant performance -- (No
microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think it was probably just more beneficial that everybody got
their feet wet, especially considering there were a lot of players on our team
that had not played in an NCAA Tournament game. I think that it was positive
for them to get minutes and even go through kind of the bad moment in the
third quarter. But that whole group I was able to reset at the beginning of
the fourth quarter and I thought they played some pretty good basketball in
the fourth quarter.  
  
Just a lot of teaching moments that you always can use as you move forward.
I'm not sure rest matters at this point. I think it's overrated. I think teams
get on runs and they forget how tired they are, and they don't worry about all
that. I don't know that it matters one way or the other. I'm sure we will both
be ready to play regardless of minutes tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've got a chance -- I noticed you were sitting court side
yesterday, that's got to be different than watching film, up-close and
personal scouting them, what struck you about North Carolina?  
KAREN ASTON: Just a really solid basketball team. As you start to get ready
for an opponent you try to figure out what are their weaknesses and how can
you attack their weaknesses? How can you take way their strengths and those
type of things? And the one thing that's striking about NC State is I'm not
sure they have a lot of weaknesses. They do things really solidly, really
well.  
  
The game plan you can tell when you scout them that they have a game plan and
they're disciplined enough to follow it. That was what was the most striking
thing to me as I watched them in person.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think we pumped those brakes when we got back from the Big 12
Tournament and they're still "pumped!"  
  
They're having an understanding, based on the experiences late in conference
play of how good they were when they stayed in the moment during that stretch,
and I've said that a few times here in the last week or two. I did think that
was when we were at our best, when we just talked about what are we going to
do today and who are we going to be today? We really tried to get back to
that, including in practice. What can we do today to get better? I thought
we've done a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you mentioned this before, but critics of women's
basketball often say it's too predictable at the end. What is your stance on
UConn's dominance, whether that's good or bad for the sport?  
KAREN ASTON: I mean, I don't think exposure is bad, period, whether it's what
people perceive as negative or positive that they've won so many games, people
are still talking about women's basketball and I promise you people are going
to tune in to this tournament and see what happens. So if they're bringing
notoriety to our sport you have to appreciate that. I appreciate it as a
coach.  
  
Q. If they make the Final Four they will play basically four home games.
Do you think that women's basketball in the future to grow has got to get away
from, at least in the third and fourth rounds, teams not being able to play at
home?  
KAREN ASTON: I think there is some interesting ideas being tossed around, and
I would like to talk about that more than I would that we don't need to be
playing on home sites right now. We tried a different way, and I mean, I think
where we are right now is where we need to be.  
  
But I do think there are some interesting ideas about putting all the
regionals at one site. There has been some toss around about that, and I think
there are some -- you would have to do more research probably to find the
ideas, but I do think some of them are worthy of conversation just because
everything about I think what we're trying to do is to make sure that there's
butts in the seats for the young women that are performing. That's what you
want. The student-athletes put a lot of time and effort and commitment into
what they're doing, and then they get to this stage and they want to play in
front of people. That's the reason why we are where we are, because you don't
want an empty gym.  
  
I don't want an empty gym tomorrow and we worked really, really hard to get to
play at home, and you guys have done a great job of getting it out there at
the Statesman and I think we've done a better job this year in marketing and
everything that's on our side to get a community to be knowledgeable about
what we're doing, yesterday and tomorrow. I was very impressed with the crowds
that we had on Friday. It was St. Patrick's Day, the middle of the day, and I
thought we had a terrific following yesterday. I'm expecting that tomorrow,
and that's it is what this is all about right now is that you want those young
kids to play in front of a crowd. If that's what has to happen in Bridgeport,
that's where we are right now.  
  
Q. Players may not get (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: It is. It is.  
  
Q. For the seniors, talk about finding leaders that steer the ship. What
have Ariel and the others done to lead?  
KAREN ASTON: Bri and Kelsey?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
KAREN ASTON: Honestly, I didn't say anything about it today and I probably
won't tomorrow. So I guess they would have to read this to know we're having a
conversation, but it's bittersweet for seniors and I think different ones
handle it differently. I think this has been a struggle for them to have their
last moments at home.  
  
So I'm going to stay way from that. I know that our team will enjoy tomorrow.
It will be a really fun basketball game and I think our team is excited about
playing at home. I know that Bri and Kelsey -- it will be a bittersweet moment
for them, but it will be fun.  
  
Q. A lot was said earlier in the season about how tough your schedule
was. Looking back, do you think all those tough games could be a benefit going
forward?  
KAREN ASTON: I almost think that that stuff is over now. I mean, it's
tournament play and everybody in the country that makes the NCAA Tournament
pushes that reset button and they try to forget everything that's happened
regardless if it was good or bad or hard or easy.  
  
There is a reset that happens with this. I think if you ask the players they
would tell you that they enjoyed every minute of it, regardless of whether
they won or lost because I think they enjoy playing in those venues that we
played in. I think they enjoyed playing on national television. I think they
enjoy playing against the best teams in the country.  
  
This is all about the student-athlete experience or that's what it's supposed
to be about. If you ask them, I bet you they would tell you that they enjoyed
the journey.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: It's been a bit of a chess match and I think that it has been all
year long. I wouldn't even say down the stretch. That's where we bogged down.
It's been a chess match all year, in the sense of, especially once we got into
conference play teams deciding who and what they were going to try to take
away.  
  
Brooke has obviously been the focus on a lot of people's game plans. I do
think, and I think I said this earlier, we made adjustments after the Iowa
State game that I thought were really good at K-State. We didn't necessarily
make some of the shots, but I thought we made the adjustments that were
necessary. I thought we played better and looked more confident.  
  
Again, there isn't anything we haven't seen. We have absolutely brilliant
coaches in the Big 12 that are going to challenge you every night especially
because we play each other twice. So that second time around you better be
ready for someone's best shot intellectually, and it's really challenged us to
be better. Nothing will surprise this team that we see, regardless of what it
is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn. I will let Coach begin with a brief
comment.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We knew NC State was a very good team and that they
could score. We did a good job at times but we didn't do a good job enough to
stop them from scoring, and we struggled scoring as well, but we continued to
play hard, and that's who we are. We were relentless all the way to the end.  
  
Q. Thank you, Coach. We will take questions for Katie Frerking and
Janiah McKay.  
Q. For most of the game you really weren't able to force turnovers. I
think in the end the numbers were about the same. Were they better at handling
it than most?  
KATIE FRERKING: I think we weren't as aggressive as we should have been at
times. We weren't rotating like we should have been, and it's tough when we
can't get our press set up like we wanted to. So I think that was a little bit
of an issue, but, I mean, I will give them credit. They did a great job of
handling it, at times, but we needed to pick up our aggressiveness a little
bit.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KATIE FRERKING: I think we just couldn't get shots to fall. Our offense got a
little bit stagnant. We were standing around, not cutting hard. I thought we
got looks at times; we just couldn't get it to fall.  
  
Q. Additional questions for the student athletes? Can you comment on
your overall season, reaching the NCAA Tournament, your overall season as a
whole?  
JANIAH McKAY: This season, it was tough but, you know, we fought like Coach
said to the end, and I'm happy that some of the newcomers got a chance to
experience the NCAA Tournament. This is a culture that we want to continue to
fit for Auburn's women's basketball, and we want to just get back to the grind
and just keep playing.  
  
Q. Thank you. Katie?  
KATIE FRERKING: I think it was an interesting season. It was a little bit of a
roller coaster. We had some good wins, a lot of close games and some tough
losses, and it's a long season, and that happens, but I'll say I've played
here four years, and this is my favorite team I've ever played on here,
because we are relentless.  
  
And no matter what came against us, no matter what we faced, we always bounced
back, and we had 13, 14, 15 girls who just wanted to be out there, and we
loved each other, and we just played hard. It was a good season. I'm proud of
everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Why was it so tough most of the game to turn them over?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: NC State did a very good job. You're looking at four
experienced point guards, four seniors. It's very hard to rattle them. They've
been through a lot, and they did a very good job. They spread us out a little
bit, but just like Katie said, NC State gets kudos for taking care of the
basketball.  
  
Q. Did you see the NC State team that you scouted? Did they do anything
different?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No, they were the same NC State team, and that's Wes.
Wes does a very good job. He's a very good coach. He doesn't really have to
change too much of what he does. He stays grounded to what he does, and what
they do, they do it extremely well. When you've got good shooters, it kind of
helps you, a lot.  
  
Q. You didn't give up fast break points. The press didn't create
turnovers.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: They score in transition, if it's there, but usually
they're a good half court team that can put five people on the floor that can
score at any time.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on -- (No microphone.)  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: The scouting report said she was a scorer. On every
catch she is a threat to score, and that we saw.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions? Thank you, Coach.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 78, Central Arkansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: Current time is 3:44. Central Arkansas here with Coach Sandra
Rushing, also student-athletes Maggie Proffitt, Brianna Mullins, and Taylor
Baudoin. We'll open up with comments from Coach Rushing.  
  
SANDRA RUSHING: Wow. That's not how we wanted to go out and perform today.
Texas, they're big, they're fast, stronger. I just want people to know that
nobody up here or anybody in the locker room is happy with our performance
effort-wise, but that does not define our season. I'm so proud of these young
ladies and what they've accomplished. That's what they need to remember, not
today's game.  
  
Like I said, Texas, I mean, they're very solid. They're going to go deep into
the Tournament. I thought the crowd was great. Maybe we're a little nervous.
Maybe I didn't do a good job preparing them. But, again, I am proud of these
young ladies.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, we'll start with you: Yesterday we were talking about the
Texas height and 33-point difference on rebounding. Was it more difficult than
you expected? Because you expected it would be tough on the rebounding.  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think it was definitely tough. We were sending five
to the boards, and they were still able to jump over the top and get the
rebound. We knew we had to block out, and we probably could have done a better
job than we did. We definitely expected them to outrebound us. Maybe we should
have just fought a little harder.  
  
Q. Maggie, you couldn't get anything going in the first quarter.  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Definitely, it was a rough first quarter. We dug ourselves a
hole, but Coach Rushing just kept pushing us. We were going to keep fighting
until the last buzzer, but we just kind of dug ourselves too deep a hole to
climb out of.  
  
Q. Brianna, you got two quick fouls. Did that impact you rest of the
first half?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I think picking up those quick fouls at the beginning kind of
had to do with how we dug ourselves a hole the first quarter. Coach and me
talked about that all season, me not getting in foul trouble. I think there
was some bad mistakes that I took upon myself.  
  
Q. Taylor, third quarter you guys outplayed and out-hustled them. Talk
about what it was after halftime that things kind of fell your way for a
while.  
TAYLOR BAUDOIN: We went in at halftime, and Coach was talking about how we
weren't playing with a whole lot of effort and not attacking the way we
should. I felt like the third quarter we came out and just started going at
them, and things started to fall a little bit.  
  
Q. Maggie, what do you take away from when you watch Texas? When you see
them on film and then you play against them, what would you say your major
impressions are of them?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: They're a very good team. We knew that coming in. Like we
said, they're bigger, faster, and stronger, and maybe they were a little more
of all those than we kind of expected. But they're a really great team. We
knew we were going to have a battle today.  
  
Q. Were you surprised they played so many people? They kind of emptied
their bench and played a lot of people. Did you see much difference between
their starters and their reserves?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: You know, we kind of knew they were going to play a lot of
people. We feel like they kind of overlooked us. They've got a big game coming
up Sunday. We knew they were going to play a lot of people. When they subbed
and their bench players came in, they kept the tempo just as well as their
starters.  
  
Q. Taylor, if you don't mind talking about the season as a whole and
what you guys accomplished.  
TAYLOR BAUDOIN: I know this season we've been through a lot, and we just
continued to push through and get to where we were. I wanted to send the four
seniors out on top of the South, and we did it in the regular season and into
the Tournament. I just feel like we could have done a little bit better to
capitalize on our season today, but overall, I just wanted to send those
seniors out on top.  
  
Q. Bri, losing against Texas on its home floor is nothing to be shameful
about at all. What do you guys take away from this team. There must be some
positives. You played them tough for a while.  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I feel like my team, we all came together, like I said, in
the third quarter, and came out and played like we've been playing all season,
and just pulling together and playing for each other is something I can take
from this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll excuse Maggie, Taylor, and Brianna. Thank
you very much. We'll move to questions for Coach Rushing.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday you had hoped your team wouldn't be nervous
or intimidated. Is that what happened early? Did they just come out? Were they
overwhelmed?  
SANDRA RUSHING: I think we were a little nervous, but also Bri Mullins being
on the bench hurt us. Her and Maggie have such good chemistry together, and
they look for each other. That's what you want out of your senior guards.  
  
I'm not blaming anything on Bri. That's not what I'm saying. We had other
people that needed to step up, and we didn't. You could tell we were out of
sync. Texas did a great job of denying Maggie and trying to keep the ball out
of Bri's hands. We could never set a screen -- we never set good screens.  
  
I just think the game was so fast early that we didn't really adjust.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it was Taylor that said something about you challenged
them at halftime. Anything in particular you said? Because they played awfully
well in the third quarter.  
SANDRA RUSHING: I just thought we were timid, not attacking the basket. I had
my freshman, Taylor Sells, who's really going to be a tremendous player for
us, but you could tell she was a little timid, and I thought she had some gaps
she could have penetrated. I thought T.B. could have penetrated, and we had to
settle down.  
  
But you could also -- you saw who was started in the third quarter, Bri
Mullins was back in the ballgame, and it's our little comfort zone there.  
  
Q. Sandra, you said you think they'll go far in the Tournament. What
level do you think they're at trying to get through the Tournament?  
SANDRA RUSHING: After getting beat 40, you're asking me that? (Laughing), A
long way then. I don't know. You don't want to have a bad game in the
Tournament. They have all the tools. They're big. They're fast. I wouldn't
mind sitting in the stands watching them. It wasn't very pleasant on the other
side over there on the bench watching them.  
  
But I think Karen does a great job. I thought their fans were great. But I do
want to say this and not putting anyone else down, we have the best fans in
the country at UCA in Conway. They were wonderful. I appreciate them coming
out today and supporting us. I thought it was great. I'm just sorry the end
result is like this.  
  
Q. Was there any weakness you thought you might be able to attack at
Texas that you weren't successful today?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, no. We missed a couple of assignments on doubling the
post. We knew we were going to have to double the post. We knew -- I mean, at
home you're going to shoot well, and we were giving them that 15-footer. We
knew who was going to shoot outside, and you could see them exchanging when we
were backing off. We didn't do a very good job of trailing 11. We got caught
up on that, and she got a couple threes.  
  
But we felt like -- we wanted to give up the jump shot and not give up all the
offensive boards we gave up. We can't help it if we're in front of them and
they're bigger and they get the basketball, but we need to be in front of
them, and we needed to win the 50-50 balls, and I felt like they had a pep in
their step there.  
  
Q. You all won the turnover battle. What were you able to do to force
the turnovers?  
SANDRA RUSHING: I wouldn't mind if it was reversed and we had 21 and we had
that score, so that's a good question. We tried to double, like you said, the
post. We wanted any time that someone got in the lane, we wanted to close it
down. Just make them pass it out. They're great at penetrating. We wanted to
stop that. Especially, I think it's fourth quarter, they got a couple drives
on us. Whether it's fatigue or what's happening looking up there at the
scoreboard, I don't know. We really wanted to keep them out of the lane, try
to contain their drive.  
  
We know they can shoot it, but you have to pick -- we have to pick our poison,
as I like to say. We were going to give up those 15-footers, but they got
several rebounds and put it back in. So it really didn't do us any good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Appreciate it. Congratulations on a great
season.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by North Carolina State. We will open it up for a
quick comment from Coach Moore and then we will take questions for the
athletes only. Coach?  
  
WES MOORE: Just real proud of the effort our young ladies gave today.
Defensively they were really locked in. These two in particular did a great
job with their match-ups. I thought we took pretty good care of the ball
against their press most of the day. I know we had several late turnovers
there. That kind of skewed the numbers a little bit, but I thought we did a
nice job.  
  
Again, it's great to get that first game out of the way. Auburn has a great
team. It was a scary game to go into knowing that they were going to press you
for forty minutes and the way they fly around.  
  
But like I said, I thought our players did a pretty nice job. In a game like
this Coach is kind of blocked out of it almost. A lot of it is up to the
players to make decisions and knock down shots, and they did a great job of
that. Again, these two seniors in particular the defensive job they did and
the way they contributed offensively, really proud. They've done it all year
long; and, you know, we'll keep, as our friend Darryl Roy used to say, we'll
keep dancing with the ones that before you can us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for Dominique Wilson and Miah Spencer.  
  
Q. You weren't happy last time they went and you couldn't go. How do you
feel about this now?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Are you talking about last year? Oh, that I didn't get to go
to LA?  
  
Q. You weren't allowed to travel.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I'm happy. Just taking it one game at a time. We knew going
in, like Coach Moore said, that they were going to press us. I think we did a
good job of breaking the press and slowing the ball down and making plays. So
I'm happy I'm playing.  
  
Q. Did you go with Arkansas or is this your first NCAA game?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: No, I didn't go with Arkansas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pretty good NCAA game?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I find myself more focused because this is your last game,
win or go home.  
  
WES MOORE: I should have told you that earlier! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Did you try extra hard to make an impression after waiting five
years?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Yeah, sure. Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you approach it differently at all?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Um, a little bit because in the ACC there wasn't -- except
Syracuse, not most teams pressed us all game, so we played differently. Coach
Moore said in the locker room we had to execute differently, ran some
different plays that we hardly run because we're not getting pressed. Then
people go back into the zone. So, yeah, I came to the game thinking
differently.  
  
Q. Was there anxiety after all these years?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: No, it was excitement. Happy to be here.  
  
Q. Miah, you're the point guard. I know your coach said the numbers
weren't great at the end, but for most of the game you handled the press. What
was the critical factor in that?  
MIAH SPENCER: Like Dom said, Syracuse, they press us the whole game, too, like
that. So I've been in that situation before, but one thing Coach Moore told us
not to do is pick up your dribble, and that's what I tried to do, stay off the
sidelines and go to the middle of the floor so they couldn't easily trap you.
Once I broke the press just looked for those that were open, drops to the
basket, kicks, shots, take my own shot, but mainly just kept my dribble.  
  
Q. You were kind of spread out?  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah, spacing was important, too, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions? At this point we will excuse Miah and
Dominique. Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Did playing Syracuse, did it help like that?  
WES MOORE: Well, they have seen forty minutes of pressure, press, and a lot of
traps and they've seen -- these kids have seen it the last three years or
whatever. So they probably were a little bit more comfortable knowing what was
coming, but it's still tough because, you know, there again, it's kinda
random. You don't know exactly when it's coming, where it's coming, so it
makes it difficult.  
  
As bad as you hate to admit it they kinda dictate what you do and you don't
like that. You would like to be the one that controls your own destiny there,
but they dictate what you do and you have to figure it out from there; and,
again, I thought they did a great job of that.  
  
Our defense gets a lot of credit. I think they had 23 points at the end of
three quarters, pretty unbelievable job, and obviously the last quarter there
they scored more in the last quarter than they did the first three. So we had
a dip there, but a lot of it goes to defending and when you get stops it's a
little bit tougher to get in that press.  
  
Q. I forget what her scoring average was for one year, but did you know
what you were getting?  
WES MOORE: Yeah. Again, I was coaching in Chattanooga, Tennessee for 15 years,
and Dominique played and went to school in Atlanta which was about an hour and
a half way. So we knew we were getting a talented player. But she as just
grown so much the last year. I think this year she has been, you know,
unbelievable on both ends of the floor. Today she did a great job defensively
on her match-up and offensively obviously she took on a lot of the
responsibility.  
  
A year ago, maybe didn't shoot quite as high of a percentage, didn't make
quite as good of decisions, wasn't necessarily a defensive stopper for us, now
this year she is all that and more. I'm really proud of what she's been able
to do the last year.  
  
Q. You remember her reaction? Sounded like she was upset that, you know,
the rules don't even allow her to go to the tournament at the time. Do you
remember what that was like for her?  
WES MOORE: Not a whole lot. Obviously, it is tough on these kids when they
have to stay behind, but sometimes a year, that's good for them. They get to
practice with the team. They learn the system, get adapted to it. It's almost
like you would redshirt a freshman, but obviously it was her sophomore year.
It is tough, but I think she is pretty happy with her decision; and I know I'm
very happy with her decision. So glad she's here.  
  
Q. Have you seen Texas at all?  
WES MOORE: I saw 'em on TV a couple of times this year. Obviously, the staff
was putting together film on them but I was more focused on Auburn. Obviously
that will change. We will watch this game here and then get back to the hotel
and, you know, go through the games we've clipped and scouting report and get
ready. Obviously, it's going to be a great challenge. They're a great team,
well coached, and they're on their home floor. All those things make it a
tough challenge, but, hey, we're glad we're getting it.  
  
Q. You both beat Florida State. Did you see that game?  
WES MOORE: I did, yes, great game.  
  
Q. What were your impressions?  
WES MOORE: Great game. Texas played a tough stretch there. They played three
or four games in a week and, you know, I know they showed a lot of toughness
and finding a way to win that game. That's a tough -- Florida State is a tough
place to go and get a "W" as we found out, too. It was a great win for us, a
great win for Texas, too. But this time of year you throw all that out of
window, start over and we'll go from there.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Well, we just did a really good job with the scout, with the
personnel, knowing who did what, knowing strengths and how we were playing
individual players. Obviously, Frerking and Montgomery are both great scorers
for them, really for that matter as is McKay. But I thought we did a nice job
of trying to limit their looks. When they did get a look I thought it was
pretty well contested and rebounding too.  
  
They're a great offensive rebounding team, so we knew we had to keep 'em off
the boards. Our guards had to help. We had three guards get 5, 7 and 10
rebounds, so that was a big factor, too. The posts blocked out and the guards
went and cleaned up so to speak, and then we knew we had to take care of the
ball against the press because that is where they score a lot too is off
transition, off turnovers. So I think all those things contributed to us being
able to defend pretty well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Appreciate your time.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 78, Central Arkansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas coach Karen Aston along with student-
athletes Brooke McCarty and Ariel Atkins. We'll start with an opening
statement by Coach.  
  
KAREN ASTON: I thought our team got off to a tremendous start today. I was
very, very pleased with our tempo in the first half. Just our intensity and
attention to detail. I thought it was something that we had worked on during
the time that we had off, and you could tell that it had carried over.  
  
Then a little bit of a letdown at the half that we talked about after the
game. We do understand that that's probably not something that can happen
again for us to advance any farther than where we were. But, again, young
team, may have gotten ahead of themselves a little at halftime.  
  
But overall, got a chance to get everybody minutes in NCAA Tournament play. I
thought that was great. Pleased with the win. It's that time of the year where
you just survive, advance, and move on and get ready for the next one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Texas student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brooke, you feel like the team showed no rust at all as far as the
first half and doing what you wanted to do?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. I think we came out and really executed the game
plan and listened to our coaches. Like she said, it had all flowed over from
practices.  
  
We did have a letdown in the second half and we kind of got away from what got
us off to a good start in the first place. So I think we just have to maintain
that energy for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Brooke, I hate to ask the smallest player on the team, but the
rebounding advantage from your vantage point, how is it that you guys were
able to dominate the paint the way you were?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think we just stuck to the game plan, and our post went in
there and they -- we knew we had a size advantage going into the game. So we
kind of just gave them confidence that, when we gave it in there, for them to
go to work because they did have a size advantage.  
  
Q. Ariel, you played 18 minutes. Do you feel like you exert more energy
in a practice than you did today, since you played not as much as you do in
most games?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I can definitely say practice these past few days has been
pretty intense. I try to give it my all when I'm out there on the floor,
whether it's 18 minutes, 40, or 10.  
  
Q. Did you know you'd be playing that little and that the minutes would
be spread out?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I kind of think I put that on myself a little bit today, too. I
think it's really good we got most of our players in and got a feel for the
NCAA Tournament. And the people on the bench, they carried over what we've
been working on in practice.  
  
Q. Brooke, 21 turnovers with Texas. Is that so many people playing in
different roles or --  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that they really stuck to their -- we knew they were
very disciplined on defense. So when we started doing things that were
uncharacteristic, they got advantages just because of our turnovers. So I
think that they're really disciplined on defense, and then we have to take
care of the ball better.  
  
Q. Ariel, I guess it's not too early to look ahead. NC State looked
really tough in the backcourt. I know you guys saw some of the games. Can you
talk about this challenge that you see ahead of you on Sunday.  
ARIEL ATKINS: They're a good basketball team. They have a good backcourt. They
have people who crash the boards. We'll start preparing for them in a little
bit here.  
  
Q. Brooke, what did Mack Brown say to you when he talked to the team?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think his overall message was basically to stay in the
moment and have fun. This NCAA Tournament should be more about the team than
yourself. When we do it together, it's going to be fun. We just have to take
it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Did he show you his championship ring?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. He said you have that for life.  
  
Q. Did he let people try it on or what?  
BROOKE McCARTY: No. It was just on his finger.  
  
Q. How did it look?  
BROOKE McCARTY: It was nice.  
  
Q. Brooke, curious that T-shirt that said "Texas Mentality" whose idea
was it, and what does it mean?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I don't know whose idea it was, but "Texas Mentality" has been
our motto all year, Texas tough basically. It's just a reminder to ourselves
that, when you put on this uniform and you go out there and step on the court,
to be tough and have that mentality that you just have to go out and give it
your all, all the time that you're out there.  
  
Q. This question is for both of you guys: Y'all don't seem too happy.
Are you all just worried about what's going on next? Are you kind of excited
that you're moving on?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think you're definitely excited, but we know that we have to
be prepared for the next team, and we have to come in tonight and be focused
in film.  
  
I think you can only celebrate for a few minutes after a win in the NCAA
Tournament. You have to turn around and focus on the next team.  
  
Q. Ariel, when you see people like Mide and Hosey that don't play a lot
contribute, how content does that make you as a starter when you see the role
players, the bench players do as well as they did?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Definitely not content. I think it happens in practice. I think
we're trying to push each other to a new level every day in practice, and I
think it's definitely carrying over for them in the games right now, and I'm
really excited for them.  
  
Q. Ariel, do you feel like you all played at a championship level
today?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Honestly, no. Not 40 minutes.  
  
Q. What do you think you all didn't do?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we got comfortable at halftime. I think we stopped
listening to our coaches. And that just happened. But we know that we have to
fix it and we have to stay connected for 40 minutes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse Ariel and Brooke.  
  
Q. Karen, I'd ask you about the turnovers. They did get a little sloppy
there. Is that a concern, or do you think you can clean that up?  
KAREN ASTON: I think turnovers are always a concern because, at this time of
the year, there's such a value that you have to have for the basketball and
for possessions. We went through a long period of time this year where I
thought we'd really cleaned up the turnover issue, and then the last couple of
games we've played, we've had some uncharacteristic turnovers. But I think
most of them are from lack of patience.  
  
This time of the year, everybody has you pretty well scouted, so you have to
get to those second and third options of offense, and I thought the first
half, we looked dramatically improved in that area. Even though we had some
turnovers, some of them were excitement, I think, from the game and from just
getting out there. So I could sort of forgive some of those in the first half
because I thought our flow was really good.  
  
Second half is where I thought the flow stopped and the discipline to reverse
the ball, it comes from relaxing, like Ariel said. It comes from the place
where they think they can kind of just do whatever they want, and it just
never works. I don't know why we continue to do that, quite honestly.  
  
Q. Just kind of feeding off of that, how do you drill it into them as a
coach that they can't do that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it's just -- I've said this from day one about our team.
They ebb and flow with their attention, and it's not -- I don't mean that
negatively at all. It's just a characteristic of this team. Therefore, our
leadership in the locker room before games, halftime, those types of things
needs to be really strong. It's still a work in progress. I think they still
don't understand how locked in you have to be this time of the year.  
  
So we talked about it after the game, and we'll continue to work on it. We've
gone up and down all year long with our focus. We're still working on it,
believe it or not.  
  
Q. Can you talk about why you invited Mack to speak. What did you take
from it?  
KAREN ASTON: We talk quite a bit, just off and on every now and then. He
always congratulates me when we do well. I asked him earlier a few weeks ago
if it he was going to be in town for a game, and he was having a nice little
vacation, I think, in Baker's Bay. So he wasn't available for a little while,
but he made it back. So I had checked with him and asked if he would come talk
to the team today.  
  
I mean, you know, he's won a National Championship. The nuggets of information
you can get from someone is always good this time of the year. I think it's
always good when you hear from a former Longhorn or someone that's been there
and done it and chasing something that you're chasing, and his words are
really good.  
  
Brooke hit it on the head. He talked about staying in the moment, being the
best you can be, being about the team -- all those things that you have to do
to make a run.  
  
Q. Talk about if you thought about what you guys have to do better
against them (inaudible).  
KAREN ASTON: Just attention, focus has to be better. We ebb and flow with our
focus. When we're good, like we were in the first half, then you're pleased
with that. I understand we're going to have things go wrong. I'm not trying to
say we have to play a perfect game, but we do need -- we can't go through a
stretch of five minutes without guarding and not taking care of the ball.  
  
And they're one of those teams which we're at that place now, where you can't
have a stretch of poor play. I think they're a terrific basketball team. I
know they probably feel like they were not seeded fairly, and I might agree.  
  
It's going to be a really good basketball game. Wes is a great coach, and
they'll be really disciplined at what they do, which leads to what we have to
be better at. We have to be more disciplined offensively. If something isn't
there, just be patient about reversing it and looking for other options. Not
taking quick shots when they're not good ones, and that doesn't mean I don't
want to push the ball, but our shot selection has to be good. Their guard play
was terrific today and has been all year.  
  
Q. Coach, on a positive note, 55-23 on the boards. You can't even
predict something like that. Could you talk about how you expected to
dominate, and that was a part of the game plan was to feed the bigs as much as
you could.  
KAREN ASTON: We definitely thought we would have -- we knew we had a size
advantage, but let me say this much. What we game planned for as far as ball
movement, the flow was really terrific in the first half. So things came a
little bit easier than I think we anticipated. And then we got to the second
half, and they started the doubling, and they started packing it in, which is
what we really thought would happen early, and we got out in transition early
and sort of maybe flowed better than maybe they expected.  
  
What I saw in the second half was what we really game planned for, and that's
what I was frustrated with was that we didn't have the discipline to do the
things that we had worked on. I thought they started to pack the paint and
double and do some things that we thought would happen.  
  
So credit to them that they -- either they made the adjustment at the half, or
their players probably made the adjustment at the half, one or the other.  
  
Q. What all did you get out of this game?  
KAREN ASTON: I think, I mean, little things you can emphasize to young players
-- I mean, we still have half a team that hasn't -- this is probably their
first experience playing in NCAA Tournament play for sure because the young
players didn't play much last year. So just emphasizing that the things, the
little things, the detail things really do matter. They can see that.  
  
You asked were they not happy? I mean, they know that they have to put
together 40 minutes to beat NC State. So they understood that they need to
play better.  
  
But a win is a win. I don't want to -- I mean, we can --  
  
Q. You're not mad?  
KAREN ASTON: No, I'm not mad. They understand. It's a win or go home.  
  
Q. You looked a little mad or irritated.  
KAREN ASTON: I was a little irritated in the third quarter, but they did make
some adjustments. Again, I'm talking about players that are young, that
haven't even been in those situations before in an NCAA Tournament. I did
think that they played much better in the fourth quarter. So they adjusted.  
  
Q. And you liked some of the moments you got from like Sutton and
Goudreau?  
KAREN ASTON: I really did. I think Audrey gave us great minutes in the first
half, but they can't help herself from fouling. I thought Mide was good. She's
a young player that's really starting to grow, and you hate it that it's
getting towards the end of season because she's one of those that the more
minutes she gets and the opportunities come, she's going to grow and grow. You
can see it.  
  
Q. Is there more (inaudible) a difference with Joyner? I thought she had
more pop in her step. She looked confident. She played well. She got 9 boards,
12 points.  
KAREN ASTON: She practiced better.  
  
Q. She practiced better?  
KAREN ASTON: She did. It does matter, and I thought that her practices were,
once she took the little break and came back, I thought she was very
determined to make her minutes count in practice. I thought her reps have been
better in practice. Young players get through that where they're just -- it's
a grind and they're overwhelmed. I did think that the reset -- and I think I
said that in the press conference. The reset for the young players was
helpful.  
  
Q. You didn't try on Mack's ring?  
KAREN ASTON: I did not. It is pretty, though. It's really pretty and shiny.  
  
Q. Was "Texas Mentality" your idea?  
KAREN ASTON: No. Actually, that's -- I mean, every school that is a Nike
school is getting those shirts. So you're going to see that throughout the
Tournament, and then they kind of add on what -- kind of what's your motto.
You know, you could see the "HAW" on the side, and all the teams had different
words they wanted on their shirts. Nike was nice enough to give us those
beautiful shirts. It's great to be a Nike school.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Brandy Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28290)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. Brandy, could you describe the defensive style of play that you guys
have?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: We like to pressure for 40 minutes, full-court press, all
in people's face, trapping them, trying to get turnovers, to go in transition
and score on the other end. We're relentless. We're not going to get out of
it. It's what we do. That's how we play.  
  
Q. Katie, you guys have come in here losing nine of your last 12; do you
feel like you're coming in here with no momentum at all, or did the break
after your conference tournament reenergize you guys?  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think it does. It gives us time to rest, and actually
gives us a lot of time to practice and kind of work on some of those things
that I think a little bit contributed to those losses.  
  
But I also think just making the tournament in and of itself and kind of
getting that news is just kind of a little extra energy and motivation. But I
mean, we're not thinking about those losses at this point. We're looking at
this as kind of a whole new season, so we're ready.  
  
Q. Brandy, I assume you guys have looked at some NC State tape; what are
the challenges you think that you have when you see them?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I mean, we play in the SEC so it's really not nothing that
we haven't seen before. They have scorers. They have an inside presence. We're
just preparing as if how we've been preparing our whole season, especially
during conference where there's threats on the outside, threats on the inside,
but we're just going do what we do regardless.  
  
Q. Will you guys have any time to look at the city, see the sights or do
anything besides just play basketball for a weekend?  
KATIE FRERKING: I don't know. I mean, right now we're just focused on our
first game. That's kind of all we're thinking about right now. Hopefully if we
can get a win, we'll see if we have some extra time, but we haven't really
talked about that.  
  
Q. Being an 11 seed suggests that you were one of the last teams in.
Were you guys nervous about that, and what was that moment like?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I think, yeah, we were pretty nervous about it, sitting
there waiting to see if our name would be called. But like you said, when you
asked the question, does that give us momentum coming into the tournament, I
think just us receiving another opportunity to get to the NCAA Tournament and
play, I think that's a lot of motivation by itself. I know as soon as I saw
our name up on the TV, me and Katie were like, oh, it's go time. We've got
another chance to play and get in the tournament, so that's enough motivation
by itself.  
  
Q. Katie, I would ask you about the defensive style you guys play. One
thing when you're in the SEC, maybe teams have seen you do it before. This is
an opponent who may not have seen anything like that. How disruptive do you
try to make it, and what do you hope to be able to do?  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think that's kind of our goal every game is to just
really take teams out of what they do. It's hard whether or not you've gone
against this press before or not to play against this style for 40 minutes,
because like Brandy said, we don't come out of it. That's what we do; that's
who we are; that's all we know. So, I mean, we think it's an advantage, of
course, when we are playing a team who we haven't played before and they
haven't seen it, and so we're just going to use that to our advantage, and we
think that's our biggest strength.  
  
Q. What did you learn from being in the tournament last year that you
guys can use and that you can tell the young ones that have never been to the
tournament?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I mean, it's one-and-done, so you have to give all you've
got for 40 minutes. You have to play hard. You have to play like you don't
want to go home. And it's a big stage to play on, especially for those who may
want to play on the next level. It's a chance for you to show who you are as a
player, and a team. Just us having experience and talking to the younger
girls, I think that helps them a lot just knowing that we've been here before,
so I think that helps the team.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, and I think the biggest thing that those of us who were
here last year can share with the younger kids is just that it's still just
basketball. It's the NCAA Tournament. It's a lot of bright lights, you're on a
big stage, but at the end of the day, you're just playing a basketball game,
and when that game starts, it's 40 minutes of the same thing we've been doing
all season.  
  
Q. Katie, you guys are in a traditionally tough conference, Mississippi
State, Tennessee, got you guys, Georgia. Does that toughen you up in a way
where once the big dance starts that you guys have been through the fires and
it's prepared you?  
KATIE FRERKING: I mean, it does, yeah, absolutely. Playing in the SEC, you
literally don't have an off-night. You're playing a good team, and I mean even
the teams who are at the bottom of the conference are still great teams. So I
think then when you come into the NCAA Tournament and you're playing the best
of the best, I mean, we feel like we play the best of the best night in and
night out in our conference.  
  
I think it's a confidence thing, but I think it's also just feeling like we're
really prepared for anything.  
  
Q. Going back to when Coach first started recruiting you and you were
part of one of the first classes, you've now started 216 combined games,
scored almost 3,000 combined points. What was the buy-in like then to join the
program and try to change where the program was at that stage to where it is
now? Any interesting stories as far as that goes in?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I know personally Coach Flo really sold it to me as being
her first recruiting class to set the foundation for Auburn and where she
wants to take this program. You could have went to the schools that already
have big names attached to that school, and I just wanted to come here and do
exactly what we're doing, help change this program around and set the
foundation and the culture of this program of being an NCAA team, and I think
that's exactly what we did. We believed in her, we believed in the program, we
believed in what she wanted to do, and that's really sold me to come to
Auburn, and now I think it's expected.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, and I think it's interesting you use the word buy-in
because that's what I think we've all done. We committed to Auburn, and when
we committed to Coach Flo it was very clear to us that we committed to a
program and we committed to a culture and a style of play, and we weren't
going to come here and be a bunch of individual players. If you've watched us
play at all, you know we don't have superstars, we don't have people going out
and scoring 30 points a game, but we play together and we all contribute and
we play our role and we do what we do, and I think that's why we're
successful.  
  
Q. How would you describe the defense you play and how disruptive it can
be to your opponents?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Probably the word that you just said, disruptive. You
know, it's disruptive. It's relentless. It's pressure, pressure, pressure,
trap, trap, trap, and that's pretty much what we do. A lot of times people see
it as just -- we just run around the floor trapping the ball. We actually have
so many defensive goes out of our pressure defense, you know, whether it's a
certain number that we want on the shot clock once a team comes over half
court. It's not just the steals, it's not just forcing the turnovers. And then
you look into the time and preparation that teams have to put in to prepare
for us. The girls don't understand that, but as a coaching staff we understand
that.  
  
It's a lot -- we have a lot of defensive goes out of our pressure defense.  
  
Q. Are there coaches that you studied earlier to pick up this style of
play, people that influenced you?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, I actually started coaching at Georgetown, so
watching John Thompson, Jr., and the pressure that he applied to teams and the
way he just wreaked havoc, as well as the coach at Arkansas. Actually it's
funny, I just watched this clip the other day of 40 Minutes of Hell, you know,
just watching that type of defense, and it's always been a way that I wanted
to play. When I first got my first head coaching job, I couldn't play that
way. You kind of have to go with what you have. But then into my head coaching
job at Georgetown, we changed probably going into my fifth year. It was just
like, this just isn't working. I'm trying to teach a 2-3 zone; I'm reading
books on 2-3 Zone For Dummies. It just wasn't something that I was used to
doing.  
  
At the end of the day, you say, you know what, just go with what you know, and
we had our kids to buy into it. And for young kids, once they see success,
then it becomes a little easier because it's tough, we practice hard, just
like Katie and Brandy said, we practice hard. It's a lot of conditioning
involved in it. So it's really something that not only do you have to buy
into, you have to believe it, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have lost nine out of 12; do you worry that your team
is coming in here completely with no momentum, or did the last 10 days of
having a break do something for you?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: You know, I think we look at those losses, and it
wasn't really anything that was bad. You know, we just -- a lot of times we
couldn't score, but we're still doing everything that we needed to do. The
majority of those games I believe we lost by six points or less, so it's like
we're right there.  
  
At this point, and I think Brandy probably said it the best, you can't go back
and live in the past. We've got a new opportunity. This is a new season. We
have to continue to do what we do and realize that it's a whole new season
right now. We can't look at what happened before because then you start to
question yourself and second-guess yourself. This is a whole new season. It's
the NCAA Tournament. Everybody at this point is 0-0.  
  
Q. I know a lot of coaches at this stage kind of turn inwardly to make
sure that they have their base and their fundamentals all squared away. You do
have four common opponents over the course of the year with K-State and Tulane
and Indiana and Virginia Tech. Have you spent a lot of time, a little time on
comparing your games with those teams versus NC State's games with those
teams?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Not really. I mean, I think we're two very different
teams, so it would be crazy to compare my team to an NC State team when we're
two very different teams. We've watched those games, but I think you really
look more at what you've done lately, especially in the ACC. We've watched
them. We've taken note. But I wouldn't say that it's a huge comparison to see
what they did versus what we did.  
  
Q. Is there a team that NC State emulates in the SEC from what you've
seen?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I think they're a little mixture of both. Their
defense reminds us a lot of Missouri. It's very much scout report oriented as
well as very good shooters. I mean, you can put five scorers on the floor at
any time, and then the athleticism compares to a lot of teams in the SEC. So
it's kind of -- I can't say it's really one opponent in particular. It's kind
of a combination of some.  
  
Q. Katie said that even the teams in the bottom of your conference are
really good. Can you say how the SEC as a whole has prepared you for this
tournament?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Oh, yeah. I mean, it'll be a fight to the end because
I think the SEC is one of the best conferences in the country. I think we're
the top. It's 14 teams, and from top to bottom on any given night, anybody can
be beat, and especially when you talk about going and playing on the road.
It's one of the toughest conferences that we're in, and that's really why we
get so many teams into the NCAA Tournament, because it's a very tough
conference, and we've got really, really good players. When we're trying to
choose the top players at the end of the season, it's tough because it's a lot
of players to choose from. You're trying to just pick -- I think it's eight on
the first and eight on the second. That's really not enough for the number of
players that we have in this conference.  
  
Q. You mentioned Nolan and 40 Minutes of Hell. Seems like back at that
time a lot of teams played that style and not so many anymore. Do you know
why? Do you ever discuss that with coaches?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I haven't really. I think it's a type of mindset.
You've got to get tough kids. You've got to get tough players. I think the
game has changed to allow us to play the way both Coach Richardson and Coach
Thompson were allowed to play back then. There wasn't as many fouls called
back then as there are now. So a lot of teams probably see that, as well.  
  
Q. Is it tougher on the road? Nolan used to sometimes stop pressing on
the road because you do get more fouls --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No, we get called fouls at home, so no, it doesn't
really matter. No, we're never going to stop doing what we're doing, no matter
whether it's home, on the road, neutral site. We do what we do.  
  
Q. Just talk about the three seniors that really made up your first full
recruiting class and what they've meant to the foundation of the program.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, both K.T., as we call it, because we have a
K.D., also, and then Brandy, they've just been three seniors that came into a
program that wasn't that great when they decided to come here. But they bought
into how we wanted to play. They bought into the future of our program. They
bought into understanding the culture that needed to be changed and the work
ethic that needed to be done to get to that level that we wanted to be, which
is right here playing in the NCAA Tournament, and for them to go back to back,
it really speaks to them as leaders and as players and understanding that not
only did we do what we wanted, what we said we wanted to do, but we also
brought some people along the way, as well.  
  
Q. There's a player on your team who I think the previous coaching staff
from NC State took at look at with Jessica Jones --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: There's two of them. They're a set of twins.  
  
Q. Focusing on just her specifically, you brought up fouls, NC State has
a foul-prone player in Chelsea Nelson, and you clearly have a foul-prone
player in Jones --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No (chuckling).  
  
Q. First off, what kind of plays give her difficulty in terms of fouls?
What is she not doing as well as what you would like, and then when she's off
the floor, how does that change the way that you guys are able to play your
defense?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if it's one play in particular that
causes her to foul. Jess will foul any play. She's just that type of
aggressive player.  
  
Honestly, just to even have Jessica there, it's no big secret, we're not a
huge team, so then when she does get in foul trouble, then her twin comes
right back in, and her twin hacks, also, so between the both of them, they
have 10 fouls to give, which is great when you think about how we play. It's
not really any particular thing that she does to get in foul trouble, and then
bringing Jaz in, her sister -- actually bringing Jaz in at the 5 actually
makes it a little quicker and a little more athletic. They're twins, but
they're very different in their play, different positions. We kind of ask Jaz
to play backup at the 5, but she's really our 3 player.  
  
Q. Flournoy is not a very common name --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: And it's not spelled right, also.  
  
Q. Are you related to Harry Flournoy in any way?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: From the movie?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yes, he's my cousin. No, I don't know. I tell
everybody that. I don't know. First of all, let's start with this: I married
into that name, okay. I am Williams, the first one. But it's not very common
at all. I do think he's somewhere related down the line, but if you know my
husband, he tells a lot of stories, so I can't really get the true story out
of that. But it is a very uncommon name, and there's not many out there, and
it's usually spelled know and we get Flourey, Fauntleroy one time, which is
why I just go with Coach Flo.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Sandra Rushing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30739)

### [Maggie Proffitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30742)

### [Brianna Mullins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30741)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. You get the distinction of playing the host team on their host floor.
What do you expect that to be like with the crowd against you and stuff in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, we're just excited to be here. It's been a pretty
long season, but it's been a very rewarding season, too. Playing on the home
court, I feel like we're just going to have to come out focused and ready to
execute our game plan. Like any other gym, any other court, we're just going
to have to come out and play basketball just like we've done the rest of the
season.  
  
Q. Maggie, you guys played in the NCAA Tournament last year; how can
that benefit you this time?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think it's definitely going to be beneficial to us.
Kind of going back to Bri's question, we played Louisville on their home court
last year with a bunch of their fans. That was a fun experience, and I felt
like maybe we were a little kind of nervous last year, but since we've been
there, coming into this year we kind of know what to expect, and maybe we can
come out and play better than we did last year.  
  
Q. If I remember, you guys were leading that game in the second quarter.
Does that give you not hope but a thought that you can go here, you can go
anywhere and win?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think that definitely gives us some confidence. Coach
always tells us, last year we got too shot happy against Louisville. Maybe
like I said if we can come in a little more relaxed and just play our game and
try to execute on offense and get stops on defense and see where we are at
halftime and then maybe be able to come out better in the second half than we
did last year.  
  
Q. Looking up and down the roster, Texas has a lot of size on you; how
do you deal with that? How do you play against that kind of stuff?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, as far as the size, I feel like my teammates and I,
we can play with anybody. I feel like we have the confidence to go out and
just play the game that we've been playing all season.  
  
Q. Brianna, what challenges does playing against somebody that's four to
five inches taller than you, what are the challenges for you?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, they're bigger, like you just said. I'm sure they may
be a little stronger, maybe a little quicker. But regardless of all that, I
feel like my teammates and I have the heart to come out and just play
basketball.  
  
Q. Do you feel like it's a David versus Goliath, you go in there and
want to take down the big man, the host school, coming into a game like
this?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I'd say, yeah, definitely. Probably last year nobody heard of
the Sugar Bears. Nobody knew who they were, and we got picked to play
Louisville, and there's probably still people out there who have no idea who
we are now, and they all know who we are coming to play Texas, and obviously
Texas in the Big 12, they're a big school, obviously the bigger conference,
like Bri said, bigger, faster, but that's not going to stop us from come out
and playing basketball and just giving it all that we have.  
  
Q. Maggie, they've got a lot of good players, but any particular players
that you really have to focus on? I know, for example, Brooke is a great
three-point shooter, but any one or two players that you have to shut down?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I would definitely say Brooke McCarty. She's one that we're
really focusing on. Even all their bigs inside, like we're undersized, but I
know KJ is going to come out and she's going to play like she's 6'5", too,
isn't though she isn't her size. We've just really got to stop, like you said,
Brooke from just being able to shoot the three whenever she wants, and if we
can stop some of their other quicker guards from getting to the rim and just
be able to really stop the post from just shooting over the top, then I think
we'll have a good shot.  
  
Q. How different is your program now than when you first arrived as
freshmen?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: It's extremely different. We were the first group to ever
even come to the NCAA Tournament. We were the first group to win the regular
season and the conference tournament, so we're a group of firsts, and I feel
like we had a big part of where our program stands today.  
  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I'll just agree with Bri. I feel like we were Coach Rushing's
first true recruiting class coming in, and I want to say there was -- how many
of us, seven freshmen? And we always joke me and Bri and Raquel Logan were the
three that made it all four years. We've just really grown so much together,
and I feel like that shows on the court with how well we play together. We're
just excited. You never know what can happen. It's kind of bittersweet being
our senior year, but we're just ready to go give it all we have.  
  
Q. I was asking the players, Texas's size, they've got a lot on you up
and down the roster. How do you neutralize that, play against that sort of
size?  
SANDRA RUSHING: That's a good question. I can guarantee you we're not going to
grow 12 inches by tomorrow, okay. But Texas is Texas, and Karen has done a
great job, and they're loaded with talent, and we're just excited about having
the opportunity to play the caliber team of Texas, and being back here at the
NCAA.  
  
My players have played extremely hard this year, worked hard, showed a lot of
pride, and I'm just proud of them. But that's a good question. You know, I'm
hoping that Texas has a bad game, but I can promise you, we're going to go in
and we're going to fight it and we're going to try to do a couple things to
disrupt them, and I don't know if we can disrupt them, but I just want my
players to go out and not be scared and not be intimidated. I heard you ask
them about the crowd, and I know there's going to be a great crowd, and it's
going to be a great atmosphere to play in front of.  
  
Q. Going off of your comments there, what are the challenges that come
with playing Texas, not just the height and the size and all that stuff, but
the fact that you're playing them on their home court and they don't have to
travel anywhere, you guys are out of your element, what are the challenges
that come with that?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, also with that, a lot of teams are having to do that.
That's why you want to host it, and Texas is hosting it, and somebody has to
play Texas, and it's us.  
  
But you know, again, it's going to be exciting. I want us to play on the big,
big stage, and we're having the opportunity to play on the big, big stage.
Especially I'm happy for my seniors. I think you heard Bri and Maggie talk
about the first -- this was my first recruiting class that's getting ready to
graduate, and they've been able to go back-to-back. I'm really proud of them,
but I'm also, on the other hand, excited that my young kids, the ones that are
going to be returning next year, they get to experience this. Nothing takes
the place of experience, and you can always bring this up: Remember, win. And
this is what we want to do every year to continue to get back to the NCAA and
have an opportunity to win a game in the NCAA.  
  
Q. Last year here in the NCAAs you played Louisville, actually had the
lead in the second quarter. How much does that game -- is that relevant at all
for your players that are back, to come into this game here?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I think it helps. Last year we were nervous, really
nervous, and I'm sure we're going to be nervous tomorrow. But that just goes
along with the game. But we had the chance to experience that last year, and
it's something we talked about all season long, about getting back to the NCAA
and wanting to experience this again.  
  
Like I said, I'm sure there will be some nerves tomorrow, but I just want to
go out and let's play hard, let's compete, and this is great exposure for us,
our program, our university, and just have an opportunity to play on the big
stage on national television and everybody is watching and seeing. Of course
we want to go in and represent the Southland very well.  
  
Q. Maggie was saying nobody knew who the Sugar Bears were last year.
Maybe they still don't. You said it's a great opportunity for your program.
For the folks in Austin, who are the Sugar Bears? What are the Sugar Bears all
about?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I think we've got the best mascot in the country, all
right, and I get asked that all the time, the Sugar Bears. Somebody asked me
where did it come from, and I said, it's just because we're sweet, Sugar
Bears.  
  
We're a program that really does the right thing. Our kids graduate. They work
hard. They represent the community and our University well. They're gaining a
whole lot of experience on and off the floor. I've got a great group of young
ladies that, like I said, I'm really proud of, and just to watch them
experience this and go through this really -- it warms your heart as a coach
because you keep telling them hard work is going to pay off, and they're
seeing the end result. It keeps them hungry to go back and want more.  
  
Q. I was asking your players the difference now in your program compared
to the first time -- I didn't know you had seven freshmen at the time. The
biggest difference with your program now as opposed to --  
SANDRA RUSHING: I didn't know I had seven, either, sorry. I was just thinking
-- I had to think back. Sorry, go ahead.  
  
Q. The biggest difference between their freshman year and their senior
year with your program.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Maturity. Absolutely, maturity. When you have freshmen coming
in, of course they're superstars, and they're used to playing and shooting a
lot, and I emphasize defense, and they bought in. That's the thing, you've got
to have your players buy in if you're going to be successful. I've been very
fortunate that this senior group has bought in, and Maggie and Bri, they have
a very special chemistry on the floor, and that has come over time by them
coming in and having to play.  
  
They've been starting since their freshman year, and that just -- that says a
lot about this program and where we started and then we've been able to bring
people in to help contribute and help get us where we are.  
  
Q. Will this be the first time that you guys have been on national TV
this year?  
SANDRA RUSHING: This year? Yeah, this year. CBS Sports, this year. But last
year, of course --  
  
Q. Is that relevant when you're recruiting players, hey, we were on
ESPN?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Absolutely, that's a selling tool, yes, absolutely.  
  
Q. You had the A &M game on SEC Network.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Oh, yes, we did.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. What is the difference between the team that beat all these top-15
teams and the team that lost to Wake and Carolina?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: You said what's the difference?  
  
Q. Yeah, as far as the way you play.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, I feel like the losses, we just weren't making shots
and executing properly how we did when we were beating the top-15 teams, and
that's definitely something we have to come out and do because either you win
or you go home. You can't make that many mistakes.  
  
Q. Miah, your coach has talked about he was a little disappointed the
fact that you guys had to go on the road, there were I guess five teams in the
ACC that lost in the first round; you're here 1,200 miles away. What's the
team attitude about that? What kind of attitude do you bring in here as a team
on the road?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, right now there's nothing we can do about it. The
committee has already selected where we are supposed to play, so right now we
just have to take it one game at a time. We can't worry about that we're not
playing at home or we're not playing close to home. We're here to win, so
wherever we were going to play or if we were playing at home, I mean, it
doesn't matter now because we're here now, so we just have to focus on what we
do best and just come out ready to play tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. You said you're not worried about it. Has it been a rallying point or
is there sort of a chip on the players' shoulders like we'll show them kind of
thing, on the seeding and other things?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, we've had a chip on our shoulder since the beginning of
the year because we didn't make the NCAA Tournament last year. But we knew
what we had to do. We knew we had to come out and play every game like it was
our last game, and I feel like that's what we did this season. The wins that
we got this year, I feel like they were pretty good wins, but I mean, like I
said, the committee has already made a decision. There's nothing we can do
about it right now.  
  
Q. Dominique, what do you like about this team to be able to come on the
road out here? To be able to come to Austin where you could have to
potentially beat a host team on their home court, what do you like about this
team's ability to come out here and do that?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, for one we showed that we can beat teams on the road.
When we beat Florida State, nobody thought we could do that and we shocked a
lot of people, and we beat other teams on the road, too, other than Florida
State. I'm just comfortable with our team. If we come out and just execute and
make shots, then we have a good chance.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you're aware of it, you come into the middle of the
South By Southwest music festival, which is kind of a big deal here. There
have been times in the past where coaches kind of let their players walk
around and kind of take it in, the music scene that Austin is known for. Have
you talked to Coach about all that, about what you want to do off the court?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I didn't know that was going on. I don't think we knew that
was happening here.  
  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah. Sounds fun, though.  
  
Q. Dom, correct my timeline if I'm incorrect. The last time NC State
went to the tournament you didn't travel with the team because it was a
transfer year?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Yes.  
  
Q. So how validating is it for you to in your last year be at the NCAA
Tournament, which was your goal when you transferred to NC State, and how
difficult was it to be left behind in your transfer year?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, it was difficult being left behind because for one I
couldn't play, and they went to LA. I was kind of mad about that. But right
now I'm just happy to be here. Like you said, one of my goals was to be in the
NCAA Tournament, which we did, and now I just want us to go on a run and just
make history for our program.  
  
Q. Miah, you mentioned the chip on the shoulder from not making the
tournament last year; what was that conversation like in the off-season, and
what was kind of the feeling like when the selection was announced that you
guys were in?  
MIAH SPENCER: Well, after the season, you know, it was hurtful because I feel
like we had a pretty decent season last year. But we had four returning
starters, and we were all seniors, so we knew what we had to do, from the
preseason to the summer. We knew that we had to work hard to accomplish the
goals that we wanted to accomplish this year, and Coach Moore just told us
like we have all the right pieces. We have everything that we need to win big
games. I mean, that just showed -- but I'm just excited to be here. It's my
last year. Like I said, we have four seniors that start, so we all know what
it takes, and we know that we can't take anything for granted right now, just
one game at a time, win or go home, and I just know that we're all excited and
just ready to play.  
  
Q. What is the difference between the team to you that's beating top-15
teams and the team that lost to Wake and Carolina?  
WES MOORE: Well, first of all, Wake and Carolina aren't bad, either. ACC is
tough top to bottom. Every game you've got to be sharp and playing well. I
think part of it is shooting the ball well. You have days where maybe you
don't shoot it as well, and I think that's important for us. We need to -- we
shoot the three quite a bit, so we need to be knocking shots down to be at our
best. But sometimes, again, in the grind of the season, maybe you don't have
quite the energy or whatever. It's just one of those days, a couple of those
games where people shot the ball extremely well against us that day, both of
those games that was the case.  
  
But I think we're still the same team. The seasons ebb and flow and you have
peaks and valleys, and you hope that you're peaking right now. You hope you
get momentum and play your best ball in March.  
  
Q. Immediately after the selection you seemed a little disappointed to
get the No. 6 seed and be sent 1,200 miles away from home. What are your
thoughts on that today, and have you talked to your team about that? Is that a
rallying point for you guys?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, you know, at this point it doesn't matter. You move on, and
we're excited about playing, excited about the opportunity, and whoever you
play this time of year is going to be very good. Obviously Auburn from the
SEC, very talented team, very athletic team, press you. One of my coaches came
right after the bracket was up said, we're talking about them pressing so
much, and he said, well, again, at least they have to score to get in the
press. After about five minutes of watching film, we realized that wasn't the
case. They press on the jump ball. They press on missed free throws.  
  
It does present some -- their style of play is a little unusual, and pressing,
falling back into zone, trapping out of the zone, we're going to have to make
good decisions with the ball, we're going to have to shoot the ball well,
those sort of things. But like I said, really, the seeding at this point, it's
a matter of, like I said earlier, hopefully you play your best basketball now
and get hot and get on a roll.  
  
Q. Have you seen anything in terms of that kind of defensive style?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, we've probably seen a few teams similar to it, but it is
unusual. That's been our main point of emphasis on handling the press, having
a variety of ways to attack it, so you have a backup plan if something is not
working. And then like I said, in their zone, 1-2-2 and they'll trap you a
lot, especially when you first get across half court.  
  
We're going to have to make good decisions with the ball and make sure when we
do get those open looks -- that's the thing, when you trap, somebody is open,
so hopefully we can find that open person and then we can knock down those
shots.  
  
Q. Auburn's style, is it something you saw maybe more in the '90s than
what you do today?  
WES MOORE: Oh, Lord, I don't know. I can't remember last week at my age. Not
necessarily. Like I said, Syracuse plays a similar style of basketball and
against them in the first half we really shot the ball well, and second half
we didn't. Again, those are going to be important factors. I just think, like
I said, there's certain teams that maybe do try to have their own style, and
Auburn is one of those. They've done a great job with it, and again,
fortunately we at least have had a few days to prepare. It would be a little
bit tougher if you had one of those 24-hour turnarounds or one day to prepare,
so it is good that we've had a few days.  
  
Q. You have four senior starters; how did that not making the NCAA
Tournament last season weigh on them during this season?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, it was very disappointing. We were 10-6 in the league last
year and won 20 games, and now this year 10-6 in the league, got a 4 seed and
hosting. It's sometimes hard to understand exactly how all these decisions are
made. But yeah, I think we've talked about that quite a bit through the off-
season last year, through the preseason this year, and I think we've tried to
use that as motivation. Last year they said we didn't have enough top-50 wins,
and this year I know we had four top-15 wins right off the top of my head.  
  
I think they took it to heart and have done a great job. Again, that's the
core of our team, those four seniors have been great leaders, great mentors to
the younger players, on the court, off the court, in the community, every way
you could imagine they have been unbelievable ambassadors for NC State and for
our program. I'm excited, too, that they're going to be playing on this stage
their senior year and get the opportunity after not getting it last year.  
  
Q. I asked Dom this a little bit earlier. Last time NC State went to the
NCAA Tournament, we head to LA and she's left behind during her transfer year.
Has she exceeded expectations over her three years of being on the court with
NC State? Did you see her as 1,100-, 1,200-point scorer for you when she
finally got on the court?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, I don't really think in those terms. I will say this:
Dom has shown unbelievable improvement over the last year, just her shot
selection, so from an offensive standpoint she's been a lot more productive,
and then on the other end of the floor we're asking a lot of her in that we're
having her usually guard the other team's best scorer. She's having to play
both ends of the floor for 40 minutes, not a ton of players out there nowadays
that can do that, you know? So very proud of her maturity and where she is
going as a player, and that's obviously a big reason we're here now.  
  
Again, very proud of Dom and where she's come from even a year ago.  
  
Q. At the Christmas break did you foresee a 6 seed?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, I don't look at it that way. It was a rough time. We
lost a couple of games November, December, after having a double-digit lead in
the fourth period in both of those games. Christmas break came at a great
time, and I've had some people question how long of a break we take at
Christmas. We usually give them at least five days off, five or six days away
from it, and it was without a doubt a big benefit this year because we came
back, fresh start, right out of the chute, beat Notre Dame at home, beat
Florida State on the road, and again, that's kind of what gave us the momentum
to reach the point we're at now.  
  
No, it was hard to envision at the time, no doubt. It was a pretty low time,
and that goes back to what I said earlier. The season is a lot of peaks and
valleys and how you handle adversity, how you handle setbacks, and this team
has overcome a lot of that. Proud of the way they responded.  
  
Q. Is there a catalyst of change from that point that you can put your
thumb on?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, I don't know. You know, from a basketball standpoint, we were
really trying to stress taking care of the basketball. When you're playing
Notre Dame and Florida State, you turn the ball over, it usually leads to a
bucket at the other end, and that's similar to what we've got with Auburn.
We're going to have to take care of the basketball because that's what they
feed off of. Some little things like that.  
  
But you know, I just think, again, I think they came back refreshed, a fresh
start, so to speak, and that's kind of what we have now. Hopefully we have
that same kind of result.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Brianna Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28430)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. Do they remind you of anybody you've already played and what are the
challenges you're facing against them?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think we've seen a team such as theirs, like similar style
of play last year in our first round game and I think that we're prepared to
play them and we've watched a lot of film on them to prepare, and I think that
any challenges that we're facing that we're not ready for, we're going to
prepare for that today on the practice court.  
  
Q. Kelsey, some early losses, 19-game win streak, and I think four
losses in the last six. Where is this team right now? Do you feel like you
have any momentum heading into the postseason?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, I think for the past week or so, we've just been
talking about how this is just a new slate for us and it's a new season, and
everyone is starting off and when you lose a game, you're out, so everyone is
on the same playing field.  
  
And so even though we did have some late losses towards the end of the season,
I think we spent the last week really preparing and fixing some things that
needed to be fixed, and so I think that that prepared us going into tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys are familiar to this routine, such a long gap between the
conference tournament and the NCAA Tournament. How did the team handle that
downtime? What did you do to prepare and stay sharp, and also rest and
relax?  
KELSEY LANG: I think the team handled that pretty well. We have four
upperclassmen that have been through this for a couple years now, so we were
able to tell the younger ones about how this goes and everything. The couple
days that we had off, or we had between the tournament and now, we used to
prepare. We used it to refocus and get back on the court and get back to being
us.  
  
Q. What Chris (ph) was just asked, over this extended time off, I know
the goal was to get back to the form that you guys were in during your 19-game
winning streak. How close do you think you got?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think we spent a lot of time preparing and preparation for
the NCAA Tournament and I think those days that we were able to regroup and
refocus and get back to our style of play, I think these days that we had to
prepare were very vital and they were very good for our team.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just overall, what is this time of year like for a player?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, this tournament, where you're playing one game, you're
guaranteed one game; you lose, you're out, is definitely different from the
entire rest of the season where you know you have guaranteed games left.  
  
And so I think especially for this team, having so many young players and just
players who haven't experienced this yet, the upperclassmen really had to get
that point across to them that once you lose, you're out, and you go into the
off-season -- for us, we're done. I think it was important to get the
underclassmen to understand how important taking every single moment is. When
we were able in the middle of the season to take each Game 1 game at a time is
when we were playing our best. I think if we can get back to that, we'll be
good.  
  
Q. Is there a sense that maybe at some point, some of those younger
players kind of lost that perspective with the late losses? As things were
going so well, things got confused?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think our entire team wasn't taking one game at a time any
more, and getting back to that is extremely important, especially right now in
this tournament. And so practice over the past, you know, week and a half has
really just been about taking each drill one drill at a time, and each
possession, you just give all you can on that one possession and so I think
that can -- if that can carry over to the game, then that will be great for
us.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I don't think it's any secret why the two of you are up here,
the two seniors. This is your last go-around, regardless of what happens. What
are the emotions like for you as a senior going into your final NCAA
Tournament?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, watching the selection show on Monday night was kind of
-- it really I think hit me then that this is the last time I would watch a
Selection Show, and see where we were going, and you know, who our opponent
was going to be and so for me, just especially taking that one moment at a
time, and just enjoying each moment I have with this team, and I love spending
time with them and I think that that goes for everyone on the team.  
  
We like being around each other. We love playing with each other. And so just
really enjoying each moment that we have, you know, one game at a time, is
really important for us.  
  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: Kelsey pretty much covered it all. It's very exciting for both
of us. I think she covered it by just saying we're trying to stay in the
moment and take advantage of every opportunity that we have with this team, so
we're excited to get to play.  
  
Q. Two years ago, Sweet 16 last year, there's a progression there. Can
you talk about your goals? Start with Bri.  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think coming here to Texas, ultimately our goal has always
been to get to the Final Four, and our goals have not changed since.  
  
Each year we have progressed and I think that just shows that this program is
headed in the right direction and I think Coach and the coaching staff and the
girls have done a great job of buying in and following the game plan and
everything. So I think that we're definitely headed in the right direction.  
  
KELSEY LANG: Yeah, going off what Bri said, I think especially for us, too,
when we were recruited here, we wanted to get Texas back on the national
scale.  
  
And so our freshman year, being able to make the tournament again, and then
each year progress further in the tournament, that was definitely a goal of
ours, and like Bri said, it's still a goal to keep continuing to go further.  
  
I think everyone on our team, especially the underclassmen, understands that
is our expectation and our goal is to continue to go further within the
tournament.  
  
Q. Bri, how much pride do you guys take in the fact that you guys are
leaving the program in a better state than it was when you got here?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think that we can say that we definitely accomplished one of
the goals that we had coming into this program, and I think that Coach has
covered it by saying that this is going to be our legacy when we leave here
and knowing we were a big part of that and we were a part of it, it's just
amazing to think about; that we were actually at contribution here and we're
going to have something that everyone can remember us by.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just looking at the roster, you guys would seem to have a
significant size advantage over your first-round opponent. Talk about that and
how you hope to be able to exploit that?  
KELSEY LANG: Yeah, you know, we definitely saw on film the past few days, I
mean, obviously just looking at the roster, you do have a size advantage and
so we have been talking about how we definitely need to throw it inside and we
need to expect double teams and we need to expect to have to kick it out, our
guards cutting off of us.  
  
We just need really to focus on what the coaches have been telling us, which
is we do have a size advantage and we're going to need to be able to throw it
inside and kick it back out in order to be successful in this game.  
  
Q. Did people toward the end of the season adjust their defenses to your
personnel? What can you do to counter them?  
KAREN ASTON: I think that we saw about every defense we could possibly see,
and I wouldn't say that it was towards the end of the season. I mean, you play
each other twice in the league, and the first time, the first time we saw
K-State, for example, and Iowa State both, they manned Brooke.  
  
So I wouldn't say that anything Iowa State did to us the second time when we
lost was any different. We just didn't play as good. And they played better.
So sometimes you have to give credit to opponents when they play better than
you do. And as now, I think our players have talked about, we've tried to use
this week that we've had off to sort of reenergize our batteries a little bit.
I think that down the stretch, we just didn't play as good of basketball for a
few reasons, and they would all be deemed as excuses because that's what they
are. We just didn't play as good of basketball, period. It wasn't anything
that we saw different. I actually think we did some better things against some
of the junk that we saw late in the year, as opposed to when we saw it the
first time. Some of the games, the ball just didn't go in and some things
didn't happen for us that happened at other times in the year.  
  
Q. How do you feel like this team is responding to that re-energizing
period?  
KAREN ASTON: I think they have been good. It was hard to get a few of them to
sort of get out of the disappointment, because we have good kids and we have
kids who really want to do well and expect a lot out of themselves and expect
a lot out of our team, including their coach. And so there was this first
moment of a few days of disappointment and probably being mad. A lot of things
combined, a lot of emotions that we needed to sort of work through.  
  
We worked through those and I think the period of time was long enough to get
through those and get through the mad and get through the part that we needed
to to get back to, we're excited to be in the tournament, and it's a new
season and to get re-energized. So it was probably just enough time. I'm not
sure a couple of days would have been good, so we were fortunate in some ways
that we had enough time to kind of sink a little bit and then comeback up.  
  
Q. You mentioned all the positives that come with the big gap between
the end of the conference tournament and the start of this tournament. Any
negatives that come with that that you have to overcome?  
KAREN ASTON: No, I really can't think of any negatives, at all. It was just
one of those periods of time -- I mean, last year, I would have worried that
we were kind of on an up swing. I think any time you can get, in particular, I
say this because of the grind of the Big 12, I think any time that you can let
them breathe a little bit is probably a good thing, and I mean, it all boils
down to the fact that it is a one-game season at this point, and do teams
really want to keep playing. And sometimes that's what some of this boils down
to when you get into tournament play: Are you ready for this to be over; are
you tired of the grind of it, or do you have a little bit more left in you.  
  
I think our team definitely has that. Speak to the break; I think what it was
probably good for was the young kids that it's been a long season for.  
  
Q. I know you're modest by nature, but how much does it mean to you to
be in the Final Four for the Coach of the Year honors?  
KAREN ASTON: I think any time that you're recognized as a player or a coach,
that it's a reflection of everyone that's involved in what you're trying to
get accomplished. So I would say that I'm proud just from the standpoint that
it's a reflection on our players and our staff. I mean, everybody does a great
job every day, and it's a privilege to be acknowledged. It's humbling to be
acknowledged, for sure.  
  
Q. Brianna and Kelsey were talking about how the program is in a better
state now than it was when they were freshmen, and before they were freshmen,
that was the one year you didn't go. How proud are you of their effort to help
lead this team back into an elite program?  
KAREN ASTON: As I said, we talked a lot about this on senior day, and it is
fun to watch as now I've been here long enough, I've seen players come in as
freshmen and leave, and you get to see the impact and you get to see the
maturity and what they have turned into as young women and what this
university does for student athletes here at Texas. It's understated what I
think our university does to grow up people and grow people into what I deem
as leaders in society and what they will be able to do in their next so-called
life.  
  
So as much as I'm proud of what they have done on the court, and I am, really
proud of how they have gotten Texas back into a place that we need to be in,
but I'm also probably more proud of how much they have grown up as young
women.  
  
Q. Part of getting Texas back each year is making a run in the NCAA
tournament; do you talk about that?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, obviously it's one of our goals, and it should be. It
should be at Texas. And we talked about it early in the year, the hashtag, all
that stuff, is part of what our ultimate goal is for this season.  
  
But I will say that part of this process and this last week or ten days, to
try to get our team back to the competitive level that we were at for quite
some time, was to really start talking about the one day at a time thing,
because that approach worked with this particular team. Just to talk about
what are we doing in this moment, how can we be the best we can be in this
moment, in this game. We don't care what's ahead. Let's just talk about today,
and for whatever reason, I think this particular team is better when they stay
in the moment.  
  
So we haven't talked about anything but Central Arkansas.  
  
Q. Are there certain things, when you get into a game, signal that you
know, all right, we're playing well --  
KAREN ASTON: You know, it's funny that you say that, because I was sort of
thinking about the games. You do reflect back on the year when you have to
some time to do that and you think about games that you felt really good.  
  
I think that the old saying, that guards, most teams go as their guards go; I
would probably say that I feel strongly about that with this particular team.
And it's not necessarily whether Brooke is making shots or Aerial is making
shots or Lashann is making plays. It's how our guards play and when our guards
are full of energy and they are really on task defensively, and they are
really pushing the ball and they seem very connected, there's an energy in the
building. There's an energy on the bench. There's an energy with our team. And
sometimes guards don't have it. Sometimes players don't have it. And sometimes
coaches don't have it.  
  
But when -- that feel comes from our guards, that I think we're a better
basketball team, if that answers your question.  
  
Q. Kelsey mentioned to us a little bit ago that upperclassmen had to
grind into the lower freshmens' heads that it's a one-and-done tournament. Do
you feel they have really embraced that in-moment feeling, and going into
this, how do you think they are going to perform under the NCAA pressure of
one-and-done?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, you never know what under pressure they are going to do.
They are a question mark a day most of the time. But I will say that if I
based it on, which I usually do, base everything on what our preparation looks
like, then I would say that they have sort of taken another step of maturity.
That's really important. They are talented players. Our young players are very
talented and I would include the sophomores in that because they just didn't
get enough minutes last year to really understand all of this.  
  
But I do think that the last few days, I've seen them kind of -- they seem
like they are, I don't want to say reenergized all the time because that's not
necessarily -- they just seem refocused. That's a better word. They lost their
focus a little bit, maybe from fatigue of the season, overwhelmed by whatever;
sometimes just being a freshman is overwhelming for most of them, but it does
seem like they are refocused right now.  
  
Q. Situations sometimes where two or three of your players, the other
team doesn't really guard them. They are daring them to shoot. What are they
supposed to do in those situation if the clock is not running out?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that's -- the statement about the clock running out
does make a considerable difference. But where I think we get bogged down
sometimes is when we don't move the basketball. It's not necessarily who is
shooting it and who is not shooting and who is open and who is not open. It's
when we don't move it, and the last couple of games, we got stagnant
offensively and we stopped -- the ball kind of got stuck. And I thought we did
a better job at K-State, which was our last conference game. I thought we made
some changes and we did some things that were very positive.  
  
And I mean, it was a different game against West Virginia, so I hate to say we
didn't carry it over, because West Virginia just outplayed us. I mean, we
didn't play great. Shots didn't go in but they played really good and they
played really good in the whole tournament. You kind of have to give the
credit to them in that situation and not beat your kids down and say, oh,
well, we were terrible. We got out played for sure but they out played
everybody in the tournament. So the sense of urgency, we didn't have, so I was
more interested in getting back home and finding a sense of urgency that we
don't go to Oklahoma City with, rather than worry about who was shooting.  
  
Q. In trying to refocus that, do you have a special speech? Do you
change up routine? Do you give them extra time off or drill down harder? How
do you as a coach approach that?  
KAREN ASTON: It was the week before spring break, and at Texas, going to class
and being a student is pretty important, so I had planned on that regardless,
so that they could catch up a little bit academically before spring break. So
I would say the only thing we probably, or I did maybe differently, was the
practices that we had kind of in between were, for a lack of better words, my
patience wasn't very good in those practices. We kind of got back to some
things that I felt like we were getting away from.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 75, Tennessee - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then questions for the players.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, just disappointed for our kids. Great group, great bunch
of young ladies to work with, be around. We'll never get this group back
again, obviously, and I'm going to miss Jordan and we'll miss Schaquilla.  
  
Q. Mercedes, it looks like particularly in the first half Tennessee was
really struggling to get the ball to you. What was Louisville doing that
impacted that?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Honestly, I think they were just kind of playing a poke and
packed-in defense, which looks like five players are in the paint but really
they're just trying to make you shoot jump shots from the outside and get
tough looks, which, really, they did a good job of that. It was tough to get
me the ball early.  
  
Q. Both of you are juniors, and you'll be coming back next year. Knowing
that you'll come back having another shot getting to the pinnacle of all of
this, how bitter is this one to lose?  
JAIME NARED: It's frustrating any game you lose. It's the end of our season,
so there's nothing we can do about it now. I think we're going to get in the
gym and get ready for next season.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, just off what she's saying. It's definitely something
that we're going to need to learn from, but we'll just take this feeling that
we have right now and use it for motivation next season.  
  
Q. For both Mercedes and Jaime, I guess, I think at one point in the
fourth quarter there were 15 straight missed field goals. How can you explain
that, if you can?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I mean, it's tough. You know, you never know coming into a
game if you're going to hit shots or not. But when you're not hitting shots,
you're usually supposed to fall back on your defense, and we weren't getting
stops on the defensive end and then not making shots on the offensive end. It
just wasn't adding up.  
  
Just we're going to need to fall back on defense when we're not hitting shots
and rely on that from the git-go.  
  
Q. Jaime, what made Asia Durr so difficult to guard?  
JAIME NARED: She's a crafty point guard. She's a lefty. I mean, we knew that.
We didn't do a good job forcing her right. But she can shoot, she can drive,
and I think we didn't do a good job of stopping her. But when she wasn't
hitting, then Moore started hitting. So I think just all around we didn't do a
great job of stopping them on defense.  
  
Q. Jaime, 28 points tonight, 9 of 18 shooting. Was there anything in
particular that you were feeling early on, or was it basically just the
defense presenting the opportunities to you instead of to DeShields and
Mercedes?  
JAIME NARED: I think just being aggressive from the git-go. I think we got a
few transition points. I think that was huge in this game because we knew that
was an area we could attack and we've been good at the whole season. So I
think just making open shots. My team just did a great job of finding me, and
that's a credit to my teammates.  
  
Q. Jaime, Mercedes kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier. Was it
anything in their defense that they did to you that caused you to shoot poorer
than usual tonight, and especially in that fourth quarter? And it seemed that
they pretty much wanted to take the game away from Diamond, didn't want to let
her get the ball, but she struggled a little bit shooting?  
JAIME NARED: I think we got open looks, I think we did. I think we got open
looks. But what we've done in the season was offensive rebound. We had one
person crashing for a lot of the game, so I think when you're missing shots
and you're giving yourself at least a second opportunity by offensive
rebounding, and we didn't do that. I think just when we're missing shots,
falling back on our defense, we didn't get stops, we weren't crashing. It's a
lot of things. I don't think -- I think it was a lot of what we could have
controlled that could have helped ourselves better at.  
  
But Louisville is a great team, great defensive team. We knew that. We knew
they were going to help on Mercedes, and we didn't take advantage.  
  
Q. When fouls started to slow down and the game started in the third and
fourth quarter, is that what you guys think caused a lot of the scoring
droughts, or was it something else?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: No, I don't think the fouls are what caused it. We just
weren't getting good looks at basket, and we should have been driving and
trying to draw fouls on them, and we just weren't doing that.  
  
Q. Jaime, did you get tired in the fourth quarter? You didn't look like
you were getting any lift on your jumpshot late.  
JAIME NARED: No, I think I was just -- I wasn't making shots. I wasn't getting
to the basket like I was before in the game. So I wasn't tired. I was just
missing shots. And we weren't getting stops so.  
  
Q. A team like Louisville that has three really strong players that are
All-ACC caliber, how difficult is that to defend knowing that while Hines-
Allen and Durr have been hot lately, Mariya just was on fire tonight,
especially from the outside?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I honestly think it's definitely difficult because if one
time on an off night the other two can step up at any point, and in a lot of
games they're all three on point. Defensively, it's just about locking in and
trying your best to stop all three of them.  
  
Q. Coach, there were a couple spans there, one in the first half and I
think one in the second half also, where you had some long shooting droughts.
What do you attribute that to? Was it more fatigue on your team's end or more
Louisville's defense?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I thought we got good looks, we just missed shots. We
missed a lot around the basket and just didn't make plays. I thought we got
good position to get some looks and just didn't finish it.  
  
Q. Holly, Mercedes commented on this inability maybe not to get her the
ball enough. Did Louisville do anything different? I didn't realize they were
dropping that many people back.  
COACH WARLICK: I don't -- you know, it's a physical game, and there were times
we couldn't get her the ball and times we could. You know, she made some and
she missed some. We didn't make plays. You've got to make plays. You've got to
make plays down the stretch, and we didn't do that. Jaime's right. We'd miss,
and we didn't have a lot of people going to the boards as we usually do. So it
just -- fourth quarter, obviously, we couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- Mercedes mentioned the failure to get some
stops early in the fourth quarter, maybe that would have helped the offense on
the other end. There was a 7-0 run they went on and then a 5-0 run quick?  
COACH WARLICK: Sure. Yeah, if you get stops, it pretty much helps you win the
basketball game, and we couldn't get stops. So, yeah, they made great plays,
and we had no answer for them. We fouled -- a foul was called in the fourth
quarter that we normally don't do. So it's just a combination of a lot of
things.  
  
Q. Coach, Mariya was 31% from three coming in, today she's five for
five. Did you want her taking those shots or were you just not happy with the
way they were guarded?  
COACH WARLICK: She was outstanding today. Five for five. I thought their
three-point shooting separated them from us. She was outstanding. We knew how
she could play, I mean, and we just let her get loose.  
  
Q. Coach, throughout the game the score was fairly close, but in the
fourth quarter, obviously, it got away. Do you feel like your girls were a
little tight as Louisville started to pull away, trying to force the issue and
why they made missed shots?  
COACH WARLICK: No, I don't think we were tight. Again, I thought we got good
looks, we just didn't make plays. You all know. You've got to make plays. We
have kids that have made plays throughout the year, and we just couldn't get
it done in the fourth quarter.  
  
I thought we got them to turn it over. We got lay-ups, we cut it, and then,
again, we didn't get stops. Then we'd come down and we missed a five-foot
jumper. So just a little bit of a combination of a lot of things for us down
in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Holly, Diamond was coming off a great game against Dayton the other
day. She just never really got it going today. Anything you attribute that
to?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, she's just a great competitor, and sometimes I think
in Diamond's mind she's got to do everything. She didn't have her best game.
She's gotten us through some tight jams, she's played exceptionally well, and
you look at her stats, and it just kind of wasn't her night tonight. So she's
got to play and she doesn't have to be her best, she just needed to step up
and do some things, and, you know, it wasn't a typical night for Diamond
DeShields.  
  
Q. At some point the page does turn. What is the message for the
offseason with the incoming recruiting class that you have, which is ranked, I
believe, No. 1?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we want these young ladies coming in to grasp ahold of
our culture. When we had the opportunity to get four new kids in here, it's
going to help us as far as our bench play. You know, these kids know what
they're getting into. I mean, it is Tennessee, and you've got to be on your
"A" game every game.  
  
So I think for us we go back, we teach these freshmen what it needs to -- to
play hard, being disciplined, and we've got to have some people step up and be
just solid on the leadership end of it and be consistent and give these
freshmen an opportunity to grow. Because they're going to play. They're going
to play, and they're going to play a lot.  
  
So I welcome it. I love what our practices are going to be. They're going to
be extremely competitive, and we're going to bring this -- we're going to make
sure this Lady Vols program is intact, and we're going to be as competitive as
we can, because we've got the kids now to be competitive.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 75, Tennessee - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH WALZ: First, just want to congratulate Tennessee on a great season. It
was a great basketball game. I thought it was up-and-down the floor at times
and impressive shots were made by both teams.  
  
I thought our crowd was great. It was just a really, really exciting college
basketball game. I'd also like to thank again Tom and Christine and everybody
with the University of Louisville, our athletic department, the Yum! Center,
all the volunteers for putting on such a first-class event. This is not
possible without all of them. I'm quite aware of that. We don't take it for
granted, so I just wanted to make sure I said thank you to all of them.  
  
Q. What was your mindset going into the fourth quarter, and can you
describe some of those plays where you got the big threes?  
MARIYA MOORE: My mindset was we've come so far, we can't give up now. And I
need to do whatever I could to make sure my team pushed through. So not only
was it trying to hit big shots, but it was also making sure that when they
made mistakes, just let them know it was okay and to keep going.  
  
Q. Asia, what did you see in Mariya? It seemed like you were looking for
her there late?  
ASIA DURR: I saw that she was very confident. Basically what she just said.
She didn't want to lose, and I think that she showed that when she came up
clutch with those two threes in a row. I was just so hyped. I'm so excited,
and I'm proud of my team as well. I think we fought hard. This is a great
game, and our fans are so amazing. I'm just so happy to be here as well.  
  
Q. Asia, you and Mariya were responsible for 14 straight points in a row
there. Did you have any idea that you two were going to be the keys to start
the fourth quarter?  
ASIA DURR: I had no idea. I was just trying to focus on stop, score, stop.
Because I know for us to score as a team, we have to get stops first. That's
what we did as a team. We came up with some huge stops, and I was just so
happy to see those stops that took place.  
  
Q. Myisha, what was it like for you matching up with Diamond? Because it
seemed like in the beginning, you guys were giving each other a little bit of
trouble, and your game really opened up in the second half.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, she's a great player. Projected to go high in the
draft. It's just basically trying to keep her in front of me. And I know I
have my teammates' help in the back. If she beat me, I knew my teammates would
be there to help, and I would have their back.  
  
So it was just a team effort, though. But just trying to keep her in front
because she's such a great player and she's so fast. Her pull-up jumper was
probably the best in the country. So it was trying to keep her in front and
knowing that my teammates would have my back, too.  
  
Q. Asia, it was a tight game throughout, but you guys were -- you guys
held a slight advantage for most. What was the message from Coach when
Tennessee did go on that run and took a five-point lead?  
ASIA DURR: Well, coming into this game we knew it was going to be a game of
runs. So that's what Coach Walz stressed to us way before the game even
started. He told us: It's going to be a game of runs, but we have to get stops
first. And I think we got like three stops in a row, I think, and that was
huge because then we came down and scored as well. So we just had to get
stops.  
  
Q. Mariya, after I think the fourth of your five three-pointers, you
made a gesture that looked like you were putting pistols in a holster. Was
that an accurate description? If so, what was the message you were sending?  
MARIYA MOORE: I'm going to be honest, I --  
  
COACH WALZ: She was feeling pretty good. After our last five games she was 1
for 21 from the three-point line, so she could have done a cartwheel for all I
cared.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: I was so happy because Coach always stresses how we need to get
in the gym. And so after the ACC Tournament I've been in the gym as much as I
can, so to finally see the hard work paying off, I was just so happy.  
  
I knew before the game I was like, hey, Mariya, if we do this, don't
celebrate. Get back on defense. So I don't even know what happened, really.
I'm going to have to look at the replays, but it just came out.  
  
Q. Asia, in the first quarter, I think, first, second quarter you had
like nine points and you had that rush stretch, and you seemed kind of
frustrated there. It seemed like it just took one basket to kind of get it out
of you. If you could just go back to that point and feel like you were
pressing and maybe that was part of it?  
ASIA DURR: I think the most important thing for me is to stay patient. Coach
Sam told me a few times slow down. I think I was playing way too fast. And
once I finally calmed down, I finally started to see the ball go in, and that
was good. But I think it all started on the defensive end getting stops first,
because that's what gets us going.  
  
Q. Tennessee has never lost a second-round game. I think the number is
28-0 coming in. So what's that say about not only the level of competition,
but the accomplishment of beating them?  
MARIYA MOORE: Well, this is the first time we're hearing of that. Regardless
if they had lost or hadn't lost, we just came to play our game. It's a huge
accomplishment. All these second-round games have been very competitive, so we
weren't expecting ours to be any different. But I'm happy our team was able to
pull through.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Like she said, it's the first time we've heard of that, so
thanks. But it's March Madness and anything can happen. They came and played
their best game of basketball, and we also did. So, I mean, two great teams
just going at it, anything can happen.  
  
We're lucky enough to get the win in front of our fans because last year we
weren't able to accomplish that goal. But just knowing this year we were able
to do it in front of an amazing crowd. The crowd was loud. When we were down,
they were still with us, even when we were up, they were still with us.  
  
So, I mean, just the fact that we were able to get this win not only for
ourselves and for our confidence going into our next game, but for our fans as
well.  
  
Q. Mariya, after the game was over, you were obviously celebratory, like
everybody else. You were also in a ton of pain. What's it like, those two
things going on at once?  
MARIYA MOORE: It's just a hard lesson I have to learn because our nutritionist
preaches to me all the time and our trainer that I need to drink more often.
And when I'm in the heat of the moment --  
  
COACH WALZ: That's water. That's water. Just want to make sure we clarify that
now.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: Drink water, water, drink water. When I'm in the heat of the
moment, all I'm really focused on is the next play instead of my body. So I
was in pain, but it was my fault. Water.  
  
Q. Myisha, you touched upon this about getting back to the Sweet
Sixteen. I know it's not a given every year, but how appreciative are you all
of this after missing out last year and coming so close last year?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, my freshman year was the first time we made it to
the Sweet Sixteen, and we had seniors on the team. You know, you just play for
your seniors once it gets to the end, because you know this could be their
last game. You don't want to see them go home heartbroken.  
  
But getting back to the Sweet Sixteen gives everyone else confidence. We know
Coach Walz and our staff will give us a great game plan going into this game.
We've just got to stick with it and stay pushing and get to the Elite Eight
next.  
  
Q. How long will you enjoy this win before you start thinking about that
Sweet Sixteen game in Oklahoma City?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Today and tonight.  
  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I would say the same thing. I think the next game is Friday.
Yeah, I'm not sure who we play. But we need to be prepared for that game
because it's going to be huge. I mean, it's one game here. We can't get too up
about this game. We have to stay right at the right point. So we've just got
to keep our game plan going.  
  
Q. Myisha, it seemed every time you had the ball in your hands in the
fourth quarter, you had a smile on your face, whether you were taking the
rebound or ripping the lay-up. Were you aware of how close you were to
clinching?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, every rebound I pulled down, I was just like, we're
one step closer. That was just a mindset. If you get the stop, you're one step
closer to getting to the Sweet Sixteen. We get a stop, and we're one step
closer.  
  
So every time I was able to get up there and get a rebound, because they're
great rebounders, they're top in the country in rebounds, so every time I was
able to get one in the fourth quarter, it was just like, yeah, we're one step
closer. Get the ball up to one of our guards, and let's go work on the
offensive side. It's just like one step closer. That's my whole mindset going
in to the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked yesterday about the importance of your bench, in
particular Ciera. How well do you think she played in her minutes, and how big
was her role in limiting the Lady Vols' inside game tonight?  
COACH WALZ: I thought our bench was fantastic, right down the line. Ciera did
a great job of buddying up in the post on Mercedes, which we need to keep her
as far out from the basket as we could. She made a big-time hoop for us. She
hit a big-time basket when we needed a bucket. So I was really proud of her. I
thought Briahanna Jackson came in and gave us a lift and did some good things
for us. Sam Fuehring hit two big shots there in the first half.  
  
You know, it was a team effort. I'll tell you, Sydney Zambrotta is one that
you look at the stat sheet and you're not even going to see that she did much
except for pick up two fouls, but she picked up a huge charge. Then all I care
about is plus-minus. At the end of the day, I look at when they're in the
game, what did we do as a team? And I'm really looking forward to seeing what
she did in her six minutes, because I'm willing to bet you we're probably a
plus-six or plus-eight in the six minutes that she was in the game.  
  
Because it puts another shooter on the floor, which then helped spread the
floor, which is what we needed to do, because things were getting a little
clogged up and jammed up, and they were backing off our non-shooters. But she
did a really nice job of coming in there and staying composed and doing what
we needed her to do.  
  
Q. Coach, we just saw a video of you coming into the locker room for the
first time after the game. What was that moment like?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, it was great. You know, it's exciting to see these kids and as
excited as they are. I demand a lot from them, because I just don't know any
other way to do it. It takes hard work. If you want to be great at something,
you've got to put the time in, the effort in, and the work. I hold them
accountable to that.  
  
So I know what we've gone through. I know how hard they've worked. To see the
celebration, the excitement, the smiles on their face is what makes this job
as fun as it is and makes everything worthwhile.  
  
Q. In the first three quarters, it seemed every time you'd get a little
separation, Jaime Nared would come in and nail something on you. She had quite
the game this evening.  
COACH WALZ: She's a big-time player. Nared, Russell, Reynolds, DeShields, you
just go through the list, they're all big-time players. We lost her a few
times at the three-point line, which I can't even make an excuse for because
it was just bad. She made some tough shots too.  
  
But it's like I try to tell them, we started the game with some breakdowns, so
she got some open looks. She knocks down two in a row, and all of a sudden
she's got confidence. You can't do that against good players.  
  
What I did think we did well with her was forcing her at times to turn the
ball over. I thought we then got some pressure on her and we were able to
create some turnovers.  
  
Q. How did you keep Mariya encouraged with a game like this? Her NCAA
Tournament games hadn't exactly been great.  
COACH WALZ: They've been bad.  
  
Q. Yeah, okay. I was being kind.  
COACH WALZ: We keep things real around here.  
  
Q. Okay, in particular the three-point shooting, how do you keep a
player like that encouraged when they struggle like that?  
COACH WALZ: As we keep telling them, shooters shoot. What I did is I told her
after we came back from the ACC Tournament, I'm like, Mariya, if you trust me
with anything, when you shoot, follow your shot. Just run after it. Shoot it
and go after it.  
  
The same thing I told Antonita Slaughter four years ago, if you go back and
look at the way she played for the NCAA Tournament. As we like to say, she
couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. Antonita was just throwing a brick. It
was awful. I finally told her, Antonita, when you shoot it, just go run after
it and get it. I told Mariya the same thing.  
  
What that does for some of these kids is now you stay with your shot. Instead
of falling back, you get balanced. I just said, keep following it. I was
really proud of her, because every one she took tonight, she stayed with. She
didn't release it and get back. She kept going with her shot. And we made some
big ones. She made some big ones. It was a great ballgame for her, and I
thought she rebounded the ball extremely well, too, especially at the
offensive end.  
  
Q. Pretty evenly matched game for the most part. Both teams kind of had
some scoring droughts, had some struggles. What do you think it was that
really set you guys apart?  
COACH WALZ: I thought we executed extremely well. When I go back and look at
this game, I think we may have called three timeouts or four timeouts, three
of them I think for sure on baseline out of bounds where we got tangled up, we
called timeout, and I think we scored off every single baseline out of bounds
play that we had.  
  
What makes this game fun for me is there are two or three that we just drew up
in the timeout that we hadn't run before. Because you get a feel of how
they're guarding you and what we're going to do. As a coach, that's what makes
it fun. But you've got to have players that can sit there for two minutes or
30 seconds, see it, and then go out and execute it. And we did. We made big-
time baskets at crunch time when we needed them.  
  
Q. How important was it to kind of break through this level and get to
the Sweet Sixteen and for these young players to experience what they're about
to experience?  
COACH WALZ: I think it was an important step for especially Mariya, Myisha.
And Myisha said it perfect, her freshman year we get to the Sweet Sixteen, but
like I always told Mariya and Myisha, all they had to do was score. I had Bria
Smith out there guarding two people at one time because Mariya wouldn't guard
anybody. Shawnta Dyer's out there guarding Myisha's man too. All they had to
worry about was scoring.  
  
Now they've got to do a little bit of all. I was really proud of them. I mean,
Myisha, and I'll show her on film, this was probably one of the best games
she's played since she's been here because she stayed engaged. She missed some
shots, she didn't make things, but she kept rebounding, kept defending. And
normally she'll check out on me for three or four minutes, and she did not do
that tonight. That's her next step in the evolution of her game.  
  
Q. Coach, going back now to Oklahoma City and potentially facing the
same team you did back there in 2013, what kind of memories does that bring
back? What do you need to do to replicate that magic that you guys had the
last time you were there?  
COACH WALZ: Well, four years ago it was a special run that we put together.
You know, Shawny is not going to come back and play, Antonita is not. So we're
going with this group. It's a whole new team, it's a new year. Sure, it's
going to be fun for us as a coaching staff and Cortnee Walton because Cortnee
was a part of that team to walk into that arena. You know, just kind of put a
smile on your face, going, boy, we did some pretty special things here four
years ago.  
  
But you can't really look back at the game and take anything from it.
Everybody has pretty much moved on from their team, from our team. It's just
going to be a great ballgame whoever we would play.  
  
Q. Holly was a little reluctant to give you guys credit for the
defensive effort you put up. She said there were a number of factors that
contributed to their loss. So looking at it from your side of the fence, what
is the one big thing that you think contributed to you guys winning and them
losing?  
COACH WALZ: We scored more points. That's really what it comes down to. To me,
it doesn't bother me if somebody doesn't say we did this good, we did that
good. At the end of the day, we've just got to figure out a way to score more
points, and we did that tonight. I've never seen a game, for the 20 years I've
been doing it, 2-0. So we figured out a way to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Like I said, I thought we executed. I thought our execution was off the chart
at times. I thought we did a great job on our baseline out of bounds defense.
We came up with two steals and then forced them into some bad shots where
we're getting lay-ups on ours. That's what we take pride in. We take a lot of
pride in how we sit there and go through and execute. It was fun to watch.  
  
Q. I'll try not to get you in trouble on this, so I'll ask it this way:
When one team gets 18 out of 20 of their free throw attempts, what do you say
to your kids to keep them focused?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it was poor coaching. It was poor coaching. I've got to do a
better job of figuring out a way to get our kids to the free-throw line.
That's all it is. I'm just bad at what I do when it comes to that. Okay. I
thought we did some really nice things of driving the ball to the basket. I
thought we attacked, but I've got to do a better job of teaching them how to
get fouled. So that's what it comes down to. It's all on me.  
  
Q. This question's for Lola. Lola, how do you think Dad did tonight?  
LOLA WALZ: Good.  
  
Q. Is he the best coach you know?  
LOLA WALZ: Yes.  
  
Q. Thank you, Lola.  
COACH WALZ: Did you cheer hard tonight?  
  
LOLA WALZ: Yes.  
  
COACH WALZ: Who did you cheer for? Tell him who you cheered for.  
  
LOLA WALZ: Mariya and Myisha and Asia.  
  
COACH WALZ: All right. Thank you, everybody. And I really appreciate the media
coming out here. We just really, really appreciate it. Thanks so much.

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Diamond and Mercedes, and then Coach. Questions
for the Lady Vols.  
  
Q. Diamond, you and Durr are both from the Atlanta area. Just a reminder
how many good players come out of there. How do you think that impacted your
game and helped you develop, just playing against really good competition in
the Atlanta area?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Well, it's all I know. Being from a state where we have
very talented basketball players, you kind of know what you're getting into
when you sign up to play basketball. You're going to play against All-
Americans, top talent in the country always.  
  
So Asia's always been younger than me, so I've never really had any
competitions against her. Yeah, I was probably just older and she was probably
just younger. I don't even really remember. Maybe once. But, still, you have
those other players.  
  
Q. You guys have had some good wins over No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in this
tournament this season. But is there any one game that's a win or loss that
stands out to you that you guys played your best?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I wouldn't pick just one. I think all of those wins were
huge for us. Just how we played reflected our game a lot. Just all of those
games from start to finish we played hard for 40 minutes. We were all focused
and our effort was on 100%, and I think that's what we're going to need from
tomorrow night.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, same. The games we win, we always do what we're
supposed to do. It's like when we do what we're supposed to do, we win. When
we don't, we lose, and it's always a disappointment.  
  
But in the games that we win, you know, we just do what we're supposed to do,
and the game is just easy and everyone's having fun. Like I can't say that any
one stands out more than the other.  
  
Q. Diamond, do you like playing against teams like Louisville which kind
of play a similar style to you guys -- up-tempo, aggressive defense, just keep
the ball moving, really push it in transition?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: I wouldn't say I have any preference for like a style of
team. I know it will be a good opportunity for us on both ends of the court.
They have some athletes, and I know it will be an up-tempo style of game.  
  
So, I mean, we're always looking forward to having the test of your abilities
against somebody with similar abilities.  
  
Q. Mercedes, when you look at Louisville, is there any one thing that
stands out to you that will be hard to defend or to adjust to?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I just think from top to bottom they're an overall good
team. They have guards that can penetrate and kick. They have a couple good
shooters on that team and some pretty good rebounders. We've got the same on
our team, so I think it will be a great matchup.  
  
Q. Diamond, the one time you're here in Louisville playing here, your
dad is actually in Arizona. How do you feel about him not being here and kind
of missing this game?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: It's kind of normal, you know? We're like usually like two
trains crossing in the night sometimes. Literally, he'll be in the city, and
then the day he's leaving, I'm coming in. Or like my brother, it's the same
way. We never really count on seeing each other play live as much as we just
try to catch the games on television or something. I'm not upset about it. I
know he's working doing what he wants to do, and I'm happy for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Holly, Asia is one of the best players in the country. Just address
the challenges that she'll present for you defensively?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I've watched Asia since she was a young kid. She just has
the complete package. She's a terrific shooter, terrific three-point shooter,
can get her shot off at any time, is a penetrator. I think the best thing Asia
Durr does is she's a great passer. A great passer. So I think she's a complete
package, and she's going to be a difficult defend for us.  
  
Q. When Diamond had a really efficient game, you talked about how
efficient she was in that game. Is it hard sometimes for her? I mean, not to
force things, because with the offense not functioning well, you almost kind
of need her to force things. Is that kind of a fine line?  
COACH WARLICK: It is. I think Diamond is an extremely competitive young lady,
and sometimes I think she thinks she has to do everything by herself. When
things may not be going right for us, she feels like she's got to step up and
do more. I think Diamond's really efficient when she plays within our team and
our concepts.  
  
Again, I think Diamond's one of the best players. She's one of the best
passers for us as well. I think Diamond, she stays in our game plan and works
with our team, we're really, really good. But, again, she's a competitor, and
sometimes she feels like she thinks she has to take the game over.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about consistency issues this season. Do
you think that you guys are in a place mentally now where that won't be an
issue going forward?  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. I think we came back from the SEC Tournament and
really dialed into the two weeks we had to prepare. I thought the prep for
yesterday's game was probably the best we've had in a long time. Just focused,
dialed in, and I had that same feeling last night when we got back and this
morning.  
  
So I think we're in a good place. I think we understand that we've all got to
be on the same page. And as Diamond says, we've got to come up with a game
plan and we've got to stick to it. I keep telling them sometimes don't make
things up. And when we make things up, we're not a very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Holly, you've had so many great players in the program. I guess you
think of Holdsclaw, Catchings, Parker, Bridgette Gordon. Talent-wise, is
DeShields kind of in that same class, or is that saying too much?  
COACH WARLICK: No, I think Diamond is a talent in that class. I think God has
blessed Diamond with a lot of talent. She's worked at her skillset. I think
she can do things that Catchings did. She can do things that Holdsclaw did.
But she could learn from them as well.  
  
I think Diamond is a better rebounder than she is right now. She can rebound
more. But I think she has the skillset to get a shot off when she wants to.
She has a skillset to be a great defender like Tamika Catchings. So I think
she's got so many different attributes from everybody else that we put her in
that class.  
  
Q. I just asked the players this as well, but is there any game from
this season that you think sticks out to you as the way you want your team to
play?  
COACH WARLICK: Gosh, I think they've all come at times when it seems like we
have struggled before. Probably my game I keep going back to is Mississippi
State, and we're playing in front of 15,000 people and we're just playing.
It's just a great feel. We're playing together, we're moving the ball. The
ball's not stuck in our hands. Different people are stepping up, hitting
shots. We're getting great stops on the defensive end.  
  
Again, and it all boils down to: Are you dialed in? Are you focused? And they
were spot on that game. So if I could bottle that game, regardless of who
we're playing, it would be awesome.  
  
Q. When you're in a man, would Reynolds figure to guard Durr?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, it depends on what lineup. They've used so many different
lineups. They can go small. They can go more guard oriented. I think we're
going to have to guard Durr with a variety of people. I think Jordan's going
to have to do it. I think Diamond's going to have to do it. I think Meme
Jackson's going to have to come in and be solid on her. So I don't know if we
can keep one player on her and be successful. I think we're going to have to
move people around and give it a shot.  
  
Q. This program has a really established postseason history. But Jeff
Walz has made that a tradition here at Louisville as well. When you're going
up against a team and a coach you know also has a lot of NCAA experience, I
mean, does that make the matchup all the more exciting?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think it's exciting when you have two teams, as Diamond
said, are similar. I think they play hard, they're well coached. You're in the
NCAA tournament and you're trying to advance. So I think that will bring some
excitement as well.  
  
It's here. They had a great crowd yesterday. So I think both styles are apt to
bring excitement, because we're both up and down. We're athletic, we can
rebound, shoot the threes.  
  
So, as we're similar teams, we may go inside more than they do, but they
stretch the floor out and have players that can face up. So I would think this
game would be really fun to watch.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Louisville student-athletes, and then
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, you and DeShields are from the same area. I'm just wondering if
you maybe played against her in AAU ball, and whether you did or not, have you
seen her play, and what are your impressions of her as a player?  
ASIA DURR: She's a great player. I've never played against her. I think we had
a chance to in travel ball, but it never happened. She's very talented. She's
a well-coached player as well. I think she's projected to be the first round
draft pick, so that she's -- she's a great player.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. Just yesterday when you guys were sitting
out there watching that game against Dayton, what are some of the key things
that you noticed? Was there anything you noticed that changed what your
previous impression had been of them? Myisha first?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, they're a great team. They get up and down the court
really well. They have good guard play, and they defend. It's going to be a
hard-fought game that's going to go down to the wire. We just have to play
hard for 40 minutes.  
  
ASIA DURR: I'm going to go off of what she just said. They're a scrappy team
as well. They play hard. They trap a lot too. What I saw with them is that
when they get stops, they love to run, so we have to be careful of that. We
have to be cautious of that, too, and we have to be aware.  
  
Q. Asia, over the course of the season, really two seasons, have you
pretty much faced every kind of defense? Is there kind of a normal as to how
teams try to defend you?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I would say I've seen all kinds of things. I've seen a box
and one. I've seen teams that played us a triangle two as well.  
  
So I think we just all have to be on the same page as well. It's not about me.
It's about the whole team. I think we have to be on point for tomorrow's game
because they're a great team. It's going to take the whole team and not just
me.  
  
Q. Getting back, you mentioned the trapping defense that Tennessee did.
Both of you guys did that very successfully yesterday, it really disrupted the
opponents. Do you kind of envision a game where both teams are getting after
it with pressure defense tomorrow night?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Of course, we're both aggressive teams. We like to get out
in transition. And the way you get out in transition is pressuring your
defender. Both teams do that very well. So I think you're going to see a lot
of trapping.  
  
On our part, you're going to see a lot of mad dogs so we can get out in
transition, because that's how we like to run. I wouldn't expect anything less
from them as well, because they feed off their defense, and that's how they
play.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing as her. We both do those things well. We
trap the ball well. We're both a scrappy team, so it's going to be a great
game. We're all excited for it as well to see how this goes.  
  
Q. Tennessee's had some wins over teams like Notre Dame and South
Carolina that you guys kind of struggled against. When you look at how they
played against those teams, what are you thinking, and does that affect at all
how you're going into this game?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it's the same thing that I've been saying. They're a
great team. Very talented. They have a great coach as well. So we're going to
get their best shot. We're going to get everybody's best shot, because this is
the tournament. Nobody wants to go home, so that's what it's all up to now.  
  
Q. Is this the sort of game you really look forward to when you come to
a school like this? The way this thing lines up, this could be a Sweet 16 or
even an Elite Eight game, but here it is in the second round.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, I know it's not just for me, but for everyone. This
is why we came here, to play in front of the amazing fans that we have.
Tennessee has amazing fans.  
  
So, I mean, this is why we came here, to play the top of the top and to get to
a Final Four. What better way to do that than here at home and to play a tough
team. Because once you get past this team, you have another tough team and
another tough team. So, I mean, it's setting us up for success because we're
going to be able to play our game. Tennessee's such a great team, they're
going to help us get better if we're able to get past them.  
  
Q. Jeff, just looking at your roster, it's a travel-cade, got players
from all over. Did you recruit nationally as soon as you got here? Is that
kind of how it's gone after you've been here awhile and built up a successful
record?  
COACH WALZ: We've always tried to start here in our city, our state,
surrounding states, and then work our way out. We've had a lot of success in
California and some different places. We're now down in Texas.  
  
Really, when it comes to recruiting, you're trying to find the players who are
also interested in you, not just ones you want. Because there's a list of the
ones that I want that weren't interested in me. So we go out there and we
watch a lot of kids play and try to get that feel of, okay, she has genuine
interest in our program, our university, our academics, and then you proceed
from them. We like it that we have players from all over, but we do have our
state taken care of with some very talented players, and we're excited with
that also.  
  
Q. Tennessee has their marquee wins over Stanford, Kentucky, Notre Dame,
but then they have a couple unexpected losses to teams like Alabama. What do
you make of that?  
COACH WALZ: I don't make anything of it. That doesn't even cross my mind.
We're playing a team tomorrow that's beaten two No. 1 seeds, two No. 2 seeds.
They're as talented as anyone in this tournament. It's tournament time.
Everybody's going to give it their best shot. There is no overlooking anyone.
Because if you don't take care of tomorrow, there is no next game.  
  
So I'm expecting them to play at the highest level that they can possibly
play, and we're going to have to do the same thing. I'm expecting a great
ballgame. There is no doubt that this could be one of the better, if not best,
second-round games that has presented itself.  
  
Q. The last couple years you've been able to host a lot of home
tournament games. Tomorrow night, Monday night at 6:30 against the Lady Vols,
what kind of atmosphere do you expect from your fans?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we're very fortunate, very pleased that it was a 6:30 tip
time, especially in women's basketball, because we get a lot of families and
seniors that come out to support us. And a 9:00 tip time is hard. So we're
really excited about the 6:30 tip.  
  
We'd love to see us get between 8- to 10,000 in here for Monday night. You
know, we're at 5,400, I believe, for yesterday's games, but I'm challenging
our fans, challenging our city, to see if we can't get 8- to 10,000 out here
for Monday night's game, because it's going to be a great basketball game.  
  
I had a college teammate of mine that came down from northern Kentucky. It was
the first game that he had seen us play. And, actually, I believe the first
women's game he had seen in some years. And he just commented to me afterwards
he was just so impressed with how athletic and talented the girls were. And I
told him: Our biggest challenge, I think, in women's basketball is to get
people to come out one time. Get them to come out one time to see what these
young women can do, and normally people are impressed, they're surprised, and
normally you get them to come back.  
  
The great thing about it, I know he brought down his boy who is in the sixth
grade and his buddy is in the sixth grade, and they want to come back down
tomorrow night. Now it's convincing Dad to bring them back down.  
  
But when you get the kids hooked, it's hard for parents to say no.  
  
So we've got to continue to do our job as coaches and go out there and promote
our programs and make sure that our fans are able to feel a part of it.  
  
I think that's the other big thing in our game. You've got to go out and make
sure that your fans feel that they're a part of your program, not just
cheering for it. And that's one of the reasons we sign autographs after every
home game, win or lose. Wins are easy. A loss, your true character comes out.
And I tell our kids that every time. You've got to be able to take that. You
get beat, it's tough, no one likes to lose, but you've got to be able to flip
that switch and go sign some autographs and put that smile on your face. I
truly believe your true character comes out in situations like that.  
  
So it's something we have to do. I'm hoping Monday night we can get 8- to
10,000 in this place.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little about the challenge that DeShields presents
for defense, also what Asia brings to your offense and your overall team?  
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, DeShields, I'm hoping she thinks the game starts
at 9:30. She's so explosive. She's got an unbelievable pull-up jumpshot,
extremely quick, pushes the ball in transition as fast as any player I've seen
on film. Rises up over top of people.  
  
I thought in yesterday's game -- I read the quotes from Dayton's Coach Shauna,
and I thought she was exactly right. I thought they defended her well on a few
occasions, she just rose up over top of them and shot it. There's not much you
can do about that.  
  
So she presents some problems. You know, their post game, I thought their post
game was very good yesterday. So they have a lot of people on the floor that
can score. You've got to make sure that you're prepared. At times you're going
to have to guard too. You're going to have to look like you're guarding two
people at one time because that's how good they can be. You can't stand and
watch. So it's going to present some challenges, but one our kids are excited
about.  
  
Asia has been playing with a lot of confidence the last month and a half, and
I'm really excited for her. She's really been efficient, which is important.
She scored 26 or 27 in yesterday's game, but only took 16 shots. When you can
do that, then you're really starting to get something accomplished out there.  
  
But we're going to need our bench to step up. We're going to need everybody to
contribute. It might not be 16 or 18 points, but we're going to need to make
open shots.  
  
Q. Asia and Myisha both describe Tennessee as scrappy. What kind of
challenges does that present when you face a team that's scrappy like that?  
COACH WALZ: Well, they hustle. That's one thing about them. I watched them in
yesterday's game, the ball's going out of bounds, it looks like it's just
going to bounce out, and they fly after it, throw it back inbounds and it
turns into a lay-up.  
  
You know, they're on the ground after 50-50 balls, which is something that
we've talked about this entire year. If you want a chance to keep advancing in
postseason, you've got to win the 50-50 balls. That's something I think both
teams take a lot of pride in and something we're going to have to really put a
lot of emphasis in for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You just alluded to your bench. How important do you feel your depth
has to be in tomorrow's game?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think it's going to be important for us. We play games
where Asia's played 40 minutes, Myisha's played 39 minutes, Mariya's played 40
minutes, yes. But when we get the performance like we got out of Jazmine Jones
yesterday, it helps, because now all of a sudden, you're putting a different
dynamic on the floor with her athleticism, her ability to rise up over people
and shoot.  
  
I thought Sam Fuehring did some good things in yesterday's game. Ciera
Johnson's going to be important in tomorrow night's game because of their
size. We're going to need our bench prepared to play. We're going to need our
bench ready when their name is called to go out there and perform.  
  
This time of year, you don't have three minutes to get loose. You know, when
you go out there, you've got to make a difference from the start. It might not
mean you score, but you've got to be able to defend. You've got to be able to
rebound. You can't be like: Coach, I just need a few more minutes. I'm
starting to get a sweat going. That has to be taken care of before you get in
the game.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Tennessee - 66, Dayton - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes?  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you. Thank you. Just loved our effort tonight. I thought
Dayton was just -- they're an outstanding basketball team. They challenged us
in every aspect of the game. Had a great year, but I loved our focus. I loved
our energy, and I loved our resilience. So I can't say enough about this team
and what they did tonight.  
  
Q. Diamond, were you ill there late in the game? You went off the court,
and then came back and never went back in the game. Are you okay?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yes, I'm fine. Just had to handle a little situation, but
I'm all good now.  
  
Q. Diamond, I had the pleasure of covering your dad in the majors, your
brother when he played for Lexington Legends. What have you learned from them
about being on the big stage that helped you with this game and the big games
that are coming down the road for you?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Just to attack the moment. When you're on the big stage,
you can't shy away from that. I've seen my brother in Cooperstown and on
numerous big stages. I've seen my dad play on numerous big stages. Just that
competitiveness runs in our family. So just never to shy away from it, attack
it, and be who you are, no matter where you're playing.  
  
Q. Diamond, you now have 1,000 points as a Lady Vol. How does that feel?
That's what Twitter says, at least.  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: I mean, points are -- I mean, points are what I do. I'd be
more excited for like an assist record or a steals record or rebounding or
something like that. My point is like I never really got too high about points
because that's what my team expects me to give each and every night. That's my
job. So had it been like 1,000 rebounds, I'd have been like, what? That's
crazy. But I'm happy. This is what I came here to do and be a contributor, so
it's nice to be rewarded.  
  
Q. This is for both players. Dayton came in as one of the top teams in
the country in field goal defense. What were you able to do, especially there
in the second half, to really kind of overcome the defense that they put on
you guys, especially after that second quarter where you guys only made 4 of
16 shots?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think just from the start, us attacking them in transition
really helped us out with easy buckets. On the offensive end we were really
moving the ball well and getting good cuts and getting good looks at the
basket.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, just to piggyback off what Mercedes said, but we were
also taking care of the basketball. So we were utilizing the possessions that
we had, and we were able to get good open shots, and we were hitting those
shots.  
  
Q. Holly talked about the effort and energy of this team tonight. But
that 14-point lead did get away from you. Do you have a sense yet of why this
team at times kind of finds the challenging way to do things, I guess?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: No, I don't. That's been a question we've been trying to
answer all year, really. But you can't expect a team like Dayton to just give
up. They're here for a reason. So you can look at it and say we gave up the
lead, but on the other side they fought back.  
  
They're a hard-working team, a well-coached team. And they weren't going to
let us just run the score up on them. They kept playing hard and came back at
us when we did go on our run. So credit to them for not giving up.  
  
Q. Mercedes and Diamond, Dayton kind of wrote this off as a bad day at
the office where they missed shots they normally make. But did you feel like
from watching them on tape and then playing the game that you were doing
things that affected them offensively and got them out of their comfort zone,
maybe?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I definitely think our defensive pressure was huge tonight.
We had three keys for Dayton. It was guarding the three-point line, playing
defense without fouling, and boxing out. And, honestly, I think we did a
pretty good job of all three all night.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, they got a few open looks, especially in the second
quarter when they made their run and tied the game back up. But we were just
pressuring them. I'm sure it's unlike anything they've seen all year. Yeah,
they missed a couple open shots, but the majority of the time we were in their
space and taking away their three-point opportunity.  
  
Q. When coaches look at a bad game, a bad shooting game, is there a
tendency to blame it on your own team as opposed to giving the opposing
defense credit?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you know, I do think they missed some shots that they
would normally hit. I thought our defense affected them. I'm sure our defense
wore them down a little bit.  
  
I mean, our goal was to pressure the ball. It was to deny one pass away, we
didn't want any high post catches, and if they did, it was away from the
basket. So I think at times we made them work to get good looks.  
  
And they missed -- fourth quarter they missed open shots, and I think it was
the pace of the game, our pressure, and it wears you down a little bit. That's
what we wanted to do. That's what we wanted to do. I agree with her. I think,
too, it has something to do with our pressure as well.  
  
Q. Even with that early lead getting away, you felt like this was a full
40-minute effort? And if so, how often have you seen that this season?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought it was a great effort. I can't say enough about -- I
thought Schaquilla Nunn was outstanding. We don't win the game if she doesn't
get 15 rebounds and she shoots 6 for 10. She just competed. Because we were
getting good looks, and then that second quarter the shots weren't falling,
and I just thought -- then Jamie Nared got into foul trouble. So I thought
Schaquilla was just absolutely huge.  
  
Obviously, Diamond, we went to her. We're going to go to her. Mercedes kind of
stepped up in the third and fourth quarter, but I also want to give credit to
Jordan. She didn't shoot the ball well, but she led our basketball team, and I
thought we gave great effort for 40 minutes.  
  
Second quarter, they got a little hot. We didn't do what we needed to do as
far as switching and attacking the ball. But overall, really, really pleased
with people stepping up and staying consistent.  
  
Q. What is it that Dayton brought as an opponent that you didn't really
expect or wasn't prepared for that could help you as you move through the
tournament here?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I tell you what they did, they're a great three-point
shooting team, and at times it's given us fits throughout the year. I thought
for the most part we took away their looks to get three-point shots. They're a
great rebounding team, and that was one of our big points, is don't get
outrebounded.  
  
So they're a team that at times has been our weakness, giving up offensive
rebounds, giving up three-point shots, giving up drives to the basket. So they
challenged us in every aspect of the game. And that's what makes a good team.
Shoots the three. Can penetrate, rebounds. This is a tough team to guard, it's
a tough team to defend, and it's a tough team to win against.  
  
Q. I think with today's win you guys are now like 29-1 in first-round
games in the NCAA Tournament. Obviously you guys are one of the more if not
the most historic program in women's basketball. What is it about just being
able to be that dominant and being in the tournament every year, and not just
be in the tournament every year, but advance and move on?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you all know we've had such a rich tradition of women's
basketball, and it started with Coach Summitt, and it's up to this team and
our coaches to continue that culture.  
  
At times the last couple of years we hadn't been at our best. But it seems
like in tournament times, these kids rise up and they accept the challenge.
And it is a culture. It's what they come to Tennessee for, is to play an NCAA
Tournament and compete for championships. So if I can just get them to act
like the tournament's all year round, I'd be in business (laughing).  
  
But I've said all along, they're kids that work hard. They work hard. But we
let things get in the way sometimes during the game.  
  
All in all, I will say this: This last two weeks they've been the most focused
that I've seen them pretty much all year. They've been tuned in, focused and
asking a lot of questions, meaningful questions. So I'm just was pleased with
how they played and how they finished the game. It's a product of how we've
been practicing.  
  
Q. When you say that you let things get in the way during games at
times, do you mean physically or mentally with this game?  
COACH WARLICK: I think both. I think mentally we check out sometimes. We have
in the past. I think we're in really good shape. I think sometimes we don't
box out, and that's a physical part of the game.  
  
It just goes down to just the game, when we're clicking on all cylinders and
everybody's doing their part -- tonight I ask them: You've just got to bring
me your best. Just bring me your best. And I thought they did that tonight.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 82, Chattanooga - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to have Coach with an opening statement, and then
we'll have questions for the student-athletes for a few minutes coach,
congratulations.  
  
COACH WALZ: Thank you. I'd like to start off by first congratulating Coach
Foster and Chattanooga on a great season. They do a good job with that
program.  
  
We knew it was going to be a tough ballgame throughout. We were able to pull
away there towards the end, but it was never a game I felt really comfortable,
especially with the way they shoot the three. But really, really pleased.
Looking forward to have the opportunity to play on Monday night and see what
we can do.  
  
Q. Asia, you had a fairly good game out there today. Your teammates were
really finding you in some great spots, weren't they?  
ASIA DURR: They did, yes. Ra, she had a great game. She had ten assists. They
just did a great job of finding me on the court. And Coach Walz called a few
plays for me as well, and I was able to knock the shot down.  
  
Q. Jaz, you've had maybe two of your best games this year against the
same team, Chattanooga. Would you like to play them maybe four or five times
next year?  
JAZMINE JONES: Chattanooga's a really good team. I was just doing what Coach
was asking me to do all the time. It just so happened that I had a good game.  
  
Q. If all three players would comment about this. You all shot 60% from
the field, and if I can get my stat sheet up here, I think you had 28 assists
on 36 baskets in an NCAA game. That's hard to do. Talk about that. Was
everybody sharing the ball, getting the ball? What was it today? Asia first,
please.  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it starts in practice. Each day we have to get up a
certain amount of shots, and that's where it starts. It doesn't start in the
game. It starts in practice.  
  
Coach Walz says you can't just come in the gym and just shoot during practice.
You have to get more shots than that. It definitely showed. Our bench, how
many points did they have? We had 23 bench points or something like that, and
that was really good. So our hard work is paying off.  
  
Q. Myisha?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Just to go off Asia, when we passed the ball, we were a
great team. When we got in transition, we were a great team, and that's what
we were able to do. Getting rebounds and pushing the ball up the court and
running. We're just a great transition team. So that helped a lot.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: Yeah, just to piggyback off what they said, when we passed the
ball, we passed the ball extremely well tonight, and we were sharing it well.
What Coach says: Don't stand around and watch. Move when you don't have the
basketball. We got easy lay-ups, and it was great.  
  
Q. Jazmine, you said you were just doing what Coach asked you to do.
What is it he asks you to do, and how hard is it over the course of a full
season is it for you to keep doing that all the time?  
JAZMINE JONES: Name them all (laughing). Well, he always asks me to go hard.
He always asks me to go hard, be a player. Don't be a robot. And that's what I
did tonight. Him telling me that every day, it gets stuck in my head so I
can't lose it. So if I actually listen to him like I did tonight, good things
happen. Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, when Jaz is doing those things, how much different does it make
you as a team because of her athleticism and opening things up for the rest of
you?  
ASIA DURR: It makes us a hugely different team because she can do more than
just shoot. She can crash, she can defend, she's getting better at that too.
You know, she's just a great player, and she's finally showing that. We've
believed in her since day one. Like she said during practice, Coach Walz stays
after her at all times because he knows what she can do for us. And that's
what she did.  
  
Q. Myisha, you all had -- points in the paint were 46 points in the
paint. Their coach says, well, if you give up the points in the paint, do you
sacrifice the outside and vice versa? They had seven blocks against you the
first time. Only had one tonight. Was that the result of you just running your
offense? What was it?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No. In practice leading up to this game we knew that she
had seven blocks against us, so we were worried about that. It's basically
just going up strong every time. Not really being afraid, but just knowing
that she's there because she's capable of blocking shots. She leads the
country in blocked shots. So we knew that going into the game. We just have to
go up strong and finish through contact. We did that today with 46 points in
the paint.  
  
Q. This is for anybody. 14 players got some minutes today. Was fatigue
an issue today looking into Monday? Were maybe minutes a concern?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: For our team? No, everyone's capable of playing. I think
Coach Walz has a game plan, and just getting everyone in. Because you never
know who you're going to need in this tournament. So just getting them ready
for any game at any moment. So just having all these different players and
trying to find the right ones to be out there so we could run the game, I
think that was like the biggest thing. Coach Walz and the coaching staff
having a game plan, and knowing who needs to step in at the game to have the
right five out on the court.  
  
Q. Myisha, they started off really hot from three, and they were leading
you by one point. I think you guys had a 13-0 run there in the first quarter.
Were you starting to get worried the way the game was starting? What kind of
caused that regroup?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, like we said, they're a great team, so everyone team's
going to have a run. It's just how you react to it. If we want to make a run
in the NCAA Tournament, we need to know that teams are going to make runs, but
it's how we react to those runs. So we held our composure. Our mad dog was
really working. We were playing aggressive and able to get stops in that. And
that led us to getting transition buckets.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the difference between Chattanooga as opposed to when
you played them last time? What did they present one game versus this one?  
COACH WALZ: We knew they were very patient. We were trying to get the game a
little bit faster. So even at the start when they were scoring, I felt it was
still a good tempo. Like we wanted to get up more shots. We wanted to get it
to be a little faster game. So by doing that, you're going to give up easy
baskets.  
  
I thought we got the tempo where we wanted it. To score 82 points on that
ballclub is not easy to do. I told them before the game started in the locker
room, you know, it was probably going to be a 55- to 56-shot game for us. And
it ended up being 59. Normally we're trying to get into a game where we're
getting 70 in the possessions.  
  
So we knew they were going to be very patient. So we thought we were doing a
good job defensively on them. But give them credit because they did shoot the
ball well from the three-point line which caused some problems.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same questions I asked the players about the 28
assists on 36 baskets. Is that good enough for you?  
COACH WALZ: No, it's great. We passed the ball well and made open shots. It's
no secret. We found each other open with wide-open looks, and that's what you
have to do. If you want to continue to advance, you've got to be able to take
open shots. It's not the contested shots, the tough ones, it's the open ones.
I was very pleased with how unselfish we were with the ball, how quickly we
moved it at times and we're willing to make the extra pass.  
  
Q. Was that what you wanted from Jazmine, and when she's on, how
different does that make your team?  
COACH WALZ: Jaz and her athleticism and ability to do things with the
basketball, it's one of the reasons we had recruited her. She's young. She has
a lot to learn still. But she's going to continue to get better. For us to
continue to move on, we're going to have to have Jaz, Kylee, Ciera, players
come off the bench and give us some numbers.  
  
And that's what happened tonight. I feel pretty confident right now with what
we're going to get from Myisha and Asia tonight. I thought Mariya played well
tonight. But she struggled the past month. She goes two of three from the
three-point line, which was encouraging to see. We're going to need to
continue having solid bench play.  
  
Q. Jeff, what kind of read have you had from this team over the season?
Have the bumps been where you thought they'd be?  
COACH WALZ: It's been a good year. We're sitting here 28-7. We've kind of
stayed around the Top 10, top 12 the entire year. But we've had some ballgames
that were right there. N.C. State here at home goes to overtime, we lose. It's
a five-point game at Florida State, you know? And we lose. Duke, a three
(indiscernible). So we've had a lot of -- Maryland here at home is a six-point
game.  
  
We've had a lot of ballgames that we have to be able to close out. That's
going to be the test from here on out because no matter who we play on Monday
night, I expect it to be a great basketball game and one that's going to go
down to the wire.  
  
You know, when you're playing for a chance to go to the Sweet Sixteen, you
know, nobody's going to go out there and not give 100% effort.  
  
I'm just really going to be excited about how hard we come out and play,
because you have to win every 50-50 ball. You've got to be the one who comes
up with the 50-50 balls. I actually thought Chattanooga started the game doing
that. One of the highlights to me on Chattanooga was the end of the first
half.  
  
And I pointed it out to my players. When they took the shot and their two kids
went up after that offensive rebound and knocked each other on the floor, they
went after the ball. I pointed that out to our kids, that's how we have to go
after it. I thought we did that in the second half.  
  
Q. Your assist to turnover ratio was obviously great. The number of
points you got off the assists was obviously great. But two things have to
happen. Your players have to be able to see that they have players open to get
the ball to and do it quickly. Are you surprised that that happened today? Is
that the type of effort you'll need in that next game coming up?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yeah, we're going to need that same effort on Monday night.
You know, I'm not really surprised. We've actually been playing much better
the past month. Shooting percentage has been up. We've been getting the ball
moving. Instead of holding it and occupying the ball, we're getting it out of
our hands quicker. So now your teammates open. We're making somebody flying at
us. Now we put it on the ground and it's a one-two pull up, an open shot. The
longer you hold the ball, the worst things that are going to happen.  
  
So we have been preaching to them, get it moving, get it moving. And we had a
week to work on it. That two-week break between the ACC Tournament and the
NCAA Tournament, we had a solid week to work on half court execution,
transition game, which it paid off for us today.  
  
Q. Whoever you play, I know you don't get a choice, but you've got
history. In the next round last year, DePaul knocked you off, and the year
before, Dayton. Will you use that as any kind of, hey, look, this is a time
the last couple years this has been a bugaboo for us?  
COACH WALZ: Our kids know. Last year was a second-round game. The year before
that was a Sweet Sixteen game. At this point in time, everybody you play is
good. It's new teams. It's a new year. Our ones that got beat last year by
DePaul, it hurt. They understand that. But you can't look back and worry about
that and think, oh, my gosh. I don't want that to happen again. You've got to
go out and play and play as hard as you can for 40 minutes and see what
happens.  
  
Our kids are in a good place right now. They've competed today, which I was
really excited about. We've just got to continue to get better.  
  
Q. Everyone's kind of doing something different tonight. You had Asia
knocking it down from outside. You had Myisha on the board, Mariya with the
assist, Jazmine in transition. Are those the strengths that you think you
should be playing to from now on, or is there something else you think this
team can bring out?  
COACH WALZ: No, that's what we have to do. I thought everybody played to their
strengths. I thought Kylee did some good things for us. Kylee can run the
floor. She catches it in transition. She's able to finish. Just constantly
working on her, getting more aggressive and more physical.  
  
I thought Sam Fuehring did some good things for us too. It was a team effort.
And then when you're getting the team like Chattanooga that's going for guards
a lot, that's why we had to go with four guards. I thought Briahanna Jackson
being back was a big help for us. It gave us more depth, which is what we
need. She ends up with five assists and a turnover and six boards. I was
really pleased with what she was able to bring. I thought Taylor Johnson gave
us nine solid minutes. So we have to have that play from our team.  
  
Q. Between Tennessee and Dayton, who is one player you know you'll have
to stop going into the next round?  
COACH WALZ: All of them. Both teams have very talented players. I mean, it's a
group of kids that play hard, that know how to play. It's going to be a
challenge, one that we're excited about. It's always nice to have the
opportunity to play the next ballgame.  
  
Q. Obviously you aren't going to argue with ten assists and two
turnovers. Are you comfortable she's in a place mentally where if she needs to
look for her shot, she will?  
COACH WALZ: I am. I think her making those two shots were a big relief for
her. Seeing the ball go in was really important. I thought today she really
did a nice job. She didn't force up any shots and she was able to find her
teammates open. That's what we need. Now it might present itself on Monday
that she has to take more shots. But I thought today she didn't force anything
and did a great job of finding her teammates.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Tennessee - 66, Dayton - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Green, can you give us an opening statement, and then
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH GREEN: I mean, I'm really proud of our effort and really proud of how we
came out. It's just one of those games I felt like nothing, nothing could go
in. A lot of the shots that we normally make, and we got some good looks and
they weren't going, you shoot 20% from three, and that's not us. We rely on
those.  
  
And even with that, it was still we were still in the game. We were still
battling. I was really, really happy with our defense and the job that we did
on the people that we were concerned about. Obviously, DeShields had a great
game, but she's an unbelievable player. We had contested shots that she made
great plays, and you've got to give her credit for that.  
  
You've got to give Tennessee credit. Whenever we made a run, they came back
and made a run as well. You know, they're a tough team.  
  
But I'm really proud of our toughness and how we played defensively. And we
made runs. We kept pushing. We got it tied up at the half after being down,
and that's a testament to our players and their toughness and their belief and
their togetherness, which they've shown all year. So really happy with that.  
  
I feel for our seniors. They've done an unbelievable job here, and I've been
with them as an assistant coach and now had the privilege to coach them as a
head coach for a year. They're just unbelievable. They've set the tone. I just
can't thank them enough for everything that they've instilled into this
program and what they've given. They've made three NCAA Tournaments, and
Kelley's made four. Just really proud of them.  
  
Q. Saicha, as far as coming into the tournament, Tennessee had some size
with them, most notably with Russell and also Nunn. How did that compare with
what you faced in regular season play in non-conference play?  
SAICHA GRANT-ALLEN: Well, we definitely don't have a 6'6" girl in the A-10, so
it was a bit of a drastic change in terms of size. But our game plan didn't
change. We tried to get into the paint so Russell couldn't really foul because
she's such a significant player to that team. So we tried to get inside and
use our length too. The we're a tall team. So the game plan didn't change, but
it's definitely a difference.  
  
Q. Jenna, your coach talked about it just wasn't your day shooting
overall. But did Tennessee's athleticism and quickness on the perimeter maybe
get you guys out of your comfort zone, did you think?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I mean, yeah, it did at first, and that's why we came out to
such a slow start. But like she said, in the second quarter, we went on a
pretty big run. So I think we let the game come to us a little more after the
first quarter, and we just needed to calm down.  
  
Q. Saicha, you had come in on Russell early. Is she the best center that
you played against, do you think?  
SAICHA GRANT-ALLEN: I'm not sure the best. We've had Jonquel Jones before in
the A-10, she's also good. But she was definitely a really good player, so.  
  
Q. I think at one point your team was 1 of 16, and you kind of refer to
that in your opening remarks. When you have a team struggle like that, is
there anything you tell them or anything you talk to them about during the
timeouts or after the first quarter? And how did you see your team respond
after that? What was it that really kind of helped them get back in the
game?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, I thought we came out a little timid. That's all you talk
about all week is attacking them and being confident. We shot the ball the
last shootaround, and yesterday we shot the ball extremely well here.  
  
I just thought we were timid. So we didn't have a great start. So I just kept
telling them, yeah, we were 1 for 16, but I'm not going to tell them to stop
shooting. I'm telling them to shoot, shoot, shoot. Still yelling at Kelley to
shoot, because I thought she passed up some open jumpshots. If you're a scorer
and you're a shooter and you shoot like we shoot, you keep shooting.  
  
We wanted to get the ball inside some, and I thought we were successful. When
our bigs attacked them at times, we got lay-ups. Our guards got to the paint.
That was a big goal for us, is paint touches. We got to the rim. We couldn't
finish lay-ups either.  
  
So I think you have to give some credit to Tennessee. Their length does --
even though they alter some stuff and we haven't seen a 6'6" kid in a couple
months since Texas A&M when we faced Hillsman. Even in the back of your mind,
she tried to alter some. I think that was there.  
  
But I thought we got open looks. Our stuff was working. We were getting the
looks we wanted, we just couldn't hit them. In the past games we'd hit some of
those corner threes or hit one of those kickouts, and that would give us a lot
of momentum, and they just didn't go today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Jordan's performance today
coming off the bench? Career high 7 points, and kind of what change that made
when she went down in the third quarter?  
COACH GREEN: She was great. I thought all of our young kids were great. I
thought our bench was awesome. We talk all the time about when you come in,
you bring energy, and you add fuel to our fire. I was so happy with them.
Jayla came in and was fearless. That's what I love about her.  
  
I think sometimes when you're a senior, or even Jenna, they press because they
want it so bad, they wanted to win so bad, and sometimes you get timid. I
thought Kelley kind of did that today.  
  
So that's where sometimes the freshmen, they don't know any better. They come
in and they shoot. Jayla was a spark for us. Jordan was huge defensively,
hitting shots. And I think that was really good. I told them after the game,
after I addressed the seniors, I talked to them, because we made that run with
freshmen on the floor. I don't even know if there was a senior on the floor
during that run because Kelley was in foul trouble and Jenna was out, Lauren
was at the point. So I think that taking this and growing from this
experience, that's going to be something we can go towards next year and that
they have a taste of it and they know they can play with the best.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple times you mentioned the word "timid." Are you
surprised that the ballclub came out being timid, and knowing that you
probably prepared them for this moment and this big stage? Were you
surprised?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, the last two games in the A-10 tournament, we've had some
slow starts the first quarter. Obviously, I mean, I thought our start was
going to be really, really key today in how we came out. We've been known to
make runs and come back, and that's exactly what we did today. The exact same
pattern as our last two games in the tournament.  
  
But all we talked about was being aggressive, attacking them. Again, I think,
and I knew that initial wave of Tennessee's man-to-man when they're really up
and they're pressed in, and especially that first five minutes they were going
to really get into us. It's one thing to talk about it. It's one thing to have
your practice players do it, and it's another thing to actually feel it on the
big stage.  
  
It happens. It happens. But I was really proud of how we came back. We settled
in, we calmed down, and we made a lot of good plays and used their
aggressiveness to our advantage, too, with some back door, easy lay-ups, and
they executed well the stuff that we drew up.  
  
Q. After you guys took the lead briefly in the third quarter, it was a
close game, two-point game. DeShields hit about three field goals kind of off
the dribble over defenders. Was that just kind of a great player stepping up
in that situation?  
COACH GREEN: She's a great player, and great players make plays. A couple of
them, and I'll have to watch it on film, but a couple of them I thought we did
everything we could. I thought we had a high hand. She elevates so high.
Players make plays, and she did. I'll have to look at it a little bit closer.
But you've got to credit her. I thought our defense was good. I thought we
contested the way we wanted to contest it. She rises up high, and she made
plays.  
  
Q. You've got a senior class you're not going to see for a while, if
ever. What do you say to those girls as they move up from under your wings?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, you look at Kelley, who has been here five years and been
to three NCAA Tournaments, an Elite Eight, won two conference championships,
an A-10 Tournament championship. I could go on and on. Defensive Player of the
Year. She's done so much here and been a rock for us. She's done it on both
ends of the floor. Played 40 minutes a game a lot of times and just will run
through a wall for you.  
  
What she's done for this program is -- you can't even put into wording.
Saicha, the same thing. She's played a lot of minutes in big moments. Macioce
hasn't played as much, but so important to our team, every single day is there
and works. And Andi, again, big-time moments through a lot of different games.  
  
I just told them -- I thanked them. They took me in as an assistant, and
coming here as a head coach under the timing that we came and from the
beginning, they completely bought in. They did everything that I asked of them
and our staff asked of them. And they really led and made sure the younger
guys were doing that. I just told them: I love you guys. I'm going to miss you
like crazy. Thank you for everything.  
  
They'll be around. I mean, it's a family, and they'll be around.

### [Queen Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33157)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 82, Chattanooga - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH FOSTER: Tough game. Questions.  
  
Q. Jim, it felt like every time you threw a punch, whether it be late
first half, early third quarter, they responded.  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah, that's what very good teams do. We have to have a score-
stop mentality. I thought we had a lot of good looks, but their mentality to
come right back at us, you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that. A
score and a stop is not how you play the game. Not score, let them score,
score, let them score. Especially when you've got to cut it to four. Just pull
your shorts up and work that much harder on defense.  
  
Q. This is for the players. If each of you will comment on the question
that was asked to Coach Foster. Every time y'all made a run, you got it to
four, and they'd punch back at you. Is there anything that they'd do or
anything that y'all wouldn't do? Why could they always answer? Jasmine,
Chelsea then Queen?  
JASMINE JOYNER: Just like Coach said, they're a very good team, a very
athletic team. Sometimes it was our mistakes that would make them get a good
look or a good score. So like Coach said, that's what good teams do.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I definitely agree, that's what good teams do, and
they just completed it. They had the all-around game.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: I think it goes back to simple basketball, you know? We made
simple mistakes that they capitalized off of, and those are the mistakes you
can't make against big teams like this.  
  
Q. Chelsey, I'll ask you, because you were one of the primary ball
handlers against Louisville's pressure. Did you feel like once you were able
to get the ball across half court, you felt pretty good about the shots you
were able to get? Because you were getting open shots when you all were
beating the press.  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I think we got good shots. Sometimes threes don't fall
all the time, so you have to work around that somehow, someway. So throughout
the game, I thought we got pretty good shots.  
  
Q. Louisville shot 61% for the game, and it seemed they were able to get
the ball where they wanted. Was it their athleticism, their quickness, being
maybe a little bigger than you? If players would address that. It just seems
they were able to get the ball where they wanted, when they wanted.  
JASMINE JOYNER: Like I just said, they were more athletic, quick, and they
were just a very good team.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, they're a talented team, like she said, basically.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: And, again, I think they just capitalized off of our mistakes.
If somebody didn't close out, they went around us. If they couldn't get open,
they found a gap. That's what good players do. That's what pretty good teams
do.  
  
Q. Queen, how much more difficult is it to have to go through this loss
as opposed to the loss you had last year in Lexington's Regional?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I mean, it's very difficult because you're almost there, but
you're never there, you know? I mean, every time we go through this, it breaks
my heart. But every time I try to take the positive out of it, try to take
every positive thing that I can that can make me a better person and a better
player. That's what you have to do when you have stuff like this, when stuff
like this happens.  
  
Q. What is the positive you take from here that you took from last year
that could have helped you now?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I think last year I was tentative, so I said this year there is
nothing to be scared of. They're just like us. That is something that I harped
on. That's something that wore on me and in my heart.  
  
Q. Asia Durr obviously was getting a lot of shots inside and outside.
Did you guys have a specific game plan to defend her, and if so, how was she
able to kind of get around that?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Asia's just a really good player. She just knows how to get
to spots, no matter how you play her. If you go under screens, she knows how
to step back. If you go over, she knows how to drive and kick. She's just a
really good player. That's what good players do, and I wouldn't expect nothing
less from her.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me, I think she's a pretty good player, too, but she was a
better player tonight, because they did a wonderful job finding her and making
sure she got the ball.  
  
Q. Jasmine, Chelsey, kind of the same question that was asked of Queen
about taking a positive away or relating a loss in a tournament game. Again,
how do you balance that, and can you now?  
JASMINE JOYNER: Well, last year I got in foul trouble; this year I didn't. So
I felt like that was very good. And I felt like the tough schedule that the
team played this year is going to make them tougher next year. They've got a
big group of freshmen coming in, but these girls are going to make them tough,
going to make them better.  
  
Like I said, I can't wait to see what next year's going to bring them. But
Lakelyn, she experienced her first NCAA game, and Coach Foster has to tell her
you've got to change your speed. I feel like she's going to get in the gym. So
once she keeps continuing that beautiful shot and now she changes speed, she's
going to be unstoppable.  
  
Q. This is for Queen and Jasmine. You both are seniors. What do you see
in your future, and what do you tell the players here that you're leaving
behind as they go and look forward to next year?  
JASMINE JOYNER: My future, only God can tell me. I don't know what's going to
happen. I don't know. I'm going to put it in God's hands. And I'm going to
keep encouraging the girls.  
  
Like I just said, they're going to have a good team. I mean, it's going to be
five new girls coming in, but we've still got Chelsey, we've still got
Lakelyn, Ary, Kei. Going to have a big senior group like we had this year.  
  
So like I said, they won't be new to playing any tough teams like they did
this year. So, I mean, nothing but the best. Go out there and give it your
all. But you never know when it's your last game.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me, I'm giving everything to God as well. I don't know what
my future will hold. But as far as the message that I would give the team is
never get content. Because when you get content, something is just taken away
from you. Whether you're high, whether you're low, whether you're this caliber
type of player, or whether you're doing this, never get content. Because at
any time, at any point, it could be taken away.  
  
Q. Jim, the first time you played them, I know you got beat up here. It
seemed like the first time, y'all had seven blocks against them the first
time. I think you had one girl that had six. Today you only had one block. Was
it anything that they did or anything that you didn't do to offset that?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, we played them a little bit differently. Our issue was --
dilemma was the three. I think they got us from the back side in the lane. I
don't think they were playing three bigs at that time. I think they were
playing three guards. And I think that's a big difference relative to who we
are. I think we match up better with guards, obviously.  
  
So their change in the lineup, I think, was productive relative to the amount
of paint points they took.  
  
Q. Jim, they say (indiscernible) money makes no money. You guys put
quite a bit of threes, you had some good looks, but just couldn't get them
knocked down, but yet you kept trying. Was there any thought of backing away
from shooting those threes and perhaps getting the shots closer in the first
quarter?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, you are who you are. We'll keep working, but mid-range
shots aren't nearly as productive, and we did get to the line a little bit
when we did put the ball on the floor.  
  
As Jas alluded to, I think we've got a freshman, we've got a couple kids,
changing speeds, changing tempo is a big deal as you evolve and become a
better player. And I think that's something that you'll see players working on
in the gym. I think that will help make them a little more successful if not a
lot more successful.  
  
Q. Jim, you've had a message. On previous tournament losses I know
toughness was a message, I believe, for a while. Is there a message you want
to leave with today?  
COACH FOSTER: Get better. Your opportunity to get better is between now and
the first time you get together next year. That's how you do it. We do have a
very talented class coming in. We'll have -- our best success has been when we
have three point guards on the floor, and we'll have that opportunity next
year as we've got a couple of really good ones coming in. We've got some good
ones already in the program. So that will make us better.  
  
We're going to have an overseas opportunity or over-border opportunity next
summer. I think that will help us with this group. The rules allow freshmen,
once they've started school, and they'll start in July, to participate in that
and partake in it.  
  
So I like our youngsters, and I like some of these players coming in a lot. As
Lakelyn showed this year, a freshman can come in and have an impact right away
and be an essential part of who you are right away. And I think the
competition in the gym is going to be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about you guys kept getting close, but it was the
transition that they ran on you guys and the interior passing. Was there any
answer to that?  
COACH FOSTER: If you have one, let me know. Transition, yeah. We made the
adjustment there. But, again the anticipation of sliding out to the perimeter
and cheating in the direction of the perimeter and giving them opportunities
closer to the basket, if you make that mistake five or six times in the game
and they take advantage of it five or six times, you need to adjust to things
like that.  
  
I thought we lost the integrity of what we did defensively probably in about
10 to 15 possessions. We didn't need to. It wasn't something they were doing.
It was something we were doing. That needs to be tightened up for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, you're in this thing leading 8 to 5. They go on a 15-0 run.
What were they doing to y'all after you addressed that run?  
COACH FOSTER: All of the above. Just what I talked about. Scoring in the seam,
scoring around the basket, in-paint points. You look at the stat sheet, it
tells you all you need to know.  
  
Q. You said yesterday, Coach, being aware of Louisville as a team that
has a couple star players and a lot of role players. Jazmine Jones was a
really big deal for them tonight. Had she been on your radar before?  
COACH FOSTER: Role players evolve in a lot of different ways during the course
of a game and what starts to happen in a game. That's why they are role
players. If you look at Durr's numbers across the board, and then you look at
Moore, okay, Moore made a decision. She took three shots, but she had ten
assists.  
  
An immature player might be upset that they only have three shots and try to
force and take advantage of opportunities. She made an adjustment in how she
was playing, and obviously she must like the Jones kid because I'm sure she
had several finishes on passes from Moore. The so her decision to pass the
ball, I think, to be a playmaker, made a big difference.  
  
Q. What are you saying to your seniors? It's time for them to move on.
How proud are you of them?  
COACH FOSTER: I spoke seniors afterwards. They know how I feel.  
  
Q. Anything you want to share with us in terms of what you shared with
them or what you said to them?  
COACH FOSTER: No.  
  
Q. How hard is it going to be to see them leave you?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they're good kids. I give Queen all the credit in the
world. We made a change late in the season, had her come off the bench, and
she wasn't a big person. She could have been a pouter. But she was sort of an
energy for us.  
  
Jas has had to do yeoman's work for four years. We're not a big team, and she
has to do a lot of extra things. Moses plays real hard, real hard, and does
good things. And Sydney had a job to do, and she did a very good job of doing
it. When we needed her, she was there. But I'm not going to tell you what I
told them.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. I realize you're all emerged in the tournament right now, but you
don't have much time before this draft, this WNBA draft. Have you had any time
in the season to weigh the pros and cons of turning pro early?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Personally, that's not something I'm worried about at the
moment. I'm just worried about the tournament at the time. That's something
I'll think about after the season.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: It's definitely a decision that's looming over both of our
heads. But like Mercedes said, it's not something we put too much thought
into. We're committed to being here in Louisville with Coach Warlick, and the
rest of our teammates and currently where we are in Louisville right now, and
focused on Dayton. That's all I'm thinking about.  
  
Q. You talk about Dayton. Do you want to go into preparation for that?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: From watching film, they're definitely a solid team. They've
won their conference championship. They've got some pretty good shooters on
their team. They have good posts that can score around the basket, and step
out and shoot the threes. So just all around, they've got good scorers. Then
on the defensive end, they really get after you.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, I mean, most important thing for us is just to
respect all of our opponents here. Being in this tournament, there's no team
here that can't be beat. So that's the first thing for us. The year we've had
has been full of lots of ups and downs. We don't want to repeat that cycle. We
want to stay on top of our game and get to a good place so that we can compete
deep in the tournament. But they're a great team, just like Mercedes said, and
we understand that and respect that. We've prepared for that.  
  
Q. Mercedes, do you like playing against taller post players, or would
you prefer to be shooting over somebody that's five or six inches shorter than
you are?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, I would say I enjoy playing against shot blockers. I
know Dayton has a couple of posts, 6'5", 6'3" that like to block shots, and I
think that's always a fun, challenging game.  
  
Q. Diamond, you talk about competing and playing this time of the year.
The whole season culminates with this, right? So all that hard work, I mean,
is this the fun part? Is it all fun? Are there times when it's not fun?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I mean, when you lose, you know, it's not fun when you
lose. But, yeah, this is why you come to college. This is why you play. This
is why we're all here for March, to compete for that trophy. So, yeah, it's a
lot of fun just being here with you guys and with each other, and all the fans
that come on the road with us and support us. This is definitely a fun time
for us.  
  
Q. Mercedes, your take on it?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, same what she said.  
  
Q. Diamond, you've been playing in the SEC regular season and
tournament, you're really familiar with those teams. They're familiar with
you. Do you kind of like going into playing a team that doesn't know that much
about you and how you play?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, I mean, you hope that they don't know a lot about
you, but I mean, they wouldn't be here if they came into games that
unprepared. I'm sure they've scouted us and know our personnel very well. Like
we said, it's all about respect moving forward. We respect their players. We
respect their coaching staff. They may not have seen us before, but they know
what we're capable of and they know what we've got and likewise. We know what
they're capable of, we know what they've got. Not overlooking anything or
anybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of an unusual start to the season with a coaching change right
before the season. As a coach, can you relate to the challenge that presented
where you would come in with the season just very close at hand and not much
time for preparation? Can you relate to that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, absolutely. I knew Jim real well, and it is a challenge.
It's a challenge, but it's something that I think that anybody would look
forward to to run their own program. So as you feel a little nervous about
taking over, you're also excited. I think that's the same situation that I
went through. And I know Coach Green has done a great job and got an
opportunity, and has really stepped up and taken advantage of it.  
  
Q. Looking not at the coach but at their players now, who stands out to
you? Who could give you fits?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, they're very well-coached. Their guards can shoot the
three and also penetrate so that, as a team, poses a difficult assignment for
anyone defensively. They're a great rebounding team, so I just think they've
covered all aspects of a winning team.  
  
They're smart, they're intelligent. They run a system, and they do it very
well. So it will be a challenge for us to limit their threes. Keep them in
front of us. Keep them off the boards. Just all those things that make a
competitive basketball team, and I think that's what Dayton is.  
  
Q. Is there any team you played during the regular season or the SEC
Tournament that reminds you of Dayton's similarities in size or style of
play?  
COACH WARLICK: Maybe Missouri. A little bit of Missouri. Except maybe not take
their bigs out so far away from the basket. But I think they're patient. I
think they shoot the three ball like Missouri. Probably I think that would be
the team that comes to mind right now.  
  
Q. Do teams now -- I realize similarities in size, style of play, but
when you're playing a team now, do you pretty much know how they're going to
play you defensively? That they've looked at the film and they see what your
strengths and weaknesses are?  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. I think coaches do their homework. I think we watch
a lot of tape, lot of film, and see how they've guarded certain teams a
certain way. I think there can be a tendency that you put in something new or
do something different because it's postseason. But it boils down to players
making plays and understanding what you want, what your coach wants. So I
don't expect them to do a lot of things different. We're not going to do a lot
of things different.  
  
We've tweaked a couple things on you are offense, on our defense. We're going
to go with what's successful for us, and I'm sure Dayton would concur as well.
There is a reason why they're here and we're here. But your players got to
make plays. We tell them to make plays, and the ball's in their court by the
time the game starts.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first, and then we'll excuse
them. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Myisha, how has the week of practice gone since the ACC Tournament?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We've been doing two-a-days, just going hard, in the
afternoon we scrimmage, and morning practice we just go over our plays. It's
been fun.  
  
Q. Prepared for Chattanooga?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yes. Our coaches do a good job of getting us ready and
knowing the scout and just overall what they're going to be doing. We went
over Chattanooga a lot yesterday, and I feel like we're really prepared.  
  
Q. Asia, question about Chattanooga. You played them earlier in the
year. Is that the same Chattanooga team that you all played then, or how do
you think they are today?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I definitely think that they're going to be a much better
team. They're a well-coached team as well, so we know that we're going to get
their best shot, so we have to be ready for that.  
  
Q. Do you have any preference on who you play in the second game?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, we've just got to worry about the first one first, and
then get that win. After that, it really doesn't matter. We want to play both
teams, but we know we can't, so we just worry about the first one first.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing as her. We have to take it game-by-game.
We can't overlook any team. It's going to be a great game. I'm just so excited
for it. This is what we came here for. So we've just got to be on top of it.  
  
Q. Asia, the advantage of being able to play at home and to know that
you're going to have this home crowd here, I know that's a positive. But do
you guys have to talk about you can't be too comfortable, especially being a
higher seed and being comfortable at home?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Oh, that's true. We see so many teams where there are
upsets, so we have to be ready. Our fans are great. Just to be able to play,
hopefully, two games at home, that is huge. I feel like we have the best fans
in the country, so I'm excited.  
  
ASIA DURR: She handled that question. She handled that one.  
  
Q. Coach Walz has instructed me that you win the game by scoring the
most points. What are some of the other things that y'all be looking to do
against Chattanooga to win the game? Offensively, defensively?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, they have a great post player, so we have to box
out. She had, I think, seven blocks against us, so we have to be careful of
that. And we have to get stops.  
  
The staff has just the whole year: Stop, score, stop. So that's what we have
to do at this time.  
  
ASIA DURR: Just going off of that one, not turn over the ball and getting out
in transition. So I think getting the stop, score, stop, not turn over the
ball, and getting out in transition will help us score a lot of points.  
  
Q. Last year you guys didn't have any seniors. You weren't going to lose
anyone. This year you've got Cortnee and Taylor and B.J., who this is their
last tournament. Does that change how you guys approach things? What have
their emotions been like leading into this?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Towards the middle of the season they started emphasizing
more that, hey, this is our last go-around. We all need to get more focused.
You don't get another shot at this.  
  
But we take pride in that we have three seniors on this team, and we have to
give it our best shot. We can't be lazy and hope for next year because they're
not going to be here next year.  
  
And they're a big part of this team with leadership -- Cortnee with
rebounding, B.J. with handling the ball, and Taylor with her ball pressure.
So, I mean, they're a big part of this team. We know that this is their last
one; in any given moment that could be the end of their season. So we're just
trying to give it our all and just play hard for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Walz, please.  
  
Q. Is B.J. back, is she playing? Do you expect to use her?  
COACH WALZ: Yes, I sure do. She practiced this past week. She looks good. She
feels fine. It's been about a month that she's not been on the court. So it's
not something that she'll go out there and play 35 minutes. But she does feel
good, so we do have her in the rotation, which will help us. So, yeah, I do
expect her to play.  
  
Q. Looking at the four regions, just on paper it looks like you're in
the toughest region by far. Your thoughts on that.  
COACH WALZ: Every coach is going to say that our region is the toughest. If
this was a 16-team tournament where you played everybody once, then I would
probably agree with you and say, yeah, golly, look at all these teams you have
to play. You've got Oklahoma, you've got DePaul, Washington, you could go
through the list.  
  
We just have to worry about the game at hand. Then, if we can take care of
business, then you've got to play a winner of two teams, and you keep moving
forward.  
  
So somebody's going to eliminate somebody else.  
  
Every region has very good teams in it, so it's not one region's better than
the other or anything like that. You've just got to worry about what's in
front of you.  
  
Q. Are you surprised at all that Virginia did not get in and California
did get in the tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I was really hoping Virginia would get in, for sure. Being from
the league, I thought they really started to play some very good basketball
towards the end of the season. A big win against Florida State at home. 7 and
9 in our league, I thought, was pretty impressive.  
  
It used to be 10, 12 years ago your goal was to finish .500. Well, that's when
everybody played everybody twice. Well, now with the unbalanced schedule,
Virginia plays us twice. We're picked second in the league preseason, you
know?  
  
So I think who you play within your league in the unbalanced schedule does
affect what your conference season is going to be, your conference record.  
  
So I'm not in that room. I'm not one of those deciding who makes the
tournament and who does not. I would have loved to have seen Virginia in it,
because I think they are playing some very good basketball right now.  
  
I wish all of our teams in our league, the ones that are in the NCAA
Tournament and in the NIT, the best of luck.  
  
Q. How have these two teams changed since they first played back in
November?  
COACH WALZ: Well, there's a lot more experience from both groups. We've had a
good two and a half months of really trying to put some things together
offensively, defensively. The kids getting to know each other. You learn as
the year goes on who does what well.  
  
I think that's one thing Chattanooga's really improved on. They're very
disciplined in what they're doing. They're focused. They know who is supposed
to get shots from where. Offensively I think they've improved.  
  
Defensively, I think they've been solid the entire year, personally, when I go
back and watch them on film. As the players said, they've got the leading shot
blocker in the country. Does a fantastic job of erasing any mistakes their
guards might have. If someone drives by them, they know she's back there to
help take care of things.  
  
But it's going to be a great game. I think both of our games here will be
fantastic tomorrow. I think you've got four teams that are very well-coached,
playing very good basketball right now, and that's what the tournament's all
about.  
  
Q. You said at the beginning of the season that you thought this team
maybe has the most talent of any team you've had. Does that still hold true,
or is there anything they need to do in this tournament to prove that to
you?  
COACH WALZ: I still say that from top to bottom. What we have to do is take
care of the basketball. That's been our Achilles heel the past month. If we
don't get that solved, it's going to be some problems for us. We turned the
ball over 18 times against Notre Dame in the ACC semis, and it's a six-point
game with four minutes to go.  
  
That's what I'm trying to explain to our players. We're shooting ourselves in
the foot. We're not giving ourselves a chance because we're throwing it to the
other team. That's the one area that we really have to improve on. The
rebounding is going to be important for us.  
  
But I like our chances. I like this group. I think they're in a good spot
right now, but we're going to need to have players step up. If you want to
advance in this tournament, you've got to play your best. You can't have an
off night and expect to win.  
  
So that's the challenge that's put in front of all these young women. Not just
on our team, but everybody that's in this. You really start to find out who
can handle the pressure, because now every shot matters. Every shot you take
matters. The ones that put the time in in the off-season, after practice,
before practice, where it just becomes routine, are the ones that normally
rise to the top. You can't fake it.  
  
That's one thing about this, when it comes tournament time, you can't fake it
because there is no next game. So every shot has got a little pressure on it,
which is a good thing.  
  
Q. You've had outstanding play from the freshmen at times. Little bit
about Kylee Shook. She's come on lately and done some good things for you.  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, she's been playing with a lot of confidence. We've inserted
her in the lineup at the four spot, moved Myisha to the three when B.J. went
down. It gives us another scorer, which has been good for us. Because B.J.
does a lot of great things defensively when she passes the ball, teams were
backing off of her.  
  
Then we had her and Cortnee on the floor at the same time. Really, we had two
that weren't, per se, scorers out there. And now Kylee on the floor, teams
have to respect her to shoot the three.  
  
So we're going to have a little different rotation now with B.J. back too.
When I had B.J. on the floor, I might be able to move Kylee to the five,
Myisha to the four, and still have four scorers on the floor, which is
something I think you have to do at this time of year if you want to advance
and continue playing.  
  
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out today. I'd like to thank Tom Gerich
and Christine Herring (phonetics) for helping and allowing us to host,
everybody from our university that is giving their time to come down and make
this such a special event, not just for our team, but for the other three
teams that are here. It's what you play the entire season for.  
  
I appreciate it, because you guys all go out of your way to make sure these
student-athletes are really -- they feel special. And the amount of work these
women put in for their seasons, not just for our team but their own respective
teams, it's a wonderful event.  
  
I'd just like to make sure I say thank you to everyone, including Jackie with
the NCAA that comes down here several times. She's been a part of it now with
us. It's just done first class, and that's one thing I can always say about
the University of Louisville when we do things. It's done first class. But
it's the people that make it so special. Thank you.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Shauna Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33175)

### [Jenna Burdette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33176)

### [JaVonna Layfield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33177)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the Flyers?  
  
Q. JaVonna, for you personally, the excitement, I've seen your team pop
up on the screen, but then finding out that you're going to Louisville, here,
your hometown. Just talk about that feeling and what that experience is going
to be like tomorrow with family and friends?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: It's an amazing feeling because what are the odds, you know?
I'm really excited for the family aspect because it will be the first time a
lot of people get to see me play. I just think it's going to be a really cool
thing. It's going to be a great atmosphere in general. I'm pretty excited.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, how many people are we talking about?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Well, I know 16 certified tickets from the student-athlete
passes, but my mom bought about ten tickets. Probably maybe like 30-plus.  
  
Q. Jenna, this team has already won a regular season and a tournament
championship. How do you guys stay hungry and motivated going into yet another
postseason experience?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I don't know. I think we're just always motivated because we
just have a fire in us that just keeps wanting to win. We talked about our
goals at the beginning of the season, which two of them were to win the
regular season, the tournament title, and we had a goal for this postseason.
Now we're here, and we have to make it happen.  
  
Q. Jenna, you were a freshman when they went to the Elite Eight and
played every minute. What would you say is the biggest difference in your game
between the Elite Eight run and where you are now?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I'd say I'm a lot less nervous. I just have a better feel for
things. My freshman year I was a little bit of a mess, kind of. So I've calmed
down a lot and just let the game come to me instead of worrying too much. I'd
say that's the biggest difference.  
  
Q. What advice have you kind of passed on to the girls that weren't on
that tournament team heading into this weekend?  
JENNA BURDETTE: Just that this feeling only comes once in a lifetime. We're
lucky, JaVonna and I, to get to be here twice. So just not to take anything
for granted because you never know if you're ever going to come back.  
  
Q. With the schedule that you guys have played, is it getting to the
point where it's easier now to kind of just view Tennessee as another team
compared to looking at the history of Tennessee, having played UConn and
playing Stanford last year and some of the teams you guys have played; that
you just look at these guys as another opponent now?  
JENNA BURDETTE: Yeah, we do. I think it helps us with the way our coaches
prepare us, too, because they prepare us the same way going into every game no
matter who we're playing. I think that's the mindset we have to have coming
into this game.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah, I would have to agree. The schedule that we did, the
schedule has prepared us as far as the preparation and what we do before every
game. So we just have to go out there and execute.  
  
Q. When you guys turned out 3 and 6, did you think you'd win 19 of the
next 22 games and win an A-10 title and be sitting here? Was there a moment in
the season that you were like -- everything kind of clicked and you were like,
wow?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah.  
  
JENNA BURDETTE: Yes.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah, I would say when we had that week break from traveling
and right before we went down to Florida, I'd say the A&M game is when we were
like, all right, this is what we needed. This is who we are. We've got it.
From that point on, it was like: We're here. We're not going anywhere anytime
soon.  
  
Q. Jenna, you've played a lot of basketball. He mentioned being a part
of that Elite Eight run as a starter, freshman, sophomore year. This year you
have to deal with that injury. You're out quite a few games in February. What
was that experience like being on the bench? And more importantly, coming back
against St. Louis and then to the Atlantic 10 tournament? Was there something
that you maybe thought of or maybe something that changed from just your time
on the pine?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I don't think anything really changed. It was kind of a wake-
up call because I had never been injured before. So it made me think about
like I can do this rep a little harder because I might not be able to do the
next rep. I'd say it was a wake-up call that anything can happen.  
  
Q. JaVonna, with your ability to bring energy to the game, outside of a
lot of people think of scoring as how many points somebody had, you're able to
put the ball in the basket. But for you now as also a member of that Elite
Eight run, from a leadership standpoint, where do you feel like your game has
sort of come from your freshman year to where we are here now as a junior?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: So I feel like I (indiscernible) since my freshman year
because I was a mess too. I've gained a lot of confidence that I didn't have
before. I feel like my work ethic has grown and I've found ways to get the job
done other than, you know, if I didn't have confidence in scoring or
something, it was like, all right, you've got to bring it on defense, then my
defense would create my offense, or, all right, get this stop, dive on the
floor for the ball.  
  
Just working hard in all aspects of the game, even if somewhere on the
spectrum I'm falling short, just continue to give all my effort. I think I've
gotten better at that throughout the year.  
  
Q. You guys had that terrific win against Texas A &M, and a lot of
people saw that as the turning point. Was there another game in conference, or
maybe it was not even a game, to where you had that long winning streak, it
was like the ball rolling down the hill from a momentum standpoint? Is there
another point in the season where you felt really good about where you were
going, and having that idea that this is a championship-caliber team?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I would say it was off the court. We had a big team meeting
and we got to know each other on a personal level, and I think that helped us
grow together on the court, just seeing what we've all been through. I really
think that helped us to be where we are right now.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: I definitely agree with that. Our closeness off the court
has helped with our chemistry on it.  
  
Q. Do you have the watch party set up for the UD men's game tonight?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: We'll watch them, sure.  
  
JENNA BURDETTE: We'll watch them.  
  
Q. Either one of you, I wanted to know what the team's perception is of
Tennessee. You look at their resumé, and they've got some really big wins, but
also some really bad losses. What is your perception of the opponents you're
facing?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Well, we just go into it, and first we focus on what we can
do in order to win the game. But they're just another team. I mean, they're a
great team, you know, but can't get too caught up in how many wins they have,
how many losses they had. You just have to focus on yourself, go in and
execute your game plan and whatever we have to do in order to win the game.  
  
So they're a great team. At the end of the day, it's what we have to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Green.  
  
Q. Coach Green, you were on staff two years ago with the team when they
went to Regional semifinals -- I mean Regional finals, excuse me. Can you take
anything from that experience with this team into coming into the tournament
this year? I guess it's a two-part question. How are you feeling as first-year
head coach of this team going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, definitely I learned so much in those three years of making
the NCAA Tournament as an assistant, and obviously the run that we had in
2015. You learn just how we approached each game, how our prep was.  
  
But, again, like J and Jenna said, our preparation has been the same. We're
not going to change how we prepare, how we do things or really anything just
because you're in the NCAA Tournament now.  
  
I think that's something we did a really good job of on our run. Whether it
was UConn, Louisville, Kentucky or Iowa State that we played, our preparation
or mindset was the same.  
  
That was number one, to focus on Dayton and what do we have to do. Because at
the end of the day, it's about us and our execution. I think that was
something really big.  
  
I think you can sometimes get caught up in when you're in these tournaments
and, oh, it's Tennessee; oh, it's UConn. Yeah, they're great teams. Every team
you play this time of year is a great team. But you want to approach it with
the same mindset so your players aren't thinking "It's UConn" or "Oh, we're
playing Tennessee." That's really -- and, again, our schedule has helped
prepare them for that as well. So I learned a ton.  
  
To answer your second part, it's kind of funny because it doesn't feel that
different. It really hasn't felt that different all year. Yeah, I'm the head
coach now, but I'm really just in-the-moment type of person, so how do we
approach it, what is my mindset going into practice, what's our mindset going
into the game, how do we prepare, do we have everything that we need to have
done. So that's my mindset. I'm not thinking big picture, like, oh, we're in
the NCAA Tournament. I don't think that way. I'm just really focused on our
players and our preparation and are we going to be ready to go tomorrow at 4
p.m.  
  
Q. You guys have the one common opponent in Texas A &M. What is it from
watching A&M film when they played Tennessee and you guys played Tennessee?
What sort of things do you take away that is a positive for you and maybe not
so much of a positive for you?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, we're different than Texas A&M as well. So they play kind
of a different style than we play. But I think we can say, I think from our
players' perspective, it kind of helps, like we beat Texas A&M and they beat
Tennessee. Even though at the end of the day that doesn't matter.  
  
From the players' perspective, you can maybe look at it that way. As a
coaching staff, obviously, Tennessee has a lot of weapons. There's a lot of
things that we have to be really, really sharp on tomorrow to put us in a
position to win the basketball game.  
  
But just from a rebounding perspective, and Texas A&M does a really good job
with that, and that's something we've prided ourself on, is defending and
rebounding. I think we play a much faster pace than A&M plays. But the
emphasis of our defense, the emphasis of our rebounding, that's something that
they'd really do a great job of. We've really tried to take down that persona
as well.  
  
So I think that's a similarity. If we can do that and get out and run,
hopefully we'll get some easy transition baskets that can help us.  
  
Q. Do you think the depth of your team may be a key factor in this game?
Will you continue to push that tempo throughout with being able to go to your
bench?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, I think that's key. When you look at Tennessee and the
players that they have, you have to use your strength and try to get any
advantage that you can against a great team like they are.  
  
So, obviously, it's something we've done all year, and something we pride
ourselves in is our pace and our depth and trying to wear people down. Pushing
the pace no matter what. Make or miss, we're trying to push it. We're getting
up the floor and trying to score in six seconds or less.  
  
So that's what we do. That's who we are. That's not going to change. Hopefully
we can use that to our advantage and wear them down. But that's a tall task.
So we've got to be on our game. In order to run, you need the basketball, so
that's where the rebounding part is the biggest key, I think, to this game.  
  
Q. We've talked this year about the fact that JaVonna just brings a ton
of energy to the floor every time she steps on the floor. How much has her
progress and her emergence with how she's played this year, how much has
really kind of fed you guys? Talk a little about her contribution.  
COACH GREEN: J's huge for us. She's one person. I'm all about just the energy
and the intensity and digging down and defending and rebounding and doing all
the little things. That's what we preach. That's what I really want out of our
players, to have that pride and that passion and play with that heart.  
  
So she's kind of a kid that I love how she plays. You could look at a stat
sheet after the game, and you may not see this padded stats, but she does so
much for us. She's our glue. She keeps us -- she does all the dirty work. She
has to be out on the floor.  
  
If you look at her -- I don't know how many minutes she even averages, but
there are certain games that I don't like to have her off the floor just
because of that. She's also someone that I trust. She'll run through a wall
for you. She'll do anything for you. I think her confidence has grown so much.  
  
She's the type of kid I'll say: Ja, you need to pick it up. We need to go get
some offensive rebounds. And she'll literally go in the next however many
possessions and get three offensive boards. I wish she'd do that from the
start and I didn't have to yell at her to do it. But she does it. She's that
type of a player. I love that about her.  
  
Q. Talking about Jenna's injury in February, your team was also trying
to win an Atlantic 10 regular season championship, and you did fairly well
without your point guard. But were you able to see sort of what she brings to
the table in the Atlantic 10 Tournament? For your squad, though, did you learn
something about your unit without your starting point guard?  
COACH GREEN: Most definitely. Because when Jenna -- when our trainer came in
and told me that Jenna was hurt, your mind just is like, okay, this is our
starting point guard that's been the starting point guard at Dayton since our
freshman year. Played every minute. She missed one game her freshman year when
she had a broken nose. The kid's tough as nails. She didn't want to stop that
game. And she played with a mask the rest of the game.  
  
Losing her, you just lose so much. So as any coach would be, you're a little
concerned. We don't have necessarily a true point guard as our back-up. So I
learned so much. Our team, they're such a team.  
  
What I tell them is our strength is our strength because we're so together.
One person is having a bad day, well, someone else will pick it up. You can
see that throughout our games. We've had someone different off the bench
always have a good game. I give so much credit to Lauren and to Kelley that
stepped up, especially Lauren, and started at the point guard for that span
of, what, five games.  
  
We had tough games in there. To be able to go out and sustain and win games
with not having a so-called true point, and losing, really, the motor behind
everyone and your leader out on the floor, that's a testament to our players
and their togetherness.  
  
No one ever felt sorry for anyone, and it was never like, oh, what are we
going to do? Is this what we're doing? Is this how we're playing? We do what
we do. We do what we do and go out there and get it done.  
  
I think they really rallied around it and they played for her. In hindsight, I
think it made us better. It gave a lot more people confidence and more
minutes, and I think we're better because of that. You saw in the A-10
Tournament, I thought we played our best basketball of the season. Everyone
was really, really together, just really knowing their roles and accepting
them and doing them at a high level.  
  
Q. With really not having a big go-to scorer like those two were, does
that make this team -- does it make this team that much tougher to guard,
different look?  
COACH GREEN: I think we're a different look than we have been all year, and I
think that's why you saw early on we were running some of the same action and
offenses that we ran and what I ran when I was here as an assistant.  
  
But after learning our personnel, and that's where the timing was a little bit
harder when I got the job, because I didn't have that time to really evaluate
and say, okay, this is what we should run. After seeing that and then the
girls talk about that 11-day span where we kind of called our new season, and
we're 19-3 since then, is when we changed our offense.  
  
I think our offense fits our personnel a lot better. We don't have an Andrea
Hoover, we don't have an Ally Malott where if you need a basket they're going
to break you down or Ally can go inside out.  
  
We have our bigs, and they don't shoot threes. We have guards that are good
coming off screens and coming off staggers to shoot. So we put them in a
position to have the most success. And that was by what we're running now.  
  
So in a way, you could look at it that, oh, you don't have your star players,
but we've also had a lot of success as a true team and not knowing who is
going to pick it up. But we also have our staples. Jennifer, that's our
staple. Saicha's been a staple, J's been a staple in her own regard. And you
have Kelley Austria who at the end of the day has been one of the best players
to ever play at Dayton. If she wants to score, she can score whenever she
wants to. She just sometimes needs to be encouraged a little bit to shoot,
where you don't have to tell Andrea Hoover to shoot that much. Kelley, I'm
still telling her every day: Shoot it, shoot it, be aggressive.  
  
So I think we're different, but I think still you've got to pick your poison
with how you guard us. We hit shots, and we have a chance to compete with
anyone.  
  
Q. With coming in late and getting rolling right into the season and
everything, what kind of a whirlwind it's been, have you had a chance to take
a breath and go "wow" at everything you guys have accomplished in the season
so far? I mean, is it still kind of middle-of-the-cycle type of thing?  
COACH GREEN: It's kind of middle of the like what do I have next, like grind
mentality. Having the time off after the A-10 Tournament, we haven't played
now in, what, almost two weeks. I told the team to really enjoy it and to take
it in, because that's something. To win the A-10 regular season and to win the
A-10 Conference Tournament, it has not been done at Dayton.  
  
We've done a lot of really good things in this program in the past. There's
been great players, great coaches that have built this into what this program
is, but no one has ever done that. I think that's -- I wanted them to truly
understand what they did and to truly be proud and enjoy it. Because sometimes
it's all: Well, we've got to do this next or we've got to do that next. I
really want them to enjoy this.  
  
This is not something -- maybe for your Tennessees and your UConns and whoever
of the world, this is every year they want to be in the Final Four, in the
Elite Eight. It's special to be in this tournament. It's not a right. It's a
privilege to be here, and they earned it. I mean, they worked hard for it. And
they went through a lot of adversity this year that a lot of people don't
know, from personal stuff to team. They've been through so much.  
  
So I told them: Enjoy this thing. Enjoy every second of it. We'll get back to
work. I sometimes maybe should take my own advice and enjoy it a little bit
more. But I've really been on the grind mentality. I think after the season is
when myself and our staff, they can step back and say, man, we did a lot this
year when a lot of people didn't expect us to do that. People kind of, I
think, have not given us, you know -- I don't want to say respect, but maybe
they didn't think that we could do this. So I'm really proud of our team.
Really, really proud of our team.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fact that it's been sort of a whirlwind. But you
were involved in this program throughout a lot of wins, NCAA Tournament trips.
Then you spent a year at Northwestern. Is there something in particular that
you've been able to take away from your experience at Northwestern that you've
been able to bring here to Dayton?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, that's a good question. I think, number one, to appreciate
what we have at Dayton and how Dayton does stuff. Just the high level of
commitment they have to women's basketball too. I'm not saying that because of
Northwestern. Absolutely great administration. I absolutely loved my time at
Northwestern. But just the fans and the support, it's really, really special.
It's a really, really special place to come out and play in front of 2,500 to
3,000 people every night. Not everywhere, I know -- Louisville does well, and
a lot of the Power Fives do well, but that's special to have that.  
  
So I really appreciated just the tradition that we have here. And I think
that's the biggest thing. Just really you kind of -- we didn't make the
tournament last year at Northwestern, and Dayton didn't either. But that was
something that you go there three years in a row and you kind of get used to
it and you think, oh, you're just supposed to be here. You don't have that for
a year, and you're like -- you want it. You get that taste. Especially after
the Elite Eight, you want to be back there. Once you get in, you never know
what happens.  
  
So I think that's just appreciating it and the opportunity to be here. I also
learned from a great coach in Coach McKeown who has won over 600-some games
and has been to the NCAA Tournament a lot of times. I've learned a ton from a
veteran coach that helped me a lot.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Jasmine Joyner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33155)

### [Chelsey Shumpert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33156)

### [Queen Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33157)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsey, since you're kind of close to home here, are you going to
have friends or family coming out tomorrow?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yes, ma'am. I'm going to have a lot of family that travelled
from Ohio, Kentucky of course and a few from (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Does that make you more excited, more nervous?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: No, I played in my hometown earlier this season. So, no.  
  
Q. Jasmine, what do you remember from playing Louisville earlier this
year in November?  
JASMINE JOYNER: I know they're a long team, very athletic, very quick. So we
had problems with our press breakers the first time, but we've been working on
it since then. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Same question for Queen.  
QUEEN ALFORD: Louisville is the type of team that wants to speed up the game,
and I think this game we have to definitely slow down and see the floor very
clear. That will make a huge difference in the outcome.  
  
Q. For any of you, I'll have each of you answer having played here
before, and having Louisville have the home court advantage, and having played
here before and knowing how tough it is, is that changing how you guys are
approaching the game at all?  
JASMINE JOYNER: We're just approaching the game how we'd normally approach the
game. I mean, nothing different. Like I said, we've matured from last time,
became tougher. So we just worked on little things that we were just going
through from the last game. But we're just going to approach it like any other
game.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, basically what she said. I mean, it's tough for
playing away rather than home court. But if we keep on playing how we know how
to play, I think we'll get it.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me personally, I don't think it has anything to do with us
playing Louisville the first time. It has everything to do with who we played
in our non-conference schedule that's going to prepare us for this moment.  
  
Q. What are some of the best examples of teams you played this season
and how you want to play?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I want to say UConn. UConn is a team you can look at, you can
pick from, and you can get better with just looking at and just playing
against. I think that was one of the best teams that we played.  
  
Q. We'll go down the line again -- Jasmine, Chelsey, Queen, if you could
talk about playing in the NCAA Tournament this time of year and how it's a
special way to close out a season?  
JASMINE JOYNER: It's a blessing to be able to be here again. I've been here
every four years, so that's a really good blessing. It's my senior year, so I
don't want to take advantage of it, so, like I said, we've been working hard
in the gym just trying to make an appearance in the NCAA and maybe go to the
second round. So like I said, we've been working hard, and being here is a big
blessing.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I've been here -- this is my fourth year as well. You
know, we're just driving to go to the second round and have a different
outcome and different mentality than we've had in the past.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: I agree with them. I think it's a huge blessing and an honor to
be here and to be in this position again. Here we are, 365 days later. We have
the same opportunity. I think it's an honor to be given another chance to do
something different.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Coach, defense for you has been pretty solid all year. Are you trying
to change your approach at all going into the tournament? Are you just going
to stay with what's been working?  
COACH FOSTER: We'll just be who we are, who we've become more so.  
  
Q. Coach, do you mind sharing some of your thoughts about this match-up
again, and when you look back to November at that all --  
COACH FOSTER: As little as possible. We weren't a very good basketball team
when we played here. We played three games here. We were in the process. We
had a point guard who had never been a point guard, and then she got injured,
actually in the Louisville game, and missed a couple games.  
  
Then sort of felt -- my analogy was we were in the spin cycle of a washing
machine, and we couldn't practice because we had games it seemed like every
other day, and we were playing sort of the cream of the crop.  
  
So when that cycle stopped, and we hit the bottom of the machine, we started
to become a pretty good basketball team. We figured out who we were, and the
point guard started to behave like one, like she'd done it for a lot of years,
instead of half a year, and the freshmen played with a lot of confidence. The
upperclassmen figured stuff out. So we got to be a pretty good basketball
team.  
  
Q. Has there been a single factor in that? Has there been something
that's been the biggest difference maker in your eyes?  
COACH FOSTER: I just think it's the resilience and toughness of the players
starting to evolve. Because, you know, we scheduled -- we opened the season at
Rutgers, and then we had Florida and Indiana, and then the schedule got tough.
We played Connecticut and Notre Dame and Louisville and Green Bay and Florida
Gulf Coast. We played a very ambitious schedule.  
  
I think the players learned quickly we're not as good as we need to be. We
need to get better. They walked into this gym with that mentality. It's
amazing what can start to happen when players want to be coached and want to
come in the gym and work hard.  
  
Q. What does Louisville do well, and how are you going to defend that?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they have two dominant players and a bunch of role
players. And the role players accept their roles, and the dominant players
like their dominance. So we've got to guard them accordingly.  
  
Q. They were very complimentary on your defense when they were in here
for the press conference. The shot blocking in particular they remember. I
think you had seven or one player had seven. Talk about your defense?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, I think we're an eclectic defensive team. We change on the
fly. We sometimes go into a game with a game plan and five or six minutes into
the game decide we're going in another direction based upon how that team is
choosing to attack us. We've become versatile enough to do that.  
  
So we have some thoughts and ideas going into the game, but we are very
willing to change them relative to how they're going to come after us.  
  
Quite frankly, we need to take care of the ball. We didn't do that here. Did
we guard them here? I don't think we were very good with the ball. And we've
become a lot better with it.  
  
Q. Jasmine and her shot blocking, is that something with her size and
her arms?  
COACH FOSTER: No, I don't think -- if it were that easy, there would be a lot
of shot blockers. First of all, I think you need to be extremely disciplined.
Secondly, I think you need a group of referees that understand.  
  
I remember -- I've been around a long time, and Dee Kantner, who is one of our
best officials, was doing a game at Vanderbilt at that time. I had a 6'10"
player, and it seemed she would get in foul trouble, and I remember Dee
standing there next to me one day, because that's where we were at Vanderbilt,
and I sort of informed her that women can and should be allowed to block
shots.  
  
So I ran into Dee a couple years later, and she said: You know, your comment
to me, I would go in the mirror before games and I would look in the mirror
before the game as I was warming up and say "Women can block shots. Women can
block shots."  
  
So just letting you know we've got a woman that can block shots. She's pretty
good at it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Quinnipiac - 85, Miami - 78  
  
COACH MEIER: That was just a great performance by Quinnipiac. I mean, just
phenomenal. The assisted field goals, I don't even know, what, 24-for-28,
percentages, but that was the one thing I was concerned about, and the one
thing we tried to disrupt. And, boy, did they find and hit. They found and
hit. And it wasn't lack of effort.  
  
On a couple of occasions perhaps lack of discipline, overexcited. But it still
takes incredible composure to hit it. I mean, we were scrambling them up and
they just stayed a very calm mind.  
  
Maybe if I watch the film I'm going to be really, really, really upset. I'm
very sad. Because I love my team so much I'm sad, because the community showed
up for us and the university stepped up for us, and I feel bad.  
  
I really wanted us to say thank you. And I'm just going to say thank you and I
don't think that we did a whole heck of a lot horribly. They just were really
special tonight. And I'm not surprised by it. But if we hadn't played as hard
as we did and have special performances, too, it could have been embarrassing.  
  
They were very, very special tonight. And at the handshake line I told Tricia,
she was being so classy and I said, go celebrate, my God, go celebrate with
your team. I appreciate the handshake but what a moment for you and what a
moment for them. And they're going to have a lot of people on their bandwagon
if they continue to play like that because that was really special.  
  
And then I'm going to try to talk about my seniors but I'm not going to get
through it because they're just awesome. So maybe I'll text y'all how I really
feel about them. But great careers. And special , special people.  
  
They carried the banner, and they did everything I needed from them. So I love
them and we're going to be in each other's lives forever. And this isn't the
end of our journey together, but it's the last time I got the honor and
pleasure to coach them. And that hurts a lot, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jessica, it seemed like every time you guys, like when Mot hit those
two free throws and it's a one-point game and they go hit a 3, there's so many
times in the game you guys closed in, and they just seemed to hit those shots.
What was that like emotionally for you guys? I mean, for the fans, it was a
roller coaster. What was it like for you guys?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think we were missing a lot of poise, like Coach mentioned.
So just for shooters to be open -- the coaches do a heck of a job on the
scouting report, and we know who the shooters are. We know who we have to
identify in transition, and who to look for, and who make sure doesn't get an
open look or open catch.  
  
For the shooters to be wide open with a late contested defender flying out at
them, I just think we were missing a lot of poise. But emotionally the game
moved so fast, they get a quick hit and we gotta make a quick run. So they
started off really well. They started off really hot, and we knew it could
either go two ways -- they'll cool down or they'll keep hitting. And they just
kept hitting. And like I said, we continued to let them keep getting open.  
  
Q. Jessica, with this team they have balanced scoring, nobody scores
more than 10.6 points. Did that make it tougher to defend them knowing they
didn't have one go-to score?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think that was a positive for us because we know how our
team defense can just bother a lot of people. So we knew nobody could take a
second off on any defensive possession. So, no, it didn't bother us.  
  
It didn't make it harder, but they're a really solid team from top to bottom
of the roster. So everybody plays their role really well, and they had another
great run tonight.  
  
Q. Jessica, how much energy got expended? It never got away, but you
guys were playing uphill it seemed like the whole time. Did that just wear you
guys down a bit too much, do you think?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I mean, it's a horrible position to be in. I think we were
down 13 at one point. And then we had to crawl our way back and fight our way
back. And then from there on, like, you still got a whole other half. We
brought it into two and then we still had a whole other quarter.  
  
But, I mean, there's been times where we've been up and there's been times
when we've been down, and tonight was another time we were down. And we were
looking forward to coming back making a big-time win. But it just didn't
happen like that.  
  
Q. Key, I know Jessica just talked a little bit about it, but what was
it like every time you guys pulled within one, every time you made a run, they
answered, usually with a 3. How frustrating was that from your perspective?  
KEYONA HAYES: It was a little frustrating. We were a little frustrated, but I
mean we kept pushing. We kept trying. We know what we're capable of and what
they're capable of. And we thought that we could do better.  
  
Q. Could both of you, as seniors, just talk about what went through your
minds at the very end there? I saw Jessica you were down on the ground, I'm
not sure where you were. But what were you feeling thinking about in those
final moments after the buzzer?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I just honestly didn't think this would be the last time I get
to play for Katie Meier.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Me too.  
  
JESSICA THOMAS: Disappointed just because I know how much we wanted it. Just
wanted, as seniors, we wanted to take this program somewhere it's never been.
So when that buzzer went off, and you try to fight to the end, but when that
buzzer went off, I really didn't see this conversation I'm having with you all
right now happening.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Like she said, I wasn't prepared for this either. I thought we
were -- we didn't overlook them but we thought we were going to go further
than what we did. And I wasn't expecting to have this conversation with you
guys either. And it's frustrating. It's hard, and it's like today is the last
time we'll ever wear a Miami jersey.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Meier.  
  
Q. The spurt at the end of the half when you got it from 13 to seven,
how vital did you think that was and what sort of boost --  
COACH MEIER: I thought Jessica was real special there in that stretch. And
there were some really, really special plays by some really, really special
players throughout the course of that game. When it came down to it, I think
they answered that huge 3 by Martucci, I think it was. That was a heck of an
answer.  
  
But even when she made it, it wasn't like, so. We still thought, okay, four-
point game. We had gone through all the scenarios. I don't think we were ever
deflated until that last foul and whatever, with the intentional. That was the
only time, I think, we just thought, well, we might be out of time here. But
it wasn't like we were playing a soft zone. I mean, they were really sharp,
really, really sharp.  
  
We did make some personnel mistakes, but not 100. I mean, you make one and
they find it and it's three points. And the quality of their passing, they're
right in the shooting pocket. So you can't be a second late. It's not like
they go and get the ball and bring it into their shooting pocket. They're on
time, on target with their passing game, and they were tonight. They were what
I saw on film. And they had tremendous poise.  
  
I'll tell you, they are -- that team tonight was very, very good and would
have beaten a lot of people. And we played well and got beat.  
  
Q. Katie, can you talk about the pressure defense? You had, the press,
and maybe something that you -- I know you don't look ahead, but you had
studied them in the time between games. You got some turnovers but also maybe
led to some open shots. Can you talk about your thought process behind that?  
COACH MEIER: Well, I think as Tim referenced, we were playing uphill. And so
we had a couple of different presses there. It wasn't the same one. We were
trying to do some schemes. And, you know, there were a couple of times we got
real excited because it worked and then we were down one and then we overran
something that -- we know better.  
  
But you know, they also were very balanced. And the pressure, then when we sat
back in our man and just let them isolate us, they were scoring on that, too.
So it was a certain point I was just thinking, let's just make sure we answer
because it could have gotten away from a lot of teams if they didn't --
Jessica had a career high tonight.  
  
This game could have gotten away from a lot of teams to combat 14 3s. Like I
said, we weren't sitting in the 2-3 zone saying, we dare you. We were
challenging their shots, too, and they were making them.  
  
To overcome that and still have a chance to win it or be within one on a
performance like that, I think, I'm disappointed but I gotta tell you, that
that's one of the -- that is really a lot of points to try to combat.  
  
Q. What's it say about the depth of women's basketball that -- sometimes
people say there isn't the depth, but this is a 12 seed that knocked off
Marquette and you guys? What does it say about the growth of the game and some
of the teams that people don't know much about?  
COACH MEIER: I think you're seeing it, like I said on Saturday, you're seeing
it on the women's side now, too, that you're starting to see on the men's side
-- you get a group that's real connected. They're veteran. They're well
coached. And they have a style that they are committed to and they don't waver
from it.  
  
And you're starting to see that pop up on the women's side too. So I guess it
says that, stylistically, you can win a lot of different ways in women's
basketball. And that's good, that's good for the sport, because I thought they
were two amazing styles. That had to be a wonderful game to watch on TV. I
mean, it was not boring. It was really a big-time basketball game.  
  
I just want to say, again, thank you for the administration and the community
and all the support we got, because I'll never forget that. It really meant a
lot. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Morgan Manz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33164)

### [Adily Martucci](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33165)

### [Aryn McClure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33270)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Quinnipiac - 85, Miami - 78  
  
COACH FABBRI: Good opening quarter for the Bobcats into halftime with a solid
lead. Miami made a great charge and almost an instant replay of the opening-
round game against Marquette. Just a great game. Great game I'm sure to watch,
one that we're thrilled obviously to win and move on to the Sweet 16.  
  
Can't say enough great things about Coach Katie Meier and her Miami team. But
I'm just so proud of our Bobcats and the way they battled and the way that
they again responded in the most difficult of situations on their home court,
not to lose the lead and make big plays again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, seemed like every time they either went on a mini run or
seemed poised to go on a run, you guys countered. And you were responsible
personally for a lot of those 3-pointers. And were you just feeling it
tonight, basically? Is it as simple as that?  
MORGAN MANZ: Yeah, I mean, my teammates and coaches, they all have the utmost
confidence in -- more confidence than I do in my shots. I just did what my
coaches have been asking me to do for the last four years, and that was just
shoot it. And I just let it fly because we had nothing to lose.  
  
Q. In the last 48 hours-plus, we've seen this team take, build up double
digits leads, time and time again the other team make a serious run. You never
relinquished a lead in either game. For each of the players, what's that been
like for you guys to withstand the onslaught of an attempted comeback that you
thwarted on two occasions?  
ARYN MCCLURE: Grit. Yeah, that's pretty much it. On both games, teams came
back, cut the lead kind of short. But we stayed focused and we knew our end
goal, and we just maintained our lead. And we end up being successful.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: Just to bounce off Aryn, I think we, in times that they weren't
going our way, we stayed together as a team and we really just fought it out.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's nothing that we haven't seen all year. And that's why we
are the team that we are, because of this whole season. And it has shaped us
into the players that we are today, the toughness that we have is incredible.  
  
I am so proud of my team. I'm so proud of my team because of how tough they
are.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you talk about your shot and the evolution of it? The
stroke seems obviously to work beautifully, like a long stroke, maybe like a
long follow-through. Could you talk about your evolution of your shot and as a
career night? And how long it took you to get here, the work that you put in?
Just talk about your shooting, please.  
MORGAN MANZ: I've always been a shooter growing up. My coaches always, all the
time, keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting. And honestly I feel like I
haven't hit a 3 in a very long time, the last couple of games. Even today in
shoot-around, I was missing, and Coach is, like, just keep shooting, just keep
shooting.  
  
And the one thing I focused on today was getting it higher than I usually do,
because when I do miss, I have a very flat shot. So my goal was the more arc
and obviously it helped.  
  
Q. Morgan, I know the thinking all season was get to the tournament, win
a game, see what happens. Now that it's over and you've won these two, how
realistic, really, was this for you guys when you saw the bracket, knowing
that you would have to beat two major conference teams to get out of -- to get
to Stockton? How realistic did you really think it was?  
MORGAN MANZ: I think we just came in here with a lot of confidence. I have
confidence in all of our players and our coaching staff. They prepare us well
for each game. And we didn't look at the team name on their shirts. It was we
were going to play Quinnipiac basketball, and we were going to do what we can.
And if we had to adjust, we had to adjust.  
  
And, I think, I mean, I am at a loss of words that we're at a Sweet 16, but I
couldn't be more proud of our team and what we've accomplished.  
  
Q. Adily, Morgan hit a lot of 3s, but the one you hit with less than a
minute left, the one-point game, you take us through that shot? And how did
you -- did it feel good coming out of your hands?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I honestly didn't know it was going in. I was definitely
hoping for the best. But once I saw it release my hand, I kind of knew it was.
And obviously I got excited afterwards. But yeah, it was just amazing that it
went in, and I was obviously very, very pumped about it.  
  
Q. Last night you're outside of your hotel. It's close to one in the
morning. And it's the second time in the last couple of weeks that it's
happened. Did you ever think that it was maybe a good luck charm?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Some of our teammates are saying that. It was actually funny.
We were just making a joke of it because it did happen during the MAAC
Tournament. We had a fire alarm and we were all outside waiting to get back
in. So we were like, hey, this happened before. Deja vu basically. So, yeah,
we were joking about that. But it panned out the way it did.  
  
Q. For all three of you, I know you're a confident team; you've won,
what, 29 games now. But are you feeling more confident now given what you've
accomplished here and going forward now to face South Carolina?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. I think every game that we win we build more
confidence. It's kind of hard not to.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: Yeah, I have to agree with Addy. I think we have a lot of
confidence right now, and we're just going to take the next game like the next
game.  
  
ARYN MCCLURE: Yeah, the goal at the beginning of the season was to make it to
the Sweet 16. Now we made it, so why not keep going.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's honestly addicting. It really is. Something about this
tournament, you just want more and more and more. And we're going to try to
get some more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously this game is beyond great for the program, for you and the
players. Can you also look at it as being good for the sport itself, women's
basketball, with the parity we talked about yesterday, and a 12 beating a 4
and all that kind of stuff?  
COACH FABBRI: I think anytime you can get a new name moving forward in a
bracket creates an excitement. And that's really, ultimately, what the March
Madness is about, right, when you have those upsets and what everyone looks
forward to. And the buzz that it has created and what it's become -- the
excitement. And that's what everyone looks forward to. And we're happy to do
our part in creating the March Madness and move it forward.  
  
But definitely, again, I think we flew under the radar getting into the
tournament. And I just saw the teams in our pod and really liked our
opportunities down here. So this team was very confident coming into the
tournament, coming down here to see our opponents and made the most of real
opportunities down here this weekend.  
  
Q. You're supposed to be a hockey school. And you kind of shot some
holes in that one over the last three days. I know you're not going to be on
campus for long, but what do you think the reaction is going to be when you
get back up there?  
COACH FABBRI: I think it is going to be over-the-moon thrilled. The outpouring
of support that we have received while we've been down here has been like none
other that I've ever witnessed.  
  
And I know that when we get back to campus and what's going on back there, the
buzz, the buzz up there has been incredible. So we're excited to get back and
see everybody.  
  
So they love their women's basketball. I mean, us going down to the
tournament. They already expected us to win. You know, our fans expect us to
win. So that was almost like no surprise to them. They were excited to see
what happened tonight.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, when Katie was in here, she said in the handshake
line you were trying to keep it so together. And she had to say to you, please
go enjoy this, please go celebrate. In that immediacy, what was that moment
like for you?  
COACH FABBRI: Be professional. Be professional. Be professional. Go down the
line. Shake the hands, congratulate them on a good season. Obviously there's a
disappointment. But do the right thing, and then get into the locker room with
your team, and then that's where you have your moment with your team.  
  
Q. In the beginning of the third quarter, your team picked up a couple
of fouls real quick and you had Adily and Jen on the bench with four. How do
you make sure your team doesn't get discouraged and stays disciplined?  
COACH FABBRI: It's what we've done -- I think we sound redundant, as a broken
record. Again, this team has epitomized a true team. I'm up here because I
have head coach. But I have an incredible staff. It's a team.  
  
I have to remind everybody, we didn't have a player named on the first-team
All-MAAC because on any given night, I think the debate that hurts us is,
you'll talk to coaches in the league, that it was a different player on a
different night that had a big game.  
  
And for those who are not as familiar with the program, you see that tonight.
Jen was great at first, had the hot hand. Then Morgan had the hot hand. And
then you had the mainstays that always chip in and do it. But we do it
together on defense. And it's whoever is going to get the ball and put the
ball in the basket.  
  
The team is so unselfish -- we ultimately epitomize what a team is. They can't
take away two or three people and beat us. And that's why we win a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a very good passing team. You had 24 assists today.
What did you think early on, maybe it might have been first minute or two,
Miami goes into a press, pretty much full court -- did you think that played
into your hands? What were you thinking?  
COACH FABBRI: Well, that's a tendency of theirs to do. I thought they came at
it a little harder. I think they saw some things on film that they thought
they might be able to do and have some success. But it does allow us to get
out. And go once we took a deep breath against the press, it allowed us to get
out in transition and really score and get us going offensively in transition
for some good looks and open up a nice lead.  
  
Q. Coach, you started the Gold Rush four or five years ago, and that
kind of propelled you guys on to the mid-major scene. Have you ever thought
about the irony, that you've gotten to your goal and you didn't use that these
two games?  
COACH FABBRI: No, because we've played players all year long that were in a
position to make the play when we needed it the most. And Morgan is a perfect
example of get the ball, look at the rim and take and make the shot. So I
think it's developing players who are comfortable to be in a position to get
the ball to make the play.  
  
We got out on the 5 and 5, and still had its benefits even tonight, because
it's everybody else who has the ball in their hand, like, we don't turn the
ball over. It's not just two people who are touching the ball. It's everybody
touching the ball.  
  
You saw us multiple times adjusting what we were doing with the pressure --
bringing the ball up the floor and how versatile we are. And, again, it's just
having kids that have experience that put them in positions that -- we've run
things through these two people. We run things through everybody. But we know
who we want to have the ball when it's going to be on the line.  
  
But it's them being confident to go out when it counts the most in situations
when people are in foul trouble, to go make plays. And that's what you saw in
two games, when we were managing foul trouble.  
  
And we were out there with four forwards and a guard. And I was, like, going,
okay you be the 2, you be the 3. And I couldn't keep it straight, and everyone
else is trying to keep it straight. That's why we're good because we have that
versatility and we play a lot of players.  
  
Q. How surprised were you when you turned the corner in the locker room
and got that shower from your team?  
COACH FABBRI: I saw it on the monitor. I was hot. I got cooled down, so I was
happy to get it.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate any trouble keeping your kids in the moment? I mean
Sweet 16, it's a lofty, wonderful place, of course. But do you guys expect any
problem keeping their minds on what's coming Saturday and not really much more
than that?  
COACH FABBRI: Ladies?  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We're focused and ready to go.  
  
COACH FABBRI: We are going to enjoy this. And then we will get focused and get
down to work and stay in our routine with what we've done all year long and
get prepared to see South Carolina.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH MEIER: Well, we've been busy. We've been busy sense you last saw me. And
the kids, I think they're well rested, but the coaching staff has been
grinding it out. It's a heck of a challenge. We had not looked ahead to either
opponent. So from the minute that buzzer sounded, we moved on; and Quinnipiac
is very good. Of course, they're extremely well coached. They have great
mental discipline. They have great balance in terms of the who, where, when
and why is very well done. It's very, very well done.  
  
The players just got their first look at them, but you gotta really see a full
game to understand how unselfish they are and how impressive they are in
sharing the basketball and just taking whatever matchup or whatever shot is
the best shot for them. So it's a very, very tough matchup for us. But of
course it is. I mean there's 32 teams left, and we're one of them, and nothing
is going to be easy.  
  
So we're excited. We are definitely realistic. We're not too high, we're not
too low. We're not considering this some, oh, we're so happy that there was an
upset and we play -- no. No, no, no. We watched that game and a very, very
good team beat a very, very good team, and one of them we were going to play
if we were fortunate enough to beat a very, very good team. And so there's
extra excitement or energy or anything. We're still in business mode. And we
gotta fix some mistakes from last night in a very short amount of time.  
  
But we made some big-time plays. We had a lot of pressure on us and we made
some big-time plays when it mattered. And you don't know who's going to do it.
The other team does not know who on Miami is going to be -- you know, make
those plays, and I think that makes us pretty special, too.  
  
Q. Laura, when you looked at yesterday, just what did they take away
from the perimeter game, because it seemed like -- obviously everyone knows 1
for 14 from three, but it just didn't seem like a lot of those looks were real
clean either. What did they take away and how much are you expecting maybe a
bounceback from the outside tomorrow?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I think Florida Gulf Coast did a great job on their scouting
report. They know who were our shooters. They pressured us. So I think they
did a great job, but you know, we know what we are. We know -- you know, our
shooters keep shooting. So it's not that we are discouraged or whatever by
yesterday's game, because I think we were 1 for 14 and we still won the game.
So you know, that shows our balance; if we can't score from outside, we score
from inside. So you know, and tomorrow we'll just keep shooting, because you
know, shooters shoot.  
  
Q. Key, yesterday you guys had a nice lead, Quinnipiac had a nice lead.
Both of you guys had to weather those late pushes. How much do you think that
was just composure coming into play for both of you guys that you were able to
weather what you did in Gulf Coast and what they did in Marquette?  
KEYONA HAYES: Can you ask the question again, please?  
  
Q. Just how much do you think it was composure that helped you guys kind
of hang on when Florida Gulf Coast made their run and the experience of having
been there? Quinnipiac had the same thing. They had a nice lead against
Marquette. It got away from them. They still managed to hang on. So how much
do you think composure came into play for both of you guys yesterday?  
KEYONA HAYES: I think a lot of composure was there. We were up and we let a
big lead go, and I just think that, you know, we kind of relaxed, and maybe
they relaxed as well, and then it's like, okay, let's -- we don't want to
lose. No one wants to be out. So I think we all -- like them and us just were
like, okay, take it a play at a time. We were up. So we know what to do to get
back to do what we have to do to win the game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I don't know how much you've seen of
Quinnipiac this year or if you've seen the film from yesterday or if you've
watched film on them. If you have, what do you know about them and what kind
of challenges they might present?  
EMESE HOF: We watched the third quarter yesterday before our own game, and
they were just a really energetic team. They were really unselfish, like
everything that was going on. They had a really good game yesterday. We just
got out of the film room and we saw some more breakdown. They're a good team,
but we are too, so we'll be ready for them.  
  
Q. Emese, when you came here, how much did you dream about moments like
what's coming tomorrow night, a chance on your own floor to go to the Sweet
16? I guess how much of a lure, I guess, was that for you when you decided to
come here?  
EMESE HOF: Like for me, back home those are not terms you heard about. It's
not even like real touchable. I've never been in the United States before I
went on any of my visits here. So to be able to, yeah, live that American
dream almost, it's great. And it's just fantastic to get an opportunity like
that.  
  
Q. You do know what those terms mean now?  
EMESE HOF: I definitely do. (Laughs.)  
  
Q. Katie, can you just sort of give us a tick tock as to what the last
18 hours have kind of been like, and was there any sleep involved for you last
night?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. It took me a while to come down from that game. I think I
really, really tried to keep it together, so when it's over -- my heart rate
was fine during the game. It's amazing when you watch it again, then I know
how everyone else felt that was texting me the thousand texts, because I was
like, what's the big deal? It's the next play, and then you watch it and
you're like, oh, my God. That was really something.  
  
So it took me a while to come down from that. But the staff, we gathered at
the hotel at about 8:30 and started our work. So we didn't stay here. We got
away, because I knew it might take me a little bit, and got back to the hotel.
I just thought all eyes on Quinnipiac, really focused. We met again this
morning. You know, about four films I've watched between the game and now, and
I'm comfortable with it. I think we're in good shape.  
  
But it's not a time for sleep. I'm sleeping so that I don't snap on you all.
(Laughs). The sleep is so that I remain human. But it's not the priority. As
long as I keep my wits about myself and my staff, we're all on the same page,
the priority is preparation right now.  
  
Q. Kate, the 9:00 start, does that give you -- were you happy with it,
just maybe them getting some extra rest or is it the whole think about it all
day before you get on the court?  
COACH MEIER: Right. We're going to do the same routine for a 7:00 game. We're
just going to bounce it back a couple of hours. And you know, I don't know,
whatever gets a crowd here. I really, really hope that our crowd can come.  
  
I don't think if we're looking for that to knock us off track, then we're not
the team I thought we were. We're going to be highly focused. We're very clear
that we don't think we played our best basketball game yesterday, and we still
haven't played that perfect game. But it's coming, and we have won in one
thousand different ways, and we're going to have to find a way to win
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Laura, like Emese said, they were just terms to her, things like
Sweet 16. How aware were you of what the NCAA tournament was and all that goes
with it before you came over here?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, I've been prolonging it for a couple of years now. They
actually show March Madness on TV back home, so that's awesome.  
  
But you know, it's just really special to host, first of all. And I'm just
really grateful that we have a chance to play another 40 minutes here in front
of our own fans, and we're just trying to take it one game at a time. I mean
Sweet 16 is close now, but you know, the only thing we have at the end of the
day is 40 more minutes of basketball. So yeah. But we're ready.  
  
Q. Key, Katie and talked about this the other day, just having the
vision that this program has at this moment. You signed on when this wasn't --
you know, when this was what the goal was. Has it played out the way you've
envisioned, and again, what would it mean just to have it be that moment
tomorrow for you as one of the seniors on this team?  
KEYONA HAYES: As in winning tomorrow? It'll be great. I mean we've never made
it to the Sweet 16. Growing up for everybody, it's a dream to continue to go
up and be in the Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four. That's what every basketball
player dreams of. It'll be amazing for us to reach Sweet 16, and go further.  
  
But like Laura said, it's one step at a time, one game at a time.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just give us your breakdown of what you've seen from
Quinnipiac on film or in person, what challenges they present?  
COACH MEIER: I mean that's the thing. That's what we talked about in the
locker room. There's no thing out there. There's no, whatever, Sweet 16 thing
out there that we're going after. We've got a heck of an opponent. And they
are -- they don't fear anyone. Tricia and I spent some time together in
Portugal this summer watching her kid, my three, and I was impressed by her
confidence. You know, they're very confident. They don't back down for anyone,
and they have a chip on their shoulder. They feel like they're an underrated
mid major. They are an underrated mid major. I mean they're major as far as
I'm concerned. And so they don't have to worry about us disrespecting them
because that's not going to happen. They're awfully good, and they've been
good; and she's been a heck of a coach for a long time, and she knows what
she's doing. So that's where we're at.  
  
Q. What was in Portugal?  
COACH MEIER: It was the European championship. Laura and Emese and Serena were
there. And Tricia was there with Paula Strautmane. She's playing from Latvia.  
  
Q. Katie, you look at them, and to kind of touch on Tricia again a
little bit, too. Carly Fabbri, is she the prototypical coach on the floor?  
COACH MEIER: Yes. It is a mini me out there. It really is. She's really smart,
knows what to do with the ball. Completely just the moxie that Tricia has you
see in her daughter, too. So they're fueled. They are fueled by a belief that
is pretty special. And this isn't some fairytale for them. They completely
expect to be here and they completely expected to beat Marquette. And I knew
that. I knew that when I saw the brackets come out.  
  
Q. 12:55, obviously. There were some other really good games, UConn and
Baylor did what they did, but are you seeing that gap from 1 to 64 start to
condense maybe a little bit more?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. And I think stylistically it's really something to -- and I
think that that's -- you see it on the men's side a ton, and now you see it on
the women's side, that you make certain choices in recruiting. I'm not -- the
power conferences, that's not my term, but that's how I can just relate it to
you, that they're going to recruit in a certain way and then other certain
conferences recruit a totally different way, and then you gotta meet up in a
really important thing.  
  
We've spent two months not playing against a certain style, and then poof,
your first couple of rounds here it comes. And you see it on the men's side,
too. They have a hard time, the bigs get neutralized a little bit. And that's
what I thought Gulf Coast tried to do to us. They tried to neutralize our
bigs, saying we have this style that you haven't seen because we see a lot of
these kind of bodies in the ACC, and then you come into this moment, and I
just think it takes a real maturity to sort of reinvent your defensive schemes
and then to figure out how to make sure that we got our way, that we got our
bigs in the paint where we need them.  
  
And Quinnipiac and Gulf Coast are just so established, they're just such
established programs that they go out of conference and they play against our
style a lot more than we play against their style. That's what they do in the
nonconference. And we went and played Ohio State, and Kentucky and St. John's,
we didn't play that style so much. So that was a real task and it's a task
again for Monday and maybe that's something we keep in mind scheduling moving
forward.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Jen Fay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33235)

### [Adily Martucci](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33165)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the 12th seeded Quinnipiac Bobcats the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference champions and they defeated Marquette, 68-65. We have
Coach Tricia Fabbri, Carly Fabbri, Adily Martucci and Jen Fay up here.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: Yesterday was certainly an exciting day for our team, our
alumni, our fans and the university. It was a great day. Once we were able to
relax and enjoy a little bit we certainly buckled down and got to work on our
next opponent once we found out that it was going to be Miami. Our focus and
attention has been on Miami since last night. Today we woke up ready, all
ready to film and scout and prepare for the Hurricanes tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jen, you said you have done film and scout already, right? Obviously,
they exploited inside yesterday and you guys had some success in the paint as
well. How important do you see that battle being tomorrow?  
JEN FAY: Yeah, I think they're a very different team than Marquette. They're
more physical and obviously bigger. We've played against a lot of teams that
been bigger than us throughout the season, so we're going to use our speed and
try and run the floor and I think that will help us.  
  
Q. Your stated goal at the start of the season you wanted to win an NCAA
Tournament game make history that way. Now that you've done that do you have
to guard against any let-down, not being as amped for tomorrow, or do you
think that will not be an issue?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We're amped for this game tomorrow, there is no let-up. At the
very least we wanted one win and tomorrow is another day to make more history.
That's what it is.  
  
Q. Carly, what's it like playing for your mom?  
CARLY FABBRI: It's been a great experience. I think the opportunity for us to
have made history together is really awesome. Not a lot of people can say they
have, A, won game in the tournament; and, B, done it playing for their mom. So
that's really cool. I think she has kept it very professional, coach and
player on the court, off the court obviously it's a bit of a different
relationship than everybody else has. An awesome experience and trying to keep
it going tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, Miami does make some threes, they didn't show it yesterday
obviously but they can shoot threes. Their guards were kept in check all game.
Do you sort of expect more of a bounce-back from them tomorrow? When you saw
their tapes, what jumped out about their guard play?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I expect them to come out with everything. We're just ready to
defend whatever they're going to throw out at us. We expect the best game from
the guards probably that they'll every play.  
  
Q. For Jen, you guys obviously pulled off an upset yesterday and Florida
Gulf Coast gave Miami a scare. Do you see more parity in the women's game?  
JEN FAY: I think it's awesome because night in and night out any team can beat
anybody and that showed. So Florida Gulf Coast is a great team and it was a
close game and it was a lot of fun.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like when you woke up this morning? Did you have
to pinch yourself and say, hey, we're going to play Monday night for a chance
to play in the Sweet 16?  
CARLY FABBRI: I think we all knew this was an attainable goal. Obviously,
still waking up in Miami is an amazing, but I think we have the opportunity to
get to the Sweet 16. But as much as it may seem "dream-like" it's a real on
that we can attain. We are enjoying the experience but also having the
mentality that this is a business trip for us.  
  
Q. How do you balance focusing on yourselves rather than the opponent?
Which takes precedence?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: All season long we have been focusing on ourselves. All that
matters is us being our best all the time. That's the reason I think we've
been so successful is not really worry being our opponent. Knowing our scout
but definitely focusing on being the best version of us every day.  
  
Q. You probably got a sense this was coming. What's it like coaching
Carly? What's that experience been like for you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: It's been -- I've been so fortunate to have coached as long as
I have and have had so many incredible young ladies come through the doors at
Quinnipiac. Having your own daughter share in that experience has just added
to really putting the cherry on top for me.  
  
I sit up here with Jen Fay, Adily Martucci and Carly Fabbri and every lady
that's down here with me and for 22 years that I have coached has been a part
of this experience and has helped us achieve what we have achieved this
weekend. Every single one of those young ladies, it's been a privilege to
coach.  
  
But to share this moment with your daughter is pretty awesome. But to share it
with Adily and Jen and this team it's history. It's hard to put into words.
It's certainly -- it's really, really nice.  
  
Q. Late last night we find out that it's a 9:00 start. What is the
challenge of that? Do you want them to get extra rest, thinking about it all
day? How do you manage those where you've got to wait all day to play this
game?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Great question. First of all, it was actually really exciting
because to me Monday night at 9:00 kinda seems like it's the big Monday!
Certainly prime time and where we want to be. Two, the time and the start with
it being a long day, look at the weather in Miami, not a bad spot to be.  
  
The third component, the rest, is really, really important with the pace,
physicality of the game yesterday and at the point where you are in the season
the time, the recovery, and the ability to relax right now with the quick
turn-around, even with the press conference, the film and the scout, I think
that's all key. So I don't think we're going to mind the 9:00 start at all. I
think that time is going to help us.  
  
Q. Ally tweeted congratulations to you guys after the game yesterday.
I'm sure there were others from the MAAC as well. What's that mean that you
spent four months trying to smash each other's heads in yesterday but what was
the response from the MAAC?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Honestly, I have barely touched my phone and looking with
everybody reaching out, but from the administration, the administrators of the
MAAC and my colleagues in the MAAC, the support that we received was
overwhelming from everybody on the thread and really that is what I have found
to be truly unique in my experience at coaching in the MAAC is the comradery
among the coaches and that is what I truly value coaching in the MAAC was the
tweet and from everybody reaching out.  
  
From the mid-major perspective how they were all like, go in and represent us
well, feeling that burden and what we talk about, you know, that upset, that
5-12, the respect, the mid-major shouldering that and winning. The pride that
they all had. I was so pleased and was just so proud to represent and see how
excited they were for us. Getting that win and championing that cause for all
of them. It was awesome.  
  
Q. UConn won by 60 and Baylor won by 20. There were good games here. Are
you seeing that gap toward the top getting closed?  
TRICIA FABBRI: We saw that last year in the women's Final Four. I believe
there are continued, elite programs, and they remain elite. You're starting to
see, again, I mentioned from the women's Final Four last year, you're start to
go see now maybe programs from five to ten, 11, 12, you're seeing Texas, more
programs starting to bubble up, and starting to take that mantle.  
  
You're start to go see more upsets and you're certainly starting to see that
now with the 5-12. Unfortunately, we were looking at another 5-12 game late
last night that almost happened in another close one. It's happening. It's
starting -- the pendulum is starting to slowly happen and the more we can see
the results in this tournament as it's slowly starting to shift, the better
it's going to be.  
  
Q. Trisha, you shared a special moment with your President, John Lahey.
Can you share what he told you after the game and what he shared with your
team in the locker room?  
TRICIA FABBRI: President Lahey and his wife Judy were here yesterday at the
game and he will be here tomorrow night. Just joy! I don't think -- he always
hoped just like us making this a reality. He's been the biggest advocate for
our university being at its best. What his vision was for this university, the
building of York Hill and the arena, Quinnipiac being on the national stage.  
  
It came to fruition seeing his women's basketball team win a game in the NCAA
Tournament. It was his plan. We talked about it, our goals and aspirations
about winning games in the tournament. He has talked about this plan going
forward and he felt like we did, sharing in the joy of attaining that goal and
he was so pleased, so happy; and sharing in that moment with the President in
our locker room. He was emotional and he was just joyful in sharing that
moment with this team and he couldn't have been any happier. It was awesome.  
  
Q. What do you see from Miami, what challenges they present and
obviously they will be the home team with the partisan crowd tomorrow night?  
TRISHA FABBRI: Look, they're a great team, extremely well-coached. They want
to play fast. They have two great lead guards. They've got size. They have
depth. They changed their defenses. We're going to have our hands full on a
home court that has great crowd, but this is why you play this game this time
of year. We're 1 of a field of 32. I firmly believe that our experience going
out to Vegas, seeing three games in three days, playing a New Mexico State
team that gave Stanford all they could handle. Us playing and beating Long
Beach State that we know went wire-to-wire against Oregon State, and seeing
Oregon State, all those different style of games in three days has completely
compared us for the weekend that we're having. I fully expect that we are
going to be prepared. We are going to be ready for the moment again with
Miami. It's not going to make it easier. They're talented. They play so hard.
They play really well. We certainly have our work cut out for us. We're going
to be ready to play, have a plan, go out and execute and certainly leave it
all out on the floor for 40-plus minutes because we know it's this game,
tomorrow night, that's standing between us and a Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That will conclude the press conference.

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Haley Laughter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33240)

### [Taylor Gradinjan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33241)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida Gulf Coast University head coach Karl
Smesko and student-athletes Haley Laughter and Taylor Gradinjan.  
  
COACH SMESKO: Obviously a very disappointing ending. We came here with the
idea that we were going to win and advance. The first half we didn't play
particularly well or shoot it. We were a little rattled early.  
  
It was a little, it was my fault it took a little long to make an adjustment
versus their 1-3-1. I thought we did a better job against that later in the
half and in the second half. But I couldn't be more proud of the way our kids
fought back.  
  
We started off shooting it really poor, but we just hung around and then when
we start playing when we're capable of playing it was a game to literally the
last second.  
  
I'm really proud of our team, really disappointed that we don't get a chance
to play again, because I like the way we're competing right now. And this is
the heartbreak in March, and hopefully everybody can at least see how
competitive our team is and how hard they're willing to work and how much
fight they have in them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes only.  
  
Q. Taylor, on the last play, on the defensive end where you stood in for
the charge, no call, what was your perspective on the play?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: It's disappointing. But that's what the refs thought it was,
and you gotta deal with it. We had another chance to bring it down on the
other end, and we just didn't accelerate from what we had. So nothing we could
do about it. It sucks, but it was a good play by their post move and you gotta
deal with it.  
  
Q. Haley, it seemed as though you guys were just waiting for that one
spurt, and then it finally came, maybe on the five-point play, late in the
third or something like that. How were you able to keep confidence up when
nothing was falling for so long for you guys?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: We came in at halftime and we kind of regrouped, and we told
each other we're only down, I don't remember how many, we were down six at
halftime. And we're right in this game, guys. We just gotta keep going, our
shots are going to fall. We just really kept telling each other one more stop,
one more stop. And if we could get that one stop then it will start going our
way on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Taylor, you seemed to be struggling a little bit from behind the arc,
then you hit the big 3 to tie the game with less than 10 seconds to go. Was it
something that Karl was telling you or your teammates were telling you to keep
shooting the ball?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: Absolutely. That's all I hear from Karl and my teammates is
keep shooting, and if I don't shoot it when I'm open I get in trouble. But, I
mean, they're going to fall. I did start out a little rough and I knew that,
but I knew if I got to my finish they would fall at some point.  
  
Q. Ladies, is the emotion more the pride in how well you guys played or
the disappointment in getting that close at the end and having two very
questionable calls not go your way and maybe not having a chance to keep
playing?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: I mean, obviously we were frustrated with how the game ended,
but we can't really base the game off those last two calls. We just needed to
make a couple more plays in the first half, say, when we weren't attacking as
much.  
  
I think we have been playing really well towards the end of the season and we
finally hit our peak. I think that's just the most disappointing part is to
have to see it end now.  
  
Q. Haley, throughout the season you guys typically hit a lot more 3s,
your percentage was a lot higher other than this game. Uncharacteristically,
you hit a lot less, as a team, a lot less 3s, but even though you took the
same amount that you take. What do you attest it to? Was it defense or
nerves?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: We were getting open shots. That wasn't the problem. I just
think the first half, especially, it was just more nerves. We just needed to
calm down and relax and get to our finish. I think ultimately that was it.
Because we were getting open and getting the shots, just calm down.  
  
Q. Whenever you guys average 9.7 3s made per game and then go 2-for-19
in a half, how frustrating is it considering that's a big part of your
offense?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: That's frustrating but as a shooter you have to have the
shooter mentality. You're a shooter, it's going to fall. Just keep shooting.  
  
Q. What did Coach have to say to you afterward about the level of play,
obviously, but just dealing with the disappointment?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: He said he was proud of us and that we did really well and
that it's a disappointment that we couldn't move on when we're doing so well
at this point in the season. But I mean he was just encouraging about all of
it. He basically said what he started off with in here except maybe a little
more personal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Have you gotten a chance to review either of the last two plays
before you came in?  
COACH SMESKO: No, just what I saw on the floor.  
  
Q. I know you were arguing pretty vehemently for the charge call. What
did you see on the last play down at your end?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm the best person to ask,
because obviously I have my perspective, and it's not necessarily objective.
So we'll have to -- usually I watch the game on the way home. But I may wait a
couple of days. That's if -- my assistants will want to see it right away and
make a judgment.  
  
But we were in a position to win the game. It was a tight game. I don't think
you can ever blame a call for one call or two calls, because there's a
thousand plays within a game. So it was a well-officiated game with the little
bit of a controversial ending.  
  
Q. Karl, seeing you emotional occasionally after seasons end in tough
ways. Is that the same sentiment here? Is that all of it? Or is it partly the
way that it ended make it even harder to accept?  
COACH SMESKO: The way it ended makes it tougher, for sure. But you never want
any season to end. And for me I was okay, maybe a little irritated, when I
went into the locker room. But then when you see all the kids that worked so
hard for so long and they're all crying, you don't have a heart if it doesn't
get to you.  
  
Q. You said in the first half that it took you a little longer to adjust
to the 1-3-1 than it possibly should have. What were you doing in the second
half that made the offense click a little better?  
COACH SMESKO: We were having a kid behind the zone be more active, cutting
into gaps. And then where we placed our shooters based on how they were
playing, you know, they kind of sagged off our non-shooters to take away our
shooters in the 1-3-1, so we had to move where they were.  
  
And it took like four or five minutes of that 1-3-1 and you saw we had a
number of turnovers right in a row until we made the adjustment. So that was
something that I wish we would have -- that's something that we have in our
arsenal and we should have went to it a little bit quicker.  
  
Q. To play for you guys always has to require a level of resolve to go
up against bigger teams all the time. As much as they were struggling with the
shots and as physical as Miami is, where would you equate the degree of
resolve the girls showed today with what you've seen with your program?  
COACH SMESKO: This team has fought as hard as any I've had today. To be behind
against a top-20 team on the road and you could see a little bit of
frustration on our kids' faces when shots weren't falling. To come back from
that and realize that they were capable of coming back and capable of winning
the game and essentially taking it to the end against a great team. So I got
no calms with our competitiveness or how we responded to adversity. I'm very
proud of our players.  
  
Q. Going against taller players, two drives in a row there in the
fourth, China went right at their 6'3 " player. Could you talk about her
mentality, how she just showed no fear going against somebody that much bigger
than her?  
COACH SMESKO: We thought China had the best matchup at the end of the game. We
kept going to it and creating space, having her drive the shooter's gap. And
then we had some cuts just in case she was cut off, so she'd have somebody to
pass it to.  
  
But give her a lot of credit. Early in the game she maybe forced a couple of
shots and then at the end of the game she got to the rim. She absorbed
contact. We were hoping maybe to get some and-ones on those situations.  
  
But to finish over a kid of that size and the way China used her body to
create an angle to shoot, it was really impressive.  
  
Q. You've seen them both, obviously. What do you think Trish can do
against Miami on Monday night?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I'm not surprised Quinnipiac moved on at all. We've played
them three straight years, and I know Marquette is really good. Won the Big
East. But Quinnipiac is a really good team with really good players and
they're not that quite as big a mismatch inside as we were today.  
  
They're big kids, they're strong and physical and they can score. So I expect
Quinnipiac to play really well. They'll still be underdogs playing here in
this arena, and Miami's a great team. But it's good to see a mid-major do so
well.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Miami - 62, Florida Gulf Coast - 60  
  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I don't think that was the beautiful offensive display that
both coaches in the crowd probably wasn't expecting, but there were a lot of
veteran plays down the stretch, so congratulations to Gulf Coast. I thought
they played tough when they started getting hot from the three there. That was
their true identity, so their second half performance from the three is more
indicative of who they are, and we know that. So when they started getting
comfortable, that's why they're so good. That's why they have so many wins on
the year, and that's why they were in this tournament at our place. We had to
counter that with our inside game, and that was not a surprise. That we knew
coming in.  
  
But I think in the first half when they were cold from the three and we broke
the rhythm a little bit, give us some credit for that, but we should have
taken -- we had a nice lead there that we kind of lost our focus and let slip.
So then when it comes down to it, you know, one big three and then they're --
they hit them in bunches, and they did. A couple mistakes late game for us,
but we're still alive, and we are very excited for the crowd that showed up
for us, and we're excited to have an exciting game for them, and we're excited
to continue to play.  
  
We are going to take it, and we're going to move on and we're going to get
ready for our next game on Monday.  
  
Q. Keyona, your last play, obviously not the last play of the game, you
kind of cut across, you post-up, and then just sort of take us through were
you just thinking you were going to overpower Taylor or did you know that --
did you know she was there? What was your thinking when you took the entry
pass?  
KEYONA HAYES: I felt her. I knew she was there. But she's a lot smaller than I
am, so I just took my time and laid the ball up.  
  
Q. Jessica, what does this mean big picture for you guys? Like Coach
said, it wasn't offensively pretty at times, but to grind and then to have the
lead most of the night and then lose it twice in the final two minutes and
survive, what does that mean about where this team is toughness wise right
now?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think we're definitely mentally tough. It came down to
making veteran plays at the end, and I'll keep saying it, I think I've been
saying it from the beginning of the season, but we executed when we needed to.
We had a few gutsy plays where a few mishaps and stuff like that, but as far
as this team, I think we just had the will to win. We had the will to win, and
didn't want to take no for an answer.  
  
I mean, it just came down to being sharp every play, every possession, and
just controlling the game.  
  
Q. What were you guys thinking when Motley went out toward the end
there?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I knew we had a 20-second delay because of the substitution,
but it was kind of weird, I was like, Mot fouled out? But when she stepped
out, we knew what we had to do. People knew they had to step up, and I think
that's what's so special about this team is we know our roles and we know what
we've got to do when certain people aren't on the floor. I mean, it was a
tough loss, but at the same time, I think we knew we definitely had to make
sure we executed this game and finished it off strong for her.  
  
Q. Keyona, back to that play where you posted up, that blocked charge is
always a difficult thing. Do you feel there was any dispute or controversy on
that play, whether it was a block or whether it was an offensive foul or
not?  
KEYONA HAYES: I mean, it's the NCAA Tournament, and it's the last like couple
of seconds of the game, and I'm just happy the refs let us play. It was a good
no-call.  
  
Q. Jessica, just your thoughts on Monday's game?  
JESSICA THOMAS: As far as what?  
  
Q. You have another chance to keep going.  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think as a team we're definitely excited and we're happy to
survive and advance. We've got another tough opponent in front of us coming up
on Monday, got to lock and load again, be mentally prepared, lock into the
game plan. I know our coaches and the staff, they'll get us right. They'll get
us prepared. Just looking forward to having another opportunity to play some
more basketball, especially as seniors.  
  
Q. The three-point play with 49 seconds left, that looked like you sort
of made something out of nothing, and then whoever cut baseline with 16 left,
I forget who that was, who you found on that pass, are you comfortable with
just having the ball in your hands in the last minute of a game, because you
had to make two very big plays that have kind of been forgotten about already
because of the way it all ended.  
EMESE HOF: I think I am like comfortable with the ball, and yeah. I didn't
even think about it, I think. They doubled key haze, so Key-key was wide open.
It was even a pretty sloppy pass. I have to admit that. But she got it, and
yeah, we made it work as a team.  
  
Q. Emese, going into Monday you're going to have a much better match-up
on the inside. I don't think it's going to be as easy. Not that it was easy,
but you definitely had a few mismatches there. What have you guys done to
prepare for that, for the bigs?  
EMESE HOF: Just like catching the ball high and keeping it high to throw it,
basically make lay-ups. But it's going to be different Monday, and personally
I'm happy about that. But we'll be fine. We're just going to make it work.
Anyway, we have a lot of people we can rely on, and we'll get there.  
  
Q. If you knew three hours ago you were going to shoot 1 for 14 from
three and Mot was going to have four, you would not have probably envisioned
that you'd be playing on Monday is my guess?  
KATIE MEIER: Exactly, no. But that's something about this team. I don't even
think last year we could have handled that. I'm pretty sure we couldn't have.
And yet we've been in -- we've had a lot of just -- this journey has been full
of adversity, and it's been full of gut checks, and it's been full of that's a
surprise. I'll tell you, Mot is as sharp as she's been all season. She's been
great as we prepared.  
  
You know, and it's not -- I mean, you ask how do we feel when she fouled out.
That wasn't this huge moment for us. It just wasn't. Okay, so we got Laura, we
got Key-key, and we're just going to keep going.  
  
I think that was crucial, our composure. We just were coaching every
possession, every second. We didn't get too big into, oh, my gosh, it's a
close game. We expected that, and then it was just a matter of -- I said in
the press conference, the preview press conference we had in here that the
coaches are going to have to coach very well within the game because these
teams are too good to let you go to your identity, and that's going to win the
game. The teams are too smart. Every call they called -- every call we called,
they knew. The scouting was great. So yeah, you have to do something
different. You're going to have to reinvent yourself in the middle of the
game, and we did. We went inside quite a bit, and I thought that was crucial
for us.  
  
Q. When you have a game like this, when you have two posts that are like
head and shoulders taller than anybody who's going to be guarding them,
there's going to be a lot of contact, a lot of people on the floor. How much
are you concerned going into a game like that that any time there's bodies on
the floor, there's a natural reaction to blow a whistle. Were you worried that
going to your strength might backfire on you a little bit?  
KATIE MEIER: Right, well, I told you the game would be can we play our bigs.
Are they going to try to foul them out with their drawing charge action, and
then are we going to be able to defend. They had China Dow going downhill and
I thought Hof did a pretty good job, but at the end there, they got a lay-up
on us and a couple fouls on Emese that she was walling up. That was the whole
game, and we knew that. But on that last play, I'll have to look at it for
Hayes, but she was very balanced. She was very balanced, and we had practiced
balance and pivots and whatever, and we had practiced that because we knew how
they would go, and she was pretty deep near the basket, too, so I felt good
about it, and we absolutely were going into her with Thomas. The whole play
was action to go Thomas to Hayes. We were going to go with our seniors.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you spoke to the degree of rally that they brought
to you guys and if in any way a game never comes down to the last two calls if
you guys feel in any way -- what's your perspective on the end game, two no-
calls, I guess, that you guys were the beneficiaries of, the final basket for
you guys for the win --  
KATIE MEIER: I think I'm getting your perspective. I'm sorry, but it sounds
like I'm getting your perspective.  
  
Q. Do you feel fortunate at all that with what FGCU brought at you guys
that you're able to get out of this one with a win?  
KATIE MEIER: I feel great about the win. I feel great about the crowd. I feel
great about the environment that we had. We executed down the stretch, and
they executed down the stretch. They got -- I feel great. I did compliment
them when you weren't in here. I thought they did a great job and they did a
great job of hitting big shots, and they found their identity in the second
half. Yeah, they had a great season, and they deserved every win that they
have.  
  
Q. There is commentary on TV about two no-calls at the end, the game-
winning basket and their inbound on the final play, that commentary that
either or both could have been called as fouls.  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I think throughout the game, whatever segment you want to
pick, you can always do that.  
  
Q. With 8.6 seconds left in the game, tied 60-60, I saw Laura in the
time-out, very vocal. Can you share with us what she was saying or what you
guys were talking about?  
KATIE MEIER: She's just a great natural leader. She's been in a ton of big
moments, world championships, European championships, and ever since she's
always been playing above her age group, so the first time I saw her, I was
the U-19 national team coach and she was 16 years old screaming in her huddle
yelling at these 20-year olds. She's just amazing. She was very clear. She had
specific questions for me and wanted to make sure she communicated them to the
team. You know, she wasn't playing great. She had some turnovers that really
hurt us, but late-game stuff, she's in control and real great command.  
  
Q. You know when a team is up all day and then you lose it in the last
two minutes, you know that 99 percent of teams probably don't win that game on
empirical evidence, but you know what I mean. What's it say about where you
guys are that you weren't having flashbacks to last year.  
KATIE MEIER: That's the thing. You know, I mean, I'm not trying to give myself
credit by any stretch of the imagination, but like you have to be prepared. I
mean, these teams are great, and we were -- we got away with a lot in the
first half in terms of they got a bunch of threes off and they weren't making
them, and so it wasn't like I sat there and said, they're just going to
continue to miss all game. You have to have some -- one of the hardest things
about being a coach is you have to run through a lot of scenarios prior to the
game, and it's hard on you because you have to run through some negative
scenarios, too, just so that you're prepared, so that you have a script and
you go through them and you know them. So as you're in moments, and then they
pop up, you've got to be prepared for them.  
  
You know, clearly Davenport shouldn't have pinched off the shooter in the
corner to give them that shot. We talked about it, it was clearly what we did,
and I yelled at her in the locker room but I wasn't going to waste the time
yelling at her that then, right? That's just not smart. So we coach the next
play, and then we got to the locker room and we had a conversation, and Erykah
is the greatest kid in the world, but those are things that as a coach you
just -- there was still time on the clock and we had something we had to do.
We were all very -- just very, very, I thought, composed and calm.  
  
Q. Do you almost feel like the pressure is off a little bit? Now you've
got kids that know what this feeling is like? There had to be pressure being
at home. It's an advantage, sure, but it comes with additional pressure. Do
you almost feel like you're going to get more of what you've been kind of all
season Monday?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, we didn't play our best basketball game of the year, and
you want to. I mean, you want to in the NCAA, wherever it is. And I think that
the crowd certainly -- I thought our crowd was so positive, so excited. They
were -- I got a thousand texts already people are mad at me because they were
going to -- their heart rate was up. But I thought that our crowd, the energy
was great, and our players had this true belief, and yeah, I'm just -- we're
going to keep -- great on the glass, and I'm glad you mentioned Emese Hof
because basically the way they were playing, she turned into a point guard.
She turned into a point guard tonight, and I ran everything through Emese, and
I said at halftime, we're going through Hof because of the way Gulf Coast was
playing us, Hof was making a ton of big time decisions for us, and I thought
she did a fantastic job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenge you have Monday at Quinnipiac both
in terms of their team and also the quick turnaround from a scouting
standpoint and also for the kids' legs and all that.  
KATIE MEIER: Right. I have never, ever looked ahead. I never have done it in
my profession. We just played three games in a row in the ACC Tournament. I
had no idea -- came out of the press conference, and my staff is tremendous.
They're so talented. I didn't have a particular opinion whether it was going
to be Marquette, who we were going to be playing. I was so locked in, I stayed
with the team in the hotel and came over on the bus with them instead of
watching that game. I only watched a little bit of it. But we can adapt. We
have a very, very great IQ on this team, just a tremendous IQ, and they're
going to want my plan, and they're going to want it pretty quick, and I'm
going to want my plan for my assistant coaches and they're going to give it to
me pretty quick, and we're going to be ready. But the team can really take it
and we can reinvent ourselves. But I never thought in a million years, like
Tim said, you're 1 for 14 from the three and you come out with a victory, and
we need three-pointers. I mean, we do. They're a team that kind of dares you
to shoot over them. So if you'd have told me that before, I wouldn't have been
prepared for that, but I promise, we'll get there. We'll get where we need to
be for Monday, and just the crowd is going to be huge, and I hope everybody
can really get out in the community and give us that advantage again.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: First I want to give a lot of credit to Quinnipiac.
They played fantastic, very confident. And they came out with a lot of fight
the first half. I also want to give a lot of credit to my players and my staff
for how far we've come. I'm really, really proud of our whole entire program.
We've come a long way in three years and I'm glad we've got to have this
experience here at the NCAA tournament, because we've worked really hard for
it. We know we're just getting started. We talked about in the locker room we
have to remember this pain. We have to remember what this feels like and use
it for motivation.  
  
Q. You were a big part of the come back, what was the mindset after
being down 19 to rally the team back?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: We're a team that just keeps fighting. We've been down
before, this isn't the first time we've been down at half. So we just said we
need to leave it all on the floor. And I think we rallied together. I wish we
could have played a little stronger the first half and had the same fight in
the first half we did in the second half.  
  
Q. Natisha, on the last shot, it just looked like it was dead center.
What was the view you had, and did you think it was good when you let it go?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, coach threw up the play for me to hit the three to tie
the game. When I shot it it looked good. It was halfway down. I guess it
wasn't supposed to go in, I guess.  
  
Q. What was it like to play on a stage like this?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel like honestly it was a blessing to even make it here,
to even play on this stage. I feel like we learned a lot of lessons on this
stage. Honestly, I wouldn't trade any of them.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would say the same thing, making it here is a great
accomplishment. We came a long way from last year to this year. I'm just
already ready for next year and looking forward to it.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Like they said, it's a blessing to even get here. But we're
not satisfied. We'll be back next year and better and stronger.  
  
Q. Natisha, you said you'd never heard of Quinnipiac before this game.
Now after playing them, what can you say about them, and their mentality a
Mid-Major to come in and knock off a Big East champion?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Quinnipiac is a great team. I give them all the credit. They
played hard. They had a great first half. They had a great everything. They
played with a lot of fight. I give them all the credit and I wish them best of
luck in the tournament.  
  
Q. Natisha, can you go over, I think about 18, 20 seconds left the
blocked shot. Did you feel her there or what happened on that play?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I just tried to create space and it wasn't there, it was a
forced shot.  
  
Q. Is this game sort of a microcosm of maybe the first three years? Such
a hill to get over and you could see it coming, see it coming, just sort of
ran out of time? And how nice is it to already hear your kids talking about
what this is going to mean going forward to you guys?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean definitely. I think you could see they were
nervous to start this game. I think everybody in the building knew it. We just
tried to keep them confident. We try to get them to calm down little bit.
Obviously I feel like if we had more time we would have came out on top.
Unfortunately you only get 40 minutes.  
  
But the fact that they're hungry and the fact that they want to learn from
this, as proud as I am of them, I didn't want to go in that locker room and
say congratulations, we made it, because I really do believe that there's a
phenomenal amount of potential in that room. And we are just really getting
started. And I want them to know that this is a step and we should be proud of
where we came, but we got to think of ourselves as an elite program. And
that's what I want them to do. And that's how we've got to think. We've got to
learn from this.  
  
You're right, the last three years have been a lot of ups and downs. To be
here is amazing, but in our mind I think we all thought we deserve to be here,
and we wanted to still be playing.  
  
Q. It seemed like Erika was a big part of your offensive game plan, what
did you see in that matchup?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: They do a great job of packing the paint. And they
front a lot. We knew Erika was going to be able to use her athleticism and
strength down low. Obviously she had a great game. I think sometimes we forced
it to her in the first hatch. And I think that was kind of jitters and
whatnot. I give a lot of credit to Erika's fight. And the way she attacks that
rebound, she's relentless, she's really hard to guard.  
  
Q. Quinnipiac seemed to do a good job in the first half of controlling
the pace, and slowing everything down. Did you tell your team anything at
halftime about controlling the pace and speeding the game up?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: Definitely. We tried to make as many adjustments as
we possibly could there at halftime. And I think our players did a great job
of focusing and kind of honing in on that second half of listening. Obviously
they did a great job of packing the paint and really keying in on our leading
scorers. Like I said, I give them a lot of credit. And we've got to learn from
it.  
  
Q. What do you think changed for your guys in the fourth quarter to
enable you of being three to tie that game?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: We started playing the way we always do. And that's
fast and that's frantic and that's getting up in full court pressure. That was
the game plan to start the game. Obviously to start out in our press, and we
just didn't have the energy and the fight we did in that fourth quarter.
Nothing different.  
  
The biggest key that I see, though, is our points in the paint. We had 34 in
the paint. And our whole defensive game plan was to pack the paint and not let
them in there, and we did not do a great job of doing that tonight.  
  
Q. McKayla went three for four on three pointers, I want to know why she
wasn't able to good get more shots off. And I don't think you had her down at
the end when you were hunting that three pointer to tie. If you could talk
about that?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think McKayla was open quite a bit and our
guards missed her, to be honest. She scores a lot off from behinds and a lot
off open windows and drift passes. And I think we missed her a lot. That play
that we drew up and we run it all the time and Natisha, I'll give that look
again. And I can't tell you how many times Natisha has made that shot in
practice. We use McKayla as a decoy and we run her off. And we've made that
shot several times in practice, and I definitely won't second-guess that

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Paula Strautmane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33234)

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: When we won the MAAC Championship close to two weeks
ago I told my young ladies to enjoy the moment, because you never know. We
worked very hard to win that title. But I also said, don't be satisfied. We
weren't finished yet.  
  
And then today we came down here to win a game and advance into Monday and our
goal was to play to win Monday. It's a goal that we started last year when we
left for summer and we continued just to move forward with our mission. And
here we are getting ready to play in the field of 32 come Monday night.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you had the great first half. You're up 19.
You go to the third quarter. What's the feeling on the bench, the huddle, the
floor, while they're chipping away at the lead? You had to stay positive
during the fourth quarter?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. We knew -- they're a great team. And we knew that
was going to be a tough battle. And teams usually come back. We just knew that
we had to stay strong. We had to stay gritty, mentally tough. And that's
actually our identity. That's how we identify ourselves is very gritty, just
the perseverance with this team is amazing. It makes me so proud. They're a
great team and we knew it was going to be a tough battle.  
  
JEN FAY: Having a really good start helped us kind of get a lead and get a
feel for the game. That helped us boost our confidence in the beginning.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
JEN FAY: We've been in that position before when we were up a lot. We just had
to stay relaxed, stay poised and we got the job done.  
  
Q. I think you guys know this question is coming, but Natisha Niedeman
said she'd never heard of Quinnipiac before today. What's the message to her
and Marquette now?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: They know who we are. I think everyone knows who we are now.  
  
JEN FAY: Yeah. I think everyone knows who we are now at this point.  
  
Q. Adily, you had arguably one of the biggest plays at the end of the
game with that big block. What was going through your mind when you saw her go
up for the three and just making sure that you saved your season?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Allazia is a great player, I knew that she didn't get any
three point shots up. She shoots the ball really well. Really, when it came
down to it, I just knew that I had to be in her stuff. And my hands had to be
up, because we knew she was going to watch it. She's a play maker. Basically
just shading her left hand with my right hand and hoping that that was a block
and it ended up being one.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when the last second shot goes up, what's
going through your mind? What's going through your mind there?  
JEN FAY: I thought we deserved to win, so I was just crossing my fingers that
it wasn't going to go in.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It was a great shot. We're glad it didn't go in.  
  
JEN FAY: Yeah.  
  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Welcome to March Madness.  
  
Q. You had fouls to give, obviously in that last possession. Did you
think about using them at all?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: No, because I think there was 2.6 seconds left and
it was a catch and shoot. And we had defended very well all night. I trusted
our defense, defending the three-point line on that shot.  
  
Q. Finally, that shot, it was the perfect line. How good was your look
at it and did you think it was down?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: It was great and it was in and it was out and walked
right down the line and shook the coach's hand.  
  
Q. It seemed like through a lot of the second half when you did need a
big basket or a big steal, Jen came up with. Talk about her play overall?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Incredible. It's not the first time I've seen a
performance by her in that nature. She had it against Temple, and completely
talented player offensively, great IQ, and you got to wit firsthand on the big
stage just how good she is, you saw incredible spin dribble. The ability to
pull a three-point shot. When we need her the most she's been really great all
season long. And she just wanted the ball all game long. She didn't shy away
from the shot, whether she missed it or it went down, she wanted it. And she
made incredible plays for us all evening. And we needed that. And she
delivered.  
  
Q. With everyone looking at Quinnipiac now. You're in the round of 32.
You're one win from the Sweet 16 with a lot of national attention. What do you
have to say to the rest of the nation that is looking at, hey, Quinnipiac I've
never heard of them before?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: This team deserves the recognition. I think we
really flew unjustly under the radar going into the tournament. There was the
sexy matchup with Marquette and Miami looming in the game Monday night. And
the only way that was going to change that was a win here today. And we took
care of business, just like we have not only this year -- well, in a big way
-- but what we've done over the course of the last five years, getting into
the tournament the last three of the five years. We did. We handled our
business. And that's what we had to do to get the real attention that this
program and in particular this team deserves. I saw the 81-69 pick, as well.
And not only nationally, but this team has been so good all year long in tough
spots, and there wasn't a tougher spot with a team like Marquette, how they
come at you offensively, and not only did they make their push in the run, but
we not only defended in the biggest spots but had the right answer in the
clutch spots. And that's what this team has done all season long.  
  
Q. People are going to talk about the run at the end. But how critical
was it to go into the half on a run of your own? After 10 or 12 in a row for
them in the second quarter, you getting it back to double figures, how
important was that?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Not only that, we were dealing with foul trouble. We
had Jen Fay on the bench with two fouls. I had Aryn McClure, I had Paula
Strautmane on the bench with two fouls, managing all that with two fouls going
into the locker room, I believe it was 43-30 and closing out the half the way
we did. Credit to this team and my coaches.  
  
Q. You were saying on the radio that throughout the MAAC Conference
tournament, falling behind earlier, rally to win, three times. Today you
jumped out to a seriously 16 point lead, shot almost 60 percent from the field
in the first half. That had to be super important to be the hunted not the
Hunter as the game progressed?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: It was certainly something that the coaching staff
talked about, with us flying so far under the radar going into the match, who
was definitely wearing the bulls eye on the back in this game. We were
breathing a little easier and we just knew we had a great team, a great
preparation. And to be honest with you, our shoot around this morning was the
best it's ever been. The laser focus. The ready to go. And my AD said we're
going to be hard to beat today. That's on the record at a text at 9:30th
morning on the bus back.  
  
Q. What does the step stool signify for this team?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: That's been a number of symbolic pieces that we've
done, February into going up to the MAAC tournament. And now for this program
that we talked about last summer was taking the next step. And it was the step
stool with two steps, and that's what we came here to do, take the next step.
And that's what we've started every practice with, when we get into our
circle, just a message and a real focus on the purpose. And it's right in
front of us and it's been really good for us, very rewarding of why we're
doing it, front and center. And we took one step today.  
  
Q. You opened with FGCU, obviously it's going to be 90 minutes anyway,
but does it matter who you get Monday night?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: We're going to play who we're going to play. But
Florida Golf Coast, FGCU, we've had a great rivalry going back three years,
and we were able to get them the first game in the season. They beat us the
two previous seasons and great games. So obviously his team was young and he's
done a great job all season long, so I'm anxious to go watch.

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Jordin Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33183)

### [China Dow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33185)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH SMESKO: We're excited to represent the Atlantic Sun Conference in the
NCAA tournament. We know that we have a great competitor to go up against, in
Miami. They're an excellent time, very well coached. Good at every position.
So we have our work cut out for us, but we're excited for the opportunity, and
we're preparing to give our best effort.  
  
Q. Taylor, how much momentum are you hoping to carry over from winning
the way you did in the title game, having to rally and all that?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, I hope so. It's always good to go in with a lot of
energy and momentum, so if we could remember what it feels to win like that
and carry it over to tomorrow's game, we need to come out with energy and
bring it the entire game, and hopefully we get the outcome we want.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, the 2 and 5 or whatever it was at the start is
obviously not something that you all are used to over there. How difficult was
it to believe that this was going to be a process and that there was still a
lot of basketball to be played? How difficult was it to not get too down just
based on the early results of the season?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I don't know. We were still learning in the beginning of the
season. We had a brand new team, and we were still trying to come together. So
it was a struggle in the beginning just to come together and start playing
well together and learn each other's abilities. So we knew that was going to
happen, so it didn't really get us down, but we had to keep fighting through
it. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so good now is that we
fought throughout the season because we knew we had to keep improving if we
wanted to make big things happen.  
  
Q. Jordan, not to give away any secrets or anything, but what have you
guys seen looking at Miami and what can you say about the kind of challenge
that they'll be tomorrow?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, like Coach said, they're a great team. I think one of
the biggest advantages for us is our preparation. Coach is one of the best in
the country in that aspect, and I think the team is really embracing that. And
if we can go out there and just execute our game plan, I think, yeah, we'll be
in a good position.  
  
Q. Ladies, how does it feel to be closer to it for China, and Jordan?  
CHINA DOW: It feels good. You know, I came here my freshmen year, but it feels
good to be here with this team because everybody was doubting us. But I think
it feels great. I think it's going to be fun. We just gotta enjoy the moment.  
  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah. No. I'm so excited. Yeah, it's been a dream for me
like ever since I was a little kid to play in a NCAA tournament. So I'm really
excited for us to have an opportunity to compete at this level.  
  
Q. How is your shoulder?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, no. It's feeling good actually, so yeah, I've been
doing some rehab on it and everything this week. So it's feeling good today.  
  
Q. Popped it back in? Was that accurate? What happened?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, yeah, it just like -- yeah, it popped out and then it
popped back in on its own. So it's not like a full dislocation, but yeah, it's
all good.  
  
Q. Ever happen before?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, it has happened before, so I like knew the feeling and
everything. So I just had to like get the strength back. It's like really weak
right when it happens.  
  
Q. Taylor, what advice have you had for teammates whom this is their
first NCAA tournament game?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, just coming in, being excited and still being able
to control that excitement. We're here for a reason. We do have a game plan to
follow. We can't slip up, because we're playing a good team, and basically
just sticking to what we know and not letting the excitement get to them?  
  
Q. Karl, I recall over in Naples -- or I'm sorry, over in?  
KARL SMESKO: Germain.  
  
Q. Thank you. I'm sorry. It's been a long day. I remember we talked when
you were 2 and 5, too, and you knew it was going to be a process, but was
there something that you could point to that said, okay, this is where we're
starting to get it? Was there a point or was it just like a natural
progression?  
COACH SMESKO: Yeah, it was pretty slow and incremental. I think one of the
reasons and maybe the biggest reason we were able to make progress during the
year is we have a great staff, the assistant coaches. And we had so many new
players, and they needed a lot of talking to and getting on board with how we
do things. And our assistants did a great job of getting people back into the
program and how we do things and the attitude that you need to have.  
  
And that with, you know, we have leadership with Jordy and Taylor. But we
definitely needed the assistants' help to get people progressing and just
having the attitude that, yeah, this isn't where we want to be as a program,
and the only way to change that is to get a little bit better each day and
have a good attitude about it and pull this together.  
  
I can remember when we were 2 and 5, you know, we talked about it. And I told
them, hey, I've never been 2 and 5 as a coach, so this is new for me, too. So
the only thing I know to do is to go back to work and compete at it and try to
help you as best I can and hopefully you guys will have the same attitude.  
  
Q. Going through that adversity, going through having a chance to host
and then losing the finale at home and all that and having to go into a place
and deal with more adversity. How much did what you went through in November
ultimately help you last weekend?  
COACH SMESKO: It's tough to say. You would think that it did. Our players and
our fans are very close, and our fans are also very honest to them, where at
the beginning of the year, you know, they would have to hear that you're not
playing like FGCU.  
  
This isn't what we're used to seeing. So to overcome that and to start feeling
confident in the way we were playing, and then, you know, to have a setback
and be able to respond well to it -- I thought we were all really disappointed
when we lost our last home game so we wouldn't be able to host. But I did
think there was a feeling within our locker room that everybody in there
thought we could still win the tournament if we had the right attitude. So it
was pretty comparable to having the right attitude after a slow start. So I
think it definitely helped us.  
  
Q. Finally, I'm sorry to filibuster, but you're the only team of the
four that's sort of on a quote-unquote normal schedule. You played a few days
ago. Everybody else has been off 11, 12, 13, 14 days. One, do you like that
for the women's tournament, how that seems to be so common? And two, is there
any advantage in being closer to a normal routine than the teams that have
been sitting around for a couple of weeks?  
COACH SMESKO: You know, we've done both, and you may think one is an advantage
over the other, but I'm not sure that you could really prove it. Like when we
had -- I think the year we played St. Bonaventure, I think we had two weeks
that time. I would have to check to make sure. But you get a chance to take a
couple days off, and then you get to really hit fundamentals for a week and
then you can get to the preparation, and I enjoy that. I think the players
enjoy just getting back out there and playing another game.  
  
So I'm not sure one's an advantage over the other. I think you could have
arguments either way.  
  
Q. For any of the three players, there's a degree of athleticism all
over the floor for Miami that's about as good -- I guess maybe as you guys
have seen, including their interior players. Just how do you approach that and
how do you address that?  
CHINA DOW: I mean, honestly, I think when we was in the tournament we got a
little taste of athleticism playing Ohio State and stuff. And I think we'll be
fine as long as we go with what Coach tells us to do. As long as we do
everything we need to do, I think we'll be fine.  
  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: I think our defense is going to be huge, little things in
that area, and yeah, boxing out. So I think that'll kind of help combatting
that athleticism a little bit. Just doing the little things that Coach has
been preaching all year.  
  
Q. This is kind of for any of the players. Does it ever get tiring?
Maybe that's the wrong word. But you -- the program gets so much notoriety for
threes. It's the hashtag, all that. But there's obviously much more to the
system. It's not like you're coming down and jacking five 3s a game. Is it a
little bit frustrating or do you think maybe it's a little bit of a
misunderstanding that that's all this program is five out, just going to shoot
it, first one to touch it is just going to jack it up? Have you ever found
that to be disappointing or frustrating in any way?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, I don't find it disappointing. I think it's more our
fans thinking we're really good three-point shooters. And it is something we
do, and we always work on it, and we take pride in how our shooting percentage
is, but no, it doesn't limit us to just our three-point shots. And we know as
players very well that that's not all we do. We're taught very detailed,
complex stuff day by day, and we don't take disrespect people that say raining
threes or anything like that. We just know that's what they understand about
us.  
  
Q. Karl, you have a smile on your face evaluating Taylor's answer there
to some degree. Do you want to give us a critique of perspective?  
COACH SMESKO: I think she's doing excellent. I think they've all been doing a
very good job up here.  
  
Q. You seemed pleased with her perspective.  
COACH SMESKO: It just -- she understands how we play. She's been here the
longest. So she has a very good understanding of how we play basketball at
FGCU, and I thought she did a good job saying -- hey, she knows there's more
to it than threes, but she doesn't get offended if somebody wants to emphasize
the threes, especially, I mean, Taylor is pretty good at threes.  
  
Q. Taylor and China, I think you're both back next season. So to Jordin,
just can you talk about this one and only opportunity for you?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, I mean it's been an incredible experience so far. I
couldn't have asked for a better way to go out. And yeah, just have the
opportunity to be coached by one of the best coaches in the country and play
for such great teammates and everything, it really has been an awesome
experience.  
  
Q. Karl, do coaches call you in the summer and ask you to kind of
explain the system? I mean you can't look at one or two games and figure it
out.  
COACH SMESKO: You know, I mean we get called by coaches from time to time,
particularly at the college level, who want to better understand what we're
doing. And I have sat down with coaches before. It's not something I really
like to do. But when I think about it in terms of I like learning from other
people. So it's only fair to take some time to help teach other coaches as
well.  
  
But we have a style that you have to be really committed to, so it's not
something, like we will sprinkle in some things from what we see from others,
but our style isn't something that you could really sprinkle in. You've gotta
be committed to it and teach it every day or it just isn't going to work for
you. And I think sometimes when we go over it with people, they're like, wow,
that's really good. I don't know that I want to invest that much into making
that exactly who we are.  
  
Q. I'm guessing you're okay with that?  
COACH SMESKO: Yeah?  
  
Q. China or Jordin, we've asked the men recently about the university-
wide success athletically and the baseball team is just having a tear right
now, and the men were talking about you guys. This is the first year both
basketball teams are in the tournament the same year. Can either of the newer
ladies on the floor I guess offer your perspective on -- maybe Jordin just
because it's one year in -- what it's like seeing that, being within that?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, I mean it's awesome to be a part of a whole athletic
program that has so many great programs within it. And yeah, it's great for
the school also, you know, having so many teams doing so well, and I think it
kind of brings the teams together, with all the teams doing well, it kind of
helps our support also from students and everything.  
  
CHINA DOW: Yeah, it's fun. And all of our fans appreciate it too because all
fans go to every game. But I think it's fun. It's enjoyable on campus to liven
up a little bit and do what we gotta do. It's sports.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH MEIER: Well, it's nice to be able to thank my own people for putting on
such a great tournament so far. I'm really impressed. It really does have an
NCAA feel to it. Just a big-time athletic department. A bunch of people have
been putting in a lot of work, and we see it. And we really appreciate it and
we just want to make sure we say thanks. It's great. Looks great, feels great.
Big-time basketball is going to occur and we're really happy to be a part of
it. That's number one.  
  
Number two, this is just great. It's just awesome. We're thrilled. We know
it's a big moment. We all came to Miami because we wanted pressure, and we
wanted big moments. And here it is. We've never shied away from the goal of
having a third tournament here this year. Very first meeting we talked about
it.  
  
We actually had the -- some friends in the conference office at ACC and some
RPI people analyze our schedule the year before and say swap out one or two
games whether we won or not and would that have put us in a top 15 or 16 RPI.
And it turned out that the Syracuse game at home last year that we lost, had
we won that, and perhaps maybe beaten Notre Dame in the tournament -- there
was just one or two games that we could have turned and would have gotten us
there.  
  
That's how I opened our first meeting this year with the team was this is a
goal of ours. Like, let's get there. But that was November. So now it's March,
and we're here. So our next goal is to do something really special, and that's
to win. Anytime you can get any type of win in the NCAA tournament, I don't
care where it is and I don't care who it's against, but anytime you have an
opportunity to compete in the NCAA tournament, it's awesome. But we want to
get a win.  
  
Q. Mot, what's this buildup been like the last few days since knowing
you're going to host, obviously, and it is a different feel. It's home but
it's not home, but it is home. What has the buildup been like, even with the
guys not here and school on break. Do you notice the electricity? Do you
notice there's more of a buzz this week than usual?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Yes. Not having school we're basically here all day. And we
know the stakes are high and it's a big tournament, and just to be hosting it,
we're blessed just to be hosting it.  
  
But I woke up this morning with a little bit more pep in my step knowing this
game will be tomorrow. I came in the gym and just seeing how great everybody
has done with the signs and just security, and just everything here. It's a
little bit more livelier here.  
  
And I think we're excited. I could just see it in everybody's faces. We're
just ready to go. We haven't played in a little over a week, I think and just
to play against somebody other than the practice squad in such a big stage is
just exciting. And I think we're ready. We've been watching a lot of film and
just critiquing our last games, and I think we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. Mot brought it up, it has been a while since you guys have played a
game, and it feels like an eternity. What are you kind of expecting when you
step on that floor tomorrow even though there is all this buzz and excitement,
it is about basketball. Will there be any rust or are you worried about
anything like that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: No. I don't think so. I think we're well prepared, the
coaching staff and practice squad have done a great job of getting us prepared
for this first game and this first round. I just think we're ready to go, like
she said. It's a feeling of urgency, honestly. It's been a little over a week,
a long bye week. We're just ready to go, ready to get going and playing.  
  
Q. Laura, they're a team that obviously they use great spacing. Any team
that runs that system would have to and we don't know how prolific they are
from three. What are the things that jump out that you guys are going to have
to really keep an eye on defensively to try to disrupt them as best you can
against that system?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, we watched a lot of film, and I gotta say Florida Gulf
Coast is a great team. As she said, they have a great spacing on offense. And
they all can shoot. Even their post players, their five, they can shoot. They
move very well without the ball. They set a lot of off-ball screens, so we
gotta be low in our stance. Everybody gotta defend everybody. We might switch.
You never know.  
  
So yeah, they are a pretty good team, but I think we are a pretty good
defensive team as well, so we just gotta lock down and get ready for their
movement.  
  
Q. Mot, you guys were the favorite last year in your opening-round game.
Obviously things didn't go the way we wanted them to. How much have you all
even thought about that at all or just making sure it doesn't appear again
because you know what it feels like to have an underdog coming after you?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I honestly haven't thought about it. It's a new year. It's a
new feel to the season. But just knowing that every game might be your last,
you just play with a little bit more sense of urgency.  
  
As far as thinking about last year, I think that's long gone. We have our
minds set to something bigger, and we're just focused on making sure we pursue
that. So I think we just have a better vision of what we want to accomplish,
and I think we're ready just to get the ball up in the air and just get going.  
  
Q. Tim Reynolds of the Orange Bowl Committee?  
COACH MEIER: (Laughs).  
  
Q. I'll give you a minute. It's been like a month and a half since you
played a game. How much does that concern you?  
COACH MEIER: I'm not concerned. We just -- there are times where our
conference just think about game after game after game against ranked
opponents and how much pressure we had on us to finish strong and to do
something special in the tournament.  
  
We were very, very honest about our position. They get RPI updates all year.
So we knew. I mean there was a point in the season where you know, I think we
were a little down because of our standings in the conference, and I'm like,
guys, look at your body. Don't worry about it. It was a schedule that had us
playing away on most of the ranked teams' courts. And we had done a really,
really special job.  
  
But that ACC tournament we played our guts out. We really played hard. And so
I wasn't sad to have a couple of days of rest to sort of regroup and get their
legs back underneath them because it was that third game where the shots --
you can't say that we were fresh. We weren't. And we need to hit when we're
fresh.  
  
So I'm really excited. It's been a minute since I've seen these guys fresh. It
has been a minute. And I'm happy. I mean, I'm excited. I cannot -- it's like
Christmas Eve and I cannot wait to open up that present that's sitting under
-- I cannot wait, because when they're fresh, we're good.  
  
Q. Scale of one to ten, Mot, how fired up is she?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Oh, a 20 (laughs).  
  
Q. Coach, with the balance that they have, knowing obviously you gotta
defend all five positions all the way out to the arc, do you still, even
knowing that, though, pay any greater notice to any -- they've had so many
different players step forward with some 20-point games and occasionally
30-point games. Does that give you any different kind of worry knowing that
you have to be prepared for one of their players to get hot the way some of
them can?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. I don't think it's any extra special worry. I respect their
talent, and I think they have great isolation sets and great mentality. But, I
mean, a balanced team.  
  
I think we're one, too, and I think you got both coaches trying to -- we're
going to have to coach really well in the game, because you can't just say,
well, they're all about this and Miami is just all about that. I mean, it's
just not true. So throughout the rosters up and down both teams, what matchup
is going to work? I don't think either one of us can go into the game knowing
for sure who's going to be on who and what's going to work. But I think that
both teams will give the ball to whoever is hot. There's no selfish player on
either team.  
  
Q. Laura, we asked coach this the other day, but those two players that
are sitting right next to you, how much have they meant to this program and
helping bring you guys along to where you are here today, the two ladies up
there on the dais with you?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: We thought a lot about this, but they are just two great
players. They're great people. And you know, they've brought us here. So yeah,
I'm really proud of them, and we just -- we all want to go far for them. It's
their last go around, so yeah, we're just trying to do it for them a little
bit, too, yeah.  
  
Q. How does your game day philosophy change in a game 7? I mean, it is a
game 7 atmosphere. They're all game 7s from here on out obviously. Is it
something that do you find you're doing things a bit differently when you get
to the tournament or do you try not to?  
COACH MEIER: You know, I sort of have a philosophy and I'm pretty clear when
I'm hiring and recruiting. If you're blessed to have 35 game days, if you're
blessed to have that many or more, it comes down to, what, 70 hours of your
whole entire year that you should be pretty awesome. You should be great. And
I'm going to be the best version of myself in those 70 hours, because they
deserve that from me. And in order to stay in that, I have exactly the same
routine every game day for as many years as I have coached.  
  
You do have to have a few more special situations probably ready because every
opponent is going to be so great from here on out and you want your kids very
comfortable and familiar with what calls you're going to make. You don't want
to surprise anybody. Sure, that might be one adjustment, but that doesn't
change on game day. That's more in preparation.  
  
Q. Just between the press conference that you guys had on --  
COACH MEIER: I thought you were going to say just between me and you.  
  
Q. Just between us, what's the secret game plan (laughs)? Between the
last press conference on Tuesday and Wednesday and the preparation from the
film, anything else that you can share that maybe you didn't expect that
jumped out at you at all in any way?  
COACH MEIER: That actually is a just-between-you-and-me question. You're not
going to catch me on that one.  
  
Tons of respect. Tons of respect. Their system is what they are and their
players make it work, and they do a great job. So it's complicated. And I
think that you see their conference and you know how they've just been so
great in their conference, and so you watch their conference films, because
it's just like watching us.  
  
You're going to watch Florida State's games for Miami because we play each
other three times a year. So you get a lot of information from seeing what
their conference is trying to do to them.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Lynn Bria? Did you call her at all for any tips?  
COACH MEIER: Lynn Bria?  
  
Q. Or North Florida?  
COACH MEIER: No, they're going to protect their conference?  
  
Q. Is that protocol?  
COACH MEIER: That's pretty standard.  
  
Q. Jessica, how important are the first five minutes going to be? Just
the start really in general. You know it's going to be hopefully anyway for
you guys I would think it's going to be a pretty exciting atmosphere. There
should be some people there. Is it critical to just get a jump early and sort
of dictate the flow instead of having it dictated under you?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Definitely, especially on the home floor. Our main focus this
season has just been about starting the game off right. We're probably one of
the most complex teams where we have different starting lineups, different
games, different weeks or whatever. So we take pride in the starting lineup to
make sure that we start off right, set the tone early and get everybody else
going because they know we set the tone.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay.

KATIE MEIER: Well, it's nice to be able to thank my own people for putting on
such a great tournament so far. I'm really impressed. It really does have an
NCAA feel to it. Just a big-time athletic department, a bunch of people have
been putting in a lot of work. We see it, and we really appreciate it, and we
just want to make sure we say thanks, because it looks great, feels great.
Big-time basketball is going to occur in this building this weekend, and we're
just really, really happy to be a part of it. So that's number one.  
  
And then number two, this is just great. It's just awesome. We're thrilled. We
know it's a big moment. We all came to Miami because we wanted pressure, and
we wanted big moments, and here it is. I mean, we never shied away from the
goal of having a third tournament here this year. The very first meeting we
talked about it. We actually had the -- some friends in the conference office,
the ACC, and some RPI people analyze our schedule the year before and say,
well, swap out one or two games, whether we won or not, and would that have
put us in a top 15 or 16 RPI, and it turned out that the Syracuse game at home
last year that we lost, had we won that, and perhaps maybe beaten Notre Dame
in the tournament, there was just one or two games that we could have turned
and gotten us there. That's how I opened our first meeting this year with the
team was, this is a goal of ours, like let's get there, all right.  
  
But that was November. So now it's March, and we're here. So our next goal is
to do something really special, and that's to win. Any time you can get any
type of win in the NCAA Tournament, I don't care where it is and who care who
it's against, any time you have an opportunity to compete in the NCAA
Tournament, it's awesome, but we want to get a win.  
  
Q. What's this buildup been like the last few days knowing you're going
to host, and it is a different feel, it's home, but it's not home, but it is
home. What has the buildup been like, and even with the guys not here, with
school on break, do you notice the electricity, do you notice more of a buzz
about this team than usual this week?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Yes, I mean, not having school, we're basically here all day,
and we know the stakes are high. It's a big tournament, and just to be hosting
it, we're blessed just to be hosting it. But I woke up this morning with a
little bit more pep in my step knowing this game will be tomorrow. I came to
the gym and just seeing how great everybody has done with the signs and just
security and just everything here is just -- it's a little bit more livelier
here. I think we're excited. I could just see it in everybody's faces. We're
just ready to go. I haven't played in a little over a week, I think, and just
to play against somebody other than the practice squad in such a big stage is
just exciting, and I think we're ready. We've been watching a lot of film and
just critiquing our last games, and I think we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. It has been a while since you guys have played a game, and it feels
like an eternity. What are you kind of expecting when you step on that floor
tomorrow even though there is all this buzz and this excitement, it is about
basketball, and will there be any rust? Are you worried about anything like
that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: No, I don't think so. I think we're well-prepared, the
coaching staff and practice squad, they've done a great job of getting us
prepared for this first game and the first round. I just think we're ready to
go, like she said. It's just a feeling of urgency, honestly. It's been a
little over a week, a long bye week. We're just ready to go, ready to get
going and playing.  
  
Q. Laura, they're a team that obviously they use great spacing. Any team
that runs that system would have to, and we all know how prolific they are
from three. What are the things that jump out that you're going to really have
to keep an eye on defensively to try to disrupt them as best you can against
that system?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, we watched a little film, and I've got to say Florida
Gulf Coast is a great team. As you said, they have a great spacing on offense,
and you know they all can shoot. Even their post players, their five, they can
shoot. They move very well without the ball. They set a lot of off-ball
screens. You know, so we've got to be low in our stance, and everybody got to
defend everybody. We might switch. You never know. So yeah, they're a pretty
good team, but I think we are a pretty good defensive team, also, so we've
just got to lock down and get ready for their movement.  
  
Q. Mot, you guys were the favorite last year in your opening-round game.
Obviously things didn't go the way you wanted them to. How much have you all
even thought about that at all, or just making sure it doesn't happen again
because you know what it feels like to have an underdog coming after you?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I honestly haven't thought about it. It's a new year. It's a
new feel to the season. But just knowing that every game might be your last,
you just play with a little bit more sense of urgency. But as far as thinking
about last year, I think that's long gone. We have our minds set to something
bigger, and we're just focused on making sure we pursue that.  
  
I think we just have a better vision of what we want to accomplish, and I
think we're ready just to get the ball up in the air and just get going.  
  
Q. It's been like a month and a half since you played a game; how much
does that concern you?  
KATIE MEIER: I'm not concerned. There are times where our conference -- just
think about game after game after game against ranked opponents and how much
pressure we had on us to finish strong and to do something special in the
tournament. We were very, very honest about our position. They'd get RPI
updates all year, so we knew. I mean, there was a point in the season where I
think we were a little down because our standings in the conference, and I'm
like, guys, look at your body of work, don't worry about it. It was a schedule
that had us playing away on most of the ranked teams' courts, and we had done
a really special job, but that ACC Tournament, we played our guts out. We
really played hard. So I wasn't sad to have a couple days of rest and sort of
regroup and get their legs back underneath them because that third game, the
shots that -- you can't say that we were fresh. We weren't. And we need to hit
when we're fresh, so I'm really excited.  
  
It's been a minute since I've seen these guys fresh. It has been a minute, and
I'm happy. I'm excited. I cannot -- it is like Christmas Eve, and I cannot
wait to open up that present that's sitting under the tree. I cannot wait,
because when they're fresh, we're good.  
  
Q. How fired up is she, Mot, scale of 1 to 10?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Oh, 20.  
  
Q. Coach, with the balance that they have, knowing obviously you've got
to defend all five positions all the way out to the arc, do you still even
knowing that, though, pay any greater notice to any -- they've had so many
different players step forward with some 20-point games and occasionally
30-point games. Does that give you any kind of different worry knowing that
you have to be prepared for one of their players to get hot the way some of
them can?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I don't think that's any extra special worry. I mean, I
respect their talent, and I think they have great isolation sets and a great
mentality. But I mean, a balanced team, I think we're one, too, and I think
you've got both coaches trying to -- we're going to have to coach really well
in the game because you can't just say, well, they're all about this, and
Miami is just all about that. I mean, it's just not true. So throughout the
rosters up and down both teams, what match-up is going to work, I don't think
either one of us can go into the game knowing for sure who's going to be on
who and what's going to work.  
  
But I think that both teams will give the ball to whoever is hot. There's no
selfish player on either team.  
  
Q. Laura, we asked coach this the other day, but those two players that
are sitting right next to you, how much have they meant to this program and
helping bring you guys along to where you are here today, the two ladies up
there on the dais with you?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I mean, we talked a lot about this, but they're just two
great players. They're great people, and you know, they've brought us here. So
yeah, I'm really proud of them, and we just all want to go far for them. You
know, it's their last go-around. So yeah, we're just trying to do it for them
a little bit, too, yeah.  
  
Q. How does your game day philosophy change in a Game 7? They're all
Game 7s from here on out, obviously. Do you find that you're doing things a
bit differently when you get to the tournament, or do you try not to?  
KATIE MEIER: You know, I sort of have a philosophy, and I'm pretty clear when
I'm hiring and when I'm recruiting, if you're blessed to have 35 game days, if
you're blessed to have that many, or more, it comes down to, what, 70 hours of
your whole entire year that you should be pretty awesome. You should be great.
And I'm going to be the best version of myself in those 70 hours because they
deserve that from me, and in order to stay in that, I have exactly the same
routine every game day for as many years as I have coached.  
  
Do you have to have a few more special situations probably ready because every
opponent is going to be so great from here on out and there's going to be --
you want your kids very comfortable and familiar with what calls you're going
to make. You don't want to surprise anybody. Sure, that might be one
adjustment, but that doesn't change on game day, that's more in preparation.  
  
Q. Just between the press conference that you guys had on Tuesday or
Wednesday and the further preparation and the film, anything else that you can
share that maybe you didn't expect that jumped out at you at all in any way?  
KATIE MEIER: That actually is a just between you and me question. You're not
going to catch me on that one. Their system is what they are, and their
players make it work, and they do a great job. It's complicated, and I think
that you see their conference and you know how they've just been so great in
their conference, and so you watch their conference foes because it's just
like watching us. You're going to want to watch Florida State's games for
Miami because we play each other three times a year. You get a lot of
information from seeing what their conference is trying to do to them.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Lynn? Did you call her at all for any tips?  
KATIE MEIER: No, they're going to protect their conference.  
  
Q. Is that protocol?  
KATIE MEIER: That's pretty standard.  
  
Q. Yes, Jessica, how important are the first five minutes going to be,
or just the start really in general? You know it's going to be hopefully a
pretty exciting atmosphere, there should be some people there. Is it critical
to just get a jump early and dictate the flow instead of having it dictated
under you?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Yeah, especially on the home floor. Our main focus this season
has just been about starting the game off right. We're probably one of the
most complex teams where we have different starting lineups, different games,
different weeks, whatever. You know, we take pride in the starting lineup to
make sure we start off right, set the tone early, and get everybody else going
because we know we set the tone.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Erika Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33153)

### [Natisha Heideman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33154)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're start with opening comments from Coach Kieger. Then we'll
open it up to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH KIEGER: First of all, I think we're very excited to be here. We're very
excited to be in our first NCAA Tournament with this group. Obviously it's a
lot warmer than it was in Milwaukee. So we're excited about that.  
  
I think our team is very thrilled to represent the Big East in this NCAA
Tournament. And I'm just really happy for our players that they get to
experience this.  
  
We've had a motto for about the last two months now to make the NCAA
Tournament for our lone senior, Michaela Yentz, and the fact we were able to
do it and celebrate this round because she's never been there. I think it's
going to be really special, and I think our girls are really excited about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Allazia Blockton, Erika Davenport and Natisha Heideman.
Questions.  
  
Q. Erika, the momentum that you all are carrying into this, just was
there a trigger over these last eight games that helped you guys find this
next gear? Or was this just the culmination of just steady progress kind of
throughout the course of the season?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel it was steady progress. I feel like we always had it,
just, like, the season, I feel like we got better, and it was just steady
progress of all the momentum going through the season.  
  
Q. From what you've seen on film with Quinnipiac, what kind of
challenges do you think they present for you tomorrow?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Quinnipiac is a very good team. They're very disciplined and
skilled. I think the challenge we might face is that they're a good rebounding
team and we're pretty small, so keeping them off the glass will be a key part
of winning the game. And I think we'll do a really good job of that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You're obviously a team that when you can get out and run when you
can put up a lot of points, you tend to do it in hurry in bunches. Quinnipiac
is a team that I think it seems like they're best with a pace much slower than
what you guys like to get out. How critical will it be the first few minutes
to set a tone and get that pace at that level where you guys are most
comfortable?  
NATISHA HEIDEMAN: We're going to set the tone in the first five minutes of the
game. Our whole game plan is to just play fast. That's what we've been doing
all season, and that's what we'll continue to do throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. Sometimes it's strange because women's tournaments you haven't played
in a while. Sometimes the men they go from Sunday, they get right into it on
Thursday in some cases how has this time helped you and how are you worried
are you about maybe some rust building up from the Big East Tournament until
Saturday?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel that we have great trainers that help us to be
energized and just making our body feel well. I feel like this time period has
really helped us (indiscernible) and to get rest and do what we need to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kieger.  
  
Q. This is a bit of a homecoming for you. Is this the first time you've
been back here since you've been at Marquette, and what's it like coming back
here?  
COACH KIEGER: Our team actually played an FIU tournament last year, so they've
been back here. I've been back here. We practiced here, last year before that
tournament. So that was kind of good for them to get down here and for me to
kind of be back in the practice gym.  
  
So it's very unique. It's very weird. I'm enjoying it, obviously, being back
here and seeing all familiar faces. But like I told the team yesterday, for
us, this is a business trip. It's not spring break. We're not coming down to
Miami to have some fun. This is our first NCAA Tournament as a group and we're
going to enjoy it, and we're going to have a lot of fun, but we also want to
get to work.  
  
Q. You look at the roster and it's just so young. And is this maybe even
a little bit ahead of schedule for what you envisioned what was maybe like the
most likely path for this program?  
COACH KIEGER: When this group of sophomores came in, we knew they had a lot of
talent, and it was just a matter of time and when we were going to get to
where we wanted to go. Obviously last year was a lot of learning experience.
They played significant minutes.  
  
So I don't really consider this group sophomores in terms of the amount of
minutes that they've logged. And our goal all season long was to get to the
NCAA Tournament. So for us I don't think it was a shock. I think for others it
might have been, but this was our goal from the moment we lost against Seton
Hall in the Big East Tournament last year until now.  
  
Q. You touched on the homecoming aspect, but what was the emotion like
when you just saw who was in this pod with you guys and you realized who would
be on the floor in the game after yours?  
COACH KIEGER: I was actually writing when our name popped up and all of a
sudden the team started screaming. So I looked up and I saw the 5 seed and I
saw Coral Gables, and my first thought was, one, we're a 5 seed, and, two,
we're playing in Coral Gables and that Miami was hosting. So congratulations
to them; they deserve it.  
  
And then obviously then, we're coming back here to where I coached. So it's a
lot of emotions. Can't really put it into words, but more so I'm just really
excited for our team to have, one, won the Big East and then, two, to
experience what it is to be in a NCAA Tournament.  
  
I've really talked all season long that I really want them to experience this.
I remember as a player, I remember what it's like as a coach, to be here and
for them to experience this and really get rewarded for their hard work, I'm
just really proud of them.  
  
Q. What stands out defensively when you look at them?  
COACH KIEGER: They're very disciplined, as we talked about prior. They like to
pack the paint. They play personnel very well. So I think we've got to be
aware of them, face guarding our leading scorers and just changing things up.  
  
They run a buzz defense. They're very well coached. For us we've got to, as
Natisha said, play our pace, make sure we're playing Marquette basketball and
don't let their defensive tendencies dictate what we're doing.  
  
Q. The follow-up was how has what you would define as Marquette
basketball kind of evolved over your three years?  
COACH KIEGER: Well, I think when I got the job at Marquette, I knew the style
that I wanted to play, and I knew we wanted to be up tempo. I knew it was
going to take a while for them to get to the pace we want to play and
understand the system that we're trying to create.  
  
I think our offense has evolved in the last three years, and as a group we're
figuring it out. And I think when you see us play now versus last year, even
we know each other better. We know what I'm looking for better. They're making
reads and they're reacting versus just being robots. And I think that's when
we're very hard to guard is -- we're unpredictable. And we're very hard to
scout.  
  
When you watch us play, I would not want to be an assistant coach for another
team because: What are they running? Sometimes I don't even know what we're
running but they do a fantastic job of reading and playing off each other, and
I think that's one thing that where we really evolved last year is eliminating
our dribbles and our passing has improved drastically. That's the biggest
thing I'm proud of in the year from last year to this year, is the way we're
sharing the ball; it's phenomenal.  
  
Q. Carolyn, Quinnipiac, this is their third NCAA Tournament appearance
in the last five years. They feel that they've been to the stage; they're
ready for the upset. How do you make sure that your team doesn't fall victim
to the 5-12 upset?  
COACH KIEGER: For us, once the NCAA Tournament starts, I don't look at seeds.
You have one job. And that's to beat the opponent next to you.  
  
And everybody is good if you make it to the NCAA Tournament. Everybody is
capable of beating the person that they're playing every single night.  
  
So for us, we've been just focussing on one game at a time. We did it for the
Big East Tournament. We weren't looking ahead. We were just going to play
Marquette basketball. And really we're evolving as a defensive team.  
  
And I think that's one thing, that you look at the beginning of the year to
now, we're starting to learn how to pack the paint. We're starting to learn
how to play to other players' tendencies.  
  
So for us, we've watched film on Quinnipiac for the last four days, and I
think our players are really focused. And they're going to make sure that
they're locked in defensively as well as offensively.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the 12th seed, Quinnipiac. We're joined by Coach
Tricia Fabbri, Carly Fabbri, Adily Martucci and Morgan Manz. And what we'll do
is we'll open it up with opening remarks from Coach.  
  
COACH FABBRI: Good afternoon. We're excited to be back in the Big Dance. We're
excited to be in Miami. We're looking forward to a great game with Marquette.
They've had an incredible season. Big East champions.  
  
But we're really looking forward to an opportunity that we've worked extremely
hard for, earned, and to be back here a third time in five years. We've got
incredible experience. It's a great opportunity, and we're just really excited
to make the most of an opportunity that we have, again, worked really hard for
all year long.  
  
And this is a moment that I don't feel is too big for this team. And, again,
we're looking forward to the weekend, the competition tomorrow and the 40-plus
minutes against Marquette tomorrow.  
  
Q. Carly, it's been, like, two weeks since the MAAC final, I guess, and
there's been spring break, the storm. I don't know how much of it you ended up
getting or not. But just what has this all been like to go from the three
games in three days in Albany to three days of hurry up and wait for
tomorrow?  
CARLY FABBRI: For sure, in any tournament three games in three days, it is a
lot. But we felt good coming out of the MAAC Tournament, obviously having won
it.  
  
We got, I think, two days off, and then we went right back to practice and
refocused. But when we found out on Monday who we were going to play, you
know, we were really excited, kind of finally putting a name to a face.  
  
But I think those days off, they helped us recover from a grueling tournament
up in Albany. But we're happy to be back in tournament play. Happy to be in a
warmer place in Miami. But definitely it was a long too weeks, but it helped
us refocus for sure.  
  
Q. I believe you won 10 games (indiscernible). Can you talk about how
much confidence the team has here coming in? Is the confidence pretty sky high
(indiscernible) accomplishing things this weekend?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. After our little slump, the ten games straight has
been really big for us and definitely grown our confidence levels. And since
then we've just had a huge belief in each other and in our coaches and that's
going to be huge come tomorrow.  
  
Q. When the seeding came out on Monday and Marquette was asked their
initial reactions about facing Quinnipiac, one of their guards said I've never
heard of it. What are your initial reactions to that, and how does that fuel
you?  
CARLY FABBRI: I think that it's nothing new to us. I think a lot of teams that
we do play from bigger conferences, they do have trouble pronouncing our name.
They don't really know where we're from, even though we have, you know, been a
major power for the past couple of years.  
  
But, I mean, if anything it's just an extra push. We're motivated as it is.
We've had this school since summer, we wanted to win our championship in the
league, which we did, and we want to win a game and the NCAA Tournament. But I
think we're just a little bit more focused on ourselves. I think if they don't
know who we are, they're going to know who we are tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, as a starter your team has been prone to slow starts.
Marquette just said a little while ago in their press conference they want to
start the game really well. They want to dictate pace of play, especially in
the first five minutes. How do you go about combatting that?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We definitely want to do the same. I think because of our slow
starts, we need to really change that and start very hot on offense. And I
think the big thing about doing that is just staying confident in our own
shots.  
  
I know I am very confident in my teammates, and they're confident in me. But I
think for ourselves we just need to be confident in our own shots.  
  
Q. When you get to this game, when you talk as a team since summer, like
Carly said, to win the MAAC, get to the NCAA Tournament, when you accomplish
that, do you almost feel like, yeah, you're playing for yourselves, you're
playing for your school, of course. But do you feel you're almost representing
the MAAC, too -- in some way that you're carrying the MAAC flag a little bit
when you get into this environment as well?  
MORGAN MANZ: I definitely think it's an honor to represent the MAAC. There is
only one team that gets to be sent here. You have to win your conference.  
  
So being able to come here represent the MAAC in the best way we can, we're
going to go out there and hopefully we can do our best.  
  
Q. Trish, third time in five years with this team. In your mind, what
sets this squad apart from the two prior teams that you sent to the NCAAs?  
COACH FABBRI: That's a great question. Ultimately, I think that this team has
benefited from the experience of being in not only the tournament but having
won championships. They've been able to set a different expectation this year.
I also think that we benefited from getting into a championship game and not
winning and really having a focus and a clear vision of what they wanted for
this season.  
  
And they were unwavered in their goals and what they wanted to achieve. It was
a challenge. Every season is. And we faced our challenges. But how we
responded to our challenges has made this team very different than the teams
that we've had in the past.  
  
Nothing good's ever easy. I said it a million times. But how we responded to
losing three out of four the end of January into the beginning of February,
and now to win 10 straight, to get into this position, to earn the seed, to
see Marquette on this neutral court, to remain unwavered, to stand in those
challenges and to respond the way that we have all together has made this team
very different.  
  
I've said the word time and again we talked a lot about grit, resilience,
finding ways. We haven't gotten out to our best starts. That's been maybe just
who we are, but we have been resilient. There's no panic; there's poise in how
we find ways to win. And that's what I would expect from this team tomorrow,
regardless of the start.  
  
Q. The logistics of this week, (indiscernible) or something like that.
How difficult was all that to deal with from a logistics standpoint?  
COACH FABBRI: Honestly, it wasn't bad at all. Because my part-time job is
meteorologist. I really enjoy The Weather Channel. And so we were planning
ahead.  
  
And fortunately enough, after the Selection Show, with the weather coming and
even before that, we had the plan in effect that we went grocery shopping. We
had plenty of supplies on hand.  
  
And with finding out that we were playing on Saturday really did help us that
we were able to not practice on Tuesday. And the governor did close the roads
down.  
  
So there was no way -- there was a travel ban, we were not going to get on the
roads. And the players can tell you that they went in, they went grocery
shopping in the team room and everyone had their supplies for breakfast, lunch
and dinner.  
  
And everything was copacetic, and we were able to have very good prep days,
our practice and stay in a routine. And the best thing we knew we were coming
to Miami.  
  
Maybe they weren't going anywhere for spring break but we still were able to
get to Miami. So it was really a win-win for us.  
  
Q. I know it turned inland, but how much did you guys end up getting?  
COACH FABBRI: It was around 10 to 12 inches of snow and it was still pretty
icy the next day, but we fared pretty well.  
  
Q. There's three games really on their schedule that sort of jump -- the
three against DePaul. DePaul locked down everybody all year, and DePaul
averaged 100 in those three games. What's it about their ability to get out
and go that might concern you the most?  
COACH FABBRI: Yes, just because I studied up as much as I could and
ironically, I just had that championship game on that night watching them
play.  
  
The synergy that they have with the three players that played on the AAU team
together, you know, their connection, their ability to get out and find one
another, that's a big deal. That seems to obviously carried over and turned
into a short turnaround into this program that's really on the rise and
playing so well right now.  
  
But we have a game plan in place to defend what their strength is in their
transition. And it's not going to be easy, because they get out and they're
just talented players with a great coach that have found a great way to get
out and score and average 80 points. We certainly have our hands full with
them wanting to get out and play up and down. But with that said we like to go
up and down ourselves.  
  
So I like that pace. I think it's going to be an exciting basketball game for
40-plus minutes, however long it's going to take. I think it's going to be a
really good women's basketball game in the tournament which is what you want
to see. These are the elite teams in the 64, but they want to get out and run.
I think we have our challenges, but I think we also do have a plan that's in
place to hopefully try and slow that transition game down.  
  
Q. Coach, you sort of touched on this earlier, but just how much of an
advantage does your experience, the players who have been in the tournament
before and just the veteran players veteran leadership, will help you
tomorrow?  
COACH FABBRI: Again, reflecting back to the first time and the second time,
you get this excitement and happy to be here. And as the years go on, and your
goals and aspirations change for your program, and within the players. And now
it's a real opportunity for us, and it was talked about not only as the
coaches, but when you don't have to talk about it, coaches to your team and
players, when it's an expectation amongst your players and your team is
talking about what they want, makes our job a lot easier.  
  
So this is an expectation from them. They've worked extremely hard to get
here. This is the moment they want. I expect them to make the most of their
moment.  
  
Q. When you went 1-3 in that stretch, was there -- what changed? There's
all sorts of reasons, ball just bounces that way or whatever? Were there
meetings? Did you change things? What was the catalyst to go from that to
this?  
COACH FABBRI: There's a lot that goes into it. There's not just one thing.
There was certainly an injury to Brittany Johnson. We were playing five in and
five out. We adjusted to that. There was just a flip of the calendar to
February.  
  
There were some other symbolic things that we did as a team from within, that
if I believed made an impact on going back to the purpose of what we were
doing, why we were doing it. And maybe that's a question that the players want
to answer more than myself.  
  
CARLY FABBRI: I think we just kind of banded together, I think. Obviously we
didn't like to lose. And it was happening a little bit more frequently than we
were used to in past years.  
  
So I think we just banded together. We made some changes on the court, off the
court, and we just got back to Quinnipiac basketball, sharing the ball,
winning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 86, Cal - 46  
  
Q. Nina and Alexis, just talk about just your last home game and what it
meant to go out like this, just to have a performance like this in your last
game.  
NINA DAVIS: It was great. We wanted to come out, we just wanted to kind of do
like we did in our first game, come out strong and aggressive and just kind of
try to put them away early.  
  
As I say, it's a bittersweet thing. We wanted to just leave our mark here. Of
course you wanted to give the fans the exciting thing, and just wanted my last
game here to be a good one.  
  
Q. Talk about the fan reaction when all four of you got taken out at the
same time.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It really hit me once she said it was our last time going in
here. I don't know. We had a good year. Played hard, finished it the way we
were supposed to. Kristy, there were like six lead changes there early, and
y'all went on a nice run and then had another run there in the second quarter
where it went from like six points up to I think it was 35-16 maybe. Was that
your offense, or do you feel like it started on the defensive end?  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: I think we got going on the defensive end. Yeah, we stopped
kind of the big presence and kind of helped down and covered down, and we were
able to run off that, and we're really good on the run, especially with these
two on the wing. They can just create and do some athletic stuff. That's where
the momentum kind of changed, and we kind of just kept pushing forward.  
  
Q. Kristy, y'all assisted on about 80 percent of your makes. What did
you think of the ball movement, especially in the half court today?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, great. I think we played a good team game on offense. We
didn't settle for just regular shots. We kind of looked to find some good
shots, and yeah, we made them, so that was really great.  
  
Q. Kristy, there was the spurt, but there was also the two back to back
threes by Natalie, but the first one you come over to the right side and she
was there and you motion her over and a couple passes later she made it. Talk
about what that sequence did for you, the two threes. I guess you were telling
her to get open, right?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, Nat hit some key shots, and that was a huge momentum
shifter. I show she's been working hard on her threes, so it was great to kind
of find her, and she got herself open, and yeah, she hit them, which was
really exciting.  
  
Q. Nina, y'all go back to Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. You
lost to West Virginia there, you lost to Notre Dame there a couple years ago.
Does the arena matter at this point?  
NINA DAVIS: It doesn't. We've had losses there. We've shed plenty of tears
there, but we've also celebrated in confetti there, as well. We're not really
worried about the location where we're playing at, we're just worried about
our next opponent, which is Louisville, and just focused on us and what we
have to do to get to the next round.  
  
Q. Kim, talk about that stretch in the second quarter where y'all did
take over the and the fact that Natalie hit those two threes and it seemed
like the whole momentum of the game shifted at that point.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Natalie, she's comfortable now, and I think when Kalani got
in foul trouble, Cox, freshman, goes in, and was big. Beatrice played big.
Jones came in, and then Natalie. We shared the ball, Kristy did a tremendous
job of pushing the ball up the floor, but looking to the backside and finding
shooters, and when a shooter makes one, find her again and let her make
another one.  
  
Q. Kristy mentioned during that stretch that the defense stepped up. Was
there one particular area that help side rotation ball pressure that stood out
to you?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes, we want to hedge big on the on-ball screens. We didn't care
if that post player slipped the screen, so the help side that's guarding that
wing player over there, we made sure she came and helped. We didn't do that
very good in the conference tournament, in any of the games. So we were able
to come back and just work on us, just work on help side. You get caught up in
this game. Look, this game has changed. When they started shooting threes,
it's changed everything about your defense, and you get caught up in -- I got
mine, you take yours, make sure you have your girl, and I just can't play like
that. That's just not how I was taught the game.  
  
We just got back to being better help side defense, and I thought we took away
all their transition baskets. A team that's as athletic as they are, take away
their transition baskets.  
  
Q. Asia Thomas, I think she was the one that hit like five three-
pointers for her. Kristy was on her most of the game. Talk about the defense,
and what did they make, 3 out of 13 for the game; is that a good basketball
question?  
KIM MULKEY: That's a great question, and you even knew her name. Kristy was
assigned to guard her. We didn't want to help down ball side. When the minute
Anigwe turned, then you could hit from the backside. If you were ball side and
it was not Thomas, we covered down and we wanted them to make threes. We
didn't want them to penetrate and get in the paint and get us in foul trouble
all night, and she hit big shots against LSU. We knew that, but we were very
willing to give them the three-pointers tonight.  
  
Q. The ball movement, again, 28 assists tonight; how impressed were you
on that?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, very. I think sometimes -- there were spurts in that first
half where we dribbled too much in the same place waiting for on-ball screens
and they were trapping us, and I didn't like that. So I got out of our offense
where we were setting on ball screens and just do the high-low look with the
two bigs, and then Kalani got in foul trouble, so when you go small with Nina
she can't see in there to get the big the ball, so just spread the ball, just
move it, slip the screen, find the open player. Kristy does that as good as
anybody I've coached. She pushes it up the floor to the wing players and lets
those guys go find a post player in transition.  
  
I thought all of them were big tonight. I thought our depth has surfaced big
time in these two playoff games. We knew we had depth. We've seen it all year.
You've seen them play. But you don't know how they're going to produce in the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Tonight, while you don't ever want Kalani Brown to play two minutes in the
first quarter and sit, it may have been a blessing in disguise because it
allowed me to gain confidence in Cox, who went in immediately and defended a
tremendous athlete. Beatrice has all of last year's experience, and we didn't
miss a beat. And that's important for them and for me and for our team.  
  
Q. Obviously next is Oklahoma City. Talk about facing Louisville for the
third time in the Sweet 16 in nine years and just how different is that team
from ones you've faced in the past or if you know much about them yet?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I watched a little bit of their game with Tennessee prior to
our game. You know, the first time that we played Louisville, I thought they
had the better team. You know, Jessica Morrow tried to take us on her
shoulders that year, and we competed. We competed. And then we all know what
happened the year that we were supposed to win that third National
Championship when we had Griner and Odyssey and all those guys, and they were
good. They made, correct me if I'm wrong, if memory served me right, 16 out of
25 threes. Well, you can win every game if you do that. And for us to have
come back and even made it a close game and a shot to win it was miraculous
because they couldn't miss.  
  
But that's history. So now you go to this game, and they're a different team,
we're a different team. They have great players, we have great players.
They're well-coached. I don't know if we are or not, but we'll see. But we'll
compete. I think we have a size advantage, but really what does that mean at
this level? If you can play, you can play.  
  
Our size is young, and I think people tend to forget that. Our size -- and
Nina and KK are small, but our three bigs are a freshman and two sophomores,
and I just think the more they can get NCAA experience, the better they get,
and then maybe some day they'll win them a National Championship here.  
  
But two different -- three different times we've played -- this will be our
third time to play them, and we'll prepare tomorrow and Wednesday, and I think
leave Wednesday night and go to Oklahoma City.  
  
Q. Is Alexis -- her shot was off a couple times today. Is that a matter
maybe of not having that practice time during all this? Or is her knee still
bothering her?  
KIM MULKEY: No, her knee is fine. I asked her. When you get fatigued and
you're not running up and down the floor, sometimes you're short because of
your legs. But I thought she took good shots. I thought that she drove some to
show you that she can get in there. She got her shot blocked. But she gave us
20, 22 good minutes, and if you look at her stats, they're pretty good. She
gave us, what, six rebounds and eight points, five assists. She's good.

LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: First off, we want to thank you for being here and the
coverage, and I think it's a great sport of women's basketball, and for you
all to be here I think is really meaningful. I'd also like to thank the folks
at Baylor who have run this weekend. They're obviously used to hosting. They
do a great job, and the people from the -- the workers and people who checked
us in were not only on top of things but gracious and kind, and we appreciate
that.  
  
I want to congratulate Baylor. Kim gave me a baby gift at shoot-around today.
I thought that was really thoughtful. She said she has a place in her heart
for moms and coaching, and that's the kind of thing that women's basketball is
about.  
  
They have a darned good team. I know they have to go to Oklahoma City first,
but I think they have a great chance to be playing down the road here in
Dallas and a shot to win the National Championship, so it was a great
challenge for us.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. I think it was a huge step for us to get here,
and not just to prove to people that we belonged in the tournament, but more
taking a look forward, I think this is a group that can do some special
things, and we needed this experience. We needed to see that we could win a
game on this stage, and we also needed to be humbled and see what a No. 1 seed
looks like, because that's where we want to be.  
  
Especially appreciative of Courtney Range, without whom we would not have
gotten to this point, because there were some times in the year where it's
rocky, and I think her leadership helped us get here, and I think next year
when we're a better team and these young kids are playing deeper into the
dance, we'll be talking about Courtney's leadership at that point. So I just
wanted to say that.  
  
Q. Kristine, Kalani Brown picked up two quick fouls early in the game. I
think it was the first minute and 10 seconds. Did y'all sense that as an
opportunity with her on the bench?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Um, they have like six 6'4" players, so I just tried to play
them the same way, and if one went out, another one came in, took her spot and
played hard. Another one came in, played hard. So I just tried to do the same
thing. They all like played kind of the same.  
  
Q. As Coach just talked about, the experience of getting here and the
win and then tonight, talk about trying to put that -- I know it's a little
early, but put that in perspective looking ahead what that can do for this
young group and everybody coming back.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Wow. I wish I was celebrating going to the Sweet 16, but you
don't always get what you want. And so I personally am just going to work
really hard and take my team there next year. Last year we didn't even make it
here. It's just a step, a step -- we won the first round, lost in the second
round by 40 points to the No. 1 seed. Next year I really hope we can get to
the Sweet 16 and not be that 9 seed playing the 1 seed.  
  
I'm just going to work really hard to not feel this way ever again.  
  
Q. Courtney, for you as a senior this is your last game in the Cal
uniform. Talk a little bit about how that feels for you, and also Coach's
words about your leadership, helping to get Cal back on this stage.  
COURTNEY RANGE: I mean, it's a bittersweet feeling, you know. I mean, it
sucks, you wish you could be like Baylor celebrating, going on to the Sweet
16. But like Kristine said, her individually, she's going to work hard. I know
her, her work ethic. She's going to take the team, put it on her back, and
have them follow her and what she's doing, and she's going to make sure that
they don't feel this feeling anymore. Like she said, they're going to work
hard not to be a 9 seed. They're going to work to be that 1 seed to
potentially be hosting at Cal.  
  
Yeah, and me personally, I mean, four years, I mean, it's gone by -- I
wouldn't say fast. People say it goes by quick. I wouldn't say that. Yes, it
has its ups and downs. It was fun, and I mean, the group of girls throughout
my four years, I just love them all, and I'm happy that I chose Cal.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys shot 29 percent. I know as Kristine said, they've
got a lot of size, but what is it about Baylor's defense that makes it so
tough? Is it the length?  
COURTNEY RANGE: To me, yeah, just like Kristine said. One goes out, another
6'4" comes in, so we had our game plan, we tried to execute it the best we
could. Obviously today it wasn't in our favor, but like I said, if we get a --
if they get another shot at them again, they'll know what to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you played these guys three years ago I think it was; what's
different about this team? Is this a better team, I guess?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: That's a tough one to answer because they're both pretty
good. This is a truly unique team in women's college basketball with the waves
of post players coming in. And it's not like -- I mean, I don't know, maybe
you saw, our game plan early on was to really pack the paint. I tried to use
the West Virginia prototype, pack the paint, make them shoot jumpers; then you
look at the stats, and those kids shooting jumpers are 40 percent, 40 percent.
Oh, Natalie comes off the bench, 45 percent. It's not like they have a glaring
weakness.  
  
I think if Alexis Jones kind of gets back in her rhythm a little bit, I think
she's a first-round WNBA pick. If she's playing well and the post players and
the guard play, I mean, that team we played back then was pretty darned good,
to too, but this team is really, really special, and I think as people thought
from the beginning of the year, they're a legit national title contender. They
played Connecticut tough the first time. They're really good.  
  
Q. Once you guys hit your first three shots and had some good passing
and stuff, with Kalani on the bench, I know they said the depth that Baylor
has is tough, but did you see that as an opportunity?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, if you had told me that we would start the
game and we would get Kalani two quick fouls, I would have thought that's
favorable. I would have chosen that, but I wouldn't also have been like, okay,
now we're home free. You just know that their depth is a huge just weapon for
them.  
  
I thought the main thing was we struggled to score so much, which actually
didn't even allow us to try to do our defensive game plan. When you let them
get going in transition, that's when they're up scoring in the high 80s and
90s, so if we could have scored more I thought we could have set our defense
and maybe tried to at least bother them into some shots they weren't as
comfortable with, but once they get going in transition now, now it's tough to
get your doubles on the posts, it's tough to get a hand up on shooters, so I
think our inability to score consistently was trouble.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know your team would have liked to have been the seventh,
but it looks like the Pac-12 is going to send six teams to the Sweet 16. What
does that say about the challenge that you guys have but also just about how
strong this league was all year?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so Washington and UCLA both won? Great. You know, I
can't say I'm that surprised. Like I remember having a conversation with Mike
Neighbors, my buddy in the league, we talk about this stuff, about getting the
RPI and all that kind of stuff. We said early in the year, I don't know if we
have a Final Four team. I don't know if there's a legit top five team, but we
said we could get five or six in the Sweet 16, and maybe there is a Final Four
team or two, and I hope there will be.  
  
But I think it speaks to the depth of the league. I mean, we've said it -- it
sounds like lip service, but it's real. Our fifth place team took the SEC
champ to the wire last night. Our -- is it five? Five teams, yeah. And our
sixth place team tonight beat a top ACC team, with Duke -- did Duke come in
second or third? Really towards the top. So the depth of the league is no
joke, and I think we prepare each other for moments like this, and I'm super
happy for my colleagues and our Pac-12 brethren, and I think five Sweet 16
says a lot, and of course it makes every night in the league harder, right.
Going back the days when it was us and Stanford battling it out, only two
teams in the tournament, maybe my life was a little easier night to night, but
it doesn't make you better, and I think this is what's good for the league.
Glad to be part of it, and sure, we want to be one of the ones at the very,
very top next year.  
  
Q. Building on that, like the league is getting -- the Pac-12 is getting
so strong now; what are you going to do with your team to keep pace or even
catch up really?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, I think different things matter right now.
Like we used to be able to be young and talented and go win on the road in the
league even when we didn't play our best or something like that, and now the
league is so good that that's good for everybody. I mean, what I said to them
in there is the year prior to the Final Four year, we were an 8 seed. Again,
we finished second in the Pac-12 and we were an 8 seed at Notre Dame. We won
the first game, and we played Notre Dame tough. Played them tougher than this
outcome was. But I remember saying in that locker room, I think Muffet McGraw
had said, hey, that's a top-10 team next year, and I said, I want us to be
great next year not simply because we return everybody but because everybody
in this room is better than what they are now, and it was a very similar
message. We will definitely miss Courtney, but we have the majority of our
team coming back. We have some great kids coming in, and my challenge to them
is let's not just be better next year by default, because other people
graduate, but I want to be better because we've seen the bar and we want to
get to the top. We have competitors in there. They expected to come in here
and win. Not in any type of like unrealistic or -- but they're competitors.
Like they're going to come and say we want to beat this team. So now we have
to channel that into off-season workouts that get us to the point where we can
and get us to the point where we can be first in the Pac-12, and I don't have
a doubt that that's what's on the players' mind right now.  
  
Q. What did Kim get you today?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: It was one of those like carrier things, the things that you
wear when the baby is like 8 to 35 pounds. It was really cool. Yeah.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Kim Mulkey, Nina Davis and Kristy Wallace with us
today. Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Nina or Kristy, could you tell the break from the Big 12 until this
weekend, even during the week, had helped you guys a little bit, refresh you
physically and mentally?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure, rest is always great. It allowed players like Alexis
Jones come back and get her rhythm back and practice with us 100%. Around this
time of year rest is always great. We have seniors on this type of team and
any rest is always great. It showed yesterday.  
  
Q. Kristy, what did you like about y'all's defensive effort yesterday
and how do you carry that over to tomorrow?  
KRISTY WALLACE: It was good, I think that we emphasized that throughout the
week. Cal is an athletic team so we're going to need to be able to contain
them and stop dribble penetration.  
  
Q. Nina, obviously I know the focus for you is trying to get to the
Sweet 16, but talk about the fact that you'll be playing your last home game
here tomorrow night and the emotions that will go with that.  
NINA DAVIS: It's a bittersweet moment. Baylor has been great to me these past
four years, the fans, I'm definitely going to miss the opportunity to play at
the Ferrell Center in front of my fans and teammates and coaches, but I'm not
focused on that. I'm taking it day by day and game by game and I'm looking at
the big overall picture, and after we get there maybe the emotions will come
of how this is my last year.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Kristy Wallace's family is here from Australia, a side note for
you. A long trip with two little sisters, and of course Nina's family from
Memphis doesn't seen so far compared to that, but Kristy would never tell you
that.  
  
Q. How do you erase what happened last night and the fresh start? I know
you guys go from game-to-game, but how do you erase the performance last night
and move forward?  
NINA DAVIS: Simple, you erase it. It was a great game. It was a great showing.
I think everyone on the team scored. It allowed a lot of us to get rest and
the young players to get out there and get comfortable in their first NCAA
Tournament game. We're expected to win and we expected to win that game so you
move on from that. You just look forward to the next game. You don't look too
far ahead, and you don't look in the past.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: What she said. Just move on and take it game by game.  
  
Q. Kristy, we will ask you about your family being here. Like Kim said,
you didn't tell us the other day that they were coming. How special is it when
they're here? What's it like when they are here for you?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Very thankful that they got to make it up here to the
tournament. Yeah, very blessed to have my family here and very excited that
they get to watch a few games. It's a big effort and a big trip to make, so
I'm just thankful that they get to be here.  
  
Q. How long is the trip?  
KRISTY WALLACE: It's a 16-hour flight, so it's pretty brutal.  
  
Q. Nina and Kristy, what have you seen from Cal? Did you get to watch
the game last night? What have you seen from the Golden Bears?  
NINA DAVIS: They're a team full of a lot of athletes. They have five. They
have a great post player and they are going to come out aggressive and try to
take us off the dribble penetration. They're going to rebound hard and we have
to do a lot of boxing out and a lot of help defense. On the defensive end they
play man-to-man. So we have to do what they're doing to us and attack the
basket and come out hard like we did yesterday and play with a lot of energy.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Cal is an athletic team and we have to contain the dribble
penetration, like Nina said. They have a good post presence, so our bigs are
going to have their hands full dealing with that. Defense is a big key and
that is going to win us games, so we need to focus on them and stop them that
way.  
  
Q. Nina, you played them in 2014 here in the tournament. Do you remember
the difference between then and now? Have you seen them since then?  
NINA DAVIS: That was back in the day, my freshman year. They were a great
team. They came out and gave us a challenge. I think they had Brittany Boyd
and that crew. I don't think they have changed much. The faces have changed,
but they're going to attack. They're athletic. They crash the boards hard and
we know they don't want to go home, and this is the NCAA Tournament and
they're going to come out and try to pull off an upset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen film from Kristine Anigwe, their really
good forward?  
KIM MULKEY: Tremendous athleticism, leaps out of the gym, has great range,
runs the floor well. She's just an athlete. She didn't score a lot last night,
but we know that we've got to defend her. She gets to the foul line more than
anybody on their team, leading scorer. We have the size to match-up with her.
I think playing Cal versus LSU, it's a little bit more traditional for us
because of their size.  
  
If we had played LSU it would have been difficult, because they bring their
bigs outside the paint. So tremendous, tremendous athlete.  
  
Q. Kim, two years ago when you were hear you mentioned the 2017 Final
Four here two years ago and I know there was excitement about your team and
I'm not asking you about getting to the Final Four, but you two years ago were
excited about the prospects of what you had with this season with this team.
Talk about how this team has developed and has it lived up to what you hoped
for two years ago?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I can answer that based upon what they've done to this
point. If we don't make it to where certain people think we should be in a
Final Four I guess they're going to call it a failure. I don't do that
anymore. I'm blessed to have an elite program and coach elite basketball
players and there are a handful across the country that get to do the same
thing I get to do.  
  
You look at our record. The games we've lost were to good teams. Hopefully the
loss to West Virginia in some ways made us refocus and I just know that the
team that took the floor last night. It didn't matter who we played. That team
last night was as focused and as ready as they have been at any point this
year. It started in practice. You can say well maybe the loss made them.
Maybe. Whatever it was, I know that four seniors in that locker room realized
this is their last time to play on this floor. They realize this is their last
chance to get to a Final Four.  
  
When you are young, you don't want to disappoint your coach and you don't want
to disappoint your seniors. I thought the youth on that floor last night, the
three that came to the press conference with me, being so young, they were
poised. They were focused. They were determined to do their part.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit -- Kalani and Beatrice, obviously their
size gives them an advantage, but it's more than size. You have to have the
technique and you have to play. Talk about how you've seen them develop since
last year when they played in this tournament?  
KIM MULKEY: Last year, they both came in as freshmen and played immediately.
There is no substitute for experience. There is just no substitute for it.  
  
After that first year they realized, I did a lot of good things, but I've got
a long ways to go and it doesn't start when we start practice in October. It
starts in the summer when they're here for summer school and working with
strength and conditioning coach. I think kalani -- well, I don't think, I
know. Kalani is in great shape. She can play for longer periods. She is
moving. She took charge. She is running the floor. Who does that at 6'7"? She
wouldn't have done that a year ago.  
  
Beatrice is a rebounding machine. Beatrice can get to offensive rebounds as
good as any kids I've coached and one of the best I every coached, and one of
the best I have ever coached at offensive rebounding was Danielle Crockrom.
Beatrice has a knack for being around the ball. She wants to contribute, and
both of those young ladies have a lot of college basketball left in them, and
I'm just grateful they're on our team.  
  
Q. Are you having as much fun with this group as maybe you've had with
any team you've had?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes. You know, each team is different. Each team brings challenges
to the table. What this team has done is challenged me to stay on my toes
because we've got so many that can play. You usually can figure out your
rotation after about a month of practice.  
  
This team just has so much talent I can't do that. It's game-to-game. It's who
we play. It's who is playing good, and I can't ever relax because I'm always
trying to be conscious of who needs to be on the floor together for us to win
and for them to look good.  
  
The good things about this team -- I never have issues with them. I never have
school issues. I never have, you know, late-for-class issues, tardy for a
tutor issues.  
  
Some coaches may tell you across the sport that that isn't a good thing. You
need some of them that get in trouble every now and then so you can stay fired
up; but, no, it makes you want to stay in coaching longer when you don't have
off-the-court issues. They've just been a joy to coach and I would love
nothing more than to see those seniors lead this team to Dallas. But if it
doesn't happen, we will move on and prepare for the next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais is Asha Thomas, Kristine Anigwe and Courtney Range,
along with Coach Lindsay Gottlieb. Questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. Courtney, you have had the experience of playing here. How do you
explain to your teammates that have not had the experience about playing
against Baylor here?  
COURTNEY RANGE: To be honest, it's bigger than a Pac-12 tournament. You're
playing for a Championship. To keep it simple, just go out and do what we've
been doing all year and do it even better. The competition is going to get
harder. Come out and have fun and know that just like the Pac-12 Tournament
it's one and done. If we want to extend our season you gotta play how we all
know we can play and to continue to go far.  
  
Q. What do you think are the main challenges you will face against
Baylor?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: We're fully aware that they have size. They're athletic. They
have guard play. We're going to try to do our best to contain the post and
just put pressure on the guards. We've talked about it in film. We've talked
about it with each other, and I think we're very confident going into this
game.  
  
COURTNEY RANGE: Agreed.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Kristine, following up on that, you know what they're going to try to
do especially with Kalani Brown and the big girls inside. Talk about the
challenge that gives you and how much do you relish that opportunity? It's not
something you face every game anymore.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Pac-12 did a good job of preparing me. Oregon State has
really good post players. UCLA has really good post players, Washington. I'm
prepared. I've faced this before. We watched a lot of film again. I think
we're ready to go into this game. We had nothing to lose, everything to gain.
They're the No. 1 seed. They deserve that seed. We're going to do everything
we can to win.  
  
Q. What do you guys have to do better in this game to make it
competitive and pull out a win?  
ASHA THOMAS: I think we need to be sharper. I know we had a lot of turnovers.
Baylor is a great team. They're going to pressure us more, attack us even more
and try to limit us from our strengths. Definitely we need to be sharper, know
our options and continue what we need to do.  
  
Q. After a shooting game last night can you carry something over into
that?  
ASHA THOMAS: I don't want to stop. I don't want to stop. If they limit me from
my shooting I need to do other things, whether it is attacking the paint,
rebounding defensively. I have other things to do for my team.  
  
Q. Asha and Kristine, you guys both talked about how nervous you were
beginning of the game yesterday. So talk about how you're feeling now and do
you anticipate more nerves, less nerves as it comes to this game?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: More nerves, bigger game. We're in the second round. Not a
lot of teams can say that they have done that. This is my first time being in
the second round, because my first time being here. They have really good --
all the fans come out. All the people come out, their band. It's their house.
Their home court.  
  
We're just going to try to do everything we can to be calm and steady, so not
talk like -- be within ourselves, play within ourselves, know our strengths,
know what we are good at, not try to do too much. Just always be level-headed.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Again, I will be nervous. But my teammates will have my back and
I will have their back.  
  
COURTNEY RANGE: I want to say they don't play like they're nervous!  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I did.  
  
Q. I spoke to CJ West yesterday, and she said one of the things that you
guys did well was play possession-to-possession and not try to look ahead, get
too far ahead of yourselves and that you stay within the game. That's going to
be challenging with the crowd and everything else. Courtney, can you talk as a
senior how you intend to help mentally with the team playing in this game?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Starting off before the LSU game, the week of practice after
the Big 12 we were waiting to see what tournament we were in. We find out we
were in. We were playing LSU. That was our focus. LSU, then if we get to
Baylor we'll work on that. We played Saturday. We won that game. Now we're on
to the next one. No longer looking back. Now, we had a great film session
today. We feel prepared. We're going to go over it in practice and do what we
need to do.  
  
As far as what to say, I mean, to me I'm not the only voice. Everyone is
talking. We're at the time where everyone's voice is going to be heard.
Everyone usually has something good to say that's helpful for the team and
right now I believe that this team can too a lot of things. When we stay
composed and relax and not worry about, you know, what's next, what's next and
just taking care of each possession, I feel like we're going to go far. If we
do that, we're a team to beat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach Gottlieb?  
  
Q. Lindsay, you said last night you didn't have to watch much of Baylor
to know how good they were. Now that you've had a chance to absorb this team
and the team you're facing what are your thoughts?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I mean, they're really, really good. They're like a WNBA
team and I say that with a lot of respect for the WNBA. I watch WNBA. They
have pros on the floor. They're in sync with one another and they do a great
job. They're 30-3 in a tough league or whatever it is now, 31, not sure. They
don't have real weaknesses and they do a great job of playing to their
strengths. The inside game is unreal. They're bringing in the next big body
after the next big body and at the same time their guard play is good.  
  
Just digging into the film, obviously, they're as legit as I thought they
were. That being said, you can always -- that's what we do. We study film for
hours and hours and hours and you try to find things to take away, ways to
attack them and I've never been as excited to practice as I am today, because
why not? Why not take a shot at being able to make history or bring this team
in here and do something that's unexpected?  
  
They're supposed to win. They're supposed to go to the Final Four. They're a
legit National Championship contender, but we're going to come out here and
that's what the NCAA Tournament is about, try and play our best forty minutes.  
  
Q. One of the areas of concern is rebounding. They are huge and they
crash the boards. That's something your team has struggled with throughout the
season. Can you talk about that?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: They're plus-20 on the boards. They devastate people because
of the size and the aggressiveness. It's simple. We have to box out. We have
to limit them to one shot attempt, and are you going to do two hours of
rebounding drills in this practice today? No.  
  
But I think at this point you hope the players understand from the film and
can get it done. We will do some things positioning wise to put ourselves in a
position to succeed there, but you've gotta get that done. They're big. We
also have athleticism and we're capable of it, just need to make it a point of
emphasis.  
  
Q. Trying to put your best forty minutes on the court, and last night
you called it a survive-and-advance game, which it was for you guys. But what
do you tell your players that even when they're not playing their best they
were still able to pull it out and now you can kind of turn it up a notch?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, we talked yesterday before the game about using our
entire 30-something game body of work, our resume to our advantage. We have
been in a lot of situations. I think this team has shown a lot of resilience.
Maybe two months ago we don't win that game last night when LSU came back and
took a lead. I thought we did a good job of establishing ourselves early; but,
sure, we always feel we can be better and that's a good place to be.  
  
I do think we always feel like our best forty minutes of basketball is in
front of us. That's what we're going to try to do.  
  
Q. A lot of focus has been on the post players. But you said last night
they have really good guard play. Can you talk about that as well?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: You always look at what can you take away. If a team is so
devastating inside, maybe make 'em shoot from the outside. But then you have
Prince at 42%, and Wallace at 41% and Natalie off the bench at 43%, so it's
not like they have a glaring weakness. All my friends in the WNBA I've known
for months that Alexis Jones is a first-round pick if not a top-6 pick. So add
that to the mix. They're good all the way around. They really are, so they
have legit inside/outside.  
  
We have thoughts of what we have to do, but it's not like there is one glaring
weakness that you exploit, which is why they're a top-3 or whatever they are
team in the country. They have a lot of things they do well and not too many
things they do poorly. It's a legit challenge. They belong where they are and
we have to play really, really well. I think our players are excited to do
that.  
  
Like I said, this isn't business as usual for us. This is an opportunity, and
I think our players will take it with that kind of mentality.  
  
Q. When you were here three years ago you were coming off an unexpected
Final Four to some people. You said up here, we're trying to establish
something like what Baylor has got. Present time now, where do you think you
are in that? I know you guys weren't happy with missing the tournament last
year, but where do you think this foundation of this program is at?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: We want to be a top-10, top-20 team every year, so that then
you go to the Final Four and it's not a surprise. You have that kind of
culture and then you get the right pieces in the right places and then all of
the sudden you are a top-5, top-6.  
  
Kim and Bill have had this thing going for a while. We do think we're on that
track. This is a big step for this team this year to go 12-0 in nonconference
and to make the NCAA Tournament and then to win a game. We will have most of
our team coming back next year, so it's all part of a larger process.  
  
The goal is still to be one of those programs that's in the conversation when
you talk about UConn and Notre Dame and I think Baylor is at that level year-
in and year-out. I think the strength of the Pac-12 helps that, and we're
trying to capitalize on that. Stanford is in that realm, too. We want to be in
that realm. You have to beat some of those teams to do it and you have to
continually be on this stage and continue to advance further. Definitely
pleased with the success we have had, but hoping that the next five years are
even better. It would be nice to start that tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 119, Texas Southern - 30  
  
Q. Lauren, how much fun was that, because I don't know that you've shot
that many three-pointers all year.  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, that was a lot of fun, just because they were falling for me
and my teammates were getting the ball, and we were just really working
together and sharing the ball with each other.  
  
Q. Kalani, against a team that you have a serious size advantage
against, how important is it to take advantage of that?  
KALANI BROWN: It's very important to dominate the paint, especially when you
don't have a lot of height. I think that we did that, all of us did that.
Everybody came out ready and everybody came out and executed, and we were all
ready to play.  
  
Q. Beatrice, Lauren talked about the sharing of the ball. I just looked,
seven players had at least four assists. You two guys in particular shared it
a lot. Can you talk about the post-to-post passing?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just coming out there, and if somebody opened up they
should get the ball because they worked hard to get open, so just being able
to pass it to them and they had a good shot.  
  
Q. You guys set a record, largest margin of victory in an NCAA
Tournament game. Does that mean anything to you? Is it cool to have?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely it's an honor. We all worked hard. It was a team
effort. Everyone contributed. And I think we're excited about it. I'm excited
about it. I mean, not many teams do that.  
  
Q. Question regarding the pace of the game, so two-part question. The
pace of the game, how did you feel about the pace of the game, and how
important was it for the post players to be able to see each other, feed each
other, and just celebrate this victory today?  
LAUREN COX: I think that's one of the things we do really well is run the
floor, especially our posts. We are told to run free-throw line to free-throw
line, and when we get out there, that's what we're trying to do, and our
guards push it and get us the ball.  
  
Sorry what was the other question?  
  
Q. Passing.  
LAUREN COX: Oh, that's something we've been working on in practice. Every day
we go through a drill passing it to each other.  
  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just going out in practice every day, like just running
the floor and passing the post, like we do drills for it just to perfect it,
so just going out there and doing what we've been working on in practice.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Piggy-backing off what both of them said, it's something we've
been working on from day one. When you have shots like we have, it's got to be
dominant, and I think Coach Mulkey really focuses on that.  
  
As far as the pace of the game, the game plan was to rebound, and I thought we
did that very well today. Lauren got some transition buckets. We did
everything, executed today, basically.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey talks about staying focused, staying into the game. When
you all have situations like you had today where you get off to an early break
quick and the defense picks up and it all starts to roll over in waves, how do
you all keep focus in a situation like that and just steadily move forward and
not have a drop-off?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just going out and not looking at the scoreboard, and
thinking that the game is just 0-0 when you go out there.  
  
LAUREN COX: We just have to feed off each other. If one of us hits a shot,
even if we're up a lot, we just have to get excited and feed off each other's
energy.  
  
KALANI BROWN: And also leadership. Leadership has a tendency to keep us
focused in game situations. With them leading us, we're pretty much focused
the entire way.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday you were hoping your team came out and
played with the same fire and enthusiasm that Texas Southern was going to
have. Are you pleased with what you saw from your kids today?  
KIM MULKEY: Without a doubt. I thought the group that started the game was as
intense as they've been probably all year. I thought their intensity, I
thought their focus was just so much better than the last game, and then the
group that went in the game, all of them that went in the game, understood
you'll come out of the game if you don't get in passing lanes. You're going to
come out of the game if you allow people to go to the offensive boards, and I
just felt sitting here looking at some of these stats, we shot 78 percent in
the third quarter. I don't know if I've ever coached a team at Baylor that we
haven't been in quarters many years, but that's pretty remarkable.  
  
We did score a lot of points, but the thing I'm most proud of is how few
points we gave up, and I just thought that -- we had to foul on the three-
point shot, we fouled a couple jump shooters. You can't do that against teams
when it's a close game. But I just thought our defense was just so much
better, particularly help side.  
  
Q. Did you think going into the game that it would be this one-sided?  
KIM MULKEY: No. I don't ever think that. I know when I'm watching the film, I
have a tendency to think, okay, we can do certain things against a team that
we're getting ready to play, and I just thought that we did well with our
high-low stuff, and we've been emphasizing that a lot lately. I think the
misleading thing about this team is those three that were up here are pretty
big, and they're two sophomores and a freshman. They've got a lot of
basketball left in them. But guys, we're leading the country in three-point
field goal percentage. I don't even know that I knew that until it was said at
the press conference the other day. 40.6 percent from the three, so we've got
kids that can shoot it out there, and we don't shoot as much as others in the
country because if we do, I'm not a very good coach when you've got this kind
of size inside. But we've got a lot of balance.  
  
It was good to have Jones back today. I think she gave us valuable minutes,
and I wanted to get her off the floor, and I thought it really showed when she
had the ball in her hands how quickly she can get it down the floor.  
  
Q. Going back to your size for a second, I went back and looked at the
2012 team National Championship team. You had four players 6'2 " or bigger.
You've got six on this team.  
KIM MULKEY: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. Is this just the way the game is going, just that you guys have been
able to --  
KIM MULKEY: No, I don't. I think the game, if you look across the country, I
think it probably started with the Warriors. Everybody wants guards and
everybody wants to spread the floor. I was a guard. I know where my bread was
buttered. I got it to the big girls. Who in the country is going to turn down
size? So we run offensive things that are much different than a lot of people
who don't have our size.  
  
Now, does it make for a difficult match-up defensively? Sometimes it does. But
we've got to adjust. I'm not going to turn down 6'7", 6'4", 6'4". I'm just not
going to do that.  
  
Now, the 2012 team, you did have 6'2", 6'2", but then you had Brittney, so she
made up for a lot of that.  
  
Q. Talk about the contribution of your bench today. They got a lot of
minutes because of the situation. Were you happy, ecstatic, or just --  
KIM MULKEY: Well, our bench has been giving us that all year. I've said it
many times, I don't know that I really have a bench. I can only play five at a
time. I just thought that the work we've put in since the conference
championship -- tournament championship game, I think you saw it today. I
think you saw post players feeding each other better than they have all year.
I think you saw production from people immediately when they came in the game.
It's just been an emphasis to continue to work on your defense. Your offense
is fine, continue to work on your defense, and I think our help side defense
gets better and better, dribble penetration is always a concern because it's
just hard to guard anybody one-on-one in the game anymore, so you've got to
have that second and third defender, and we've got kids that can block shots.
I want them taking more charges. I just want them to play better team defense.  
  
Q. I was fortunate to be able to see both reactions at the selection on
Monday and was really pleased to see the focus for both teams. I mean, it
wasn't the big hooray, yeah, we're in. It's like, now we know who we're going
to play, let's go. Business as usual. Talk about that; was it the right vibe
that I was getting seeing both the reactions?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I wasn't in there, honestly. I had gone to my office and was
checking in on my son's baseball, and by the time I got back in there, they'd
already shot us on the TV. I saw the paper the next day and saw the reaction
of the seniors on the front row there, and they're happy. They're beautiful
girls, and yet at the same time those seniors are missing a Final Four, and
they want to get to a Final Four.  
  
Those seniors have sacrificed a lot. You've got Prince, who is -- I don't even
know how many surgeries she's been through. You've got Jones with the knee
who's back, you've got KK and Nina, whose roles have changed since they got
here, but are such team players and great kids that they just want to get to a
Final Four.  
  
So yes, they were excited. We never take it for granted. Fortunately or
unfortunately, however you want to view it, I guess people think it's not good
if you're just an Elite 8 team. But I know there are lots of schools in the
country that would trade places with us.  
  
But we set the bar here. In 2005, I said then, I'm not sure we can feed this
monster. Well, we're feeding it. Sometimes the stomach is not full and
sometimes it is. We're going to fight and claw until the very end, and let's
hope the bitter end is in Dallas, but if it's not, I know this, if it's not,
the team that beats us just had played better, and that's what I said about
West Virginia. They just played better. We never gave up. We fought hard.
Let's see what happens.  
  
Q. Just talk more about Alexis being able to be back on the floor today.
Were you happy with what you saw out of her output and everything?  
KIM MULKEY: Absolutely. Got her off the floor. She got 12, 15 minutes, I don't
remember, but that's enough. Heck, that's about all any of them got today.  
  
But I thought her -- with the ball in her hands from one end to the other, she
got down the floor quickly. Alexis has tremendous vision and can make passes a
lot of girls can't make, and her shot, I don't know that she took very many.
Let's see. How many did she take? Five? Two for five? That's fine. Alexis
Jones, really I didn't look at her and go, oh, wow, we're going to struggle
with her out there, or oh, she's not healthy. I felt good with her out there.
She picked up two quick fouls, which took her out of some minutes there early,
but she looked good to me.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 119, Texas Southern - 30  
  
Q. Joyce, as difficult as this outcome is, what do you guys take out of
this that you can move forward with and the experience of this game to move
forward?  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Well, there's really nothing that we can take out of it. We
did the best we could, which was to hold them accountable to their mistakes,
which we capitalized on towards the end. But I think we should have did
better.  
  
Q. Again, it was tough, but y'all played tough. What were you saying to
each other on the court? How were you keeping your spirits up throughout the
game?  
CHYNNA EWING: Well, we were just trying to keep each other uplifted even
thought we were down and just do the things that we normally do and talk to
each other and talk each other through it.  
  
Q. Obviously you're very emotional. Can you tell us what you're feeling
right now?  
CHYNNA EWING: Well, I feel like we were blessed to have this opportunity, but
I do wish we would have played better against them, and I think that we should
have -- like at the end we played very well, like defensively, and I feel like
we should have did that at the very beginning, and like the game would have
probably came out better.  
  
Q. Breasia, did you feel like the game, the pace of the game, was faster
than you would have expected?  
BREASIA McELRATH: A little faster, but no, I didn't think it was faster than
was to be expected. We've played with fast-paced teams before. It was just
they outscored us. Yeah, that's it. They outscored us.  
  
But we'll be ready next year. It won't be the last time you see Texas
Southern. We took this experience, and we're going to capitalize on it and get
better from it. That's basically it.  
  
Q. This team is young. This was an experience, a learning experience for
everybody involved. What will you all take back, not just playing the game but
all of it, the tournament itself, having your name called and being a part of
your group, being a first?  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Well, since the team is young, basically the key is growth.
We have a lot more learning to do, and this is just the beginning.  
  
CHYNNA EWING: And I feel like since we are young, we're going to learn stuff,
and as we get older, we're going to finally figure it out and figure out what
we need to do as a team in order to take the next step and to keep going and
to just build as a team.  
  
BREASIA McELRATH: For me it was tempo. I liked the passion of the game. I took
the experience on, playing at a high level, and I'm going to do that every
time. I'm going to give my all every time because this is where I want to be
next year, and you will see us next year.  
  
Q. We talked the other day about experience and teaching moments and
learning from your experiences. Just talk about today, not just coming up to
this point but just talk about this game today.  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: This game today was extremely competitive on the end of
Baylor. I want to take my hat off to them.  
  
I told our young ladies in the locker room a moment ago that you've probably
played a Final Four team for sure. Great in size, shoot the ball well, shot
the ball extremely well today. Some of that was us, but a lot of it was them
hitting shots early. They did.  
  
These young ladies have worked hard. They've worked really hard for me and for
our university, and today was about them growing -- they say growing,
experience, building, and we'll keep using those terms as we go in to
postseason play. We're kicking their butt. Remember, you want to grow, you
want to build, you want to get the experience so you can be back here and get
another taste of it in the future. Breasia said it with confidence twice:
We'll be back. And she showed me something different in her eyes with her
vocabulary, with her leadership on the court, whether things are going good or
bad, indifferent with her teammates, she's found a way to keep us in it, keep
us locked in, engaged, from the athlete side. So that was important for us.
That's important for us to have that. So I think that they took some steps
forward. Even in a loss like this, they took some steps forward as a team
today.  
  
Q. You talked the other day about being overwhelmed. It's hard not to
be. Was there a little bit of that, maybe particularly early in the game, of
being overwhelmed by maybe the size or whatever it was?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I'm sure they were. You know, they don't say certain
things, but I could see it in their eyes earlier on, but as the game went,
they realized, okay, I can get deflections here and there, and late in the
game, I saw that. I may have been when the second-string team came in, but I
saw them make some plays here and there defensively. I think the tempo is
different. I disagree with Breasia a little bit. The pace of the game is
definitely faster. In her mind maybe it's not, but it's definitely faster. So
you have to learn how to control tempo, control pace, and I had a hard time
trying to get control it from where I'm standing. I think that's something
we'll take back, being overwhelmed and learning how to stay composed, having
better composure to get attempts and looks and not have the ball come back so
fast in transition or a dunk inside so easy. So definitely a little bit of
them being overwhelmed, but eventually they settled down, and they will move
forward knowing what to expect, the expectation for being in the dance.  
  
Q. As the game was flowing and kind of getting away, what was your
thought process? What was your goal? Was it let's keep it under 100? Let's
keep it -- let's try and close the gap to this? What were you telling the
ladies?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I wanted them to actually take away something
defensively. Whether we scored or not defensively, I wanted us to be better.
Clearly we weren't, but down the stretch I saw us get a few deflections here
and there, which felt like they could do earlier on with some things that they
worked on. If someone is going to beat you, you can't let them beat you the
same way. It was just dumb down, dumb down, dumb down. Like eventually, press
up against her, push her out of bounds, do something. Don't hurt her, but be
more physical, be more aggressive. Use your weight room. So that was some of
the things I talked to them about.  
  
I know Nycolle Smith picked up a foul, and people probably wonder why am I
cheering. I'm cheering because she was trying to do what I asked her to do, to
be a little more physical. If you're a little more physical, maybe it'll wear
her down a little bit more. But as you know, Baylor has about six bigs. They
just run them in and out, so they're all pretty fresh, and they finish well
around the rim and they do their job. But that was my biggest thing. Just
sticking to the game plan and trying to take something away. If you can take
something away, what will it be? Let's take away this pass. Have they beat us
off the dribble from the high post yet? Nope. And I think hit one shot from
the high post late in the game, but they keep dumping inside, so either take
the pass away, or back up and help inside, things of that nature. And again,
we're undersized, so we're playing without Shamiya Brooks, who's been here
twice before today, but all in fairness, Kelena Morris probably played the
most minutes she's played this season today. She averaged maybe 2.1 minutes a
game, if that, Big Mo, and she had to play at least double-digit minutes
today.  
  
So overwhelmed? For a freshman who hasn't been in this situation before, and
the ball is being dunked over and over again? Yeah, a little bit. So they had
to adjust to her, too. Like even with our offensive sets with her being out
there. But again, it was a great time for her to have that because our future
is wrapped around her, so that was important.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Asha Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33253)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Cal - 55, LSU - 52  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: At the risk of sounding cliché, I felt like that was a
survive-and-advance moment for 40 minutes, and we are thrilled to have the
opportunity to play on Monday. It wasn't the prettiest, but I credit LSU for
that. That's what they do. They turn you over. We turned it over 20 times.
That's what they force teams into on average. It's why they were in this
tournament. It's why they won 20 games this year, so credit them.  
  
And while I don't think we were a masterpiece on offense, I could not be more
proud of our players' grittiness and toughness to pull it out when it wasn't
the easiest.  
  
These two young women sitting here, our sophomores, played a ton of minutes
their freshman year and were sitting home at this time, and all they've wanted
is to get this team into postseason and to advance, and for Kristine to have
the second half that she had after not having things be easy in the first half
shows her growth and shows why she's an All-American, and Asha just simply
came out and played 40 minutes, turned the ball over once and knocked down six
threes. Really proud of our team, excited to be playing on Monday, a lot of
credit to LSU, and I had contractions. That's how close the game was. Fun
night all around.  
  
Q. Asha, can you describe how you got open on that three that you hit in
the corner there late, and just how good did that feel going in?  
ASHA THOMAS: They were denying the ball -- Kristine had the ball. They were
pressuring her. They were denying Kayla, and they left me open, and I caught
the ball, knocked it down. I knew I could knock it down like I have before.
That was it.  
  
Q. Asha, just talk about, that's almost a perfect game, when the point
guard only has one turnover and scores as much as you did. Were you in the
athletic zone today?  
ASHA THOMAS: Let's just say I was nervous. This was my first time being in the
NCAA Tournament. I was nervous. You probably couldn't tell because I hide my
emotions. But I just embraced the moment. You know, you never know when you'll
get this chance again, take advantage of it. But like you said, the turnovers,
I hate turning the ball over. Point guard, you don't want to turn over the
ball, and when I just let my nervousness out, just played my game.  
  
Q. Kristine, what did they do that made it so tough for you in the first
half, and how did you pull it together to have that second half, but
particularly playing with four fouls at the end, how did you manage to hit
those free throws, make that big block? How did that happen?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, they had a really good game plan, and I give them a lot
of credit because they're super physical. I just tried to get used to it, so
you're just coming from playing like in a different conference; you have
different refs, different players. Never seen them play before; we never went
against them. Again, I was really nervous. I was like shaking before the game.
I just tried to do whatever I could to win, and I didn't want to go home, and
our whole team didn't want to go home. We just played with that mentality.  
  
Q. Asha, you talked about embracing the moment; is that kind of what was
also going through your head there at the end where there was that scramble
for the ball and you guys got the jump ball?  
ASHA THOMAS: Definitely. I know we had like a time-out left, but I just wanted
to get the ball, really just to get the ball, make sure we secured it, and
that's what happened.  
  
Q. Kristine, you had the block at the end, but it seemed like every time
LSU tried to do something you came up big. You made all seven of your free
throws, which ultimately ended up being huge. Talk about that and playing in
the moment.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, the first half, again, was a struggle for me, and I
wanted to win. I wanted to come here and win, and that's what we did. So the
second half I just tried to focus on other things, rebounding, blocking shots,
playing defense, being there for my team, bringing energy. So I just came with
this whole different mentality. I just wanted to win so bad, so I just tried
to do everything I could. I knew it was going to be tough scoring so I tried
to play really like in defense and talk to my teammates. Asha was hitting all
her shots, like again, you said she had about like a perfect game, and she
works on that shot. We all trust her to make that, so she came up really big
for us this game.  
  
Q. You were talking about being nervous at the beginning of the game,
but at the end you've had a lot of close games this year, and many didn't go
your way. How did that feel at the end and to come out with a win like that?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, again, we're used to -- like you said, we're used to
being in close games. I think we've done a good job closing out, like once the
season -- we're comfortable with each other and we know how to overcome
adversity, like close games, two-point games, three-point games, calling time-
outs, when to foul, who to foul, trying to get us in the perfect situation to
win. So again, we're used to making those big shots at the end, big shots, big
free throws, big defensive stops, so yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, when is the baby due, and will you have some stories to tell
later? You've had some dramatic finishes.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Seriously. The baby is due May 9th. That's what like science
says, but I'm like, whoo, more things like this, he could come any day.  
  
Lots of stories to tell. I mean, this has been such a special season because
of the link between my family stuff and my basketball family. I mean, Teasy
(ph) walked by and touches my belly. I think any time you go through pregnancy
for the first time, it's imagine it's like miraculous and really wonderful,
but to do it with a team, I feel so grateful for that.  
  
Patrick is in the stands over there. He always says when we're on the road,
like, he calls the baby "Point Guard." He says, How are you and Point Guard
doing? What did the girls say to Point Guard today? Just the whole thing is
around this. So it's just extra super special.  
  
Q. You heard what Kristine said about her second half. Talk about that;
she had some big moments in that second half for you guys with the free throws
and the block.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah. I mean, I can't really put it into words how proud of
her I am. Most people would look and say, 15-7 and five blocks in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a good game. We all know for Kristine, it wasn't her best
game all around. But we're with these young people in the locker room every
single day. I know what they struggle with. I know what their fears are. I
know what their strengths are, and to be able to look at her at halftime and
say, we're going into the locker room with the lead and just shake it off and
give us what you can give us. Give me everything in the second half, and to
see her do it was remarkable. On that last play with eight seconds left, I
looked at McKayla Cowling and said, the ball goes into Kristine's hands
because I knew she would get open and I knew she would make the free throws,
and I wouldn't have been able to say that if she was not mentally locked in
because it wasn't the easiest game for her.  
  
She had an incredible freshman and sophomore year, but the growth this year,
being able to handle pressures and adversity and all kinds of defenses, it's
been really something, and I'm looking forward to continuing that. But those
are the moments coaches love, when you just see kids rise to a different
level. Maybe fans and media don't know what they're going through, but I just
think she had a really big-time second half, and that was -- we needed every
minute of it.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Asha's game, her first tournament game, and
all season long and what she provided for you.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Unbelievable. I said to the team in the locker room there,
as a coach you figure out how to say what you need to say to each player. I'm
the most unfiltered with Asha Thomas. I can look at her and say, make a darned
shot, or stop turning it over. There's no filter because she can just -- she's
steady. She can handle anything.  
  
She shot the heck out of the ball in practice yesterday, and I was just kind
of going to the assistants, like Teasy, she's not missing, and so when the
first one went down today, I felt really good about that.  
  
But just similar, we threw her into the fire last year and she faced a lot of
pressure and she made a lot of shots early in the season and not as many late,
and to see her growth and come through in a big-time game, knock down shots,
it's not like she was wide open, it's not like these weren't under duress. I
mean, we got her off some flare screens. She had a quick release on a lot of
them. You don't always see the reverse. Kristine to AT for three, it's usually
AT to Kristine. But really, really big time. You can't win in the postseason
without good guard play, and today she stepped up and knocked down shots and
also didn't turn the ball over. It was pretty impressive.  
  
Q. The conference has changed. You all have done a lot of growth in the
last three to five years, but over the last two, there's no bottom feeders in
the conference anymore. Every game is competitive. What changed?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Well, first of all, I mean, pretty unreal that the PAC-12 is
7-0 in this first round. I'm really proud of all of our teams, and you said it
exactly right. What has changed is that I think schools across the conference
have made a commitment to women's basketball. I think coaches have gone out
and gotten the best players on the West Coast, more so to stay home, and
there's a lot of good players. I think people have gone and recruited great
players from other regions, as well, and people have hired great coaches, and
the players have embraced representing the west and making the PAC-12 great. I
think there's been smart scheduling, but smart scheduling can't do it alone.
You then have to then win those games. But I said it all week with all the
questions we got, there's no bad team in the conference. There's opportunities
for good wins all the time. We had a bunch of losses, but nine of them were to
the RPI top 35 and better. I mean, that's a luxury to be able to play those
teams all the time and face every kind of defense.  
  
I'm really happy to be part of the PAC-12. You know, who knows if a team will
go to the Final Four this year or two, they could, but if not, the depth and
strength, our teams 5 through 12 in our league, had 12 wins against the RPI
top 25 this year, and that's not even talking about the four really, really
super elite teams in the league.  
  
It's been a great to be part of it. There's a lot more losses in my world than
there were a couple years ago, but when we came here four years ago as a 7
seed, we were second in the PAC-12 at 13-5 and nobody else in the league got
in besides us and Stanford, and now we finished seventh in the league, so it's
a really good league, and we certainly wanted to be better, and we hope to get
back to the very top, but we also know we can be seventh in the league, come
in and win tournament games, and I think that speaks to the strength of the
PAC-12 top to bottom.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about playing Baylor next.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Oh, yeah, that. How many points did they have up tonight? I
went back to the locker room. 119? Was it a record? Yeah. So I didn't need to
watch that game to know that they're really good. They're really good. I'm
sitting up there looking at Odyssey and Griner, and we played when I was an
assistant at Cal we played Baylor with Sophia Young, who was -- not even
talking about now, but she was one of their first great All-Americans on the
National Championship team, and this year's team in a lot of ways might be the
most complete. They're huge, and they've got really good guard play to go with
the size. They're a No. 1 seed for a reason. They're a National Championship
contender for a reason, but there will not be a team more excited to play on
Monday night than us.  
  
I've said it the whole time, you can be excited to be here and still have a
focus and try and want to win the game, so we'll give them a game plan. We'll
watch a lot of film between now and then, the coaches, we'll get the players
locked in, and we see it as a great opportunity, but they're a heck of a team.
They have 31 wins now, I think, which is no fluke. They play an incredibly
tough schedule, and we'll have to give it our best shot on Monday night, but I
don't doubt the women in our locker room love a challenge, and that's what
it's going to be.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Alexis Hyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30323)

### [Raigyne Moncrief](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28352)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Cal - 55, LSU - 52  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: These two young ladies sitting up here, I can't express enough
how important they are to the success of the LSU program. Obviously we're
going to have Raigyne Moncrief next year, but Alexis Hyder is one of the
toughest, undersized, versatile post players in the game, and I'm proud to be
her coach, along with the exceptional player in Rina Hill, our other senior,
who is one of the hardest working players I've ever coached and been around.
Jasmine Rhodes, who's our other senior, who will be missed, with her
versatility to play the 4. We're an undersized team but a team with a big
heart, and I can't say enough about giving Cal the credit. They did what they
needed to do. I thought Thomas had an unbelievable night from the three-point
line, and we missed some of our defensive coverages, but the fight that we had
in us to really get them turned over 20 plus times, our ability to make stops
against a team that was taller than us, I commend our team for having the
heart and the fight.  
  
It's been a journey for us. A lot of ups and downs, but this group has been
pretty special. For us to turn the program around where we were last year and
to see them a year later, that's improvement, and we're going to build off of
that.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you just describe what you saw on that last play?  
ALEXIS HYDER: Which last play?  
  
Q. The lay-up that got blocked.  
ALEXIS HYDER: I saw the lane, and I wanted to make contact, which I thought I
did. It just didn't go our way. I wanted to get her in the air, and I thought
it was a good drive. There's things I thought I could have done differently,
but I was just trying to take the best shot for the team.  
  
Q. Alexis, how were you so effective against Kristine Anigwe?  
ALEXIS HYDER: I understand that I'm undersized, and I take advantage of that.
I understand that many 6'5" people do not want to guard around the perimeter.
They don't want to guard pick-and-pops, they don't want to guard off the
dribble, so taking advantage of that opened up the court, and that's why Ayana
Mitchell was great down the stretch and that's why Chloe and Rai were easily
getting to the lane, because we opened up the floor.  
  
Q. Raigyne, you and Chloe both kind of started off a little slow, and
then you stepped up. Kind of talk about that difference in the second half.  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: We got a lot of talk from the coaches and motivation from
our teammates, and they were just saying that we've been doing this all year,
and just play our game and relax, and I think we just came up there, we
started the game kind of really off, and we just started knocking down shots
and making plays, especially Chloe Jackson.  
  
Q. Was it something Cal was doing to start the game that threw you guys
off, or was it something for yourselves that threw you off?  
ALEXIS HYDER: I mean, like Coach said, they were a good team and came out
playing hard, but I think we could have came out better offensively, and our
shots weren't falling. They were just hot. Our shots weren't falling, their
shots were falling, and things didn't go our way. I don't think that it was
anything specific. We were getting the looks we've been getting all year, and
it just didn't go our way. The same screens we've been setting all year, we
got them, the same flares, we got all the screens and everything we wanted to
get the looks, we just couldn't knock them down early.  
  
Q. Coach, which home game and which road game that you saw that you all
won or lost that you saw coming down the stretch the team was growing and they
were headed in the right direction?  
NIKKI FARGAS: In our last game against Mississippi State in the SEC
tournament, I thought our team battled a very good basketball team, obviously
someone who's a No. 2 seed, potentially could have been a No. 1 seed, and I
thought we played extremely hard for about 36 minutes. The first time that we
played Mississippi State in January, they beat us pretty good, and to see the
improvement that we made in that short period of time, I felt really good
about our chances going into NCAA Tournament play.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of talked about those turnovers, and I know that was
the game plan going into this, to kind of negate their size advantage. Is
tonight what you had in mind there?  
NIKKI FARGAS: From a turnover standpoint, it definitely played to our favor to
turn them over 20 plus times. We didn't always convert like we had been in the
past off of those turnovers. I thought our offensive board play allowed us to
get some second and third looks, but again, late game, down the stretch, we've
got to make plays, and we can't -- things that we're going to get nailed out.
Every place that we missed, an and-one opportunity, we've got to go try to
score the ball, and I think this group is very well aware that they've got to
make their own breaks, and I think those are life lessons for them, that
you're going to have to make them in life, as well, when you leave here. It's
a 40-minute game, and the beginning of the game, I know you mentioned that, I
thought we missed our defensive coverage. Again, I'm going to highlight Thomas
for Cal. I thought she was huge in the play action.  
  
We had a lot of good looks. Moncrief -- if you would have told me Moncrief and
Jackson were going to go 0 for 13 in the first half, they hadn't done that all
season, and so that's just part of it, and the fight that they had, though, in
the second half, I'm really proud of this group.  
  
Q. What particular adjustments did you make at halftime going into the
second half?  
NIKKI FARGAS: We tried to extend our defense a little bit more, tried to
disrupt them in the backcourt, thought our pressure took some time off the
clock and delayed and disrupted them. I thought from a half-court defensive
standpoint, we really tried to apply more ball pressure and tried to disrupt
the ball handler so the ball couldn't see inside. We knew their size was going
to be an issue, so it's something that we've had to battle all year. But
moving forward, we've got size coming in, so hopefully we can still play that
sustained, aggressive style of play but have the size to combat the inside
play of some of the teams that we faced that were bigger than we were.  
  
Q. In that same vein, talking about next year, what is the next step for
this team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: You know, it's tough right now because you've got three seniors
that mean the world to me personally. I can't say enough about those three,
having had to just endure last year having six players and those three being
the three returning. You just want to keep playing basketball for them.  
  
But next year, the future of the LSU program is very good. We've got a great
class coming in. We return some experience. We also signed a young lady with
size, Raven Farley. We missed Faustine Aifuwa, our 6'5" kid. I think she
really would have made a difference had she not been out this season with a
knee injury. We'll get her back. So along with some really good guards, we are
going to still be athletic and quick on the perimeter, but we're going to be
bigger.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

### [Nina Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26576)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Alexis, how are you feeling, and how much are you looking forward to
getting back on the court?  
ALEXIS JONES: I'm feeling a lot better, and I'm excited to get back out there
on the court. It's me, Nina, it's KK and Prince's last go-around, and I'm just
happy and blessed that I'm able to come back and play again.  
  
Q. Alexis, what have you seen from Joyce Kennerson, and what's key to
slowing her down?  
ALEXIS JONES: The key is stopping her in transition, staying in front of her,
not letting her blow past us, and not get easy lay-ups to the rim.  
  
Q. Nina, every year you've gotten to play home games in the NCAA
Tournament. I know this never gets old for you guys, but talk about how
different it is for you this year.  
NINA DAVIS: I don't know if it's really different. I guess the only difference
is just knowing in the back of my mind that it's the last go-around. It's my
last two games in the Ferrell Center to play in front of these fans that have
been amazing the four years I've been here, so we just want to go out here and
play hard and get these two wins in front of them because we owe a lot of
credit to them. They travel all across the country, and they support us
whatever we do.  
  
Q. Alexis, obviously she says she feels good. Just talk about the
confidence you have that everything is good with her, and how your team has
responded without her in this last month or so.  
KIM MULKEY: We only lost one game without her, and I'm not sure if she was
playing we would have won that game anyway. West Virginia was just that good
that weekend. Alexis's knees have always been a problem for her. I haven't
noticed in the days that she's practiced since being cleared that she's any
different than she was before other than maybe a few more turnovers in
practice where she's hanging on the ball too long trying to make a spectacular
pass. But conditioning-wise, I think she's about the same. Shooting, she
looked to shoot the ball really good. I'm just happy she's back. I'm happy for
her personally, and she makes us even better.  
  
Q. What do you see on the defensive end with Texas Southern? I believe
they're top 30 in field goal percentage defense.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we're pretty good with our defense, as well. I don't know
where we are today. We've led the country a long time in field goal percentage
defense. Everybody is good when you reach the NCAA Tournament, and is this
their first trip, I think, so they're extremely excited. I would be. I
remember our first trip, and I anticipate it'll be a game where we will be
much bigger. We're much bigger than a lot of teams. But that also can create
problems because I'm sure they'll spread the floor on us, and our post will
have to guard smaller players. They like to run. Kennerson and I think it's
Palmer shoot a lot of threes. We see that a lot in our league, so we'll be
prepared. I hope we're as excited as they are because it doesn't get old.
We're very blessed at Baylor that women's basketball is a priority.  
  
Q. How much do you think Alexis is going to play? Will it be back to the
normal amount that she would have played before?  
KIM MULKEY: I would think so.  
  
Q. Will you work her in a little bit?  
KIM MULKEY: The game will dictate that. I would expect her to be good to go.
I'm not sure I'll start her, but she's good to go. There is no limits on how
many minutes. I think that will just be the flow of the game. She'll play both
point guard and 2, which helps Kristy, relieve Kristy some when she gets
tired. But she's good to go.  
  
Q. Playing at home, your first two games have kind of become a routine
around here, but I know it's something you guys don't ever take for granted,
but talk about how your teaming approaches that and how they've taken care of
business, and it sounds like you don't have to tell them anything different
about, hey, this is something more than just a regular game.  
KIM MULKEY: You don't have to tell them that. I'm assuming they understand
that it is a privilege to be selected to host the first and second round, but
that privilege came from what you did all year. They don't just give it to
you. I think it's also a blessing that Nina said it: We're in a part of the
country where women's basketball is valued, and people on fixed incomes,
people who have money, they make sure that they support these players, and it
does matter in women's basketball. Just I've always said, it does us no good
to put these things in arenas where TV shows no one in the stands, and I was
all for going back to first and second round games on the home courts.  
  
We're just really blessed that our fans support us, and we've been able to
continue recruiting good players to come here.  
  
Q. I know Kristy Wallace is your energizer bunny; she played a ton of
minutes in the Big 12 tournament. How much does it help she won't have to do
that going forward in the NCAA Tournament necessarily?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't think that it helps Kristy. Kristy could play all day. She
just has the body composition and makeup to where she never tires, and usually
the first place you see it in a guard if they get fatigued is the legs, their
shots start falling short. She's been on a roll hitting mid-range jumpers. It
doesn't probably affect her. Maybe me a little bit. It may be that you think
she needs a rest, but she really doesn't. She could play 40 minutes every
night.  
  
Q. Kim, obviously it's the first time in a long time you guys are going
to the NCAA Tournament coming off a loss. What did you want to see in your
team and how they respond?  
KIM MULKEY: I want to see them start out faster than they did against West
Virginia with a little more -- I've always believed that your teams take on
the personality of the coach, and to put it simple, I'm fiery. I'm passionate.
I pump my fist, and I want them to do that coming out of the gates, and I
didn't think we did that in the last game until the fourth quarter.  
  
Well, we've got to do it in the first quarter, so that's what I'd like to see
is them put four quarters together, and they've done that for the most part. I
mean, my gosh, we're 30-3. Look who we've lost to. But it would be fun to
watch them try to do every game these four, six, whatever we get to play, and
see how good we really are.  
  
Q. You're obviously no stranger to LSU; what's it like to kind of get to
host that program this week.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's interesting because Kramer playing there, I just left
there last weekend, and I saw Nikki Fargas in the head coaches' meeting, and I
was looking for my son, and I said, y'all didn't bring him?  
  
Growing up 30 minutes from LSU, I visited there as a player and then chose to
go to Louisiana Tech, which was four and a half hours north. All I ever knew
was LSU and Tulane. But I chose for basketball reasons at the time in the
early '80s, Louisiana Tech was the powerhouse, and yet who would have thought
many, many years later my child would be going to LSU seven hours away. But
it's been a blessing for him.  
  
I'm always going to be a Louisiana girl. I've told people that from day one,
and I don't care where I am, I'm Louisiana, and I always want to see Louisiana
schools do good.  
  
And because Kramer is there now, you have more of an interest because of being
around the school more watching him play and being in the stands than I did
when I was a player because I never went to Baton Rouge, I was always in north
Louisiana. I want to see him do good. If we meet Monday, I don't want to see
them do good.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Johnetta Hayes-Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33158)

### [Nycolle Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33159)

### [Joyce Kennerson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33160)

### [Chynna Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33161)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Nycolle, obviously excitement about getting Texas Southern to an NCAA
Tournament, but talk about that and then having to come here and play Baylor
when you're looking around at everything going on around here.  
NYCOLLE SMITH: First off, I just want to say this is a great opportunity for
all of us. I think this is a place where we all strive to be. We've all wanted
to be here. I know I wanted to be here my entire life, and just coming to
Baylor, like I said, it's just a blessing. I'm taking it all in, embracing it
all, and just want to have fun.  
  
CHYNNA EWING: Like she said, it's a blessing, and I just feel like this is a
reward for the whole season, and to actually be here is a very good
opportunity for us, and I just feel like we've got to keep on working and more
will come.  
  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Like my teammate said, this is a very good opportunity for us
to showcase our talent against a great team.  
  
Q. Nycolle, do you have to put blinders on when it comes time because
clearly we're in this room and you see everything that Baylor has done and you
know their history, that they routinely play games here in the NCAA
Tournament, something that's not new to them while it's new to you guys.  
NYCOLLE SMITH: I believe whenever you step into -- we're obviously a team that
hasn't made it to the NCAA, and it is our first time. I believe we just have
to take it as if it's another team. The only thing that's different is just
the name. We come in and we know personnel, and we're going to come out and
we're going to execute to our best abilities.  
  
Q. Obviously the girls are excited to be here, and this is kind of a
culmination of what you guys have tried to do this season. Talk about how
they're handling it and this opportunity for them, and it seems like they've
obviously got the right mindset coming into it.  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: These ladies have been very fortunate this year. Our
team has, our university, to have this opportunity. I think they're taking it
in stride. I received many phone calls about their temperament, how they're
doing. It's like another game for them, and they're saying it, but they truly
mean it, this team plays fearless. Small, not big in numbers, but fearless all
the time, whether they're down or up, no matter who we're playing.  
  
So I'm excited for our university. I'm excited for our young ladies. I think
this is definitely another stepping stone for our team. They've made history.
They've done some great things this year.  
  
And the question that you asked was how do you feel walking in here and see
all this to the young ladies. You know, it can be overwhelming. I'm not sure
if they will say that, but it can be overwhelming. It's overwhelming, and it's
a great honor for them to be here, to have the opportunity to play a Baylor
team. We had a few teams in our conference play them this year, as well, but
to be here in the moment now is what we are looking forward for, getting on
the court tomorrow.  
  
Q. What challenges do these Baylor bigs present defensively?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: You know, Baylor is a very sound team. We know
offensively they're the second leading team in the country scoring-wise, but
defensively they're big. They have great size. They're long on the wings.
They're aggressive on the ball. They're big inside with Brown and a few
others. So we're definitely going to have to try to stretch the floor out a
little bit, play a little wider than we usually play, but at this point we are
who we are. We can't go in and like recreate the wheel at this point.  
  
We're just going to go in and play hard and stick to our game plan. I've told
them all year, no matter who they're playing, whatever game plan we put
together, you go with that game plan and you do everything you can; whatever
adjustment we made to make, we'll make. I don't care who it is in conference
we're playing, but they do, they respect all their opponents, they always
have, whether it's any team, up to this team that we're playing now. I think
they will definitely respect the fact that they're here and they're playing
against them.  
  
You never overlook anybody on either side of the ball, but defensively we're
going to definitely see a team that's going to rebound the ball defensively,
push it quick at us offensively, but we're going to have to be able to make
shots and not drive to the hole as much as we usually would, share the ball a
little bit more, have more assists in this game to have an opportunity against
that Baylor defense.  
  
Q. You mentioned clearly this team making some history for the school by
getting to this point. What is it about this team you think that's --
obviously you won the SWAC tournament to get the bid, but what is it about
this team you think that's made it special for you?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: This team is family. That's the biggest thing. I wanted
these young ladies to get here because they are a young group. We have one
senior. We were led by one senior who wasn't on this stage today, she's about
6'4", Shamiya Brooks. She's been to this dance now for the third time. She did
it twice with Prairie View A&M University and now she's here to do it with
Texas Southern University. So they're young. We're led by a sophomore point
guard who averages 20 points a game. Chynna Ewing is a freshman sitting here,
so hopefully four years from now she can look back and say, my freshman year
this is what we did. I didn't have a lot of words up here. And then year two,
year three, year four, look where I am now.  
  
It is a great family environment. It is extremely big for our university
because they are young and impressionable, and they're, again, taking it all
in. But I wanted these young ladies to have this moment because they are the
most family-knit team I've had in four years of being at Texas Southern
University.  
  
Q. What's it like going from the SWAC where you're one of the biggest
teams in the conference to now having players kind of tower over you like
you're going to see tomorrow?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I don't know yet. But whatever the challenges are, we'll
definitely make adjustments quickly if we have to. I don't think they see what
I see. They see another team. I see 6'6". I see 6'5". And as a player, I've
played against it, but I also stand 6'4". For my 5'2" \-- well, she's really
5'5", I'll give her 5'5" point guard, I don't think that she's going to make
an adjustment early. I think she's just going to play her game the way she
knows how and then see what happens.  
  
I don't ever want them to change what they're doing. I think they should
challenge everyone they play, challenge them. You never know, you may get to
the free-throw line. That's what we're hoping. We're hoping that we put
ourselves in position to slow the ball down, make some free throws here and
there.  
  
But I'm excited for them to see teams that are bigger than them so they can
know the flow of a game, what adjustments need to be made offensively to get
the opportunities we need to be on the board, to score big buckets here and
there and to make plays. I think it's a game of plays, and a team of 64,
that's what it's about, so we're excited. I'm excited for them to see it
finally and to coach it.  
  
Q. You mentioned the young team, and this being a young team, and you
obviously have a lot of them back next year. What is it you want them to get
out of this experience that will kind of set a foundation to keep moving
forward and keep moving the bar up for Texas Southern?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I think this sets the precedent for our future, for
sure, as far as recruiting but also for our players that are returning. Again,
we'll return everybody but one player going into next year. I want them to
enjoy the experience but learn from the experience, to have some growth, so
they can see how hard they have to work, you know, to get a piece of the big
dance every year, how hard you have to work to get here and to win here.  
  
You know, again, I respect all the teams that are in the tournament, and I
know they've all done a good job, but now they know they're getting a piece of
it to understand moving forward how much harder they're going to need to work.  
  
I expressed to them, I said, once we get past this, the hardest thing is to
come, which is postseason workouts because now what do we need to do to be
better to get here again, have an opportunity to get a piece of it, to win, to
really, truly feel good walking in the doors. I think they feel great right
now walking in, and they're going to feel great walking out winners,
hopefully, but the biggest thing is them having some carryover moving forward,
and that's what it's about. You know, and it's a great part of our daily is to
know that they are young and they'll get a chance to see it again and again
for a few years.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Mikayla Cowling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30340)

### [Courtney Range](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30430)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. I just want to ask the players, is there a sense of feeling fortunate
to be here because a lot of people wondered if you would, and because of that,
do you guys feel like you have something you want to prove, hey, we do deserve
to be here?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Well, I mean, first off, we're very grateful that we're in the
tournament, and any team would have wanted to have been there. Now that we are
and we are a 9 seed, we want to just come out and do the best that we can
starting tomorrow night.  
  
MIKAYLA COWLING: I agree.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Ditto.  
  
Q. Kristine, the height disparity with you and LSU is kind of going to
be on focus tomorrow night. Just what have you seen out of LSU and what are
you expecting from them in that regard?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, they're definitely going to compete. No one just wants
to go home. They want to stay here for as long as they can, so we're just
getting ready for them to compete and bring all they can, and we're just going
to try to do whatever we can to win.  
  
Q. Kristine, where have you seen the most improvement in your game
throughout the season?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Finishing, I guess, and just like relying on my teammates
more and knowing that like trust, so we all trust each other more, so I feel
like that's what really helped us become like a better team.  
  
Q. Courtney, you were part of the team that was here in Waco --  
COURTNEY RANGE: Yes.  
  
Q. What's different about this team than the team that was here, and how
is Cal different or the same since the last time we've seen you guys in
Waco?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Well, I mean, my freshman year we had Brittany Boyd and
Reshonda Gray. Those two together are like a good dynamic -- sorry. But this
year, since we're still a young team, yeah, we have every class, but like
personally, I feel like this team this year and from last year, because we had
all returners, we're a stronger team. Like Kristine said, we trust each other
more. We're relying on all 11 players that are playing each game, and to know
that we have each other's back, we know that we can go far, and like she said,
the trust thing is a big thing with our team, and yeah.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you kind of the same question I asked them. The
fortunate part, a lot of people were surprised in a way that you guys got in,
but talk about what they said and what you want to see from your girls now
that you are in and you've got a chance to prove, hey, we do deserve to be
here?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, to be honest, I walked in, I saw you sitting there,
and it was total déjà-vu from four years ago; I said, I remember Steven.  
  
We are very excited to be here, and kind of like Courtney said, I would
imagine all 64 teams are, and if there ever comes a point where I'm not, no
matter which team we are, then I shouldn't be sitting here. I think this is
the best time of year, and so I think our team can have a gratefulness and an
excitement to be here, and yet still a willingness to compete and to want to
win the game.  
  
You know, I don't think we need to prove that we belong in the tournament, but
we want to win the game. The interesting thing is when you're on the bubble,
it's a unique feeling. That said, if you looked at the numbers and you really
took what the committee said they were looking at, our 30-game résumé compared
very favorably with the other teams. I know people want to focus on our
conference record and all that kind of stuff, but I think our players are
always hungry to prove that they're good. I think they're always hungry to
prove that we can compete, and if there's extra motivation to do that, sure,
we'll use that. But the excitement to be in it, why not?  
  
Q. LSU isn't a team with a lot of size inside, but they're also not a
team that from the perimeter shoots a lot of threes or anything like that.
What do you kind of see their identity as?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think that Nikki and her staff have done an incredible job
of maximizing their strengths, which is the ability to turn you over. I mean,
you don't win eight games in the SEC and 20 games overall or whatever they won
with a little bit of a lack of size if you're not doing something to disrupt
the other team, and they're terrific at turning you over, flustering the
guards, not letting you get the ball to interior players, changing up
defenses, but really relying on that end of the floor, and then they create
match-up problems. At one point they shifted the lineup and they've gone
smaller, and I think that that was in a lot of ways useful for them because it
just creates match-up problems all over the floor.  
  
Q. How have you seen Kristine's game grow this season, and has it
surprised you or did you expect that to come?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think her college career thus far has been remarkable, and
so to sort of start out as strongly as she did the beginning of her freshman
year and still grow and improve is pretty impressive. You know, there was no
sophomore slump, so to speak. In fact, she's drawn more attention -- I think
her biggest growth has been in her ability to handle all situations, to be
able to take a loss or a difficult defense against her and turn that into a
positive outcome the next time-out. I think she's a better passer than she was
last year. I think she's a more efficient player than she was last year. She's
extended her range a little bit. You know, I think her rebounding numbers are
up a little bit.  
  
But mostly it's in the things we see in the locker room, the ability to
embrace this idea of being a leader and being a go-to player. I think as a
freshman you're just a talented freshman and you're kind of winging it with
your talent, and now she has an understanding of I want to get this team to
the next level and what do I have to do to do that. In all the ways that comes
with that, I think she's embraced that role.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I think each time your team has made the tournament, you
guys have won a first-round game, and you've got girls that have experienced
that. What is the key to winning a first-round game and to keep streaks like
that going?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Right. I mean, it's always about the scout and the match-up.
I think I have an excellent coaching staff, who the second that the bracket is
revealed after we got ourselves together and stopped jumping up and down, we
were watching film. I think it's the ability to turn around to scout very
quickly. I think the Pac-12 prepares you to face any type of competition.
You're always going to face someone good in the first round because it's the
NCAA Tournament. And then I think it's mindset. You have to be kind of players
refreshed and ready to go, and I think we try to give them the scout, put them
in the right mentality, and then we've got competitors out there who don't
want to go home, and they want to stay in this thing as long as we can. Maybe
that's the formula for success, but really it's a different thing each year
with each team.  
  
Q. LSU not playing in the tournament last year, is that something y'all
can use to your advantage, kind of an experience factor against them?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Well, we weren't, either. So I think it's a neat match-up in
that I think both teams were really, really hungry to get back to the level
that their programs expect. You know, the last time we faced LSU was in the
Sweet 16 up in Spokane, Washington, and I don't think there's players from
either team who have done that.  
  
So I think that all we're trying to do, like Kristine and Courtney and Kayla
said, is embrace the moment and be excited to be here because we weren't last
year, and at the same time, be competitive and hungry to win the game. I
imagine LSU is similar in that sense, but it's going to be, to me, a great
match-up. You couldn't have maybe two more evenly matched teams, different
styles but evenly matched in a lot of ways, and just really looking forward to
what our team can do on Saturday night.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. After sitting out last year, what's it like being here at Baylor and
being involved in this tournament again?  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: It's an amazing experience. We fell short last year, so just
to be here, just a blessing and a great opportunity to showcase your skills
and just a bigger stage.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: It's a blessing. Like she said, it's a bigger stage, so just
come out and play hard.  
  
ALEXIS HYDER: It's an amazing feeling to be rewarded for all the work that
we've put in. Falling short last year hurt us, and we were determined to make
it this year.  
  
Q. Kind of as the team's deep threat, how do you feel about this team
not shooting a ton of threes but that kind of being on your shoulders when you
need it?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I mean, I don't know. I mean, if it's there, just try and knock
it down, but I mean, if it's the pull-up or it's us taking it into the basket,
then that's what we're going to try and do.  
  
Q. Alexis, when you guys look at Cal, what do you see? They're a team
that some people were surprised they got in the NCAA Tournament because they
did struggle down the stretch, but what have you seen from them on film?  
ALEXIS HYDER: We saw that they have an inside presence and that we being
shorter, we're going to have to match their physicality and play defense as a
whole, not leaving anybody out by theirselves. We're going to play a strong
five defense against Cal and get out and run in transition.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question I asked Alexis. When you look at Cal,
clearly some people say, hey, what are they doing there, but what have you
seen of them, and similarly, you don't have to convince your players of that,
that they're a good team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, you know, I think the one thing you've got to see in Cal
is the leadership of Coach Gottlieb. She's done a fantastic job of maintaining
a competitive spirit, nature, culture at Cal, and although their conference
record isn't as strong as I'm sure she would like to have been as far as win-
loss column, the games that they've played in and the ones that they fell
short, they were in those games. They're a team that constantly has an
unbelievable post player inside, and that's something that we've kind of had
to address in the SEC play with all the bigs from Mercedes Russell to A'ja
Wilson. Just so many greats that we've had to compete against. So that
obviously has been an emphasis on the defensive end. But their guard play is
strong, as well. You've got young ladies that can shoot the three. You've got
kids that can play off the bounce. They've got a balanced attack. We're going
to have to really dial our defense up to another level, especially when you
get to NCAA play, and I think that's what Hyder was alluding to is that we've
got to play it like a unit, and once we establish that defensive stops, then
we want to transition and run the basketball. But they're, again, a balanced
team and well-coached.  
  
Q. Coach, you haven't seen a lot of PAC-12 teams since you've come over
to LSU. Is it a little fun for you to get to go back to your roots a little
bit and play another California team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, my roots are SEC, but my first head coaching job was in
the Pac-10, now in the Pac-12, and so I have a great respect. I think you've
got a conference that has grown, and I've seen it grow over the past six
years. Although I've been away, I still watch. It's a conference that Stanford
with Vanderveer has always kind of dominated, and just to see other schools --
I had a chance to coach plumb, so to see what she's doing with USA Basketball,
so I keep a close eye on certain players that I've coached with USA
Basketball, so I've been watching the Pac-12. I like the fact, though, that we
are familiar with the style of play, but these guys aren't. They haven't
played a Pac-12 team, and I think this is another opportunity for them to have
a great experience, and we talked about that. Last year we were not here, and
for them to really take ownership of what happened last year with the injuries
and then have that focus to make sure that we were in NCAA play, I commend
these young ladies for doing that.  
  
Q. On the format of the NCAA, since we've gone back to these home
courts, what's it like? I know you're not playing Baylor, but you come into
this arena and this practice court, and as much black curtains as there are
there's still remnants of all the success Baylor has had. Do you like the way
this format is set and is it fair and is it a good thing for the NCAA to do?  
NIKKI FARGAS: I like the format. I like the fact that you're rewarding the
body of work that teams have done throughout the entire season. I think that's
something to give your team to strive for is to be in that 1 through 16, and
you then get to move on, but it gives you a chance for you to travel and get
on the road. For us it's an opportunity to play in front of a hostile
environment, if you will, especially if we continue on and win Saturday, then
you know Monday is going to be packed in here. And these are all experiences
that can help even the returning players to take with them for next season.  
  
So everything that you go through in life, and I tell our kids this all the
time, is to help make you better and stronger, and I think that's something
that playing on the road, again, recognize the people who have done a great
job.  
  
Q. I know everything is forward right now and looking to tomorrow, but
kind of looking back a little bit on this season after the disappointment last
year, what do you think of this team and the year in general getting to this
point?  
NIKKI FARGAS: We were definitely just stunned, if you will, coming out of last
season into this year. The season of last year really took a lot out of our
kids emotionally, physically, playing six players. So this past summer you
really had to be careful in giving them that quality time off, and then we're
dialing it back up again. You can't scout. You can't prepare. You can't
overlook injuries. It's just something that's part of the game more and more.
We've got two young ladies that basically had season-ending injuries again
this year. We're missing our leading scorer in Jenna Deemer. When you talk
about the three-point shot, she was someone that gave us that. And then we're
missing 6'5" Faustine Aifuwa, one of my freshmen who potentially could have
been a starter this year, so that gives you that size that we alluded to.  
  
So I look at this team and they've been resilient. They've been very grateful
that it's not six now, it's 10, it's 11. They appreciate the fact that they've
got a sub. And so the people who do sub, get to sub in, they appreciate that,
too, so there's just a different appreciation that I feel with this group, not
that they didn't before.  
  
This season has been a tough one for us in the sense of our non-conference
schedule. Played some really good opponents, played UConn, NC State, K-State,
so just really did a nice job in non-conference play. When you get in the SEC
you can look at the win-loss columns, but every game is a game. It is.  
  
Again, we can't say enough, because I told them, I said, last year I had them
fill out the bracket with -- we knew we didn't have a chance of getting our
name called, but they needed to know what that felt like. When they did that,
I think it sent a message to them throughout the entire summer that we wanted
to have our name called and have an opportunity to play and be in the hunt, if
you will, for a championship.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 67, Mississippi State - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll take a comment from Dawn, then questions for A'ja.  
  
COACH STALEY: Just want to give God the glory for allowing this to happen.
Really proud of our team, but also I want to make sure that we recognize the
Mississippi State Bulldogs for competing, for representing our conference
positively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for A'ja.  
  
Q. A'ja, I want to thank you for delivering your promised dance with the
band. What does it mean to help get your coach, who you've known forever, a
South Carolina native, her first national championship?  
A'JA WILSON: I really can't even put into words the feeling of how much it
meant to win this game for Coach. She's put in so much time, so much sweat,
just voiced her voice into us. Just prepping for times like this.  
  
I think she really helped our confidence, to get over this hump that we were
going through with adversity, stuff like that. It really means something
special to kind of bring this back home, especially for such a great person
like Coach Staley.  
  
Q. A'ja, the stretch at the end of the game, maybe when it got tight,
you had kind of a burst, a couple of big blocks, some points, was that a
mindset change for you, you were going to deliver this down the stretch? When
Alaina went out, what kind of conversation did you have with Coach Staley?  
COACH STALEY: The first question, honestly I just kind of knew I needed to
make an impact on the game. That's my biggest thing when I play, when I
compete, is how can I make my impact. That was just my mindset going in, is I
have to make an impact, whether it's a block, a score, yelling, bringing
energy. I have to make an impact one way.  
  
When Lai went down, it was tough. It was tough. Loosing a piece like Lai was
really tough. I think Coach just kind of said, We have to play through it.
We've all been hit with adversity, we have to work through it, play through
it. That's when I knew I had to step up and be more vocal to our newcomers,
just to the team.  
  
Q. A'ja, can you talk about first just your mindset to dominate tonight,
then it seemed like you guys as a team were in attack mode from the start.
Just talk about those two things.  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, I just kind of play my game and just stick within myself,
play my role, whether it's being dominant, being a good teammate. I try to
stay within my role and helping out my teammate as much as I can.  
  
I can't remember your second question.  
  
COACH STALEY: Welcome to my world (laughter).  
  
A'JA WILSON: That was just a timeout just now.  
  
That's our season, attacking in paint, paint dominance. We kept doing that,
and got the win.  
  
Q. A'ja, at the end of the game, you were very emotional as the clock
was ticking down. It took you a few seconds to go out on the floor and
celebrate. Can you talk about where all that emotion came from, what you were
thinking at that time.  
A'JA WILSON: Well, in October I lost my grandmother. I really kind of
dedicated this season to her. It was a very emotional time for me. My
teammates really rallied around me, helped me become a better person, a great
player. Just to have -- for us to face adversity like we did, for us to
overcome it, the doubters we had, just shake them off, honestly get this
national championship, hanging up a banner, getting this ring, it really meant
a lot to me.  
  
This team is just so special. I can't really put into words and explain to you
how special this team really is, on and off the court.  
  
For us to really just see smiling faces, just positive vibes, it really set me
into tears. I really couldn't hold them back.  
  
I mean, yeah, that was it.  
  
Q. A'ja, you've spoken about, and your game bears it out, you let the
game come to you, you do not force things. I'm wondering how in the moment you
go about making that happen. How hard it is, are there little things you tell
yourself? Even after Alaina was gone, how did you manage to let the game come
to you?  
A'JA WILSON: I just honestly think that's a pride thing, within myself, that I
just kind of say, You just got to take it all in stride, don't force stuff.
You got to trust your teammates in that way. I trust my teammates a lot. I
know the guards are going to hit shots, I know my other post players are going
to work and dive in when I need them to. It really comes from trust, letting
the game come to you. I can't put it into any other words.  
  
It was tough losing Lai. At the same time I have to step up in different ways.
I can't foul as much as I would or if I could. I can't do certain things. So I
think that really helped my game out, just playing smarter.  
  
Q. I saw you had a lot of success picking away at Mississippi State's
defense. What did you do to throw them off their game early?  
A'JA WILSON: Honestly I don't know. I think we just kind of took our time. We
really took our time with plays, really read the defense, see how they were
playing us. They were denying our wings. It was hard to get the ball in.  
  
I think we really found a way of just attacking the paint and getting it
inside.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, A'ja.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Dawn.  
  
Q. Dawn, you're only the second African-American women's coach to win a
title. Do you think, as what happened with John Thompson, that athletic
directors will now being more receptive hiring African-American women to coach
teams?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I don't know what athletic directors will think about. I
know that I'm not one that looks at race. Basketball has been faceless and
colorless and genderless. When I approached it, I grew up in a city which guys
allowed me to play and hone my skills as a basketball player.  
  
I think athletic directors need to hire what's best for them. If it's an
African-American male or female, then that's what they should hire. If it's
somebody else who they feel can take their program to the next level, it has
to be the best fit for them, not necessarily color-based.  
  
Q. Is that net ever going to come away from you, since you finally got
one? What does it mean to you, to have been to the Final Four a few times as a
player, to finally get the title?  
COACH STALEY: It means that, you know, I can check off one of the things that
has been a void in my career. It's one of two, you know, opportunities that I
saw women play when I was younger. National championship games and Olympics.
Those were the things that I held dear and near to me when I was growing up,
because those are the things that I wanted. That's what I saw. That's what I
was shooting for.  
  
When I couldn't get it done in college, I thought that was it. I never wanted
to be a coach. I never wanted to, you know, be sitting where I'm sitting. Dave
O'Brien, the late Dave O'Brien, the athletic director at Temple University,
saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. He asked me to come and be a
part of changing the program at Temple.  
  
From then on, I really can't see myself doing anything other than what I'm
doing, impacting the lives of young people, and also being able to check this
box off in my career. I'm really grateful and thankful that he made this
possible.  
  
Q. Dawn, with the trophy, it took you so long to get it, how long will
you hold it? How long will it be till you let your players take a turn with
it?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I'm going to enjoy it. It's something that I've been
coaching for 17 years now. I played college basketball, what, 25 to 28 years
ago. It took that long.  
  
But I also want people to know that just because something takes a long time,
I mean, you have to have patience, you have to persevere, stay with it. If
something is a goal of yours to accomplish, you don't give up on it.  
  
I never gave up on winning a national championship, no matter how hard it was,
no matter what it looked like. I'm just so happy that I get a chance to share
it with so many different people in my coaching, basketball family tree.
Coaches, former players, mentors, everybody, everybody.  
  
I do have to give a shout out, the other African-American woman that won a
national championship is Carolyn Peck. Carolyn Peck, a few years ago, when she
was commentating, she gave me a piece of her net, her national championship
net. She told me to keep it. I've had it in my wallet for years.  
  
She said, When you win your national championship, just return it.  
  
I'm going to have to pass a piece of my net on to somebody else so they can
share and hopefully accomplish something as big as this. I do have to give a
shout out to Carolyn Peck, and I will return her net, thankfully.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you convinced A'ja Wilson to come close to home and try to
accomplish this with you, how did you frame that for her? Did you promise her
this was going to happen? Did you think she could help you deliver it? What is
your satisfaction that a South Carolina kid helped deliver a title?  
COACH STALEY: With A'ja, no, I don't really make promises in recruiting.
Probably the only promise that I make is, I'm going to work you, I'm going to
do my best to try to make you a better person, then that will transition into
making you a better player.  
  
I just thought that A'ja Wilson needed a coach which could be patient with
her, 'cause she's different. She's different. She's not one that you can keep
pounding. She's one that needs to see it, needs it explained to her, and needs
someone to be real patient with her. If you're patient with her, you know,
this is what you get in return.  
  
Her parents did a great job of doing their due diligence, making sure that
South Carolina was ready for her, on all levels, from an academic standpoint,
from an athletic standpoint, from a social standpoint.  
  
Staying at home, there's a huge responsibility. It's taxing, because everybody
knows her. Everybody wants to stop and have conversation with her. We knew
that was going to take place.  
  
But when the tragedy like losing her grandmother occurred earlier this season,
if she was anywhere else, she would have probably been transferring back to
South Carolina.  
  
So I'm glad she chose to stay with us so we could share in that moment with
her and help her mend a little bit.  
  
But it was a great fit for our program. It was a great fit for her family. I'm
glad that we were able to cut down the nets. It was a great fit from a
basketball standpoint.  
  
Q. Coach, with being named the national team head coach, coupled with
the fact that some of your contemporaries are nearing the end of their
careers, how does it feel to be the new face of this sport?  
COACH STALEY: You know, basketball has been an incredible gift, you know, that
keeps on giving. I don't know why, but I do work hard at this. It is my
passion. It is my livelihood. It is something that brings me a great deal of
joy.  
  
It brings also challenges, as well. It keeps me engaged. I am forever grateful
for the opportunity to coach USA Basketball. For so many years, it is what
keeps me coming back, the culture of USA Basketball. It's what I desire for
every team that I'm a part of.  
  
You know, you're working together for one common goal. We work together at
South Carolina for this common goal of winning a national championship. The
way you do that is you try to do it the right way. Sometimes, you know, there
are bumps along the road and things don't work out the way you want them to
work out.  
  
You look back on the culture of excellence of a USA Basketball system, and you
just try to use that as an imprint on this level. I know we don't come close
to it on the collegiate level because it's a little different. But if you can
fall short of that, you're in the right ballpark.  
  
Q. Dawn, with Mississippi State being such a good defensive team, they
did struggle with cuts in isolation. Do you think that spoke to your offensive
strengths as a team? When you look at what you've accomplished as a coach, as
a player, you've pretty much done it all. You talked about checking those
boxes. What is the next box for you?  
COACH STALEY: Well, with Mississippi State, we've played them. This is our
third time playing them, so we know exactly the things that create edges for
us throughout the game.  
  
I just thought, you know, from an offensive standpoint we needed to attack the
paint. Yes, Mississippi State is a very good defensive team. They're also a
team that fouls a lot. We wanted to make sure that we put 'em back on their
heels, put them back in situations in which we were going to make the
officials make a call, whether it was a charge, whether it was a block,
whether it was a reach-in.  
  
We feel like, with any team, a good defensive team or not, if you're attacking
the paint, it's just a hard guard. Our players stuck to the game plan, you
know, executed the game plan to a T.  
  
Also I know we talk a lot about other teams being a good defensive team. But
South Carolina is a really good defensive team, a really good defensive team.
We hang our hat on that. I'm proud of our players. To hold Mississippi State
to 55 points, probably 20 points under their average in the tournament, goes
to show our commitment to that side of the basketball.  
  
I mean, I've been named the USA national team coach. The next one is to win a
gold medal in the 2020 Olympic Games.  
  
Q. I'd like to hear your comments, fans said you came to South Carolina
when it was only a few people in the gym. Now it's sellouts. We also heard the
story about someone dealing with cancer. How are you able to be there when
someone is fighting for their life and still be able to concentrate on your
job?  
COACH STALEY: The first one is, South Carolina is a place in which they love
their sports. They love the University of South Carolina. I mean, they love
winners.  
  
Obviously if you start winning, and they start believing in your program,
they're going to come. That's what took place. I'd like to think, you know, we
got an incredible marketing department - and we do - but you can market
women's basketball all you want, all you want. If people don't believe in the
product that's on the floor, they're not going to come.  
  
I just think our fans believe in the product. We make them feel a part of our
program. We talk to them. We invite them to our offices. We put on events just
for them. In return, you know, they become the No. 1 in attendance for the
past three years, which is unheard of in South Carolina, what people think of
as a football town.  
  
Our town is a sports town. They love their sports. Certainly the fans have
painted a picture of what a national champion looks like. I can't thank them
enough. I can't wait to get home to share this moment with them.  
  
Nikki McCray was diagnosed with cancer three years ago on I think a November
afternoon. When we knew what her diagnosis and her treatments were, you know,
we went to every single one of her chemo treatments. We did scouting reports,
we talked, we kept her mind occupied.  
  
With a disease like cancer, you have to stay occupied because it will consume
you in a way that will downward spiral to a place where it's hard to get out
of.  
  
Nikki is by far one of the strongest women I know. She never missed a day of
work until she had her surgery, then we forced her. She got out of surgery,
and she came to work. We all had a bet how quickly she would get back to work.  
  
When you have someone who has cancer, you wrap your arms around them. You
occupy their minds with, you know, something other than cancer.  
  
Nikki, you know, she's cancer-free. She's doing extremely well. God has His
hands wrapped around her. It's something that's what family does.  
  
Q. A couple years ago you spent two weeks overseas with President
Clinton on the foundation. Have you heard from him this week?  
COACH STALEY: His office did call to wish us good luck. Hopefully I'll get a
chance to talk to him. And the UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, did reach out and
text today. She's a proud South Carolinian.  
  
Q. Coach, we've talked a lot about A'ja. We've talked a lot about
Allisha. They both had double-digits in the game. I think the tone was set
tonight at the tip when Bianca picked up Morgan William at halfcourt. I asked
somebody yesterday, if you could tell us a little bit more about Bianca, how
she helped control this game without scoring or assisting, just from the
defensive end.  
COACH STALEY: The maturity of Bianca Cuevas(-Moore) is quite incredible. I'm
extremely proud of Bianca for accepting that role. Being a New Yorker, being
Bianca Cuevas, she likes to score the ball. She likes to throw a little sauce
out there when she has the ball in her hands.  
  
She committed to impacting the game by picking Morgan William up, making it
very difficult for her. She knew the game plan was to make it difficult for
Morgan to operate in areas in which she could control their team, whether it's
scoring, whether it's finding other teammates.  
  
I knew she was going to impact the game in this way from the moment we knew we
would play Mississippi State. She was great in practice yesterday. She was
great in shootaround. If you ask her a question about anything, her answer
was, I know the game plan, I got it.  
  
A lot of times when a player's that confident, you don't know if they're going
to be able to deliver. But I knew deep down Bianca Cuevas was going to come
through for us, and she did just that.  
  
So super proud of her. Super proud of her maturation process.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 67, Mississippi State - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer, then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, you know, really want to congratulate South Carolina.
Thought they really played well today. Again, we've had obviously some hard
times dealing with them, and today was no different. I want to congratulate
Dawn and her staff. Those kids played extremely hard.  
  
We got out-rebounded 13. We got out-scored in the paint, I think 13-6. Points
in the paint were 42-20. We don't usually win games when we don't win the
points in the paint battle.  
  
I thought they were really, really aggressive, did a really nice job attacking
us. We had a hard time with them off the bounce. Had some foul trouble early
with Bre and Dom, tried to weather that a little bit. But I don't think it
would have mattered. I think South Carolina really played extremely well.
Today just wasn't our best day.  
  
As I told the kids, you know, you pat 'em on the back, tell them, Good job.
They were the better team today. It takes nothing away from our 34-5 season.
As my athletic director reminded us, there were 347 teams today watching this
game. We were one of the two playing. Only one of them walked off that floor
the winner.  
  
I'm still waiting for the confetti to come down and be able to stand out there
and my kids being able to stay out there and win it. We didn't have any
confetti when we won the regional. Tonight we had to walk off the floor with
the confetti coming down. That will be something we'll look forward to.  
  
These three seniors are very, very special. Along with Chinwe (Okorie), they
believed in a vision five years ago really, when we recruited them. They've
been here four. When it wasn't easy to believe. Coach Harris and myself were
part of that original staff.  
  
These kids believed. They made it happen. We didn't get here by accident. We
came through a really tough regional. These kids deserve all the credit for
that.  
  
Today doesn't define us. It certainly doesn't define this team or this season.
They had one heck of a year. I just want these kids, especially those seniors,
to know how much I love 'em, appreciate 'em. They're always going to be
special in my heart, have a special place in my heart because of what they've
accomplished, for believing and trusting us.  
  
Their parents believed us, they trusted us, they had confidence in us. I'm
really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ketara and Bre, can you talk about what it's like to go against A'ja
(Wilson). In the post, she seemed to have a determination about her tonight.  
KETARA CHAPEL: A'ja is a great player. We've been dealing with her for three
years. She's tough. We had a hard time guarding her tonight. I don't know.
She's a really great player, so it's hard to try to match her intensity.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: Like she said, A'ja is a great player. I feel like tonight
she came out and was just determined to get the win for her team. She played
with energy that her team needed.  
  
Q. Dom, why do you think this team resonated so much with the
Mississippi State fan base this year?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I mean, I think every year that we've been here, it's
gotten better. I think we've been really good this year. So, I mean, the fans
just keep growing.  
  
It just started our freshmen year. Coach Schaefer has us up in the stands
hugging babies, kissing babies, hugging people. I think it's our family
atmosphere and how personable we are with our fans. I think it's just grown
every year.  
  
Q. Dom, in terms of what you accomplished, what do you think it says
that this team, without any McDonald's All-Americans, has gotten as far as
they have? Coach talked about he recruited you specifically for your
toughness. What do you think we learned about where the women's game is right
now?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think it means if you work hard, you can accomplish
things no matter the skill level. Sometimes talent doesn't work hard. When you
work hard without talent, you out-work the talent.  
  
If you put your mind to something, you'll get it done. You don't have to be
All-American. You don't have to be 6'7". Morgan, itty-bitty, she plays like
the biggest person on our team sometimes.  
  
A ranking, a skill level, doesn't define you. Hard work is what defines you.  
  
Q. Dom, aside from the early start and the late spurt there in the
fourth quarter, seemed like it was an uphill battle all the rest of the game.
What was it like to try to get into an offensive rhythm? It really seemed like
South Carolina made it difficult for you for long stretches.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Yeah, we were up 7-3 at the beginning. They made a run.
We weren't executing offensively.  
  
There's no way to put it. We just weren't executing offensively. We weren't
putting the ball in the basket and we weren't getting stops, which doesn't
have a good recipe.  
  
I think defense is a really big key for us, and we weren't playing well
defensively, which doesn't lead to points for us. I think it started
defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions now for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how difficult it was to guard them? It
seemed like from the tip, they were in attack mode and everything was going
straight to the rim.  
COACH SCHAEFER: They certainly were in attack mode. I'm going to take a lot of
the responsibility for our poor defensive play today. We really feed off
whoever's on the ball. I just didn't have a really good matchup on the ball
today. I think when you're soft on the ball, it's always been my philosophy,
if you got somebody soft on the ball, it's hard to get four behind you to play
really hard.  
  
I'm going to take the hit for that.  
  
You know, you've got matchup problems with them. They got big ol' guards out
there, 6'2" guards. We have a little bit of a size problem guarding them, not
to mention how quick and athletic they are.  
  
So, you know, part of our philosophy going into the game, how we were going to
guard a particular set, I think it really took some of our aggressiveness
away. I'm disappointed that it did. Felt like it was the best way to guard
that particular set. In the end, I think it created an atmosphere defensively
that is not a good recipe for us.  
  
Again, it's kind of like starting a game off in zone, then going to man. I'd
much rather start man and go zone. When you start zone, it's hard to get
somebody to get up and get after it in man after you've been standing around,
if that makes sense.  
  
Q. Vic, was that matchup piece why Morgan was on the bench late in the
game? What went into that decision?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Jazz(mun) (Holmes) was playing good today. Jazz played good
today. Morgan, she had some struggles early. Again, y'all, it's a long, hard
grind of a year, of a season. We got in so late Friday night. We've been
trying to almost play catch-up since then.  
  
I thought we had a couple kids today that just didn't quite have the energy
level that we needed. When you combine that with their energy level seemed to
be really good, I think that made for a bad recipe for our not being able to
handle dribble-penetration.  
  
Again, South Carolina's really good defensively. They seem to play really well
against us defensively. They did a good job again today. I mean, they play
really hard against us and do a great job. Today was no different.  
  
Q. To elaborate on your previous point about the defensive set. Was that
going under the screen, not going over it, or giving them too much space on
dribble-penetration?  
COACH SCHAEFER: The screen is set inside the scoring area. We do things
differently, depending on where the ball screen is. We didn't handle the ball
screen well today.  
  
Again, you know, they're really good. They get going downhill, boy, and it's
hard. If y'all noticed, we had probably six or seven block calls, where
typically we're getting charges on all those. Dom is taking 52, Morgan is
taking 51, vice versa.  
  
I think every one of them was right. Every one of them. We were just a half a
step slow today on every rotation. We just couldn't get there. That's the way
it is. Again, you give South Carolina all the credit because they really
attacked us.  
  
If you can ever get those first two charges in the first three, four minutes,
it slows all that down. We couldn't get there. Bre had two block charge calls
on her. Again, they're right. I mean, we're half a step late. We were half a
step late all day.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer, on Friday night after you took down UConn, the way
you took them down in overtime, one of the things that Geno talked about in
here was being a gracious loser. It's easy to smile, be up when you win. I
think the telltale sign, you'd agree, is how you behave when you lose. Can you
tell us a little bit, without giving us too much, what you had to say to your
team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. Yeah, you know, with my team, just the last minute, I
was coaching them the last minute, Hey, we're not going to probably win the
game, but we're going to win the last minute. We talked about that in the
huddle when there was 40-something seconds on the clock. We're in the kid
business. We're constantly coaching and teaching young people. At that moment
it's not about X's and O's. It's about trying to coach and teach them on how
to handle adverse situations.  
  
You go in that locker room, those four seniors, it's rough. I love those kids.
I love all of 'em in there like my own, but those four seniors are really,
really special.  
  
You tell 'em, Hey, not our day. Make sure you pat South Carolina on the back.
They played really well. It wasn't our best day. But it's not defining our
season. It doesn't define them as young women. It doesn't define them as
student-athletes. They've had a heck of a year, man. We've beaten two No. 1's
to get here. We played on the last day.  
  
Are we disappointed? Absolutely. We have three rows in there. The front row is
my seniors, the back row is my junior and sophomores and freshmen. I
challenged the second and third row, Okay, this is your team. You nine that
are now sitting here, we're good enough. I have a heck of a team coming back.
I got the 19th-ranked class in the country coming in.  
  
It's their team. It shouldn't matter who is coming in, even though we got a
heck of a group coming back. It's their time to go work and get better. Don't
let this moment -- don't minimize this moment. How you feel, remember it. Wrap
your arms around it. Use it as fuel.  
  
So you talk about those things. I mean, I let my seniors talk. It was real
emotional, you know. They've had the ride of a lifetime. Really for four
years, they've had a great career.  
  
They've won so many games, built a program that is the talk of the country.
They don't ask me to come speak about X's and O's. Used to. Now they want to
know how we got the seventh largest fan attendance in the country in
Starkville, Mississippi. That's what they want to know.  
  
That's good. That's good for the game. You saw my fans today. I feel horrible
for them. I hate to have to walk out there and see them. You know what,
there's probably going to be a thousand of them over in the Sheraton. We had
2,000 today sending them off. It's hard to look those people in the eye
because I feel like I let 'em down. Those people love my kids. So that's what
we talked about.  
  
Q. Vic, to jump off from that point, very few coaches would have played
Morgan William 23 minutes, taken Victoria Vivians out. How much of that played
a part in thinking, This is not just an end, this is a team that you're
bringing back next year, part of a larger process that extends beyond the end
of this game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, no question. I mean, Victoria didn't have a great day.
She was 4-16. Morgan, she had four assists, one turnover, was 2-6.  
  
Again, we're educating. This is an education process. I was trying to get 'em
going. Again, both ends of the floor is real important for us, for me as a
coach. I try to hold people accountable.  
  
If you looked at the stats, my two guards, all of 'em, we didn't have a very
good day. The best position I had was my three position. That was Dominique.
She went 5-10, you know.  
  
So my point guards combined went 5-11, but Jazz was 3-5. You can go down the
list, but you're right. For me, I'm a big-picture guy. Just kept coaching 'em,
trying to prod 'em, letting 'em know.  
  
Plus, when you got somebody maybe that seems like they're a little tired,
you're trying to give 'em a blow. You give somebody a blow. Next thing you
know, the person you're putting in is playing pretty good. Maybe you don't
want to take 'em out.  
  
Don't forget, Jazzmun Holmes had 14 points against DePaul. Morgan didn't play
a lot in that second half. I got a lot of confidence in that kid. She was
playing well today.  
  
Q. You talked earlier this season about getting more help for Victoria.
It really seemed like you were either trying to get her going or, I don't
know, get her to attack the basket a little bit more. Unfortunately, neither
of those things worked out. Were other players not stepping up, or was she
just the player you maybe had the most confidence in?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We cut it to 54-50. I don't know what the time was on the
clock. We had possession, if I'm not mistaken. Took two really bad shots. They
go down, then we come down, have an unforced turnover and leave it for them at
the top of the key and they go lay it in and it goes to 58-50.  
  
We had the game, cut it back, fought, fought, fought, got it back to 54-50,
had possession. Sometimes this group can get caught up in a moment. Again, I'm
sure, too, everyone who is watching us for the first or second time, they
think, Man, that's a really bad shot.  
  
Well, I've seen people make -- I've seen our kids make some of those shots
that people think may be really bad shots. In that moment, we probably could
have gotten a lot better shot. You could get that shot any time in the shot
clock. We had one broken play, then the other one we just went off and left
it. They took it and went and laid it in.  
  
That's kind of where the game got away from us. We had it to 54-50, had the
crowd going. We were right there. You know, again, maybe it took all we had to
get to that point and get it back after being down so bad. We didn't have
anything left. It just comes down at that point, you got to execute. We didn't
execute.  
  
But, you know, South Carolina, they have a habit of making it hard for you to
execute. Again, I said that about Connecticut. Because they're such a great
oiled machine offensively, nobody wants to talk about how good a defensive
team that team is. Same thing with South Carolina. Talk about A'ja Wilson,
Gray. Let me tell you something, those kids guard your butt. They're just hard
to handle.  
  
You know, it's just part of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I had a chance to talk to your former boss, Gary Blair. He
said defense is what you done. You followed what he did by going out in the
streets and getting people to believe in the program. Can you talk about where
you go from here? I also talked to D.J., Dionnah Jackson. Where do you go?
You've been on both sides of the field in this area?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, Dionnah actually came from George Mason. They played for
Oklahoma. She hasn't been there in a long time. Her and Carly have been a
great addition for me and Johnnie. Johnnie has been with me, we've been
together, we're like brother and sister. She's so much a part of what we do,
has made such an incredible impact in my life and on this team and our
program.  
  
Again, I wouldn't be here today if she said, Hey, I'm not coming. That's the
importance that Johnnie has in my life.  
  
But, you know, when you work with somebody for 15 years, like I did with Coach
Blair, to see how hard he worked at the marketing piece of getting out, you
know, speaking to 20 people, 50 people, 200 people, driving two hours in
Mississippi to towns I've never even heard of to talk to 25 people, 30 people.  
  
But you don't turn anybody down. My thing is, I always tell 'em, If you come
to one game, your life will be changed forever because now you won't miss
another one. You'll be living your life around when we play. That's happened.
Our fan base, I have people that come from the coast, comes in the weekend,
come Thursday, stay till Sunday when we have two games in a row. From Tupelo,
Memphis, then in between, Jackson.  
  
It's what makes it special. But you have to work at it. You know, you all
asked Dom about that. My answer is, our kids get all the credit because it's
how we play the game. I believe our fans, we have some tremendous, passionate,
loyal fans at Mississippi State. But I believe they appreciate the blue-
collar, the hard work, the toughness, stepping in front of a freight train,
taking a charge mentality, how hard we play. I think that's why they come
watch our kids play.  
  
It gets louder in the Hump when we take a charge than any three-pointer that
anybody could shoot. They have a real identity and a real appreciation for
kids that play hard. People love Dak, but they loved him first because he's
tough. He ain't running to the boundary, you know what I mean? He ain't a
quarterback taking a hook slide. He's going to run over your butt. So that's
why people I think really appreciated him and loved him so dearly.  
  
That's my kids. We ain't running to the boundary, you know. It's been a real
honor and a privilege to coach these seniors, this team. This team has
certainly challenged me. But it's been obviously extremely rewarding. Just
really humbled and honored to have had the opportunity at such a great
university with these great kids.  
  
Appreciate everybody being here today. I'm disappointed we didn't play better
for you. It wasn't that we didn't try. Again, you have to take your hats off
to South Carolina and Dawn Staley for a tremendous effort today.  
  
But we'll be back. Again, it's been a heck of a ride. I appreciate everybody
in here. It's been fun. Thank you for being here.  
  
All right, praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the podium now, Dawn Staley from South Carolina.
We will take questions for Coach right now.  
  
Q. Dawn, what did it mean to your program when A'ja (Wilson) decided to
commit to South Carolina? Could you maybe take us back through the recruitment
of her as the No. 1 player in the country, what it meant for you when she
picked you over some of the other big-dog programs.  
COACH STALEY: I think any time that you have the best player in the country in
your backyard, I think it brings credibility. I don't know if we'll ever get
another No. 1 player in the country, if she were not from our area.  
  
The amount of time that went into recruiting her, her family, it was quite
easy to do it because we had access to all of those people. They watched our
program grow from the ground up. We provided some things that other programs,
other top programs in the country, were providing to their top recruits.  
  
But it meant a great deal with an attendance standpoint, where our fans get a
chance to come and watch her grow up. She's a family person, so it gave her an
opportunity to play in front of her family.  
  
It also allowed us to branch out and recruit some other players nationally,
because if she's considering the University of South Carolina, other ones may
follow suit. Back then it wasn't a very popular thing to choose our school
because we hadn't been to the Final Four. I don't know if we won an SEC --
yeah, we won one at that point.  
  
It meant that she gave us a little credibility, to say that we're on the rise.  
  
Q. Coach, (SID) Diana's (Kowal) notes highlight the raised level of play
for Allisha (Gray), A'ja and Kaela (Davis). What did you talk to your players
about after Alaina (Coates) went out with injury, and how did you see their
production respond?  
COACH STALEY: I didn't necessarily talk to the three of them. I talked to our
team. When you have a player go down that has contributed in a way that Alaina
has contributed for us, it's a blow. You feel it from an emotional standpoint.
You have to take it, you know, head on, in that moment.  
  
We found out. We told our team. We just moved forward. It's much like, you
know, if a player gets injured during a practice. We immediately take the rest
of the team down the other end and we continue practicing. I'll go back over
and check on the injured player, but you can't show your players any sign of
weakness, or you're less confident in us moving forward.  
  
I think you just have to stay confident. I've always preached with our players
you can't get too high with the highs and too low with the lows. You have to
find a way to maintain. If you're maintaining, you can only go up. You can
only go up.  
  
I thought our players took our lead as far as our coaching staff, felt like we
had enough in the room to accomplish all of our goals, still with the injury.  
  
Q. Allisha Gray was big for you last night. Talk about what you need her
to do for you, what she does for you.  
COACH STALEY: Allisha Gray has been the most consistent probably of all of our
players. We call her the silent assassin. She doesn't say much. She lets her
play speak for itself. She's been doing that time and time again.  
  
She's never complained about what she gives up on a defensive end as far as
having to play much taller, stronger post players. She just does it. She just
goes about her job. She does it in a way that would make any coach proud.  
  
I wish I had two or three or four more Allisha Grays. If we did, I'd probably
feel a little more confident going into a national championship game
(smiling).  
  
Q. Dawn, Connecticut and Tennessee have won I think 19 titles between
them, and given women's basketball great visibility, legitimacy in a
groundbreaking way. What happened last night, do you think that's necessary
for the evolution of the game, with what Mississippi State did, to let other
teams know that it's possible on the biggest stage, that maybe we can do it,
too?  
COACH STALEY: Yeah, I think it's good for the game. It's good to shake it up a
little bit. I think more people are going to start watching it just because.  
  
What it does is it gives hope to all of us, all of us that are not in that
number of 19 national championships. We're just vying to get one. Hopefully we
can build off that.  
  
But certainly I think it breathes a light into women's basketball, knowing
that it's not the same old, same old, same old UConn. Although it's been an
incredible ride. It's been incredible to watch. It's been a beautiful thing to
watch.  
  
But it was great. I mean, it's great to know that somebody else is going to
win a national championship. It's not the same old, you know, Velcro. You just
take the Velcro off, stick Connecticut back up. It's different. It's a nice
little flavor to it.  
  
Q. Dawn, does it make it easier for you guys preparing for tomorrow that
it's an SEC battle, you played twice already? Your players already know them
well, it makes it easier than playing a team you haven't played as much?  
COACH STALEY: It does make it easier, you know, but you can't -- for what
Mississippi State has done over the past five games, you know, they're much
different than they were that sixth game in which we played them in the SEC
tournament championship.  
  
The intangible part of it is really hard to get our focus in on it. They're
playing at an all-time high. Morgan William is playing some of the best
basketball I've ever seen played in a player.  
  
You can't go into the game thinking you can just do the same old things. You
got to give her different looks. You got to make sure that she's not getting
hot and into a groove.  
  
But as far as player personnel, we know them. We know them extremely well.
Although you have to prepare for both of them, we are prepared for both of
them. We didn't have to prepare as much for an opponent we haven't seen all
season.  
  
Q. Dawn, you played Mississippi State twice, obviously played UConn as
well. I think the country was pretty surprised to see the result. Were you
surprised by what happened last night?  
COACH STALEY: I wasn't surprised because we've played them. I've watched UConn
over the past couple of years. I think Vic has the personnel to disrupt. He
did it in a way, over a 40-minute period, which is extremely hard to stay
engaged that long against a UConn team that is just a machine as far as what
they're able to do offensively.  
  
I just thought they had the bigs to give them a little trouble. They used
their bigs in the right way on both sides of the ball. I think UConn had a bad
day. Watching the game, Mississippi State had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you took over at South Carolina, Tennessee was still the
power of the SEC, and had been for decades. At that time did you have in your
mind, Hey, this is where I want to get to, to be that kind of power in the
league? Can you also talk about the fact that you and Mississippi State are
here in a national championship game, have kind of replaced, if you will, the
power structure in the SEC.  
COACH STALEY: Well, here's how it went for my coaching career. When I was at
Temple for eight years, we would get to the NCAA tournament, the first round,
possibly the second round. We've always, you know, lost in that first and
second round. That was really frustrating.  
  
I thought at that time, nine years ago, that we took Temple as far as we could
take it, with the players we could get, to recruit, to come to Temple. At
tournament time, we always got out-talented. We out-played people, but they
out-talented us.  
  
I, as a coach, wanted to be part of what's happening right now. I thought
making a coaching move to a bigger conference would allow our coaching staff
to live out some dreams that we wanted as coaches, and that's to win a
national championship.  
  
South Carolina opened up. I mean, it was two-fold. One, personally, my parents
are from South Carolina. They were born there. Then professionally, it's the
platform that we needed to compete and win for national championships.  
  
We don't know it's always going to work out that way, but I knew we had the
platform. I didn't know that A'ja Wilson was in our backyard. I didn't know
Aleighsa Welch was in our backyard. Nor did I know Tiffany Mitchell.  
  
But it all came together quite nicely in the fact that we had some of the top
players in the country in our state and in surrounding areas. It made this
dream come true a little bit quicker.  
  
So, you know, South Carolina, the SEC, allowed us to be in this position. For
two SEC teams to compete for a national championship, it's quite incredible.
Even just looking at Vic and what he's done with Mississippi State in just a
short period of time. I think a lot of people don't really understand what
goes into coaching young people these days. Some people don't understand what
young people have to do to realize their dreams.  
  
Sometimes you've got to make hard calls. Sometimes you've got to, you know,
gain by losing. All that happens. But it's these moments that make you forget
about those times and really appreciate the good times and what it took to get
here.  
  
Q. Coach Staley, the first question I had, last night as I was leaving I
saw you and some of the coaching staff walking by the Mississippi State locker
room. As a coach, what did you see in that locker room? I think a lot of
things your team is going through could be mirrored by Mississippi State.
Secondly, did you talk with Bianca (Cuevas-Moore) yet about the matchup at the
lead guard spot, some of the things she might need to do come Sunday night?  
COACH STALEY: We did walk by. I looked in the locker room, their locker room,
and I just saw them very, very happy for accomplishing something that most
people didn't think could get done.  
  
I actually wanted to get some eye contact from somebody just to say
congratulations, because you work so hard, you want to make sure that you give
credit where credit is due. I wanted to congratulate Vic. I did text him just
to congratulate him on winning.  
  
You know, I'm a dream merchant for young people. One of their dreams was to
come true. They're not my kids, but it's a dream that has been realized by
young people. I wanted to kind of get eye contact with them just to say
congratulations.  
  
I also wanted to let them have their moment.  
  
As far as the matchup, you know, with Morgan William, we had film today. We
talked a little bit about it. Bianca knows what she has to do. She has to
really stay engaged and make it difficult.  
  
Morgan William is going to make shots, she's going to make plays. It is how
she's making those plays. If we can decrease the amount of times that those
plays are easy plays, I think it works in our favor. But if she's in a groove
and she's playing as she's played over the past five games, it's going to be a
long night for us.  
  
Q. In Columbia, you really praised Kaela's efforts defensively, even
though they didn't have a great offensive game. She did a good job on
(Victoria) Vivians. With Allisha, with (Doniyah) Cliney, with Kaela, it seems
like you have a lot of good matchups. How do you like your matchups in terms
of trying to make things difficult for not only Victoria or Morgan, but
several of their position players?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, we feel good about our matchups. I think, you know, what
you have to kind of plan for, and you don't want to plan for, but you do, is
foul trouble. If A'ja Wilson gets herself in a little foul trouble, that
hurts. But we've been there before, but not against a team as big as
Mississippi State. We've got to find a way to keep A'ja on the floor.  
  
Everybody else I think puts us in a position, you know, to match up fairly
well. It's when you take A'ja Wilson out of the equation, you're left with a
freshman post player with Kiki Harrigan. That's probably too big of a stage
for us to rely on her to play heavy minutes. But everybody else, I think we
got enough to match up fairly well with them.  
  
Q. You've watched Teaira McGowan the last two years. Talk about what
you've seen in the progression of her game.  
COACH STALEY: I actually had the opportunity to work with her with USA
Basketball. She was on our U-18 team. To see her three years ago versus today,
and every time I see her, I marvel. I tell her she looks great. She's playing
well. I mean, they've done a tremendous job just from her physique. She's
strong mentally. She's playing with a high level of confidence. She's becoming
somewhat of a go-to player down there in the paint. She's delivering for them.  
  
I'm very happy. I'm very happy that she's taken a lot more seriously, because
she'll have a long, fruitful career playing basketball.  
  
Q. When you got to Temple, as much as you talked about South Carolina,
it was actually instant success, which was a big story for someone who never
coached with a program that hadn't won in a decade. Took a little longer at
South Carolina. Do you remember at one point a couple of things happened that
you looked at each other and said, We're on the way?  
COACH STALEY: Well, probably during the Candice Dupree era, after her freshman
year.  
  
You mean at South Carolina?  
  
Q. South Carolina.  
COACH STALEY: At South Carolina.  
  
Hmm, I would say when we signed Aleighsa Welch is when things seemed to take
off, not just from a basketball perspective, but just from a chemistry. It
felt more like family. It felt like our culture was taking place, which would
allow us to bring in better players, better character kids.  
  
Once we got good kids in there that loved basketball, the sky was the limit.
It's opened up, you know, so many options for us to do a lot of different
things. Kids that believed in our vision. We finally got the majority of our
players believing in our vision.  
  
As any coach would tell you, you're going to be whoever the majority of your
team is. If the majority of your team is negative, you have a negative team.
If the majority of your team is positive and believes in your vision, that's
who you're going to be.  
  
I think once Aleighsa Welch got to us, the majority of our team was believing
in what our coaching was instilling in them.  
  
Q. Dawn, did Vic respond to your text? Have you had any interaction
since last night? To expand a little bit on what you said before about
Tennessee and UConn's dominance, how good is it for the sport two new teams
making the Final Four, and this year two teams playing for a national
championship who never won before? Someone will be a champion for the first
time tomorrow night.  
COACH STALEY: Vic did respond. He was up quite early today, so he responded
pretty early (smiling). He did respond.  
  
Then as far as looking back over the year, I think sometimes we lose sight of
how good women's basketball is because of UConn's dominance. But you're slowly
seeing it by having two new teams in the Final Four this year. There's going
to be a new first-time national champion winner tomorrow night.  
  
You're slowly seeing, you know, how good women's basketball is. It takes
probably UConn losing for you to really appreciate what's taken place over the
past few years. I'm hoping that it continues, and people can really see the
layers that are beneath what UConn has been able to do over the past decade.  
  
Q. How special is it to you to be one of two teams representing your
university this weekend, then one of three teams representing the
conference?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, it feels great. It feels great. This is what we've
worked so hard for. This is what we envisioned for our program. I can probably
speak for our commissioner, Commissioner Sankey, saying this is what he
envisioned for the SEC, for us to be playing on the third weekend in the NCAA
tournament, for our conference, which I think is known as a football
conference.  
  
We're raising eyebrows as far as putting basketball in that same conversation.
I mean, the SEC gives us an incredible platform, from a television standpoint,
from just our institutions, they're so supportive. We want all of our sports
to be successful. They give us a platform to do that.  
  
We're not surprised by us being here. Probably the rest of the country's
probably a little surprised by what's taken place by SEC teams.  
  
Q. What do you think the difference was in the first two matchups? How
hard will it be to win a third time?  
COACH STALEY: You know, the biggest difference is the margin of error was
small. The games could have gone either way. I mean, it took us making plays
at the end. We just made one or two more plays than they did in the fourth
quarter of both games.  
  
Is it hard to play somebody three times? It is. But for how the games played
out, that could have gone either way, I mean, it's so close. You can't use
that as bragging rights. And you're playing for a national championship.
You've got to throw all of that out the door.  
  
They're not looking at the SEC tournament championship game. They're not
looking at the regular-season game that we played. They're looking at how we
are. We're a little bit different than what we were six games ago. They're a
lot different to me as far as scoring the basketball. They're scoring the
basketball at a high rate.  
  
I think Vic's going to be who he's going to be from a defensive standpoint, so
we know that part of it. It's going to come down to us, either one of us,
sustaining runs and making plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Dawn, I know you probably burned a bunch of cell phone batteries out
of your many followers on Twitter last night. I know she checked in after you
got the Olympic job. Did you hear from the UN ambassador (Nikki Haley) in the
last 24 hours?  
COACH STALEY: No, I haven't heard from her yet. I hope she doesn't because I
don't want her to jinx us (laughter).  
  
Q. Do you have pregame rituals? If so, what are they? Do you have a
pregame routine?  
COACH STALEY: Pregame routine on the road, I don't really nap, but I do just
kind of lie still and watch TV, especially if my nerves are bad. But other
than that, not really. I don't have a pregame ritual.  
  
Actually, I do my hair. I try to do my hair. That's a ritual. I don't know how
that works out, though (smiling).  
  
Q. What has been your most difficult moment while coaching? How did you
go about overcoming it? Then how have you used this to teach your players
about overcoming challenges?  
COACH STALEY: Wow, the most difficult?  
  
You know, I always try to look at things positively, even when there's a
storm. When I was at South Carolina, we dealt with some transfers. You know,
you look at the amount of work you put into recruiting someone, when you don't
feel like they trust the process enough and give you a chance to show them
that, you know, this is the right place for them, that can seem like some
difficulty.  
  
But, again, just like when you're dealing with adversity, you can't allow your
other players to know how it's really affecting you. You have to turn the page
and keep moving forward.  
  
That's probably what we've done time and time again, like we're dealing with
an injury to one of our best players in the history of our program. We didn't
allow our players to see it other than it being a positive and us moving
forward, no matter how hard it was for us to kind of hurdle that, while also
being sympathetic to our injured player.  
  
So, you know, you have to turn the page. You have to stay strong for your
team. Your team will follow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2017

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by head Coach Vic Schaefer from Mississippi
State. We are going to jump right into questions.  
  
Q. Coach, how much sleep did you get? How much time did you actually
celebrate what you accomplished, knowing you have another big one another
night?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, the sleep factor, I think I walked out of the film room
at 3:21. My staff was still in there. Was up at 5:30 doing Good Morning
America. Why, I don't know who watches Good Morning America at 5:30 on
Saturday morning, but I did it.  
  
Went back to the room, started watching more film, fell asleep. We've been
rolling ever since.  
  
The celebration factor, I've addressed this a couple of times with some
different people. I had to go in the locker room and throw water on my kids.
They're really grounded. They've been that way all year. We've had obviously
some really big wins this year.  
  
Last night, I mean, they're just, Okay, Coach, who is next? When do we play?
Where? What time is the bus leaving?  
  
That's the way they've approached it all year long. They have a real good
understanding of there's another one down the line that's even bigger. It's
hard to say that knowing that you just beat Connecticut, and their streak. But
there is another game that's bigger than that one that gives you a chance to
win a national championship.  
  
We talked about, when we started this back in September, there were seven
championships on our schedule. We won four of 'em. We've lost out on two, the
regular season SEC Championship and the conference tournament championship. We
were involved in both of them within a week. Now we've got a chance at the
national championship, so...  
  
Our kids have been really good, really grounded, for all year really.  
  
Q. What offensive performance do you look forward to that you need to
get from Mississippi State and also South Carolina?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Offensively?  
  
Q. Offense and defense.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously they attack you with so much aggression. They
play the way we like to play. They're playing that lineup right now that's
really fast, aggressive. They go off the bounce. They play around A'ja
(Wilson), who you just can't get a butt on her. She's so good. In my opinion,
she's the best player in the country. I mean, I've had to deal with her now
for three years. I ought to know.  
  
Dawn has put those kids obviously in some great positions to be successful.
They play really hard defensively. That's the thing people don't give them
credit for, or they should get more credit for, is, man, they guard your tail.
When we walked out of the gym three weeks ago, four weeks ago, scored four
points in the fourth quarter, that will humble you in a hurry. That kind of
led to some of the things we did differently.  
  
They really, really play you extremely tough. They're physical. I mean, they
play the way that we do. If we'll play the way we typically play, we'll have a
chance in the ballgame.  
  
But we're going to have to play really hard, we're going to have to be
physical, aggressive. We have to try to take away some of those things that
they're doing really well right now.  
  
Q. Vic, on Morgan William. If you look back at the lists of recruits,
she was the 25th-ranked point guard, not just overall, but point guard in her
class. How much of that reflects the player she was at that time, how much
she's grown? Specifically to that growth, how much does her size mean that she
had to figure out how to make shots, like the one she made last night, by
finding ways to get the ball in creative ways over bigger defenders?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, I've tried all my career not to get too caught
up in numbers on kids. That's somebody's opinion.  
  
Now, you can't make a living on two stars, so to speak, so you've got to make
sure if you take somebody, like a Dominique (Dillingham) maybe that wasn't
highly recruited. But there was no doubt in my mind Dominique was exactly what
I needed. We had nobody. We didn't have any toughness, we had no competitive
spirit with that team. We had to recruit it. Her and Savannah Carter, who was
a junior college player, didn't recruit them for their jump shot. I recruited
them for their toughness, for their physical nature, their competitive spirit.  
  
Morgan's the same way. Now, Morgan was a pretty good player in high school.
When we watched her play, boy, she covered ground. They played a zone press.
She would cover from one sideline to the other. Even at her size, she's long.  
  
Quick, foot speed quick, athleticism. There was no doubt in my mind. I've had
some small point guards in my career. I've seen some really good small point
guards in my career.  
  
I think when you've done it as long as I have, you get a feel for, you know,
kids remind you of kids, if that makes sense. When you watch kids play, you
get a good feeling. You have a confidence of, Hey, she reminds me of so-and-
so, a First Team All-SEC player, whoever. I think she's going to be good for
us.  
  
I got that with her. I had that comfort level with her, that she was going to
be really special. Number one, she's quick, quick, quick. I got two of the
fastest kids I've ever coached in my life. Her and Jazzmun Holmes are two of
the fastest kids straight line I've ever coached.  
  
Q. Who are some other players who come to mind?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Aqua Franklin played for me and Texas A&M, a four-year
starter. Reminds me of a point guard that was at LSU a while back. Her name
escapes me. She won championships and was really good.  
  
The toughness factor, the Sydney Carters that we've had over the years. She
just gives you that comfort level that those kids gave you. You feel like,
Hey, she's going to be fine. I never once second guessed or even thought twice
about not taking her.  
  
Q. Temeka Johnson?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Temeka Johnson was who I was thinking of. Obviously Erica
White is a good one, too.  
  
Q. You mentioned the SEC tournament game against South Carolina, four
points. What sticks out in your mind? Up until that point, you had the
momentum. What went wrong? What do you try to correct for tomorrow's game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think you give Dawn a lot of credit. She changed up
some defenses, went to zone. We didn't handle it real well. They made some
changes defensively on how they were guarding Morgan.  
  
When you only score four points, you're not going to beat anybody in March
having a four-point quarter. And we did. Offensively we didn't make shots. We
didn't execute very well. They did.  
  
We just watched it 30 minutes ago, watched bits and pieces of that film.
There's some things on there that are glaring to us and our kids. Again, the
film doesn't lie. When you watch that, you see why we had the problems that we
had. So you've got to make those adjustments.  
  
When we got back home, that's some of the first things I addressed. We showed
the film of the fourth quarter, then we addressed those issues that we had
during the fourth quarter, which I'm not going to go into here. But you got to
address 'em and you got to correct 'em. That was part of some of the changes
that we had early on.  
  
The other piece was, we had to correct our physical mistakes in practice with
certain drills. We've done that, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sydney Carter. Back in 2011, I was here when you helped
topple another No. 1 team to go on to win. Do you have any of that in your
mind this time, being in American Airlines Center, taking on a No. 1 team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously I know what's happened here. That's six years
ago. Different team, whole different dynamic. But obviously I've had two real
special victories in that arena. Two special teams.  
  
That team last night, y'all, again, we can sit here and talk about it all day,
but the toughness, the competitive spirit that our kids played with last
night, we've seen it all year, numerous nights. Until you get to see it
firsthand, you really don't know my kids.  
  
They were just so tough, resilient. They talked last night about the game is
full of runs. We had a really big run early. That's what allows you to survive
Connecticut's runs.  
  
We built that lead early. Somebody told me we were up 16. I really didn't know
that. I was too busy worrying about defense, offense. Had no clue. Is that
correct?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, it allowed us to deal with their runs during the
course of the ballgame. Again, I don't think our kids ever once got rattled.
But we've been in those games before with the schedule we played.  
  
Certainly arena's been good to us. I'd love for it to be really kind to me one
more night.  
  
Q. With such a short turnaround, does it help you're playing a team
that's an SEC rival, you know the personnel? You don't have to say, This is
who the center is, who their guards are.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Personally I'd rather be playing somebody else, to be honest.
They know us better than anybody. Obviously we feel like we know them. But I'm
really proud that we have two Southeastern Conference schools in the
championship of our sport. That's really special.  
  
For me personally, I think that's what the NCAA tournament gives you, is you
finally are going to get to play somebody that isn't one of your 16 rivals. We
play 16 rival games, that's how I call it, in our league. I'd much rather be
playing somebody that might not know me quite as well.  
  
I think my staff does a tremendous job. They're very thorough in scouting. So
that's the piece that, if I had my pick, I'd rather probably be dealing with
somebody else. Fact of the matter is we've got to go against them.  
  
Again, we've got to fix some things that we've had some issues with them over
the course of two ballgames this year.  
  
Q. Vic, obviously you've seen a lot of A'ja Wilson. She's made her mark
in the SEC. In the two losses, she really kind of took over when she needed
to. What does she do so well that makes her so difficult to defend?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Number one, she's very active. She's physical. She's not going
to stop working. She's a constant worker. Just a competitor. She wants to be
in the moment. She wants the big shot.  
  
But if she doesn't take it, she's going to go clean it up. That's the thing we
tried to impress upon with our kids. They've got three or four kids now, when
the ball goes up, if you don't find 'em and put a butt in the gut, they're
going to go right by you and stick it in. They're going to get the rebound and
get the put-back.  
  
For us, we understand what's coming down the pike. We've had two doses of it
this year. We just watched film again. We'll watch some more this afternoon.
So we understand and respect South Carolina so much. Those kids that they
have... We've got to go out and try to fix some of our issues we've had with
them.  
  
A'ja Wilson, like I told you, because of her competitive spirit, because of
how hard she plays, just makes her even harder to deal with because she's got
a skill set to go with it. It is multi-dimensional.  
  
Q. How different is South Carolina playing without Alaina Coates? What
kind of different challenges do they present now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, they're fast. They're getting up and down the floor.
Cuevas, she may be faster, as fast as my two are. They're playing those
guards. Those kids are just in attack mode.  
  
They do a great job, for the most part, they can stretch you and shoot it.
They create a real interesting -- what it gives them is spacing on the floor
that maybe with Alaina they didn't have. That's the piece that you've got to
deal with, for us, is dealing with that spacing. When it's created, you got to
try to not give them as much room as they want, which is extremely difficult.
If you back off somebody, they'll knock down shots.  
  
I think for them, obviously Davis is just playing with so much confidence
right now. She hurt us when we played them in the second ballgame.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think the difference was in the first two games,
and how excited are you to get another chance at South Carolina for a national
championship?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'm excited to get a chance at anybody for a national
championship. Again, South Carolina certainly presents so many issues for us.  
  
What was the first part?  
  
Q. What did you think the difference was in the first two games?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, so, I mean, the first game we had with them at their
place, it's a knockdown, dragout, came down to one play. We talked about that
with our kids. It came down to one play in that ballgame. When you're playing
in those games, in those arenas, in those atmospheres, and we were playing in
front of 15,000 at their place, I walked out of the arena that night with a
lot of confidence in my kids.  
  
Certainly we were disappointed. We knew we missed a layup with 30 seconds left
to go up one. We had out-of-bounds plays. Blair had two open threes in the
corner that could have been difference makers. We all knew we could have made
plays during the course of the ballgame.  
  
That's what it came down. It came down to one play in that first game. You
walk out of there feeling, Okay, we're right there. They're picked to win our
league. We were picked second. Played them on the road. Came down to one play.
So I walk out of there with a lot of confidence.  
  
When I walked out of the arena on the second one, I was disappointed with
myself. When you score four points in the fourth quarter, and your offense
looks like it sets the game back 30 years, there's nobody to blame but myself.  
  
We went home and we went to work. We had a week and a half to get ready for
the NCAA tournament. That's what we did. That's what you do if you're a
competitor. I mean, I knew this team was capable of getting here. I told y'all
that before. I said it back in September. I know what a Final Four team and a
national championship team looks like. I've been a part of that. Fortunate
enough to do that.  
  
I told them that back in September. So my job was to fix what's broken. It's
never too late. I've been telling our kids that for a month now. It's not too
late to get better today. Let's get one play better. Let's get one play better
today. We talked about that now for a month.  
  
We got a chance to get one play better today. If we keep getting one play
better every day, we're going to be playing for the national championship. And
that's where we are.  
  
Q. You obviously mentioned the last game in the SEC tournament. Morgan
had seven turnovers, which is atypical for her. She's playing so well. What do
you want her not to try to do in terms of putting the team on her shoulders,
again, possibly with the size and length that presented such a challenge last
time?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think she's just got to continue to make good
decisions. She's playing well. She's got a lot of confidence right now. I
don't think I need to talk to her about what not to do. I think she's got a
good feel for that.  
  
She's a junior in class, but to me she's already had her junior year. She's
playing, you know, like a senior. She understands what her role is. She
understands the leadership piece, the responsibility piece. She's owning our
team right now, which is good.  
  
Again, the kid's playing with confidence. She wants to be in that moment. So
it's good to have kids like that. I got more than one right now, by the way.
Again, I think that's what allows you to be where you are today because you've
got a locker room full of kids that aren't afraid to take that shot.  
  
Q. In the big picture, if there were a lot of folks who have been
complaining, for lack of a better word, that it's always UConn, and they
wanted something new for the game, they're going to get something new
tomorrow. So help me make a case that they should be compelled to watch
tomorrow night, and maybe the most exciting moment didn't happen last night
but happens tomorrow.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Our game is so special. Again, here's the bottom line. UConn
ain't going away. They'll be back. They'll be back stronger than ever.  
  
I think that's the challenge for all of us, is we've got to -- if we're going
to have any success at this level, this stage, we've all got to continue to
elevate our game and our program.  
  
The fact of the matter is, the game is sold out tomorrow night. It's my
understanding tickets have gone up in price since the victory last night,
which I think speaks well for both schools. Both of us have tremendous
followings. We're both top seven in the country in attendance.  
  
I think it's exciting for our game. I think last night our arena was electric.
I mean, if you were in that arena or watching it on national TV, that was an
electric atmosphere for our student-athletes. What an unbelievable experience
for them and for anyone who loves our game.  
  
It's not up to one school to make that happen. I think that's what you're
seeing. So for us and South Carolina, you're going to see two teams that are
going to be extremely tough, physical, aggressive. They're going to represent
not only our conference but our game in such a positive manner.  
  
It should be a great game and fun to watch. Both of us play an exciting brand.
So I'm not sure I answered your question, but, again, I think we all need to
understand, like I said last night, I didn't have to play 'em best out of
five, best out of seven. I only had to play 'em once. It's why you play the
game. Our kids were special last night.  
  
But trust me, Connecticut's not going anywhere, you know. There will be
another streak started next year. They'll have a chance to run that streak for
a long time.  
  
I think what we did last night, it gives people hope. If you prepare, if your
student-athletes believe, on any given night anything can happen. That's the
beauty of sport.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Staley said she texted you last night. Did anyone else
that you were surprised reach out to you last night or today about what you
guys did last night? And it seemed last night was a huge Mississippi State
crowd.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, special.  
  
Q. When you played South Carolina the first two times, you were on their
home court in Greenville, which is also pro South Carolina. How much is having
your fans loud, supporting you tomorrow night going to help you guys?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Dawn did text me. I responded back to her probably I think
this morning after the Good Morning America that I'm not sure I was up saying
good morning, America, but I was in front of a camera.  
  
Again, was really thrilled for her, as well.  
  
Our fans are what make Mississippi State so special. I got to tell you, I've
been to a couple pretty big universities in my career. Our fan base is so
special. They love our kids. They're so excited right now. I can't even get
'em through the lobby to get 'em to a bus. I got to plan for a 30-minute walk
because it's stop, stop, picture, picture, autograph, autograph. I call my
team the people's team. When we win at home, we don't go to the locker room.
We go in the stands and hug mamas and kiss babies or hug babies and kiss
mamas. That's what we do. They just want to hug my kids. They want to give
them a dozen cookies. They want to tell them they love them.  
  
That's how we built our fan base. We're accessible, we're personable.  
  
The arena last night, special. That atmosphere for both teams, so special. How
proud I'm sure our Women's Basketball Coaches Association is and Miss Brown is
today. The atmosphere we created for the biggest stage in our championship.
I'm sure it's going to be that way tomorrow. I'm proud of my fans because they
were a big part of that.  
  
Today there's people driving in to be here for tomorrow. So it's an exciting
time, no question about it. I'm awfully proud to be the coach at Mississippi
State.  
  
Q. Vic, how do you identify when you're scouting, especially when you
were scouting her, that kind of sort of late-game confidence and swagger? When
did you maybe first notice she had that, I want the ball at the end of the
game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You're talking about recruiting, when you first start
recruiting her?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think in recruiting, my staff does such a great job. Johnnie
has been with me 10 years. Johnnie Harris knows exactly what our system is,
the kind of players that we need. She's been with me since day one.  
  
Since added Coach (Dionnah) Jackson(-Durrett) and Coach (Carly) Thibault, who
obviously know exactly and have learned our system and what we do. But Johnnie
has been with me. We've been together a long time. She does a tremendous job
in identifying kids that can play in our system.  
  
I think the meat of your question about her wanting the ball in those big
moments, I think that's something that's developed. Certainly Morgan was
confident when she came to us. She had 29 in her freshman year, you know, in
the NIT. I think with Morgan, she's learned to not only be this point guard,
who is really good in the open floor, but she's learned to run a team in the
halfcourt.  
  
In our league, and in this tournament, you win with halfcourt offense and
halfcourt defense at the end of the day. I think with Morgan, that's the piece
she's added to her game, is the halfcourt offensive piece.  
  
But I think her confidence has grown of late, no doubt about it. When you get
in a huddle and you're going against Baylor, the No. 1 seed, and she looks me
in the eye in a timeout and says, Coach, if I'm open, I'm going to shoot it.  
  
Hey, that's a good idea. You go ahead and turn it loose.  
  
But you want that kind of confidence in your huddle. The Jimmy Chitwood, Hey,
I'll say the shot, Coach.  
  
I have other kids that want to be in that moment. She is owning our team right
now, she's owning herself as the point guard and leader of our team. That's
what you want a point guard to do. I've seen her grow obviously throughout her
whole career. But I think right now her confidence is at an all-time high.  
  
Q. You talked in the days leading up to the game against Connecticut
about focusing on Mississippi State and not worrying about the name on the
opponent's jersey. Is there a similar train of thought against South Carolina,
given the recent history in the series? You've been close. You've had a lot of
momentum in games. There have been periods like in the fourth quarter of the
SEC tournament where things have kind of gone south. Can you follow the same
train of thinking, Don't look at South Carolina, just focus on us?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, probably a little bit. I think because of our
familiarity with them. Our kids, they understand what's in front of us. They
understand the challenges that we've had. They understand the things we've got
to adapt and fix.  
  
Again, we'll have a good practice today, good shootaround tomorrow, try to
address some of those.  
  
At the end of the day, you know, South Carolina's not going to change. They're
the same great team, coached by the same great coaching staff, and we're going
to have to adapt and change. I mean, you know what, we've talked about that in
our locker room numerous times, Hey, here is where we are. What were we when
we ended the regular season? Whatever we were. We said, Hey, if we're going to
get hot in the NCAA tournament, we're going to have to change. Some of y'all
are going to have to change. I think that's the beauty of this team, is they
changed.  
  
For the game on Sunday, we're going to have to change some things that we did
to try to adjust to the things they want to do. At the same time there's some
things we need to do better that we're really good at, that may have bothered
them a little bit. But we've got to do that even better.  
  
So it's not rocket science. It's not like we're having to invent some cure for
something that's incurable. But we're going to have to go out and execute.
That's the biggest thing right now. I think our kids have done that.  
  
Q. Considering your history against South Carolina and the fact this
team has overcome so many obstacles along the way, do you feel like this final
opportunity is the perfect sort of ending to the season for you guys?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we keep bringing up my history with South Carolina, so
apparently the fact that we've never beaten them is an issue today.  
  
You know, when you're playing in the national championship game, what better
way to finish off your season. That's where we are right now. These kids
deserve it. They've paid such a tremendous price. We practice harder than
anybody in the country, I'm quite confident. My kids are tough. They have such
an incredible competitive spirit. They've earned the right to be here. We've
come through an incredibly tough region. We've played a grueling schedule all
year long. They've earned the right to be here.  
  
I couldn't be prouder of 'em, I couldn't be more happy for 'em. I know the
sacrifices that they've made. But again, until you know what's inside their
breastplate, know the heart, the size of their heart, you just -- my
confidence in them is a whole lot different obviously than the confidence of
the media. That's fine. It's fine.  
  
But I know what I've got in my locker room. I know what I have on the staff.
It's really, really special. For these kids to be in this game in this moment,
it's really appropriate, in my opinion.  
  
Again, it's like the saying in our locker room, It's not what we do but how we
do it that separates us from the rest of the country. Everything that that
entails, there's not a lot of teams that do that. I think that's one of the
reasons why we're here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, UConn - 64, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer, then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously that was one heck of a great basketball game,
overtime game. Two great teams.  
  
Obviously I'm extremely proud of my group. What an unbelievable, gutsy
performance that no one in the country, including all of y'all, probably
thought could happen. And that's okay.  
  
But we knew it could happen. You see, you have to be careful when you start
talking about people that you really don't know about. If all you're doing is
evaluating what you see on TV, and you don't really know what's inside
somebody's breastplate, you better be careful about evaluating them.  
  
That's what these kids have. They have tremendous heart. They also have a
little pride. We had our pride stepped on last year by another great team,
just like that one today. We didn't play well. They played really well. We got
our tail handed to us.  
  
Because of that, these three right here, and the rest of their teammates,
they've kind of been on a little bit of a mission. They have tremendous pride.
They have tremendous heart. They're fighters.  
  
They have such a competitive spirit. Again, unless you know them, you wouldn't
know that. I know 'em. We believed in our locker room it could be done. A year
ago, I'm showing the Miracle, hoping for it. This year I wasn't showing the
Miracle. We weren't watching any movies. I wasn't talking about the Philistine
slaying the giant, although it was in the back of my mind.  
  
This was about two basketball teams, two great teams, competitors, tough,
physical, aggressive basketball teams. We beat the greatest team, with the
greatest streak in the history of sports. You got to give them a lot of
credit. We didn't have to play them the best out of seven. Didn't have to play
the best out of five. We just had to beat them one time, just beat them one
time.  
  
When you have these young ladies and their teammates, they can go through what
we went through for three days preparing, put that together. Again, it helps
to have a veteran team, four seniors, four juniors. Helps to have that. But it
also helps to have kids that have that competitive spirit.  
  
These kids were incredible tonight. It's never easy for us, y'all. It wasn't
easy tonight. There's always something. Always something that comes up that
makes it more difficult for these kids. But they always find a way.  
  
In that moment, they were ready for the moment. Morgan had 41 against Baylor.
Ain't any shots bigger than the one she hit tonight. But that's the shot we
wanted. That's who we wanted taking it. At the end of the day, you got to want
to be in that moment. Our kids want to be in that moment.  
  
That's what I knew about 'em. That's what our staff knew about 'em. They
prepared them and did a great job. That's why they won the game tonight.  
  
Make no mistake, we beat a heck of a basketball team, the greatest of all
time, with the best coach of all time. We're very proud of that. We're
honored, we're giving God the glory for number 34.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, take us through that last sequence.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Well, Coach called the timeout. He was like, Morgan, you can
win the game. That's what he say. Morgan, you can run this play. It wasn't
originally for me, but the way they had guarded, I told Dom (Dillingham) to
get the ball and take it down the court. Time was just ticking. I knew the
last -- end of regulation, I went for a layup, they blocked it. I was like,
She probably think I'm going to do it again. I got in the space, I jumped up,
I made the shot.  
  
When I made the shot, I was in shock. I'm still in shock. I'm over here like,
Hey, I just won the game. My teammates are just so happy and proud of me. I
can't thank them enough because I can't be playing the way I'm playing without
them.  
  
He said, You about to win the game. We want the ball in you are hands. Just in
case the foul, free throw-wise, or just get a bucket.  
  
Q. Morgan, when did you know that you could win this game?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Film. Days, I mean. We had to redeem ourselves from last year,
of course. I mean, just watching film, our coaches just preparing us, tell us
what we can do, have so much confidence in us that we can go out there and win
this game. We believed them. We just went out there and fought. It was a good
outcome.  
  
Q. Did the play intend to go as deep into the clock as it did, Morgan?
Did you put a little bit extra arc on it to get it over Saniya's hands?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I think it was on Gabby.  
  
But I just shot the ball (laughter). I know Coach said one shot. I didn't want
to give them too much time to go shoot the ball, end up going to a second
overtime. Just happened to be perfect timing.  
  
Q. A couple of your teammates sitting up there with you. The spin move.
Fans went crazy. Then your post player, seemed like you were just saddling
(Teaira) McCowan, and McCowan was able to get the ball off the deflection. She
gets a steal and goes down the court. Talk about your other teammates that
aren't here and what they done tonight.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: The whole team contributed. When T got that steal, went
halfcourt, I mean, I really thought she was going to dunk it. I was, Dunk it,
dunk it, dunk it. She ended up fouling.  
  
We did a good job turning them over. Coach wrote on the game, pregame, like
they play -- I mean, they play pretty ball, and they had 25 assists per game.
We had to limit that and guard, deny the ball. That's what our five players
did. They denied the ball. They only had 11 assists. Played out good.  
  
Q. Bre and Victoria, you had foul trouble early on in the game. What was
your plan for the game? How did you try to change the dynamic but keep the
same place for Mississippi State?  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: I guess with us, we kind of knew going in we had to impose
our will, as coach said. He said even if we get a couple early fouls, make 'em
count.  
  
After that, we just had to play smart. We started to play our style of
defense. We can't really think about fouls, just got to play smart in those
situations.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Feeding off of what Bre said, we have to play smart. Don't
take no plays off. If you got to make a foul at the end, make it, knowing
you're giving it your all and knowing your teammate has your back when you get
up.  
  
Q. Morgan and Victoria, is it different weathering UConn runs when
you're ahead? Did it feel different? Was it easier for you guys to get
composure, to get back to what you needed to be doing because you were up 16,
up 8, when UConn was making runs against you guys?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, see, we got up by 16 in the second quarter. Feel like we
got stagnant when they started going zone, we started standing around,
throwing up threes. I mean, we weren't attacking like we were in the
beginning. I feel like that's when they made their run.  
  
We finally adjusted, started attacking, getting inside. Each possession
matters in big games like this. When you get a shot, each possession -- that's
what Coach says. We need turnovers, we need good shots, get inside, stuff like
that. That's what we focused on.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Going off what Morgan said, yeah, the game is full of runs.
Either you going to make a run right after them. I feel like being ahead at
the beginning, kind of keeping a lead, takes off a lot of pressure. Helps us
to build our confidence and execute on defense.  
  
Q. For all three players. What kind of statement did you think you made
about Mississippi State basketball?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Like Coach said, it was personal. We got beat by 60 last
year. We had to prove that we're a way better team than we was last year.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: Same thing. Coach said this morning, his mindset said it
was personal. He told us to take the same mindset coming in. We knew if we
played our game, our style, you never what the outcome was going to be. We
knew if we played hard, played our game, we'd come out with the win, and we
did.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like we earned respect tonight. You know, people didn't
believe in us. But it didn't faze us. We just had to go out there and play. I
feel like it showed we're better than what everybody thinks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions now for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. You win this historic game, but there's still a final to play in two
days. What is your approach now with this team? How do you get them sort of
back to the place where there's one more mountain to climb?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, this team's been really good about onto the next
one. You walk in our locker room, there's not a lot of jumping around. I mean,
we jumped around on the court. When we got in the locker room, I mean, heck, I
had to throw water on 'em. They're just really grounded. They're always, Who
is next, Coach? What time is the bus leaving? Where are we leaving from?
That's kind of the way it's been all year.  
  
I don't think I'll have to ground them too much. It's late. It's midnight. I
got to feed 'em. My kids like to sleep. So I got to get 'em to bed and let
'em, you know, rejuvenate a little bit.  
  
But, you know, they know that. We talked about it in the locker room, that
there is one more. It's funny, last year I'm showing the Miracle, this year
now I'm having to live it, 'cause there's one more game.  
  
So for us, we'll have to come back tomorrow. The thing is, we're playing a
team, they're so familiar to us and we're so familiar to them. That's the
beauty of the NCAA tournament for us, is we finally get away from our league,
and it's not quite as difficult. But here we go. We're going into round three
with South Carolina. We've had two knockdown, dragouts with them. Dawn
(Staley) has obviously done a tremendous job. It's a great team.  
  
But, you know what, it won't be hard for me to get their attention, so...  
  
Q. Vic, by halftime they had only gotten 18 shots up. Obviously they had
few assists. Can you talk about your defensive strategy for tonight.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we got 21 more shots for the game, we forced 17
turnovers, and they're averaging 25 assists, and they only had 11. Our
strategy was, you can't let them do what they want to do. Bottom line.  
  
Again, there's not a lot of teams across the country that play that way.
There's just not. There's not a lot of teams that are out there doing what we
do defensively, trying to push you out, guard, all that. I mean, it's just the
way it is.  
  
But that's how we play. I had two different plans. I asked the girls, I said,
What do y'all want to do? I'm behind you. Whatever y'all think, we'll do it.
But I got two plans, you tell me what you want.  
  
Coach, we want to go get 'em.  
  
Okay, we're going to go get 'em, then all of us have to go get 'em. It's not
four and there's a fifth for pressure release. That's what we call it if one
doesn't do their job.  
  
You saw my big five player come over the top and get a couple hands on a
couple balls and steals, deflections.  
  
Again, when you've got a team that shares the ball so well, I mean, man, they
are a machine offensively. If you don't put something in the sprocket to jam
it up, it just keeps rolling. So you've got to do some things to make them do
some things that he don't want to do.  
  
That plays kind of into what we do. We just had to do it tonight. Our kids
were special tonight on that end, no question about it, forcing 17 turnovers,
21 more shots. That's probably the two stats of the game.  
  
Q. With the attitude of trying to take it personal, you came out and
built that 16-point lead. How did you get them to regroup and take the
punches, and punch back, not get caught up in what was across the opponent's
jersey, fall prey to that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Our kids, we know the game is full of streaks. It was good we
had a streak that got us up that big. That's hard to do against a great team.  
  
You know you do that, it ain't like you think you're going to get up that
many, then you're going to get 16 more and have them down 32. That ain't going
to happen. Those kids on the other end know how to play a little bit.  
  
We knew they were going to make a run. So what you got to do is try to
minimize that run. You go in at half up eight. I'm sure everybody across the
country went, That's nice, the little team played really good. Second half
they'll come out and kick their ass. Excuse me, kick their butt. Sorry. My
apologies. Don't print that, by the way.  
  
But again, our kids have so much pride. I mean, you see our fan base out there
tonight? Special. That's what's been so special about building that program
and about these kids. Those people love my kids. They willed them to victory
tonight. They were not going to let them lose. Our kids weren't going to lose.
It didn't matter what happened, whatever jumped up in front of us. Our kids
have seen it all year long. They found a way to get it done.  
  
I just think, again, you go through the 16 rival games we go through in the
SEC, it gets you ready for the moment. We've had back-to-back nightmare games
against two really good teams. It's not anything we're not used to.  
  
Q. Vic, when did you know that this team was ready for this?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't know. This team's always been difficult to read. I've
gone in the press room all year and opened up with, Man, I didn't see that
coming. We won by 24, 26, 28 in the SEC, which is hard to do. Just like Coach
Auriemma has done with his group.  
  
I'm not sure when it hit me. I just knew that if my kids would fight, I've
seen them in that moment when they're so competitive, their competitive spirit
absolutely will not be denied. I knew if I could bottle that up tonight in
them, we'd be okay, we'd be fine.  
  
But, you know, the moment last year was such a nightmare. It's in the back of
your mind. But I told them before the game, Who's responsible for fear? Who's
responsible for fear? If you've got fear in your heart, you got fear in your
mind, who is putting it there? What entity puts it there?  
  
We talked about it. At the end of the day we're not going to let that entity
put fear in our heart and in our mind. It's basketball. Let's go play. Lay it
on the line. Make it a dogfight.  
  
Q. Vic, what the heck happened there with 12 seconds left with the call?
The fact is that your guys could have said, Hey, what's happening here? But
you made the defensive play to set up the game-winning shot.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, I'm not sure. I really don't know. I probably need to
stay away from that. I mean, I haven't seen it. I don't have any idea.  
  
Again, you know what, that probably got in our kids, and they're like, Okay,
fine. We'll do it. We'll do it this way. Because we've done it this way all
year. Nothing's been easy for us.  
  
When that happened, we just -- once the coach kind of calmed down a little
bit, we got 'em back together, I said, Hey, fine. This is right up our alley,
ending the game on a defensive stop. Let's go make a stop. We did.  
  
Then when you make that stop, now there's 12 seconds on the clock, hey, that's
plenty of time. I don't like the advance rule. I like to bring it up. I like
people backpedaling. That's the way I like it done.  
  
Q. All season UConn has gotten the ball to Gabby Williams in the high
post. You put your 6'7 " kid in there. How important was it to disrupt her,
feed it inside, to their shooters?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That's a hard decision to make, too. Boy, it's probably not
one that people saw coming. I think if you're going to beat them, just like we
had to do the other night, we have to do some things that maybe they're not
quite prepared for.  
  
I thought that was a big matchup.  
  
Here is the thing about Teaira. Teaira, if you give her some challenge that
you tell her, You're probably not going -- it may be a big challenge, you may
not be able to do it. I'm going to give you a chance. If you can't, I'm going
to have to put somebody else.  
  
She embraces that moment. I was proud of her. Again, you're putting length up
there. 6'7". She got drove on a couple times. We knew there'd be some
heartache with that. We also knew that might be the best thing in the long run
to help us put a kink in the sprocket, so to speak.  
  
Q. A few days ago in your teleconference, you were saying how you used
to, when you were coaching teams, order off the left side of the menu, doing
everything to scrap by. Here you are beating UConn. What is it like to go
through the tough times, triumph, overcome? What is it doing for you?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That was a long time ago, '90 to '97. I've since been at the
University of Arkansas, Texas A&M, won a national championship there. But, you
know, when you grow up in these humble beginnings, it really keeps you
grounded. It makes you appreciate what you have.  
  
I know that for me personally, coaching today, year 32, I've got the greatest
job in the world. I get to wake up every morning and coach women's basketball
with some great kids and with an unbelievable staff. What a blessing.  
  
I mean, I couldn't ask for any more. So it's easy for me, knowing where I
started, to remember those humble beginnings and to appreciate them. I try to
share some of those stories with our kids. I mean, it was a bus league.  
  
But, you know, those were special times. I miss being on a bus with my kids,
watching a movie, talking, showing, hey, come up here, we'll watch film.
That's a bonding time that's really special at that level that you don't get
at this level. We roll out, get on a charter, fly, get off, go eat. I mean,
there's no time.  
  
That's what I really miss. Not that I want to go back to that. But that's a
piece of that era that I do miss. So it is special. But I wouldn't trade it. I
would not trade it for anything, absolutely not.  
  
Q. The one thing I noticed when I look at the rosters, you're the only
team here that does not have one McDonald's All-American. How did you make it
work for yourself?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, it's a system. It's the way we play the game. It's
not that we haven't gone after 'em. But when you start a program that's coming
off of 14-16, you take it over, it sometimes is a little bit of a challenge
early. So you got to go get kids that you know can play in a system, do things
the way you want 'em done.  
  
I say this all the time. We talk about, Where is the next McDonald's All-
American? Where can we get 'em? I want to know where the next Dominique
Dillingham is coming from. She's just tough, physical, aggressive basketball
player. Doesn't say anything about her jump shot.  
  
That's the piece that for us -- you got to give my staff so much credit. They
are able to identify those kids that fit our system. Again, they do a great
job evaluating this. Skill set's important, no question about it. But we don't
sacrifice character for skill set.  
  
I have too much love and respect for my community, for my university, my
administration. That's one of the things we talk about when we're recruiting.
I promise moms and dads that I'm not going to bring their daughter in and put
them around a bunch of idiots. We got great kids. Hey, do they make a bad
decision every now and then? Sure. They make them at Yale and Harvard, too.  
  
The bottom line is they're great kids. They're committed. They want to win.
They pay a price every day. That's the piece that if you're on the outside
looking in, you just don't know that about our kids. That's what makes 'em the
warriors that they are. It allows them to be successful.  
  
So, hey, I'm not trading 'em for anything. We got four really special seniors.
I mean, they believed in a vision when it wasn't really easy to believe. I
signed 'em before we ever played a game that first year, which is probably
good, or I never would have got 'em.  
  
Again, Johnnie and I knew what 13-17 looked like that first year. We didn't
panic. We backed up that first class with a top-20 class, so here we are.  
  
Q. That felt kind of like a championship game. A lot of momentum going
along. How do you take that and carry it into Sunday and still use it
constructively?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, we've been beaten twice by South Carolina. Our kids, we
know what's coming down the pike. It won't take much to get their attention.
That's our job, my job as the coach. They know now the prize is in front of
them, it's attainable.  
  
We've got one heck of a team to get ready for, a tremendous staff. They're
really, really good. They've obviously changed their system a little bit
throughout the course of the season.  
  
But it's down to two of us. Southeastern Conference teams playing for the
national championship. Hey, that's pretty special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 62, Stanford - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Stanford.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer, then we'll take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: First, I'd like to congratulate Dawn and her South Carolina
Gamecocks. They worked really hard. They had a really aggressive second-half
plan, came out and really did a much better job in the second half.  
  
I mean, Dawn and her staff have done a great job. They have a terrific team.  
  
I'd also like to congratulate our team on a great season. I'm so proud of our
team, how hard we fought. We really struggled with the third quarter. For us,
with Karlie (Samuelson) not being 100 percent, that really hurt us a lot. We
really got out of sync and never really got it going in the third quarter.
That was disappointing for us.  
  
I'm exceedingly proud of our team, how hard they played. I thought Alanna
stepped up big. They battled in there. We will hold our heads up high leaving
Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, what was it like going through that third quarter, like
nothing would go in the basket?  
ERICA McCALL: It was rough, frustrating. But my teammates talked to each other
the whole time. I'm really proud about how we kept communicating. I mean, kept
shooting. Unfortunately they didn't go in.  
  
We battled back in the fourth quarter. Alanna hit big shots. I'm glad we
battled, even though shots didn't go in.  
  
Q. The first half your team did a great job, then things started
slipping away. Was it anything they were doing differently or that you were
doing differently? How do you account for them having such a strong third
quarter?  
ERICA McCALL: I think they got aggressive, started to read where our double
was coming from. She started attacking points. She's a good player. She read
the double well.  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk about Marta's (Sniezek) play in the first half.
She really looked to score. She was great distributing the ball. What did that
do for you guys?  
ERICA McCALL: Her pushing the ball gave us a lot of energy. She really locked
down some key layups for us. Got that big and-one for us. I was really proud
of how she performed. I look forward to her doing that all next season.  
  
Q. Alanna, there's been a lot of talk about the leadership of the three
seniors on this team. You have more years left at Stanford. What did you take
away from playing with them?  
ALANNA SMITH: Well, I think one thing that our seniors do really well for us
is stay really level-headed, even when we are down, which we have been at
points throughout our season. We stay really calm. It doesn't get to our
heads. Yeah, that's just a huge tribute to our seniors.  
  
Like you guys said, our shots weren't going in. But we weren't worried about
it. We continued encouraging each other. That came from our three seniors.
That really helped our whole team.  
  
Q. Alanna, off the bench in the first half, you led your team in
rebounding, which is astounding. Did you feel that you were moving at a
slightly higher gear than normal the first half? Everybody was moving so fast
up and down the court.  
ALANNA SMITH: I couldn't really tell, but I think that's one thing that we've
really been focusing on, is keeping our pace really high and pushing the ball
up the court. That's something that our point guards have been doing really
well, and our bigs do really well, as well, is run the floor.  
  
I think that worked really well for us in this game, yeah.  
  
Q. Erica, your coach talked about how proud she was of the team. As a
leader, any thoughts on how proud you are of what your team has accomplished
this season, given your start?  
ERICA McCALL: I'm so proud of my team. We've been through a lot, especially
this past pre-season. We worked our tails off to get here. I'm super proud of
how my senior teammates helped lead the team with me.  
  
I can go through one by one of how much I love my teammates. But ultimately we
worked our tails off. We got here for a reason. There's nothing to hang our
heads down about, as Tara said.  
  
Just proud of them, really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, what was it about this South Carolina team that was so tough
for you in the second half? Was it their shooting, the rebounding of (A'ja)
Wilson, the speed? What were the things that really cooked you in the second
half?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I think that our team got a little out of rhythm, even
at the end of the first half, when Karlie came out. We did not come out as
aggressive as we needed to be. I thought we were really short on a lot of
shots.  
  
I don't think we got to the free-throw line, what, twice, if that, in the
second half. We turned it over too much. We just never could get it. When we
had a nine-point lead, they got back right in.  
  
For us, honestly, we just really struggled without our glue out there, Karlie,
twisting her ankle. Really kind of gave us a tough time.  
  
For Karlie not to score... We need her scoring. I think it was a great effort
by Bird (McCall), a great effort by Alanna. Brit (McPhee) really struggled
offensively. Marta I thought did some really nice things in the first half. We
needed her to be a little bit more aggressive in the second half.  
  
But, you know, without Karlie, we really struggled.  
  
Q. Tara, curious how much you feel your defensive game plan went
according to plan. You held them to three threes. A'ja Wilson, most of her
shots were on put-backs. Did the defensive plan start with aggressively going
after those doubles and sometimes even sending a third after A'ja?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, it didn't look good when the first shot was a three by
(Tyasha) Harris. But, you know, I thought defensively, the first half, I mean,
they shot 14% in the second quarter. I thought our defense was okay.  
  
The problem was, we gave up second shots. (Allisha) Gray got in on the O
boards. They got too many O boards and they put them back or they called fouls
on the O boards. I don't think we've ever all year been 21-5 at the free-throw
line.  
  
I mean, we didn't rebound well enough. We had too many mistakes with the ball
in the first half especially, turning the ball over. Our turnovers, some of
the little traveling turnovers, were, I mean, unforced errors. We kind of shot
ourselves in the foot with that.  
  
We were out of sync. We really depend a lot on Karlie, Marta, Alanna. Without
her, we really struggled.  
  
Q. Having Karlie less than 100%, I assume considerably less than 100%
after the injury, is that as much of a psychological hit as it is what she
brings on the floor, her shooting, that kind of thing?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. I mean, she's really been the glue to our team the
whole year. She talks. She makes big shots. If someone had told me before the
game, She won't score, I'd say, We're in trouble.  
  
She scores for us. She defends. She takes charges. She couldn't move. We
tried. She wanted to play. We wanted her to play. One of the first
possessions, Gray really took it right at her. Then we went with Bri.
Psychologically and physically, it was a challenge.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about A'ja Wilson's impact on the defensive
end. Seems like she was altering a lot of shots down there.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yeah, I mean, she's an All-American. She's a terrific
player. She blocks shots or she changes them. What did she end up with? 19
rebounds? She's on that glass.  
  
She really, you know, came out in the second half. I think Dawn probably
challenged her, and she responded.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Thank you.

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 62, Stanford - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes first, please.  
  
Q. A'ja, they were obviously very physical with you out there. How did
you remain physically tough but also mentally tough, as well?  
A'JA WILSON: Of course, it was very frustrating. It was very tough to remain
tough. But it was something I've seen before in the SEC. Playing in the SEC, I
see that kind of every night. It wasn't anything that I haven't seen. It was
just a matter of this time, it was kind of frustrating because I felt like I
wasn't really in the play offensively.  
  
I mean, I just kind of remained me. My teammates really rallied around me.
Kept positive thoughts into my mind. Coach Staley kept positive thoughts into
my mind. I think that kind of helped me overcome just kind of the way the game
was going for me.  
  
Q. A'ja, curious about two things. What did you see out of the double-
teams? What were you able to recognize? Seemed like you were able to make
decisions to help you get to the basket, especially in the second half. There
was a spot where a 50/50 ball came your way, you made it to the basket. Put
you up. That seemed to give you more flow over the remainder of the game. Was
that the case?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I think so. It's very tough when you have kind of three
people around you. You see that your teammate is open, but you really just
can't get it there the way that you want it. So, of course, it's frustrating.
I see it, and I just can't get there.  
  
I kind of let the game come to me, honestly. I try to get every loose ball
without fouling. I find a way for us to get the possession. If it was that
50/50 ball, so be it. I think that really kind of gave me the momentum to say,
Okay, we're going to be okay, just kind of push through.  
  
Q. Miss Gray, y'all only scored six points in the second quarter. What
did Coach Staley say to you guys to take over the lead midway through the
third?  
ALLISHA GRAY: Our energy was down, we just needed to play to our tempo, start
pushing tempo. Once we get that, we got on our run. We was able to go on our
13-0 run.  
  
Q. A'ja, when you're getting double and triple teamed like that, you're
having trouble getting a look at the basket, do you count on the defense and
the rebounding? You led the team in assists, as well. Do you look to do all
that other stuff, maybe just say, 'Okay, now the offense will come to you'?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, most definitely. I just kind of let the game come to me,
whatever category it is on the stat sheet. I want to make an impact on my team
any way I can. Tonight obviously was kind of rebounding. I could have shocked
myself with that (laughter).  
  
But it goes to show, you know, you got to find a different way in the game
that you can impact your team. I think rebounding kind of stuck out to me. I
just tried to get every ball that I could.  
  
Q. A'ja, yesterday you were kind of telling us about what you were
telling your teammates after your Final Four from two years ago. Given that
experience from two years ago, what does it mean to now get to a championship
game?  
A'JA WILSON: Oh, I can't even put into words the feeling that I have right
now. This is a very special team. I feel like we've earned this spot that
we're in now. We know that we're not done. But just the feeling of just making
history at your school is just something really special. Especially with the
game of women's basketball, we're kind of putting South Carolina on the map
right now. It's just a great feeling for us.  
  
I think we're blessed and we're really honored to be in this situation.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said she felt that Dawn probably challenged you to
come out and play better in the second half. You had 11 rebounds in the
second. Was that the case?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think she necessarily challenged us. I think that kind of
came from within. We knew we had to go out and get every possession. I know
Coach said in our huddle, we got to treat every possession like it's our last.
That's what you have to do at this time of the year. I think that's something
that we really kind of stuck to us. We knew we had to get the ball, earn our
possessions, keep our possessions. I think we did a pretty good job of doing
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, I think earlier one of the questions to one of the players, the
poor shooting in the first half. I guess the question is, 25 percent shooting,
did you feel fortunate to only be down nine points?  
COACH STALEY: First of all, I just want to say to God be the glory that we're
in this position, to play for a national championship. Something that is so
very hard to do. Sometimes when your kids play on this stage, they don't quite
come out and execute like they have in their minds, like we prepped.  
  
We knew exactly what Stanford was going to do to us. They were going to sag on
us. They want to force us to take some outside shots. They forced us to play
at a speed in which benefited them. When you're playing at that speed, you
don't have any fluidity to what you're doing on the offensive end. If you're
not creating it by pushing the ball down the floor, by changing speeds, you're
not going to make great shots. They're not even shots that you practice at the
speed that you practice at.  
  
So we were fortunate to be down nine. But I just wanted to get our kids to the
locker room at halftime because I knew, no matter how many points we were
down, we could utilize our speed to get back into play, whether that's
trapping in the halfcourt, whether that's picking up full court, whether
that's coming off ball screens, setting our players up in positions where they
could be effective.  
  
Timeouts weren't long enough to get our message across. We needed to get into
halftime, kind of exhale a little bit.  
  
Q. Dawn, obviously offensively there was a difficulty getting into a
rhythm. Seemed like defensively you were doing a lot of what you set out to
do, knocking them off the three-point line, making sure every shot was a tough
shot. Did you feel like the team, throughout this game, was performing to the
defensive expectations you had set?  
COACH STALEY: That is exactly why, you know, we built our reputation on
defense. You're going to have bad shooting nights at times. This was one of
them. If we didn't hold Stanford to 29 points, which is not bad, it's not bad.
I thought we did what we needed to do from a defensive standpoint.  
  
A lot of what they got from an offensive standpoint was because of our shots.
We had some imbalance on the offensive end. They created easy buckets for them
in transition.  
  
But then the second half, I thought we just imposed our will from a defensive
standpoint, sped the game up, and got playing at a pace which benefited our
style of play.  
  
Q. You have kind of a thing about bouncing back. You've done it
throughout the season. Next man up mentality. What is it about you guys that
gives you so much resilience? Do you think it will give you an edge in the
next game?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, we feel like we're always going to be in the game. For
the league we play in, the SEC, it is a tough league. We've been in familiar
situations. We don't fret it. We don't get down on ourselves. We just find a
way.  
  
Our team has an incredible focus on the end result. The stuff in between, it's
going to happen. Runs are going to happen. Bad shots are going to happen.
Turnovers are going to happen. But we hang our hats on being able to control
some of the tempo that happens out there.  
  
I think a good team can bounce back from any adverse situation in a game. I
thought our team has done that throughout the season.  
  
Q. Dawn, what was it like playing against a coach that you know so well?
Did that make any difference in the game, how you planned for the game? What
does it mean to you to beat Tara after having played for her so long ago and
being mentored by her?  
COACH STALEY: You know, I think leading up to the game, you think about all
the wonderful things that we've accomplished together. Also you think about
the things, you know, Tara, we text, we call, we talk to each other throughout
the season.  
  
She's been one of my biggest supporters since I've been in coaching. She's
what's right for women's basketball. She wants younger coaches to have success
in this league.  
  
I can't thank her enough. But then you start thinking about, you know, they
throw up statistics on the television screen, 0-5 coaching against her. You
think at some point the law of averages should play out at some point
(smiling).  
  
But once the game started, I didn't really look at it as Tara VanDerveer. We
tell our players, our opponents are nameless and faceless. We need to go out
there. Because if you start playing the name, you start playing the face, you
start playing the tradition, I think it overwhelms you.  
  
We just approach it like they're any other opponent. We don't get ahead of
ourselves.  
  
Q. A'ja talked about it was tough staying tough with everything that was
going on. What does it do for you guys when she's able to do that? She took
her game to a different level when she couldn't score the points she wanted
to, things like that.  
COACH STALEY: I mean, A'ja, she's come a long way as far as handling
physicality. We know that teams are going to, you know, wall up and smother
her. I didn't think she handled the double-teams and triple-teams well
tonight.  
  
But she found a way to impact the game other ways. Getting in there and
rebounding the basketball. If we don't have her contributions on the boards,
you know, we're not playing on Sunday night.  
  
But really proud of how she stuck in there, hung in there, not got down on
herself, because she found herself in familiar grounds, playing in the SEC,
seeing so many different looks like that. You tend to figure out, you know,
Maybe it's not my night from an offensive standpoint, let me go try to impact
it somewhere else.  
  
Q. With losing Alaina to that nagging ankle injury, how much is it an
initiative that A'ja Wilson has stepped up like she has?  
COACH STALEY: I think with A'ja, knowing she didn't have her partner in crime
for the remainder of the season, I think she kind of exhaled a little bit. She
figured out ways in which she can still impact the game.  
  
We've moved her around and allowed her to kind of control the paint. She's
taken the approach of, you know, keep it moving forward, let's do it for
Alaina (Coates). She's not able to help us out physically, so let's make sure
we give her every opportunity to get another ring, because Alaina Coates likes
rings. She wears all her rings all the time on every finger. We want to add
one more to the collection (smiling).  
  
Q. Coach, you seemed slightly sluggish in the last two minutes of the
second quarter. You regained the lead at about 3:25 and never looked back.
What do you think was the biggest difference? What adjustment did you make at
halftime?  
COACH STALEY: The biggest adjustment was speeding up the game. We couldn't
play at that pace, shoot the ball the way we were shooting the ball. We had to
figure out a way in which to create some easy buckets in transition. I thought
we pressured the ball when we came out of halftime.  
  
During the middle of the third quarter when they got settled in with how we
were playing, we went to a zone. I thought the zone bothered them a little
bit, forced them to take some outside shots, and they missed. They missed a
lot of shots in the third quarter that we capitalized on. That was all because
of the pace of the game changed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

## March 31, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, UConn - 64, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Connecticut.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from Coach Auriemma and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, you know, when you get to this point in the season,
and you lose, it's the worst feeling imaginable.  
  
The excitement that was in Mississippi State's locker room, we've been there.
We've been there lots of times. We've experienced that probably more times
than normal.  
  
Today, you know, they deserved to win. They beat us. We had our chances. I
mean, they beat us. They took us away from the things that we like to do. We
didn't have the kind of maturity that you need to win at this level at this
time of the year.  
  
Some of our young guys got a little bit ahead of themselves. That's okay. We
went in the locker room and we experienced some of the things that a bunch of
other kids have experienced against us.  
  
I'm proud of our team. I'm proud of our kids. They had an incredible run. But
we came up against a much better team tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kia, can you talk about the way the game started, and what you think
that did to you guys mentally.  
KIA NURSE: They started the game obviously with an intensity, and they came
out and they made a push fast. Kudos to them for that.  
  
I think for us personally, we had to get back to UConn basketball. Stay
engaged and stay together.  
  
Q. Gabby, can you talk about that final play defensively, what you guys
were trying to do, how it turned out.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I mean, we didn't want them to penetrate too deep, which they
did. We were trying to face guard a little bit and put some pressure on the
guards so they couldn't bring it up as fast. Just had some help defense. But
came up short.  
  
Q. For both players. Can you describe what this run has been like for
you guys over the last couple of years.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It's been incredible, and I'm really proud of what we've done,
especially this year, with kind of the gap that we've had to fill.  
  
I wouldn't want to be with anybody else right now. I wouldn't want to have any
other people as my teammates. I'm proud of what we've done.  
  
KIA NURSE: It's been quite a fun ride. It's been a challenge. I think we
handled it pretty well. It was something that we hadn't -- roles we hadn't
been in, circumstances we hadn't been in. Unfortunately, it came short.  
  
But the people that we did it with, the help that we got from the coaches,
that's irreplaceable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, could you elaborate a bit on the things they took away or
disrupted tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, normally we're a little more patient on offense. I think
we became a lot less patient. We started to try to make some individual plays.
We kind of got out of playing five-on-five, you know.  
  
It was very, very disjointed, that whole first half. There was no rhythm to
our game. We usually have a tremendous flow. We just never got one in that
first half especially.  
  
Obviously we got one in the second half. But the first half, you know, I can't
even say I'm surprised. I mean, it's something I've been talking about to the
guys that cover our team all year long. I've been talking about it all year.  
  
We're playing way above our years and way above our experience level. Tonight
it caught up to us. When we really needed to be a little more mature with what
we're doing, we didn't have it. A big part of that was because of what they
were doing.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the defense in that final sequence, trying to deny
either (Dominique) Dillingham or (Morgan) William penetration?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, we knew -- well, first of all, having the ball
with 12 seconds left was not Plan A. Obviously they had a little more time to
get something done.  
  
But the kid made a great play. I thought Saniya (Chong) did a pretty good job
defending her. We said if they're going to make a shot, it's got to be a pull-
up jump shot. Can't be a standstill, can't be a layup.  
  
That's one of the toughest shots to make from that distance under that kind of
pressure. So, you know, I always tell my team, one play doesn't cost you a
game. It almost never does. One play doesn't cost you a game. But a lot of
times, you know, one play will win you a game. That's exactly what she did.  
  
Q. Geno, you weren't surprised to see the kids struggle with their
composure late in the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Late in the game? Struggled with it in the beginning of the
game. I think a lot of it is, like Kia said, we kind of lived a charmed life
for a long time, for a whole five months. Pheesa (Collier) played like a
fifth-year senior, and today she struggled. (Katie) Lou (Samuelson) has been,
you know, incredibly consistent all year long. Today she struggled.  
  
You take that and put it together against a really good team in this
environment... I told them at halftime, It's a miracle we're only down eight.
We knew we were in good shape. We knew it was going to be only a matter of
five, six minutes before we got it back.  
  
But they were just better. They were just better. You know what? When stuff
like this happens, it kind of makes me shake my head and go, You know how many
times this could have happened and it didn't happen? The fact that it never
happened, that doesn't mean I went home thinking, It's never going to happen.
I knew this was coming at some point. I'm just shocked that it took this long
to get here.  
  
Q. Coach, could you take us through the flagrant foul call, what the
explanation was from the officials.  
COACH AURIEMMA: There was a sequence where somebody was going to the basket,
and Lou was cutting. There was a collision underneath the basket. Lou went
flying out-of-bounds. They looked at the monitor, and they said she got hit
with an elbow or a forearm in the face or something. By rules, they have to
call that. I don't know why they didn't call it when it happened. They were
standing right there. But that's what they said.  
  
Q. Geno, can you talk about the mettle that these kids had to win 111
straight games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they didn't. They won 36. It's a lot. They finished
36-1. That's their record. That's what they own. That's all theirs.  
  
I'm proud of what they've been able to do, how much they changed from last
October, you know. When we started October 15th to where we are today, as I
said, these kids were way older than they were supposed to be. They should
have shown their age early on in the season, November, December, at some
point. We just kept playing like older, older players, more mature players.  
  
I watched last year's Mississippi State game. The score at the end of the
first quarter was like 28 or something to 4. Stewy had I think 15 or 18 in the
first quarter, you know.  
  
These kids have never really been in situations like they were in today. You
know, just wasn't meant to be.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you said to the players when you realized you
were going to have two shots and the ball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's a kid trying to win the game. As I said earlier to a
question, we're impatient. Normally, you know, we go over that scenario a
thousand times. It's the easiest thing to do. Look at the clock. Every day in
practice we said, It's usually not going to be the shot you take that makes
it, it's going to be an offensive rebound. We always just want enough time for
that.  
  
Saniya just tried to make a great play. God bless her. There was a collision
and nothing happened. She's pretty good at drawing fouls. Just impatient a
little bit, that's all.  
  
Q. Geno, when Morgan William hit her game winner, you had a big smile on
your face. It was interesting to watch. Could you share what you were thinking
at that moment as the ball went down.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Kind of some of the things I've already said about how many
times that's happened going the other way, you know. Things happen for a
reason. I just kind of shook my head. This kid's had an incredible run.  
  
When it went in, it was almost like, Of course. Of course, it's going to go
in. She's had an amazing run so far.  
  
Look, nobody's won more than we've won. I understand losing, believe it or
not. We haven't lost in a while, but I understand it. I know how to appreciate
when other people win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Stanford.  
  
We will open with a comment from Coach VanDerveer, then we'll take questions
for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, we're very excited to be here. Our team has, I think,
had a great season, worked very hard. The reason I'm sitting up here today,
one of the main reasons is because of the three next to me, not just their
outstanding play, but their outstanding leadership and their commitment to
their teammates and to Stanford.  
  
I think the seniors, I'm really so proud of their senior year. I hope they are
also equally proud of it. It's just been a lot of fun working with them, and
to see their growth and development and improvement. We want to keep it going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, there was such a sort of joyous release when you won that
game, which was very tight and tense. How do you -- you switched gears to
being so excited to be here to be excited to stay here and keep playing?  
ERICA McCALL: I think it's like Tara said, we switch gears fast. Coming off
the win from Texas, we had to emotionally click the switch on and get ready
for Notre Dame. Got to celebrate for maybe one day afterwards.  
  
That game against Notre Dame is back behind us know. We're focused on South
Carolina, and I think we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Karlie, how does the experience of having played with your older
sister in the Final Four compare to now playing with a younger sister on
another team?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yeah, it's different 'cause she's on a different team this
time (smiling).  
  
It's just as fun. We got to hang out a little bit at the salute dinner last
night at the ranch. Yeah, it's definitely a different experience because we're
not working for the same thing, but we're both excited to be here.  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk a little bit about A'ja Wilson and the
challenges she presents. She's 6'5 ", dominating the paint, especially in the
tournament.  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, Wilson is a great player. Finishing really well down low.
I think it's going to be a big battle for us.  
  
I'm really excited for the matchup, though, one of the best players in the
nation, get to battle against her. I'm looking forward to that matchup.  
  
Definitely looking forward to the challenges, however, because she can finish
well down low. She finishes well with her left hand. So I'm definitely going
to need some help from my teammates, but I think we can take on the challenge.  
  
Q. Bri, I want you to travel back in time a little bit, OC Rhythm,
Carlos and all that. You saw the Samuelsons, you were all kids in that gym. Is
it weird? You have your roommate, you knew (Katie) Lou (Samuelson) on the
other side. Tell us what it was like back then.  
BRIANA ROBERSON: I mean, it was really fun. We had little nicknames for each
other. We worked out. We had OC Rhythm clinics. I don't know, I knew they were
special players even back then. Their work ethic getting to the clinics early,
all of us really. We all did have the same trainer growing up, Jason Wright.  
  
I knew through their work ethic, they were going to be special. It's not a
surprise that we're all here today.  
  
Q. Karlie, when you came to Stanford, the spot-up shot was a given, but
your offensive efficiency is basically throughout everything you do. I'm
curious how you trace that development of being able to score in every
conceivable way, and if you see any weakness in your offensive game?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I definitely see weaknesses. I think I'm best at my three-
point shot. I've definitely gotten better from my freshman year to now in
scoring different ways.  
  
But, yeah, there's obviously a lot I can work on. I am proud of where I've
come, but I think my teammates do a really good job of giving me the ball, the
place I like most, which is behind the three-point line.  
  
Q. Karlie, another question about Lou. Do you have any agreement on a
communications blackout at any point? Are you texting freely at the moment and
deciding at some point you will go in your respective corners if it comes to
that?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: We're texting freely, of course. We're talking. Obviously if
we both win, we're probably going to focus just on the game. Haven't thought
about that too much. Really just focusing on each other's games this Friday,
yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a time, I mean, the first six you were here every
year. It was almost taken for granted Stanford was going to be in the Final
Four, like UConn. Having a couple years when you didn't make it, does it make
you appreciate it more getting back here?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. It's never easy to get here. We're very fortunate to be
here this year. I think that, you know, women's basketball, there are -- when
we first went in 1990, I think there had been total of eight or nine teams
that had ever been to the Final Four. Obviously now there's a lot more.  
  
But it's harder. Sometimes you just need the right matchup, make a big play.
We're really excited to be back.  
  
It's not like we've been gone too long, though. I think we went for a stretch,
then we were off for about 11 years. This is better than that (smiling).  
  
Q. Would you characterize your relationship with Dawn when she was a
player for you on the '96 (Olympic) team, what your relationship has been with
her since.  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think I've always had a very good relationship with Dawn.
But, you know, sometimes as a player, you're going to tell 'em things they
don't want to hear. So, I mean, Dawn could probably tell you a couple stories
of things that maybe she didn't want to hear from me.  
  
I always have respected Dawn's competitiveness, her work ethic, her absolute
passion for the game of basketball.  
  
If she tells you she beat me in chess, she's a liar (smiling). We just
compete. I love Dawn. I'm so proud of her. Not surprised at all.  
  
I think she's just a great role model for the young women coming up. I mean,
she carried our country's flag. She's everything you could look for in a
coach, and a friend. It's just a great story. I just want her to keep it
going.  
  
I texted her 'congratulations' after the Florida State win. We had been in
communication because of her being, you know, announced as the national team
coach. I said, I have just one problem, I can't cheer for you on Friday night.  
  
Q. Coach, when the Cal men's job was open, a columnist in the Bay Area
wrote he thought you would be a good candidate. Not to get you to talk about
that in specifics. The NBA commissioner recently said he wants to have a
woman's coach in the NBA. What do you think it's going to take for a woman to
coach either a men's college team or perhaps coach an NBA team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think it will just take someone that has some vision like
maybe Gregg Popovich having Becky Hammon.  
  
It's just a matter of giving people opportunity. I just think there are really
qualified female coaches. I just think it's just a matter of time. The same
way we got maybe close to having a female president. It's just a matter of
time.  
  
Q. Tara, you've coached a lot of great players, whether it's Candice
Wiggins, Nneka (Ogwumike), Chiney (Ogwumike). It was pretty clear in important
moments who the ball was going to. When you have a group now that the points
are spread out, more of a collective, how has your coaching changed,
particularly in late-game situations?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I need more antacid (smiling).  
  
It's very challenging. You know, a lot of it is game-to-game. This has been a
great year for our team, and a great growth for our team, growth for me, to
really figure out this puzzle. As you pointed out in a nice way, it's a
challenge.  
  
We have to figure out during the game, and that might be why sometimes it
takes us a while to get going. This is what's available. This is what we're
looking for. Bri (Roberson) or Marta (Sniezek) or Alanna (Smith), it's not
always going to be the same person.  
  
There was a comfort, kind of a sense of comfort when Chiney was going to come
to the game and give you 25 points, 15 rebounds. There was a security in that.  
  
But at the same time there's a real excitement with this team, just to say,
Hey, we're going to have to make game-time adjustments. Their confidence and
their resilience has been really fun.  
  
But we do go kind of with the hot hand.  
  
Q. Tara, how do you assess A'ja Wilson at this point in her career, both
as an offensive and defensive player?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I mean, she's terrific. First of all, she's very athletic, a
skilled player. Can hit the outside shot. She scores low, runs the floor well.
The team, they get her the ball. She plays with some really good guards that
get her the ball.  
  
She's the proverbial load. You have to play really hard to play against her. I
know our team will battle her, but it's not going to be easy.  
  
Q. Tara, you were just talking about how many qualified female coaches
there are. Earlier today, Geno said maybe the number of female coaches
coaching women's teams right now has gone down because fewer women want to
coach. Do you agree with that? If not, what do you see as the reason why there
are maybe fewer female head coaches coaching women's teams right now?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I would say one thing. Women aren't recycled in the
way that men are. I've had this conversation today already a little bit. But,
you know, last year, as Tom knows, I was very close to Johnny Dawkins, who was
let go at Stanford. Great guy. Great guy. I went in the day he was let go. I
kind of embarrassed myself. I started crying in his office. He's consoling me.
'Hey, Tara, I didn't get it done.'  
  
I told my friend about it. My friend said, 'Don't worry, he'll get a job in a
week.'  
  
That does not happen with women coaches. There is a lot more competition for
women coaches. There are women out there. Maybe research has shown that women,
sometimes they need to check all the boxes before they take a job, whereas a
guy will check two or three. Okay, I can do that job.  
  
As an example, for me at Stanford, I was at Ohio State, I had a very good job
at Ohio State. Andy Geiger recruited me to Stanford. I said no the first time.
He said, 'Let me bring you back.'  
  
Maybe for women, you have to recruit women, you have to really support them a
different way. And women have different roles in their families with children,
things like that. If athletic directors want more women in women's basketball,
maybe they have to look in the mirror and say, 'All right, how can we make
this happen?'  
  
I think it's on their -- it's their plate basically. There are women. If you
want women in your jobs, you have to look to hire them. Keep the pipeline
going, too. You know, get more women in the pipeline.  
  
Q. Tara, on the offensive end, though you spread it around, Karlie is
your most efficient scorer, but she's least efficient in isolation. How do you
balance between getting the ball in her hands and being able to manage that,
making sure you're getting it off the catch? And defensively, I'm curious
whether you think there's an advantage to be able to play South Carolina, a
team that plays at a slower pace, when you have been a lot more effective
defensively in the halfcourt all season?  
COACH VanDERVEER: All right, so offensively. Karlie with the ball is all good
for me whenever she has it, wherever she has it. You know, maybe analytics say
something different. Eye test says to give her the ball, get her a shot.  
  
As far as playing South Carolina, honestly, we play whoever they put in our
bracket. We're here, we're excited. If it was Mississippi State or
Connecticut, you know, whoever it is, we're just going to do the best job we
can getting prepared for who we're playing.  
  
Sometimes in the tournament, like, people maybe overthink it or be careful
what you wish for. I've just kind of adopted the philosophy, like, just be
excited. I told our team, when the bracket comes out, I said, you know -- we
knew we were going, thank goodness, because we were the second to last team
announced, I said, 'Just pretend you won the lottery. No matter who you're
playing, where you're playing, that's our attitude all the way through it.' I
think we've kept it all the way through the tournament.  
  
Q. Tara, Karlie, the last couple of years without playing for the first
time in her life on a team without one of her sisters on and what you've seen
in her growth, being on her own in that way. The second question, a bit about
Dawn, what have you taught her that she might use against you tomorrow?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Karlie has grown as a player. What I've noticed is she put
more time into her game before practice, after practice. She's always the
first one out. She'll be first out there shooting. We get to practice, she
gets a hundred shots before anyone else gets out there. They're putting on
their shoes, fixing their hair, whatever.  
  
As far as what I taught Dawn, I hope she uses all those things that were bad
things that I did (smiling).  
  
I mean, Dawn is her own woman, her own coach. I just think if she learned
anything from me, great. I don't know that I could say what it was. I know
she's going to be really prepared and their team will play really hard.  
  
Q. Tara, this is a question that has been brought up for years, but I'm
curious to hear your response. Geno obviously gets it every time he's here.
When you have one team that is so dominant, it's all anybody can do to get
within 20 points of them, is that really good for women's college basketball
or not? What is your opinion?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I mean, I don't know. I don't think it's good and I don't
think it's bad. I mean, it's what's happening.  
  
Why should anyone be penalized for excellence? He does a great job, they get
great players. Is it bad for women's basketball because it's not spread
around? Maybe it brings more attention to it.  
  
I don't really have a judgment on it. I don't think it's either good or bad. I
think it's just what it is.  
  
Q. Tara, once upon a time in your navigation of a season, all the heavy
lifting was on the front end, and it was take care of business after January.
This year it was quite different. How much did the upgrade in the Pac-12 help
you?  
COACH VanDERVEER: All right. The PAC-10 and PAC-12 I think has always been
extremely competitive. I think it's alternate facts to think it was easy to go
through the PAC-10 all those years with Lisa Leslie, Tina Thompson, all those
great players, all right? I'm going to try to set the record straight.  
  
It's not easy now either, all right? But it was never easy.  
  
What has been the game changer in my mind has been Pac-12 Network, because now
people see these players. If we didn't have Pac-12 Network, maybe we didn't
get some of the better seeds that we've gotten, the same thing would happen
over and over.  
  
When people see a Kelsey Plum, Jordin Canada, Erica McCall, Karlie, they see
these players. It has never been Stanford and the 10 little dwarfs. It's
always been extremely competitive.  
  
Pac-12 Network has been a game changer and it's been awesome, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: It's great to be here. Thank you all very much.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Schaefer, then questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Good morning. Thank you for having us. We're glad to be here.
Really excited about our opportunity. Really proud of my team. We've had
really a special year at 33-4. Coming through the schedule that we've had, I
believe the comments made when the bracket came out was we were in the 'spicy
region', and anyone who come out of that region would be battle-tested and
ready.  
  
We came out of that region. I'm really proud of our kids, for their effort. It
took an extraordinary, obviously, effort to get out of that region, beginning
with the two games at our place, then going on to play in Washington, the
leading scorer in the history of the game, having to deal with Kelsey Plum,
that great team.  
  
Then beating a really good Baylor team, obviously, that was so talented, seven
McDonald's All-Americans. Obviously a team that was favored to get here.  
  
But our kids found a way. They have all year. It was a great basketball game.
Had to be fun to watch for anybody that was watching it. I understand it was
the most watched thing on ESPN that day. Again, awfully proud of our
resilience and toughness that day.  
  
It's been that way all year with this team. They've been great all year long,
in the moment. They've embraced those opportunities. We know we have a
tremendous challenge in front of us going against a team that's the best
program in the history of the game, coached by the best coach in the history
of the game, men or women.  
  
We know what's in front of us. We've had to deal with it before. Obviously we
dealt with it last year, and it wasn't a real good experience.  
  
But I think we've grown from that day; we've learned from it. We're going to
do our very best to play a really good ballgame tomorrow night.  
  
Again, these kids have earned the right to be here, make no mistake about it.
I'm just proud to be their coach. We're looking forward to an opportunity
tomorrow night in Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Victoria, whether it's in person or on film, what does UConn do
differently as opposed to any other opponent you've played?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: UConn is a very good team. They run the floor a lot. They
make smart plays. They're just a really great team. On film and off film, you
can tell they're a really great team.  
  
Q. For all the players. The experience this year, you haven't played
yet, can you talk about how this is different so far, maybe how there's a
different sense of understanding what this is all about, the distractions,
what it's been like so far, how you hope it's different Friday?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like we've grown as a team since last year. We're
better overall. I feel like we're in better condition to go out there and
compete. Last year, I feel like we was a little timid to go out there, and it
showed. This year I feel a little different vibe in the locker room, practice,
that we can go out there and compete with them.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I feel the same as Morgan. We was a different team last
year. Like she said, we growed this year, became a better team. And going into
this game this year, I feel like we're more confident. We have a chance just
like everybody else has a chance.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Same as they said. I think we're a different team this
year. I think they're also a different and great team this year, too. They're
fast. They have a great transition game. They execute offensively. They're
well-coached.  
  
But we're well-coached, as well. We're a much better and deeper team this
year. I think it's going to be a great game and a great matchup.  
  
Q. Morgan, how are you different as a player this year? Is it your
confidence or more than that?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: This year from last year, I'm healthy this year, confident as
well. I feel like I'm back to playing myself than I was last year.  
  
I have a big role. I mean, I had the same roles, but this year I had to fill
the role of talking, being a leader, being the one that sets a tone for our
team. I try to have a good day every day so my teammates can, too.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: And she had a broken leg last year, too. Played with it the
whole year, too. Had a broken leg, so...  
  
Q. For any of the players. Geno Auriemma in here earlier said he sees a
huge difference in the way y'all are playing now than before Vic made the
change, four new starters. I just wonder how y'all think it affected you?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think a big thing that went into the change is the
two-week break we had coming out of SEC play. We got back and we had practices
for that whole two weeks. We just worked a lot on our offense, executing
offensively, setting better screens, coming off those screens better.  
  
I think as a whole we just got better offensively. We really focused on
executing. We knew if we wanted to win big ballgames, you have to execute
offensively down the stretch. That was a really big focus for us.  
  
Him changing up the lineup, we've changed up the lineup many times throughout
the year in practice. We were already used to the lineup change.  
  
I think everybody's comfortable playing with each other. I think that has a
big deal to do with our chemistry. We have great chemistry no matter what. I
don't think it really affected us, like, comfortable-wise. We're all
comfortable with each other, so...  
  
Q. For all three student-athletes. A year later, what did you learn
about that game against UConn? How much of a motivation is it for you guys now
to prove that you aren't that team that played against UConn last year?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think we just learned that we cannot be all tied up.
Last year I think we were just tied up. Came out, they had us down 20 to
something already. Can't come out tired out if you want to play against UConn.  
  
We just got to be confident, come out ready to play. I think if we come out
ready to play, we'll be fine.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Feeding off what she said, we have to come out and play
comfortable. Last year we got down fast. I feel like coming into the game
Friday, let it speak for itself. Let us see what we do, what they do.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: After the game, it's kind of like a reality check as a team,
as a whole. I feel like going into pre-season workouts and stuff, you really
just wanted to work your butt off, develop more as a player, like number one,
two and three draft picks. We had a lot to work on, and it was an honor to
play against them. That season, I just really wanted to work hard and get back
to this point.  
  
Q. Did you watch the tape of that game at all since then? What did you
learn from it? Also, this team which is known for its defense has been scoring
a ton lately. What's changed to get the offense going to put up these crazy
numbers?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Yeah, we have watched the film a lot. After we played
them last year, we watched it a lot, before the season even started, just to
remind you how fast the game can get away from you.  
  
I think it taught us we have to compete each and every possession, take it one
possession at a time. If you take it from there, it will be fine.  
  
What was the second question?  
  
Q. Offense.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Offense, okay.  
  
Just like I said earlier, I think just practicing our offensive execution has
helped us a lot, setting better screens, coming off the screens better. Then
having a point guard like Morgan, who can lead your team, get people where
they need to be, helps.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Yeah, again feeding off Dom, we saw that film a lot last
year. Even walking in the weight room, our strength coach has 60 on, like, the
window. We see it every day. It didn't leave our heads at all.  
  
To be put back in this position mean a lot.  
  
For the offense, like she said again, we executed plays, we started working on
our offense. Even though our defense is good, we had to start working on our
offense. We had to start working on plays, cutting off screens better.
Shooting the ball. Coach say like, You got a good shot, but get the great
shot.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Like they said, we did watch film. He made us remember that.
We don't need to forget that game. It's staying in the back of our minds so we
don't be complacent.  
  
The scoring piece, I feel like changing lineups, it gave everyone confidence,
like people who play behind them and behind me. For me personally, it helped
me as a point guard 'cause playing with the second lineup, it made me talk
more. Had to build the confidence in them, let them know, like, when I work
hard to get an open shot, you need to take the shot. Stuff like that.  
  
Blair did a great job. Teaira, all them did a good job coming off the bench as
starters. I'm just proud of them. I think that grew, that confidence. Once you
have a sub, I mean, the starters are coming in. I feel like that doubled our
points.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit on Morgan's injury. Was it the
fibula?  
COACH SCHAEFER: She had a crack in her tibia. If you look back at the film,
she wore a protective covering on it all year.  
  
We rested her. We didn't practice her at times all week, things like that.
She'd play in games. Kid's just tougher than nails. I've had other kids that
have had that.  
  
We tried then to see at the end of the year if it would heal, but it wouldn't.
She had a rod put down, like you normally do. It's a common injury. It's one
that doesn't tend to heal.  
  
But obviously now she's back to feeling good and 100%.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I was very close with my parents both, and I buried both
of them. I still remember where I was standing the day I got the phone call
that Donnie had passed. I don't wish that on any young person. It's hard
enough when you're an adult.  
  
She's Blair's roommate. She's at my house more than any other player for
dinner or whatever. So she's someone that I know, because of what she's been
through, I try to provide that stability whenever is necessary, because she is
away from home.  
  
I love all my kids. But there's always a special place in my heart for any
young person who has had to go through dealing with losing a parent. I mean,
it's terrible.  
  
The kid's handling it like a champ. Her mom, Monica, is such a strong, strong
Christian woman. So there is that unique and special bond, you know, that we
have.  
  
Q. Vic, your numbers are overall higher of late on the offensive end.
You've been real efficient all year, 19th in the country in offensive
efficiency. How much of that has to do with Morgan being healthy and putting
you guys in better positions? Then specific to her playing through that
injury, do you think she found some ways to compensate that allow someone who
is 5'5 " to do things like score around the rim?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. We probably need to remeasure, because I'm pretty sure
she ain't the five and the second part of that.  
  
Anyone that deals with what she dealt with obviously is a really tough kid. I
mean, when Morgan makes a move, there's so much torque, you know, involved.
Really. So getting through that, certainly I think she's learned a great deal.  
  
At the same time, you know, you look back to our Baylor game. We had four
turnovers total. I think we had one at halftime. That's an amazing stat this
time of year. We forced 17, which that was the stat of the game at the end of
the day, 17-4 in turnovers was the stat of the game by far.  
  
Our offensive efficiency I think really starts with her, no question about it.
I want the ball in her hands. I want her to make some decisions with the ball.  
  
You watch Connecticut the other night, just completely disrupted Oregon.
That's concerning, but at the same time, you know, I know with Morgan and
really the offense that we run, you know, we're pretty good at doing some
things, creating space and going off the bounce.  
  
We have shooters. That's the thing. I've said this all along about the change
in the lineup. We put kids on the floor that were hot. They were making shots.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at our stats over the last five
games going into the SEC tournament and in the SEC tournament and seeing who's
hot and who's not.  
  
At some point as a coach, you got to start playing some kids that are making
shots that you've been watching every day in practice. As long as they're not
a defensive liability, you got to play those kids.  
  
That's what we did. Blair had 39 in the regional, 21-18, led us in scoring.
She'd been making shots for weeks. It was time to get her in the lineup.  
  
Teaira deserved to start. Really, for her, it was more of Chinwe had been
getting a quick foul. So I was just trying to buy Chinwe some time. She had
two fouls like the first Minnesota at Tennessee earlier in the year. I was
trying to buy her some time.  
  
Then Teaira, I didn't really want to start her. Probably could have midway
through the SEC schedule. But I felt like she could be the Sixth Player of the
Year, which she was. I didn't want to keep her from having that opportunity.
Obviously we had great continuity and chemistry.  
  
At the end of the day, let me tell you, Roshunda Johnson, she's been nicked
up, dinged up all year long, fighting through nagging injuries. If we can ever
get her back going, she's an offensive weapon, again, that can create her own
shot, can stretch the defense.  
  
At the end of the day, that's kind of what's contributed to us. Like Morgan
said, she plays with those kids every day. Those kids have been in big
ballgames. Blair had made three threes, including the go ahead three at
Tennessee that helped us beat them.  
  
Our kids could care less who is out there jumping center. That's really what
we're talking about, who is out there jumping center, compared to how many
minutes they're playing in a game. The minutes haven't really changed that
much.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed when I asked the kids the question about the UConn
game, watching film, there was kind of a wink and a nod between you and them,
like they can answer the question saying what they said. Did you watch the
film to learn what you can do, since UConn's personnel is completely different
with the three gone? What did you learn out of the film? How did the whole 60
number in the weight room come about?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we watched the film when we got back. We watched it
leading into the season. We haven't watched that film. What I've shown them,
you know, here, we showed bits and pieces of that game. You can probably
figure out which piece we showed.  
  
But, you know, there wasn't a whole lot of great things to show. I mean, when
you get beat 60, it's embarrassing. I think the big thing we learned that day
was the speed of the game. They were Speedy González fast. They were really
fast. We walked into the gym that day with six players in walking boots, and
it looked like we still had 'em on when we were playing.  
  
It was a humbling, embarrassing experience for all of us. I think that's the
big thing you learn, is the speed of the game. Let me tell you, this team is
no different. I know the names have changed with some of them. The team is no
different. Great chemistry. Great defensive team. Great offensive chemistry.
Great skill sets. They are fast.  
  
So that's the piece that hopefully with us won't be new this year. We
understand going in, we better run the floor or they'll run us out of the gym
in a hurry again. That's the piece that has been the most concerning of all in
preparing for them.  
  
You watch on film. When they get a rebound, there's not one player that turns
and takes a step. They're turning and taking a stride. They are running.
That's the difference, I think, with them when you're dealing with them. I
mean, it's really a challenge.  
  
Q. Vic, from your Texas A &M days, it looks like you still mine Texas
for recruiting for talent. How much do you do that? Could you address
contributions you've gotten from your Texas contingent this year on your
team.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, all four of those kids have been special. We're always
going to recruit Texas. Obviously I'm a Texas boy, born and raised here. Have
so many colleagues and friends that are high school coaches in the state.
We've got four kids on our team right now.  
  
Ketara and Dom and that senior class are very, very special. Then Teaira is a
sophomore and Blair is a junior. We'll always recruit this state.  
  
Those kids have all been impacts, no question about it. They have impacted our
program. Again, because of my relationships with so many people in this state,
we'll continue to try to get back in and recruit the best kids.  
  
The thing you got to remember is everybody wants to talk about the next
McDonald's All-American. We get together as a staff, Who are we going to get?
I want to know where we're going to get the next Dominique Dillingham, a kid
that wasn't highly recruited, but has impacted our program as much as anybody
I've ever signed. Her toughness, physical, aggressive. I mean, she's just a
tough, physical, aggressive basketball player. That doesn't say anything about
her jump shot.  
  
You got to have kids like that. So we'll continue to recruit this state.  
  
Q. How much of playing UConn is in the head, playing against that
winning streak, the legacy, the national championships? How do you address
that, the perception that everyone is playing for second place?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, there's nothing you can do about it. It's there. It
doesn't matter how much you do talk about it or don't talk about it.  
  
Last year I talked about it a lot. This year, you know, we're trying to treat
it just like another business trip. This team has been really good on the
road. We spent most of non-conference on the road. We only had three home
games. So this team has done a great job of going on the road and being
businesslike.  
  
It wouldn't matter if you were playing Connecticut on the road, home, or here
at the Final Four. You're still dealing with a well-oiled machine that is
well-coached, has great players, and they're always going to play great.  
  
That's what we have. So to combat that, we have to continue to play like we're
playing, which right now we're playing as well as we've played all year. If
I'm going to have to play them, which I am, now is the time to play 'em, from
my perspective, in controlling the things that I can control.  
  
That's kind of what we've tried to focus on this whole tournament, is let's
control Mississippi State. Let's work on the things that we know we got to get
better at. Let's win the minute, let's win the hour, let's win the day. That's
been what we've done since we got back from the SEC tournament. We scored 48,
49 points in the championship game. Set the game back 30 years offensively.  
  
I don't like having two weeks off after that tournament waiting to play in
this tournament. But it happened at a great time this year for us. It allowed
us to get back to doing some things. Allowed me to make some changes, quite
frankly, work on some things that needed working on. It was really beneficial
for us this time.  
  
Q. Vic, these guys would be hard to prepare for if you had a month, let
alone a couple days. I know you're not going to give the game plan away. Can
you give us a sense philosophically when you started thinking about preparing
for UConn? Do you look ahead in the tournament, send an assistant coach to
scout ahead? Always interesting how a team would like to scout Connecticut
even if Connecticut is not their immediate game.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. For us, we're always -- my players have been great about
it, too. We're great about, Who is next? What time do we play? When is the bus
leaving? That's how we've taken it all year long.  
  
Like you said, you could have told me a year ago when we walked off the floor,
You're going to get them in another year, get ready. I'm not sure how much
time I would have spent on it because I'm worried about 37 games between now
and then.  
  
So as it is, we started getting ready for them when we got home from winning
the Elite 8 game, beating Baylor. We started getting ready for them then. We
were very attentive watching the game that they played on Monday night.  
  
At the end of the day, again, there's only so much you can do because of their
philosophy. Extremely difficult to prepare for, because they're so multi-
dimensional. Each player can do so many different things at each position, it
really creates some mismatches for you.  
  
So, you know, we've got to try to minimize those situations, if we can, the
best we can. The battles that we can deal with, let's deal with 'em.  
  
Q. Coach, with all due respect to Connecticut, you've answered questions
about Connecticut now for three days. How much do you want your kids to go
into the game with the swagger that says, We're Mississippi State? We've won
33 games, we're hot, deal with us?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think we can say that just like that in our room. We have to
be careful stepping outside and have that type of brashness.  
  
For us, we do talk about, Hey, look, we're playing well, y'all. We have four
turnovers tomorrow night, we'll be right there. Take care of the ball. Let's
don't get caught giving up layups that we can't defend.  
  
There's all kinds of things that you talk about. But, you know, again, it's
hard to forget. We're human. Listen, there's not a more humbling thing than
getting beat 60 on a Sunday afternoon, I think it was a Sunday, or Monday,
knowing you're going to the WBCA convention the next week, and they've asked
you to speak about defense to your colleagues.  
  
I mean, I remember calling Danielle, the president of the WBCA going,
Danielle, it's Coach Schaefer at Mississippi State. Are you sure you want me
to give a presentation at the Final Four about defense? We did just give up
98.  
  
That's a humbling deal, y'all. But at the same time I think you grow and learn
from it. Again, our team's different.  
  
Now, we've got to go play. That's it in a nutshell. We just have to go play.
If we'll go play, like we've been playing, look, we just bit a No. 1 seed.
Baylor's pretty good, by the way. They're really good. Got a lot of really
good players. They were so good they were talking about the UConn-Baylor
matchup on Saturday night, before we played them on Sunday. They're obviously
pretty good to a lot of people.  
  
I just think we have to take care of ourselves. Control what we can control,
win the minute, win the hour, try to win the two hours.  
  
Q. Vic, when you came to Mississippi State five years ago, did you think
you could be in the Final Four in five years? Also, just to develop the fan
base. They used to have hundreds at home games on a Sunday afternoon. You had
almost 6,000 on a Friday afternoon. Explain those two things. Did you envision
being here now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Certainly I envisioned being here. I'm not sure anybody
envisioned it happening in five years. It's pretty quick. That first team we
inherited we went 13-17. We didn't panic. We knew what 13-17 looked like. We
went to work, went recruiting.  
  
Those kids that we inherited, we kept every one of them. We didn't get rid of
anybody. We asked them to change, and they did. I give those kids a lot of
credit.  
  
The recruiting piece became very important. I have a tremendous staff. I have
an unbelievable staff. They do a tremendous job developing these young ladies
both on and off the court. They're great role models.  
  
I did believe it. I wouldn't have gone there. I would have never gone to
Mississippi State if I didn't think we couldn't do what we've done. I just
don't know that anybody thought - including myself - that it would happen in
year five.  
  
Our fan base is special. We've averaged over 7,000 fans a game. We're top
seven in the country in attendance. We had 10-5 this year, 10-6 a year ago.
What happened at Mississippi State in women's basketball is very special. You
can count on one hand and two fingers where else that's happening across the
country.  
  
But that's part of building a program. When you go to build a program, it's
not about X's and O's, wins and losses. It is about a fan base. I'm so proud
that the Final Four is sold out tomorrow night. I know my fans had a big part
in that. We're going to have a great contingency here. Great support for our
kids. Just like we had more fans in Oklahoma City than I think Baylor had.
They were loud and proud. We've traveled well to the SEC tournament now for
three straight years. Had as many fans as anybody except South Carolina.  
  
So I think that's the piece that as a coach you're so proud of knowing the
impact that my kids have had on a university, on a community, and on a state.
Again, that's why we do what we do. Very few times in life do you have a
chance to make an impact. These kids have made an impact.  
  
We go in the stands after every game. If we win, we're in the stands. We're
hugging babies and kissing mamas or vice versa. Whatever it takes. But that's
what we do. In this game, that's easy. But I call my team the people's team
because everybody that comes, they want to hug them, tell them how much they
love them, they want to give them a dozen cookies. They want to feel a part of
them. That's what makes our game so special.  
  
So for us, it's been so much fun, so much. It's the best thing I've ever done.
The best decision I've ever made. Again, I give my kids all the credit. People
don't come watch us play because we're standing around in a 2-3 zone. That
might work for other people. It don't work for us. They come see our kids play
because we're a blue-collar, hard-nosed, tough, physical, aggressive
basketball team.  
  
I think the people in our community can identify with that, and they
appreciate that. They want to show their son and their daughter, Hey, I want
you to play like Dominique Dillingham. I want to play fearless and step in
front of a freight train and take a charge. I want to see you compete like
they compete.  
  
That's how you build a program. I'm really proud of that. You know, I got to
give Coach Blair a lot of credit because I sat and watched him for 15 years,
was with him. That's how we built it when I was with him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2017

  

### [Kaela Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26929)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is South Carolina.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Staley, then take some questions.  
  
COACH STALEY: We're excited to be here, playing in the third weekend of the
NCAA tournament. Look forward to the challenges that lie ahead of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kaela, all season long you've been most efficient on the spot-up
shooting. Obviously your game has had to evolve beyond that here in the NCAA
tournament. What do you see in that growth? What area has been most effective
for you during the NCAA tournament?  
KAELA DAVIS: I think it's just been attacking the paint, being aggressive, not
just settling for jump shots, just kind of looking past that first defender,
and, like I said, trying to get points in the paint.  
  
Q. A'ja, you're from South Carolina. You know all the great things about
the state, some of the not-so-great things. What do you think it's like to
have two minority head coaches representing this state and the school in the
Final Four, be such good representatives for the state and the school?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it's a great thing. Like you said, I'm from South
Carolina. Just to see the two coaches really come up and really change the
program, build our school, bring something so positive back home, to the state
of South Carolina, is always a great thing.  
  
I love this feeling. I love this sight I'm seeing. The sky's the limit for
both of these programs.  
  
Q. A'ja, you were here a couple years ago in the Final Four. What did
you learn from that experience as one of the veterans of the team, and what
have you told the younger ones who have not been here before?  
A'JA WILSON: I've learned that it is just a different feeling, it really is. I
mean, when you got to play, you don't know if the next game is guaranteed, you
don't take anything for granted.  
  
That's something I really want to tell my teammates. The biggest thing I've
been preaching is I don't want my teammates to feel the way I felt last year
and the year before that. It's not a good feeling.  
  
I want to try my best to kind of get this team to not have that feeling, want
to have the opposite feeling of what I felt. It's something that I've tried to
make them aware of. I'm pretty sure they all know you can't really take this
game of basketball for granted.  
  
Q. For any of the three players (laughter). So for the two players, what
is the easiest thing from what you've seen in scouting Stanford now, and what
will be the most difficult thing?  
KAELA DAVIS: I mean, I think, honestly, it's the Final Four. I don't really
think there's anything easy. I think we just have to play our game, honestly.
Stanford, they're playing really, really, really well right now. I think, what
was it, 80 assists on 105 field goals is what they're doing in the tournament
now. That's crazy.  
  
They're sharing the ball, shooting the ball well. They're getting scoring from
a lot of different players, production from a lot of different players.  
  
You know, we've been playing really well on the defensive end. I think that's
something we're definitely going to have to continue.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, just really going off of that. Don't really have much to
add (smiling).  
  
Q. A'ja, South Carolina has made its bones on the defensive end of
things. Do you think your offensive versatility is something that maybe
sometimes gets overlooked? Do you feel like you're able to change the
perception of South Carolina offensively with what you're able to do on the
floor?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't know, honestly. I think we all have different styles of
game. I think we all adjust to our system. That's what makes our system so
great.  
  
I really wouldn't say that my offense really gets overlooked, honestly. I
think I just kind of play my role. That's something we've all done on this
team.  
  
I honestly wouldn't say it gets overlooked.  
  
Q. For both players. What would you say was the most difficult moment
for you this season, and how did you and/or your team overcome it?  
KAELA DAVIS: That's a really good question. Most difficult moment?  
  
I mean, I think, you know, any of the losses that we had this season were all
difficult. I mean, I think obviously starting off with Duke, I think that hit
us pretty hard.  
  
I think we've found a way to learn from each one of those experiences and to
not just take them as losses, take them as lessons, as well.  
  
I think we've just found a way to, you know, take a little bit of adversity,
you know, just come back from it.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I was going to say, the losses that we kind of overcame
throughout this season.  
  
Q. For both players. What is one thing specifically that Coach Staley
has done for you to help you improve your game this season?  
KAELA DAVIS: There's a ton of things. But, you know, coming in, for me, it was
really just on the defensive end, just kind of staying engaged, staying locked
in with whatever we're doing, whatever's going on.  
  
For me, I think it's just been a way to not only be effective offensively but,
you know, be an overall player and be effective defensively as well.
Especially when I had a little lull there, offensively I wasn't doing great, I
had to find a way to stay on the floor and be productive while I was there.  
  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think I can actually, like, pinpoint how much she's
really helped me with my game, honestly. She's helped me all around, whether
it's mentally, physically, emotionally throughout. Just taking the game in,
just knowing...  
  
What do you always say? When you give something to the game, the game always
gives it back to you.  
  
COACH STALEY: The game is a gift.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, the game is a gift. You get what you put in. It's going to
return what they think you deserve.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We will dismiss the student-athletes back to
the locker room.  
  
We will continue with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you played for Tara in the Olympics in '96, did you
appreciate then what you appreciate about her now as a coach?  
COACH STALEY: I do. '96, that entire year, just opened my eyes to seeing
basketball coached and played at a different level. The amount of pressure
that was on our team, on Tara, she made us feel all of the pressure that was
on her. She didn't want the team to fail.  
  
I feel like from my experiences with her, she taught me how to approach the
game, how to approach pressure situations, and how to execute while being
under that amount of pressure.  
  
Q. Dawn, I know you've been to Final Fours as a coach. When you look
back at your time as a player, is there still experiences from that Final Four
that you still draw on, maybe you try to give to your players? Also, as part
of that Final Four, your team played Tara twice on the way to their two
championships, and you faced Geno in his first Final Four appearance. Did you
pay much attention to that at that point?  
COACH STALEY: I didn't pay much attention to the coaching when I was playing.
You know, the emotions, as I reflect on participating in the Final Fours, not
being able to win a national championship, is the thing that fuels me as a
coach, you know, to check that box off.  
  
Fortunately I've been around some great players to get us back at this point
to compete for a national championship. Hopefully our day has come.  
  
Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk, Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner,
talking about maybe a women's coach in the NBA. What do you think it's going
to take to have either a women's coach coach a men's team in college or at the
NBA level?  
COACH STALEY: Opportunity. Opportunity. Basketball is basketball. It doesn't
have a gender. It has a mind. It has an approach. It has a willingness. Given
the opportunity, women can excel in this game. As you can see. Becky Hammon is
doing a great job. You need more people like Coach Popovich to give them
opportunities to learn, to grow, and to embrace it.  
  
I don't think he sees gender. I think he sees someone that has a great
basketball mind, that's tireless. Once you're given that opportunity, you see
great things come out of it.  
  
Q. Other coaches, do you communicate with them? You don't have to say
their names. Do they share words of encouragement for you? And how did you get
the name Miss Magic growing up?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I talk to other coaches, definitely. If you're in this
game long enough, you want to create an edge, no matter where you are. You do
it through your network of friends, coaching, to figure out how you can make
your team better. We often do that.  
  
As far as Magic, you know, growing up in Philly, I like to say that my game
was probably more open court and more flashy than your regular, average
player. I like to pass the ball. Magic was the best to do it.  
  
Q. Philosophically, when Coates went down, how did you and your coaching
staff approach what you were going to do afterwards? It was interesting to
hear Tara VanDerveer talk about how you may actually be a tougher team to
guard right now because the ball is spread more, seems like there's more
avenues for you to attack offensively.  
COACH STALEY: When Coates went down, obviously we were concerned. She's
someone that has contributed to our program for the last four years. She's
gotten us SEC Championships, both regular season and tournament championships.
She's got us to the Final Four.  
  
You exhale for a second because you feel bad for her. Then once that moment
passes, you got to get your healthy bodies ready to go. You got to get their
minds ready. You got to get them ready spiritually, physically, emotionally.  
  
I mean, we never looked back. We never fretted it. We never felt like we
didn't have enough in the room to get it done.  
  
The part that I'm, you know, proud of is the way that they've come together.
They actually have gotten closer because of it. That's what you need your
teams to do in an adverse moment.  
  
I mean, you can't foresee the chemistry part of it. A lot of what we're doing
is because of the closeness of this team, because of Alaina's injury. That's
how you want your team to respond.  
  
Q. You were talking about women coaching in the NBA. You and Tara are
two of the most prominent women's coaches. But the opportunities for four
decades for women to be able to coach women have been slowly declining. How
big of an issue do you see that as being, women getting a chance to coach
women in college basketball? How do you change the trend, the downward
trend?  
COACH STALEY: I look at it like this. Obviously women are playing at a high
level, which makes our game attractive to men's coaches. That's a great thing.  
  
And also, you know, it reduces the amount of female coaches in our game
because of it. So we've made it popular. We've made it appealing to male
coaches. Now they want to, you know, be a part of our game.  
  
But I think when given an opportunity, just like men are given the opportunity
to coach the women of our game, you tend to have some success with it. I don't
think there should be a gender. I think there should be opportunity, you know,
for all women. I don't think we need to be overlooked at this point.  
  
Years ago only women wanted to coach women because it wasn't the popular
thing. But it's becoming more popular. I hope ADs and administrators are not
just looking for the male gender to coach our players.  
  
I'm one that thinks basketball is a place of utopia and fairness. I want to be
looked at as a coach and not necessarily as a female coach. I hope everybody,
you know, approaches it that way.  
  
Q. Is it an important question?  
COACH STALEY: The numbers are looking like it's geared towards that. I know
probably some of my other female colleagues would beg to differ, probably
differ in how I look at it.  
  
But my approach to the game has been, you know, loving the game. It loves me
back. That's the approach that I take from it.  
  
Q. Dawn, a couple weeks ago when Temple lost, the way they lost, Tonya
was talking about seniors, the dynamic of the game. You don't see it coming.
You had a tough one against Tara in '92. How long did it take you to get over
that?  
COACH STALEY: I still remember that. I think as many wins that I've been a
part of, it's the losses that really sting. '90, '91 and '92 all were
opportunities for us to win a national championship. But the last one was
probably the hardest one.  
  
I often look back on it and wish I had approached it a little differently
because I do think I could have made Angela Taylor foul me. Especially they
put her in the game just to guard me in that last play. I just popped out -- I
should have popped out and stopped.  
  
At the rate -- I can't say that. I can't continue. I could have made her foul
me in that instance (laughter).  
  
Q. Dawn, you played Mississippi State a couple times this season in
really, really tough games. What makes them so tough to play? Are you not
surprised to see them here, as well as you?  
COACH STALEY: Not surprised to see them here. They're very well-coached. They
are experienced. Their team has been together for the last three or four
years. They're very calculating in what they want to do from an offensive
standpoint. Defensively they're pretty stingy.  
  
Vic has done a great job as just building, having some success in our league.
When you're having success in our league, when you transition to the NCAA
tournament, you know, it puts you in the position where you're ahead of the
game.  
  
Then, you know, for how they defend, for how they rebound, how they're
calculating on the offensive end, I'm not surprised to see them here on the
biggest stage of women's college basketball.  
  
Q. Your men's team, the South Carolina men's team, have any benefits
that you don't have?  
COACH STALEY: Right now the benefit is they'll probably get all of our fans
because it's their first time going to the Final Four. But as far as benefits
--  
  
Q. Program benefits.  
COACH STALEY: Program benefits? No, we pretty much get what we want. It may be
different. We get what we want in order to be successful.  
  
That's what is great about our administrators, from our president to our AD to
our janitors, we get the same ovation as anybody on campus. Not just
basketball, but football, women's soccer, tennis. All of us feel like, from
our administrators, we feel like we're the only program at our university.
When you can make somebody feel that special all the time, it leads to being
successful.  
  
Q. In terms of your offense, a lot of times your program has been
described as a defense-first team. You are consistently top 20 in offensive
efficiency, though. This year, in particular, it seems like you have your most
diverse offensive team. I'm curious whether you think that is the case. Do you
think it's underrated historically, and do you think this offense gives you
your best chance at a national championship?  
COACH STALEY: Well, here is what has happened over the past few years. We
didn't have as much talent as we have, you know, over the past maybe two or
three years. So we had to do it with defense and rebounding. We built our
program on just that because of the personnel that we have.  
  
Now that we have a more talented roster, we're more versatile. We can do a lot
of different things.  
  
I'm not a systems coach, you know. I play off the personnel that we have. We
put them in positions to be effective. A lot of times it's off the bounce. A
lot of teams that are here, like Stanford, Connecticut, they're a passing
offensive team, a systems team that rely on passing. We're a team that relies
on putting the ball on the floor, ball screen action, and some passing.  
  
I think we have the best of both worlds in that if you take one thing away, we
have some other things that we can rely on because we have the talent to do
so.  
  
Q. Is this year your best offensive year?  
COACH STALEY: I think we've been put in the situation where we've had to make
adjustments. When you've made adjustments, and they work out, it seems pretty
good. I thought our coaching staff did a great job.  
  
Once A'ja Wilson went down for a two-week period, we went to a smaller lineup,
which helped us. When Coates went down, we just adjusted. We perfected the
offense that worked for us. You're seeing us spread the floor a little bit,
utilizing the talent that we have.  
  
Q. Dawn, what did you learn as a coach two years ago when you fell just
short in the Final Four? Along those lines, seeing UConn here year after year,
the consistency, what makes it that difficult to keep on getting back here to
the Final Four?  
COACH STALEY: Well, what we've learned two years ago is probably what we
learned throughout our entire coaching career, and just in basketball. The
margin of error is so small, so small. I mean, if Aleighsa Welch makes a shot
on one entity, we're up three, and the ballgame's over.  
  
But because she missed, we go down, we defended extremely well, so much so we
got a blocked shot, it was an air ball that -- what is her name? Graduated.
She put it back in. I forget her name. She's from Maryland, right? She put it
back in. That's the margin of error, an air ball that turned put them up by
one.  
  
I mean, it's hard getting here. It's very difficult getting to the third
weekend of the NCAA tournament. For us, it's an uphill battle. But because of
the conference that we play in, it provides us a platform to have some success
in the NCAA tournament.  
  
With Connecticut, the way they do things, you know, at the rate that they do
things, I mean, it's pretty special. They do a great job at running their
system on both sides of the ball. They make you rise up to their level of play
year in and year out.  
  
Hopefully by us being here, possibly continuing to play them in the regular
season and hopefully the post-season, you get a little bit closer to reducing
the margin of error.  
  
That's what it is, you have to continue to reduce the margin of error against
a team that is so stingy on both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Dawn, following up on the offensive development you talked about. You
brought in Melanie Balcomb to do some offensive analytics. How did that come
about? What kind of insights have you gotten from that? How much has that
helped with the personnel you have this year?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we found out that Melanie wasn't returning to Vanderbilt.
We wanted to keep great basketball minds in our game. The guys do it all the
time. There's not a great coach on the men's side that is jobless, without
wanting to be in that position.  
  
I just thought it was a great opportunity for us to capitalize on bringing in
a great offensive mind into the fold. It's worked out terrifically. Our
coaching staff has been together, most of us, for nine years now. Sometimes
you're hearing the same things, you're doing the same things. The things that
you're doing work.  
  
But you bring someone like Melanie into the fold, she just gives us a
different perspective on things. Melanie is one that breaks it down. I mean,
she likes counters to everything that she does. Sometimes we look for maybe
one or two options, where she's looking at how the defense is playing and how
we can still run the same play and get maybe a third or fourth option out of
it.  
  
She's constantly throughout the year helping us with that.  
  
Q. Dawn, for people who don't follow the season throughout, and are only
catching the Final Four right now, for any of the other three teams, how would
you describe or explain to someone how to beat a team like UConn who has won
111 straight games?  
COACH STALEY: To beat a team like UConn, you have to prep for them not just in
tournament play. You have to prep for them all season long. You have to work
on something that is effective against them, and you have to perfect it from
day one. You keep working.  
  
They do have the luxury of working on things throughout the year because they
don't have a whole lot of competitive games in their league. So for us, you
know, we play them mid February. They have a month and a half to get ready to
perfect the game against us.  
  
Also with their regular season, they play so many top-level teams in the
country, you know, they're already ahead of the game, just including their
style of play. Again, they make you rise to their level of play.  
  
In order for you to beat a team like UConn, you got to be given opportunities
to play them not just once a year. I think some of the things that we did in
the game against them this year, if given the opportunity to play them on
Sunday, we've been working on those things since then.  
  
That's something that you have to do. It's all about preparation. You can't
come into a tournament like this and think you can beat them off of one day of
preparation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UConn.  
  
We will take an opening statement from Coach Auriemma, then we will take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, it's a long journey really from October 15th, when
we started, to this weekend. A lot happens in four or five months. You go
through a lot. Players change and teams change.  
  
We're no different than anybody else in that respect. But what happened this
year was really remarkable in that the unknown was what everyone talked about
in October. Then throughout the whole season, it became really evident that,
you know, this was a really, really good team, made up of really good players.
They proved it every night. This is where they belong.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. For both players, who is the leader of this team and why? How has
that dynamic transformed during the course of the season?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think that we've all kind of shared the leadership role. Kia
and I, Saniya [Chong] stepped up, Lou [Katie Lou Samuelson] has stepped up.
There hasn't been one person to kind of take over.  
  
I think for different aspects, you know, different people take over certain
things.  
  
KIA NURSE: To kind of piggyback off of what Gabby said, obviously what we
learned from the seniors that came before us is it's never a one-person thing
to have to lead a team on their own.  
  
We decided that this year, different people who weren't in that role before
had to step up and do that. Like she said, it's been a team effort the entire
way.  
  
Q. Kia, what for you was the toughest moment of this season? How, as a
group, did you overcome it?  
KIA NURSE: I think during the beginning of the season, our toughest moments
were in practice, in understanding what we needed to do to be successful.
Because, like Coach said, there was this unknown from a lot of people. With
us, our unknown was: How do we step into these roles we haven't done before,
do them successfully, help out the younger guys as much as possible.  
  
We had a transition to make. We did it as best as we could. It was a
challenge. But I think we stepped up together. With the help of the coaches
and everyone on the team, we did a good job.  
  
Q. For both players. Obviously the team has been here for 10 straight
years to the Final Four. You don't have too much experience on the court in
the Final Four. What have you learned to get you ready for tomorrow night's
game?  
KIA NURSE: Well, obviously we're fortunate to have been here, you know, twice
with the two of us, understanding how the older kids, like Stewy [Breanna
Stewart], Morgan Tuck, Kaleena and Kia, had approached this tournament and
what it took to be a success in it. We're fortunate our ringleader has been
here a couple of times.  
  
Using the advice he gives us, things he helps us in practice, try to take that
as a game plan emphasis.  
  
Q. For both student-athletes. What do you remember about last year's
meeting with Mississippi State? How much has the ringleader and his assistants
told you to block that out, that this is a totally different situation?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Well, they've returned a lot of players. There's some familiar
faces. We've been watching them all year. So we do remember some things about
them.  
  
Like you said, they have evolved and changed, just like every other team
that's here right now. So right now we're just going to face the team that's
in front of us.  
  
Q. For both players. Can you give us a feeling of the legacy? You're
playing for a team that's won 111 straight teams, won 11 national
championships, and now you step up to a leadership role. What is that like? Is
there pressure? Does it make you feel like you're part of this? Take me
through the dynamic of what that's like.  
KIA NURSE: Well, I think no matter what, when you come into a program like
this, there's going to be pressure. What you learn from the moment that you
get here, from the coaches and from the vets who have been here before, is you
learn how to deal with it, how to handle it, how to put it aside when it's not
needed.  
  
When you come here and you have to step into a role of leadership, and it's
difficult, it's a challenge, the best part about it is is the people that came
before you to build this legacy, who had done it so flawlessly, they had the
same challenges, had to get through the same things. You are not doing it
alone. You have the help of your coaches, you have the help of your teammates.
That makes it all the better.  
  
Q. With this week being so intense, what is the most fun part about this
whole process?  
KIA NURSE: Obviously the Final Four itself is something to be celebrated. It's
not easy to get here. It's a lot of fun to be part of. There's a lot of stuff
going on around it.  
  
The funnest part about it is you get to do it with your teammates, with the
people who have put their tail on the line every single day in games and
practices to help get you here. To see the smile on the face of our senior
last night, T [Tierney Lawlor], who got to go to a rodeo. To see how happy she
was, that's probably the most fun part, to be with your teammates and
experience this with them.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It's just a blessing in itself to be here. It's definitely an
opportunity we don't take for granted. Like Kia said, this is our last few
days together, just this team. So we're just going to try to enjoy it.  
  
It's the last trip we'll have with Saniya and Tierney. We want to make sure
they have a good experience, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We will continue with questions for head Coach Geno Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, excuse my language here, but I seem to remember at the
beginning of year you said something to the effect of there are times when you
wish these guys could be more assholes on the court or something to that
effect.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wouldn't say that (smiling).  
  
Q. Well, you probably would. But I wanted to get a sense of how you
think their collective personality is as a group today, and is it different
from what the collective personality was in October?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, in 1998/'99 season, we started the season as the No.
1 team. Well, no. We played three of the top-10 teams in the country in
California in a row. We scored a hundred in every one of those games. We won
every one of those games by, like, 30. We were No. 1 in the country. Everyone
was talking about how they can't believe a team could play that well that
early. We had five freshmen. I mean, they happened to be Hall of Famers, Sue
and them.  
  
Then something happened. Sue got hurt. Things changed. As we got towards the
regionals, I tried to make the team into something they weren't. Like I knew
what they didn't have, and I tried to give it to them. It all backfired on me.
We lost. We deserved to lose because I screwed it up leading up to that.  
  
I tried to force something that has to come naturally, you know. So I thought
about that this year. Right around that time, early in the season, I said, I
can't do this. I can't make them into something they're not. It's not going to
work, you know. Things are going to have to play themselves out. We're either
going to become that or we're not.  
  
Little by little, you know, they started to respond to whatever circumstances
were in front of them. But they've never changed. They haven't become what I
hoped they would become, like edgy and really pissy, just walk out there and
grab you by the throat and choke you, like some teams that I've had.  
  
They just walk out: Yeah, we're probably going to win, so let's just play. I'm
sure something bad will happen during the game, but it's okay, we'll fix it.  
  
Lou, put your hand up on defense.  
  
Well, you know, she's probably going to make a couple threes, but we'll win.  
  
Phees, are you going to guard anybody?  
  
Eventually I will, but it's not like I have to do it all the time. Coach,
really?  
  
They just have this attitude like everything will be fine, don't worry about
it. Yet they keep winning. You know how many times I go home and go, Man, I
hope we get our butts kicked the next game so bad. But it just doesn't happen.
I'm happy for them that it doesn't, but I'm pissed for me (smiling).  
  
Q. Taking that personality of the team, applying it to the Mississippi
State game, a lot of talk about what happened last year. How do you get that
out of their minds, that it's probably not going to be a 60-point game this
year, erase that, all as a fresh start this year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Right. Well just this morning, I watched that game again. I'm
going to remind them at practice today.  
  
There's nobody on this team right now that had anything other than 'I was at
that game' to do with that score. If you watch that game, Stewy [Breanna
Stewart], looked like an NBA player playing against high school kids. Moriah
was so much better than anybody on the floor. And Tuck just dominated long
stretches of the game. So the score was like 30-4 at the end of the first
quarter. I think Lou had one bucket. I don't think Kia had any. The other guys
didn't even play.  
  
If they think they had anything to do with that win, they're going to be
reminded today, No, they didn't. This is not the same Mississippi State team
we played. The turnaround they've made offensively has been remarkable.
They're still the same defensive team that they were. And we're not the same
team by any stretch of the imagination. If those three seniors were here, I
would have a tough time convincing them. But won't be tough with this team.  
  
Q. Geno, you said a little bit there the experience, even though you've
been to 10 straight, those guys really haven't been on this stage. How do you
get them to do the right things to keep this thing going for you guys?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, the only reason we get asked that is because we've
been here so much. That only applies to me and C.D. [Chris Dailey] and Shea
and Marisa to a certain degree, as well. And we're not playing.  
  
So the players that are going to be playing, Kia has played a lot in two Final
Fours. Gabby, not much. Lou, a little bit. Saniya, not at all. Crystal
Dangerfield, not at all. Pheesa, hardly at all.  
  
They don't own any of those 10 Final Fours. They don't own any of those 11
national championships. They only own part of the streak. I mean, the only
thing that this team has to hold onto, I've said this before, is the 36 wins
that they have right now this year.  
  
So going into this weekend, how are they going to handle this situation that
they're in right now? I have no idea. But it's not going to be that much
different than, How is Mississippi State going to handle their first Final
Four? How are those kids going to handle being here for the very first time?  
  
We all have the same issues. This is not an easy environment to play in. Both
teams I think are going to see the effects of that.  
  
Q. Where in Mississippi State's performance do you see there will be a
keynote? Where have you taken some notes from where their development was from
the first game to this one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think, from what I can see, and believe me, I haven't seen
like 40 of their games, however many they've played, but there must have been
a reason why Vic [Schaefer] benched four of his starters. Either it was
because he thought they would be better coming off the bench, or he was upset
about something.  
  
So when coaches make those kinds of decisions, that says a lot about the
relationship that they have with their team and the kind of feel that he has
for his team. And they responded. They responded amazingly well.  
  
I thought in the beginning of the season, offensively, they were good, but not
this good like they are right now. And the big thing that everybody has to
remember is, you know, I don't care how good your defense is, generally
speaking, when you get to this point in the season, you're not going to win
this thing with your defense. I mean, you have to play good defense, don't get
me wrong. But if you can't score, and score when you have to, on demand, in
this tournament, it's really, really hard to win. Really hard to win.  
  
They've done a great job in the tournament of scoring. That's why they're in
the Final Four.  
  
Q. There have been some really good games in this tournament, especially
Elite 8 games, overtime, the Stanford game. What does that mean for the
women's game, to have a tournament like that? What can we do to have more
people pay attention when a tournament is that good?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that seems to have been the question for a long time.
What are you going to do to generate more interest? Part of it has to be the
competitiveness of the games, which that's what happened. It has to happen
every year.  
  
The reason why the NCAA tournament on the men's side has been so compelling
over the years is because of all the upsets that happen. The mid-majors are
starting to get screwed, so maybe that's going to be less and less.  
  
You know, it's the upsets. It's the overtime games. That really attracts
people. On the men's side, it happens all the time. It has to happen more
often on the women's side.  
  
Not in our games, but it has to happen in every other game (laughter). I think
that's kind of a starting point.  
  
Then there's a bigger question, this is not the right venue to talk about it,
but there's some changes that the women's basketball tournament has to make,
to make it better. I don't think they're willing to make that change yet. But
eventually they're going to come to their senses and they will.  
  
Q. Coach, regarding player attitudes, there is a lot made of a comment
you made last year about benching players because of their attitudes. Have you
had issues like that this past year? Do you think they've kind of pulled
themselves together and had a good attitude going into games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, we wouldn't be here if we had issues. Teams
that have those kinds of issues generally don't get this far. Teams that live
with those issues year after year don't get this far as many times as we have.  
  
We've been fortunate over the years not to be completely free of that stuff,
but, for the most part, this year has been relatively easy in terms of getting
everybody to be on the same page the entire season.  
  
Now, that's easy to do when you're only playing six players, or seven. When
there's four players on the bench that think they should be playing, then you
have some other issues. Right now we don't have that. Next year we'll have
that, but right now we don't have that.  
  
That's every coach's challenge. That's why you see so many kids transferring
now. They don't want to buy in. They want it, and they want it now. So far,
we've been fortunate to avoid that.  
  
Q. Geno, not that you're a television programmer, but how do you feel
about the change from Saturday/Tuesday to Friday/Sunday in relation to what
that will or won't mean for the popularity of this year's tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I've said this in the past. TV and what's going on in
the actual arena don't go together. So what's best for television is a 10:00
start on the East Coast, or a 9:30 start on the East Coast. It's not best for
my players to sit around till 9:30 tomorrow night, but it's best for TV
because they're paying the bills. So they get to show the game whenever they
feel like it.  
  
So we're lucky, how does that affect attendance in the arena and what's more
important? We say, Well, you know, at the regionals, there weren't a whole lot
of people there.  
  
Well, you think anybody cares about that? No. They were on TV, weren't they?
That's all that counts.  
  
So what are we trying to do? Fill the arena or make sure people are watching
on television?  
  
People in Dallas have done an amazing job. The arena is sold out. Is it 'cause
it's Friday/Sunday and people don't have to take five days off from work to
wait till Tuesday night to play? I don't know. I don't know. Does ESPN like
Friday/Sunday? No. Are they going to make sure it gets back to Sunday/Tuesday?
Yes. Is that good for us? No. Is it good for them? Yes.  
  
In the end, who is going decide what's what?  
  
I'm not blaming anybody. I'm just saying that that's the world that we live
in. 2002, we played in front of 30,000 people at the Alamodome. Now we're
worried about sellouts? A lot has happened in that time.  
  
You know, we have to figure out how to work together, make it work for the
actual student-athletes, 'cause we always use that term, you know: What's best
for the student-athletes? Not playing at 10:00 at night, that's not best for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. The other folks that have gone with you to all of these Final Fours
are your fans, the aura that has been built over your program over time, the
expectation to win, knowing you're going to win. How much of that aura do you
hope to, like, get your players to buy into? How much of it do you want them
to resist? How do you handle that balance?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Resist, what do you mean?  
  
Q. How much of it do you want to be, This is our team, this is unique to
us, and how much of it do you want them to buy into, This is UConn, this is
the expectation of UConn women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't know that you can always separate the two. We
are what we are. No one's imposed this on us. No one makes us who we are.
We've done this ourselves.  
  
The kids that choose to play at Connecticut are choosing us as much for what
they hope to do when they get there as for what's already been done. They want
to be a part of that.  
  
There's a lot of programs in the country, a lot of sports, even in the pros,
that have that kind of reputation. People want to play there. Like Kia said,
how to separate what's happened in the past from what's happening right now is
important. We've had teams in the past where kids would come to Connecticut
and they thought, Yeah, I get to Connecticut, I go through pre-season, I get
my uniform, then I call my parents and tell them, This is what the parade is
when we win the national championship.  
  
When they realize they're going to get their ass kicked every day in practice,
they don't like it, they quit. Why did you just not come here and come to the
parade? Things don't just happen by themselves. You have to make them happen.  
  
Not every kid understands that part of it. So, yeah, they want to be a part of
it. They want to be part of the legacy. They want to create it. At the same
time, you should see in recruiting. When we're recruiting, like, a great
player out of high school, invariably they'll say, Why do you want to go to
Connecticut? You're going to be compared to Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and
Stewy [Breanna Stewart]. I don't know. Go to someplace where you'll be
compared to somebody no one has ever heard of.  
  
When you come here, there's some things you have to live up to. You can't
escape it. You might as well embrace it, enjoy it, let it help you, rather
than be, you know, something that detracts from you.  
  
Q. Geno, as the unquestioned leader of your sport in terms of everything
you've won, the NCAA, the Olympics, basically since Title IX, the number of
opportunities for women to coach women, that's been in decline. Do you think
that's an issue that needs addressing or not? Have you ever sensed resentment
among your peers because you won so much -- not because you won so much, but
because you're a man who has won so much?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think in the beginning, 30 years ago, 20 year ago, 25 years
ago, yeah, there was a lot of that. There was a lot of that. By everybody? No.
But by a lot of people. This feeling of, Well, why aren't you coaching men?
Which is really the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  
  
But not anymore. I don't think anymore. I mean, there might be some old-timers
that still think that way. But not anymore.  
  
I would like to think I've done too much for the game, for the growth of the
game, for people to resent the fact that I'm a man. That doesn't exist
anymore. I don't even give it a second thought.  
  
As far as opportunities for women. There's a reason why there's not as many
opportunities for women. Not as many women want to coach. It's quite simple.  
  
When I started coaching, I was 21, 22 years old. Somebody asked me to coach
women's basketball, ninth grade girls. I didn't start coaching there because I
thought I'd be talking to you in Dallas. That's what I did because it was kind
of cool, and I liked it.  
  
Then I coached college girls. Then I coached high school guys. Then I was an
assistant at Virginia for four years. I didn't just drop out of the sky and
land at Connecticut with 11 national championships.  
  
So anybody who resents that, that's their problem, not mine. I worked my ass
off to get here.  
  
Back then, women had very few opportunities other than teaching maybe, some
other jobs that certainly couldn't even imagine the opportunities that my
players have today when they graduate. So what happened? Kids graduate from
college. They're pretty sharp. The opportunities available to them, light-
years different than they were when I first started 30 years ago.  
  
Then they look at the profession itself. They go, I really need to put up with
that crap? I can get a job at Travelers, making X, live a normal life. You
want me to sit in a gym with 400 other coaches and watch 17-year-old spoiled
brats play and I have to take five of them to come play for me? Not everybody
wants to do that. Why? They have options that they didn't have 25, 30 years
ago.  
  
So it's not like people are consciously depriving women of opportunities.
There's just too many other choices that, quite frankly, are better choices
for a lot of women. And the ones that do choose to get in it, they're really
passionate about it, they work their butt off. I've never had anything but
women on my staff. I hope they all want to be head coaches. I hope they move
on and become great head coaches.  
  
A lot of them at some point go, I don't like this business. I want to have,
like, a normal life.  
  
What are you going to do? Make them stay in the business? It's a function of
how much we've done to elevate women in our society - not nearly enough. But
they have other choices, other than be a phys-ed teacher and a coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, guys.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and good afternoon, welcome to today's Women's Final
Four head coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll
have the opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Stanford Cardinal,
Tara VanDerveer. Stanford is playing in its 13th Final Four and is pursuing a
third national championship.  
  
Before we get to your questions this afternoon, Tara, if you would, just a
word of welcome, your thoughts on coming to Dallas, being a participant in
this year's Final Four.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Thank you.  
  
Our team is very excited. I think we've worked really hard. This has been a
really fun team for me to work with. I'm really proud of the growth and
development of our players. I really thank our staff for doing such a great
job, our assistant coaches and staff.  
  
This is an incredibly close team. They were really looking forward to coming
to Dallas.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Tara. We'll start taking questions.  
  
Q. Tara, you have an association with Dawn Staley dating back to the
1990 Final Four when she played for Virginia and Stanford won its first
national championship. You coached her on the Olympic team. What traits do you
see in the team she coaches that you recognize from her days as a player?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Dawn is extremely competitive. She's a competitive person,
coach, player. She's very intelligent. She's very passionate about basketball.
I see all of these things, having coached her and known her for, I guess,
about 30 years. I started as a high school coach, too.  
  
All these things contribute to her outstanding job as a coach at South
Carolina and our future Olympic coach.  
  
Q. Tara, can you put in perspective, you and Coach Auriemma both took
over your respective positions back in 1985. You both coached against Dawn
when she was a player. Now all three of you are going to be at the Final Four,
have this Olympic connection as well with her taking over as national team
coach. It has a historical feeling, all three of you being there together. Can
you reflect on that a little bit.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I loved coaching Dawn. First of all, playing against
her, we played in the 1990 Final Four. Virginia, Stanford and Connecticut were
also in the '91 Final Four. Then we played against Dawn again in the 1992
Final Four semifinal game. Both were semifinal games for us.  
  
We do have a long history together, and a long history the three of us. Even
Dawn and Geno go further back being at Virginia.  
  
I think it just points to the fact that you have people that stick with
things, really love the game of basketball, are passionate about it. Dawn has
gone from being a passionate player to a passionate teacher and coach.  
  
It will be very exciting to be in Dallas with Dawn and Geno.  
  
Q. Talking about your team, the way that it's developed. It just seems
like this is a team that has gotten better as the season's gone along.
Everybody talks about doing that, but that doesn't always happen. Sometimes
teams do peak in February. It seems like this is a team that's found itself as
the year has gone along. Can you address maybe why that is. When did you sort
of feel like this team has a chance to do what it's doing?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think in the beginning of the year, the goal was to win
the Pac-12. We didn't win the regular season. But there were certain goals we
had. We had boxes we were able to check off, whether it was our team wanted to
win a thousand games for me. When they wrote that down, I thought, This is a
group that I say gets it.  
  
I think the reason that they've improved, the reason we're in the place that
we're in, there's a couple of things. Number one, we have great senior
leadership on this team. This team is extremely close. They play hard, with
each other. They're extremely unselfish. They're hard-working. They're in the
gym early. They don't care who gets the credit. They're very excited for each
other. They want to continue playing with each other.  
  
As the season went on, we just got better and better and/or confident.
Different people are stepping up for us. That's why we're in the situation
we're in.  
  
Q. Tara, when you look at South Carolina, what in your opinion do you
think they do really, really well? How would you try to approach attacking
what they do really, really well?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I think they do a lot of things really well. They have
an elite player in A'ja Wilson. They get her the ball. She is a big presence
down low. They run well. I think they're a very well-coached team. They
rebound, they're an elite rebounding team. You have a low block presence, a
great rebounding team, you have people that are moving the ball. They're
fantastic one-on-one players.  
  
All of them put the ball on the floor really well. I think you're going to be
challenged defensively, you're going to be challenged offensively because
they're athletic and long. You have to rebound the ball.  
  
I think on every front, they are an excellent, excellent team.  
  
Q. Tara, I wanted to ask about your impressions of Marta's developments
from year one to this point in her career.  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think that she's helping us. I think she had a great
freshman year. I think she's helping us where she is, much more mature this
year. She is a floor leader. She is a fantastic passer. She really understands
the game of basketball. She's also someone that, for me, I can be extremely
direct with her. I don't sugarcoat anything with Marta. Sometimes I need
someone to be hard on. She gets that.  
  
But she, whether she's in the game, she might make mistakes. She might be
upset. But she really stays engaged mentally. She really focuses. She's a very
intelligent basketball player. She really understands things.  
  
So if she makes a mistake, I'm always shocked when she makes a mistake out
there. Marta, you knew not to do that, knew not to go under that screen.  
  
I know.  
  
But she's a really, really smart player, incredibly unselfish. I like how
she's worked really hard on her defense.  
  
Q. What was the recruitment of her like, trying to convince a player
from the opposite coast to come out across the country and play basketball?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, we've had a history of a lot of kids coming from the
East Coast. I think one thing for Marta was she really was serious about
academics. She's not sure if she wants to go to medical school. But I think
she really loves the challenge of the elite athletics and elite academics.
That's the situation she was in when she was at National Cathedral. She was at
a great school that also had really good sports.  
  
She's a terrific athlete, a soccer player and basketball player, as you
probably know. But I think it also helped that we have direct flights
(laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure you're happy to spend a couple days at home. How much
has this felt like a three-week road trip? Is anybody happy it's finally in
Dallas, with Karlie and Katie Lou?  
COACH VanDERVEER: You know, for us, it's not just been three. We went on the
road to Oregon, then on the road to the Pac-12 tournament, then we went to
Kansas, then we had some mechanical problems, we went directly to Kentucky. We
came back one day, got back Sunday night, leaving today to go to Dallas.  
  
The reason that it works is because this team and staff get along so well. I
mean, we really enjoy being with each other. It's fun.  
  
I mean, our bus broke down. We laugh and have fun. Just say, Hey, nothing's
going to get us down. That's the kind of team you want to coach. I'm really
enjoying it.  
  
As far as Katie Lou and Karlie playing together, I think it's great for the
Samuelson family they don't have to split up. But we want to give them a
dilemma. They want to be in the championship game. If we end up playing
Connecticut, I hope her parents will root for us in that game because they
have two more years to root for Katie Lou.  
  
Q. Tara, of all the teams you've taken to the Final Four, wouldn't you
consider this the most team-oriented team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. This is a blue-collar team in the proud tradition of
Jim Harbaugh. This is a put on your boots, put on your hardhat, bring your
lunch bucket. This is that kind of team.  
  
I have never been any prouder of a team than I am proud of this team, and
happy for this team.  
  
Q. Tara, I wonder if you could kind of sum up what would be the key
points and development of Brittany McPhee? She's really come on here as
probably your top scorer now in the tournament. She looks like she's hungry to
score, but she's a great all-around player now.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Right. Well, you know, I think coming into this year, in the
fall, quite honestly, we needed Brit out there. Karlie got hurt. Even in the
fall practices, I mean, a lot of things. Brit got a lot of opportunity. I
think that's been the big difference. Her opportunity of getting the ball.  
  
This team moves the ball. It's coming to her more. She's able to take
advantage of it, knocking down the three, going to the basket. She's a worker,
number one. She's in the gym early, she stays late. She's improved her defense
and her passing. Really she's improved her basketball IQ. She studies the
game. She's always loved the game of basketball.  
  
She's gone from being a great high school player to now becoming a great
college player through her hard work and her coachability.  
  
I think more than anything in the tournament, she's gained a lot of
confidence. She's playing with supreme confidence right now. It's really
exciting.  
  
Q. Tara, what is your schedule today? Are you flying out right after
practice?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes, we had yesterday off. People were able to just relax.
We're done with finals. I think they just had a nice day.  
  
Our team watched the game last night in the locker room. Had Chinese food.
They were I'm sure just really enjoying being together.  
  
We're practicing right now. They're warming up. We're practicing today. We
leave at 1:00. We're the first team off in the morning for interviews and
everything. We'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Tara, with you and Dawn, when she first got into coaching, she wasn't
sure she wanted to do it. She was still playing at that time in the WNBA. Did
you sense, even when you were coaching her with the national team, that that
was going to be her destiny, that she was going to coach?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I didn't know it was her destiny. If she went into it,
I knew she would be really good.  
  
First of all, she understands the game of basketball. She sees the floor
really well. As a player, she was a tremendous passer. She's a tremendous
competitor. I think those things, understanding the game, teaching the game.  
  
I think Dawn, if she was going to do it, I knew she would be really good. I'm
so proud of her and so happy for her. Honestly, I wish we weren't playing
them. I root for her and their team.  
  
But, you know, I think she's done a terrific job. I think Dawn also knows that
she doesn't know it all. She surrounds herself with really capable assistant
coaches. It's always about trying to do the best job for her team.  
  
Q. You mentioned being proud of this team. You've made reference before.
Is this a team that reminds you most of that '92 bucket of bolts team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: It does, it does, yeah. There's just a lot of coincidences
with that team. We're excited about this team. I don't know that I've coached
a team that's any closer than this team, you know, 13 players.  
  
This is not a start-studded team. We have players that are really good at
certain things, and they've got to do those things. But they understand their
role, and they embrace their role. The unselfishness, just the team
cohesiveness is something that you can't teach and you can't coach. It kind of
has happened.  
  
I told our team today when we were in our team circle, I said, Maybe 10 years
from now, 20 years from now you'll look back and understand what you have. But
let me tell you, it's something very special.  
  
Q. In regard to South Carolina, when they lost Coates, their center
inside, Kaela Davis is a 6'2 " guard that has asserted her game a lot. What
have you seen from her and what challenges does she present? They are a
different-looking team than they were in the earlier part of the season.  
COACH VanDERVEER: We kind of had to do the same thing with Notre Dame.
Obviously South Carolina had more time to adjust to it. They went from
basically a two-post team to a four-around-one team. They're more athletic.
They spread the floor a little bit more.  
  
They have this anchor inside. They can go to Wilson. I mean, she is shooting
like 60%. They might not have the same depth, and obviously they're better
with Coates, but they're really good without her, too. Like you said, Davis
has stepped up, and other players kind of filled that void.  
  
People asked about Brittany McPhee. The cork comes off the champagne and other
people bubble up. That's what Davis is doing.  
  
Q. Tara, what kind of recruitment, if at all, did you do for Katie Lou
Samuelson? Could you share how that went, why you think she ultimately decided
to go across the country.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, Katie Lou, her two older sisters were at Stanford. We
recruited her. She made the decision. You'd have to ask her. It was totally
her decision.  
  
We wish her well. Obviously the team is doing well. But we recruited her just
like we recruited Karlie or Bonnie or any of the players that are on our team.  
  
Q. Coach, it's the first trip to the Final Four in a little while in
terms of you only have three players that have been there before. What do you
think this experience is like for them being back a second time, and for your
first-timers who are experiencing all this, especially with all the media
attention they'll have to deal with?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, you know, I don't think it's bad for women's
basketball that other teams have been going. Obviously, we want to go. But I
think it just shows, we went in 2014, and I think having gone, I don't know,
six or seven years out of the 10 years, I'm very proud of the fact that we've
been going a lot.  
  
Our seniors are very excited to go back. Our freshmen and underclassmen are
really excited to see what it's like. We want to have a great time there. I
think the fact that the older kids have been there will help the younger kids.
I think it's a good bridge for them to say, Hey, this is what to expect, this
is what you do. It will be fun for all of them.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks again, Tara. Safe travels. We look forward to seeing you
there.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: We'll be on our way down there later on today. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks, Dawn
Staley.  
  
South Carolina is playing in its second women's Final Four and pursuing its
first national championship in 2017. I know Coach Staley and the Gamecocks
just arrived here in Dallas. We'll bring in Dawn for some opening comments,
then take your questions.  
  
COACH STALEY: Well, we're super excited to be here in Dallas participating in
our second Final Four of the history of our program. We beat some incredibly
competitive teams to get here. Just grateful and thankful for the opportunity
to play on the third week in the NCAA tournament.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks so much, Dawn. We'll take questions at this time.  
  
Q. Dawn, you had your first brush with Tara VanDerveer back at the 1990
Final Four when you were a player, and you played for her in the '96 Olympics.
What is the difference between playing for Tara and playing against her?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, there isn't a whole lot of difference. You know
that you're going to be well-prepared for any situation that you'll see in the
game. Tara has taught me so much about the game as a player, that I still use
the foundation of how I approach games from the days in which she taught me as
an Olympian, the times we spent together.  
  
The key is preparation. You need to always be able to put your teams in
situations that they will be successful in, you know, not too much, not too
little, but just holding players accountable for their end of the bargain to
make dreams come true.  
  
A dream came true for me when I played for Tara in the 1996 Olympic Games.  
  
Q. I'm not sure, have you not beaten her as a player or coach competing
against her? How big would that be in the big picture?  
COACH STALEY: I'm o-fer. I'm part of the 1,000 wins that she has. I'm one of
the defeated teams in that total win category. I mean, she's a hard win. She's
been in these situations a number of times, and she definitely uses her
experience against us.  
  
We're hoping that Dallas brings us a little bit of different luck.  
  
Q. Dawn, just wondering how your team has been able to withstand the
loss of Alaina Coates. Has anybody in particular stepped up for your team
during this time?  
COACH STALEY: Well, how we've approached any adversity we've faced this
season. We do it just like it's a kink in our armor. But we keep moving
forward. We don't rest on, you know, people that we don't have. We don't rest
on the laurels of not having the services of Alaina Coates. We knew we
wouldn't have her, so we have to move on and figure out ways to capitalize on
who we have.  
  
I think Kaela Davis has been a beneficial of the void that Alaina Coates has
left. It put her in a position where she gets the ball in her hands probably
50% more than she did when Coates was in the lineup.  
  
Probably our entire perimeter players, because we've gone to a smaller lineup,
and it's creating driving lanes. A'ja Wilson is able to block the block, work
the entire paint area without feeling like she's on top Alaina and her
defense.  
  
Q. Dawn, I wanted to ask you, not just you and Tara being in the Final
Four, but Geno, too, two past Olympic team coaches, you taking over that role,
just the thread that's been there with the three of you, having that much of a
prestigious role with USA Basketball, now all at the same Final Four.  
COACH STALEY: I think it's great. Our USA Basketball family is back. I'm so
happy to be in that number. We all have made sacrifices for the greater good
of our sport. For us all to be here says we're doing things the right way.  
  
We've given so much to the game, and the game in turn has been the greatest
gift that keeps on giving. I want to be amongst greatness. This opportunity
does that. I'm extremely happy.  
  
I also want to be a national championship coach, just like the two of them.  
  
Q. After you had the great game against Mississippi State in the regular
season, battled with them in the SEC tournament, you sort of suggested you
wouldn't be surprised to see Mississippi State make the Final Four. Now both
of you guys are there. Can you comment on what that means to the SEC, to have
two programs in the same year, two programs that are relative newcomers to
this kind of stage?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think what the SEC does is it prepares you to play in
NCAA play. You have so many different styles of play. You've been battle-
tested in so many ways. When you face other competition, you feel familiarity.  
  
You don't fret any situation. I think Vic has done a tremendous job with his
players. He gets them to play on the biggest stage. I'm not surprised that
he's here. To watch them play, to watch what they've done in the tournament
thus far, you know, I hope we've all prepared him to face UConn and give them
a good go at it.  
  
I think they have all the key ingredients to make the SEC proud on Friday
night.  
  
Q. You do have a couple players who have the Final Four experience with
Bianca and A'ja. A'ja played very well in her Final Four two years ago. Does
that help a little that they've been through this before?  
COACH STALEY: It helps, yeah, when you have experience at the Final Four. We
feel different as a coaching staff. We feel better prepared to know what is
expected.  
  
We enjoyed it two years ago. We absolutely did. Was it a business trip? It
absolutely was. But when it's your first time, you know, you're seeing all the
different moving parts, and you're trying to fit all of it in to make it work.  
  
Whereas now, we know what to expect. Although we're going to enjoy it, we're
going to be better prepared for our players and our program, especially the
ones that haven't experienced it.  
  
It's a business trip, but it's one we're going to enjoy every step of the way.  
  
Q. Dawn, I was wondering how your team has come up physically with all
the travel, going to the West Coast, now to Dallas. Does it help going
straight from California to Dallas instead of coming home first?  
COACH STALEY: You know, we went out to California on Wednesday, last
Wednesday. That extra day really helped us acclimate and adjust to Pacific
time. We just didn't think it was feasible to go back to Columbia and Dallas
without us feeling another time change.  
  
Our staff did a great job at just coordinating us, taking care of business in
Stockton, making sure we were okay to seamlessly win the regional and then
come right from California to Dallas.  
  
There's no sweat off our brow. We want to be here. This is what we worked so
hard for all season long. We probably would have gone to the moon and back if
it was necessary for us to participate in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Dawn, I wanted to kind of get your mental thoughts right now. Last
year you had a great run. As a coach, what do you think you might change this
year preparing for it now, because you have the experience?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think, you know, practice times. It's a shorter week.
It's hard to prepare. It was an open practice last year. It's not an open
practice this year. We just get a chance to do all of our preparations at the
arena. We don't have to go to another gym.  
  
At this time of the year, rest is equally as important as preparation is.
Sometimes that preparation, we'll be watching film and preparing in that way,
just communicating and talking about some things, as opposed to always being
on the court. That's probably the biggest adjustment that we'll make.  
  
Q. For the two veterans you have returning with experience already, what
would you tell them to prepare the other girls who haven't been there yet? How
would you tell them how to lead them for this next game coming up?  
COACH STALEY: Well, you lean on them. A'ja Wilson and Bianca Cuevas both have
Final Four experience. What they're doing is they're leading them. But the
most important thing is our kids have stayed the course, stayed in character.
We're going to enjoy this. When it's time to prep, we'll prep. We'll prep like
any other regular-season game. Probably over half of our team never
participated in the SEC tournament, as well. So we'll take that same approach,
that same tournament approach, stay the course, and keep it as normal as
possible so we can perform on Friday night.  
  
Q. Dawn, we have an WNBA team here now. You played in Houston back in
the day. Have you heard from some of your former colleagues that you played
basketball throughout the years? Do they reach out to you and let you know how
well you're doing?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I think nowadays people use Twitter to communicate and
social media to communicate. My Twitter timeline is blown up. I got to go
through to make sure that I didn't miss anybody.  
  
DeLisha Milton is probably the one that reached out through text messaging.
But it's been unreal, the amount of support throughout the season, not just
getting here to the Final Four, but just the season, how our basketball family
has reached out and supported us from afar.  
  
Q. As you look back over your life, we have to reflect on the man who
encouraged you, and that's the late Dave O'Brien at Temple. You're writing
history right now because you're giving our African American young people not
only the chance to play the game, but now you're coaching. How do you feel
about making history and the possibility of winning a national championship
and the Final Four?  
COACH STALEY: I think what's taking place is quite incredible. I give all the
glory to God. Obviously I'm a vessel in all of this, and just appreciative
that He gave me a profession in which I can be a dream merchant for other kids
and other people.  
  
I'm just really grateful for the opportunity to do that because the game of
basketball has been incredibly giving to me. I feel like I owe it, I got to
repay the debt, for what it's given me. What better way to do that than help
young people realize their dreams through the sport.  
  
Q. Dawn, what do you think Stanford does best? What do you have to do to
combat what they do best?  
COACH STALEY: Stanford is very disciplined. They are a team in which they do a
great job of reading defenses and offenses. They make you go a little deeper
in what you're trying to accomplish. They make you go through options, you
know, three, four and five instead of one and two. That's hard for teams which
aren't organized, don't have great guard play.  
  
For us, they'll be a challenge for us, but we also have seen a lot of
basketball. We've seen a lot of different looks this particular year.
Hopefully we'll draw on our experiences of playing in the SEC, of playing the
four games we played in the NCAA tournament this year, to our advantage, in a
stingy team like the Stanford Cardinal.  
  
Q. Dawn, the way A'ja has been able to carry the load she has. It put
more load than ever on her with Alaina out. Talk about how well she's
responded. Then does Stanford -- are they a little bit harder to guard or
figure out because they don't really have a star? They're really a complete
team. You don't know who is going to hurt you on a given night.  
COACH STALEY: Uh-huh, I'll answer the A'ja question.  
  
A'ja, I'm super proud to watch her leadership. Obviously I know what she can
do as far as being a stat filler. But the way she's taken on the leadership
role, it has been quite remarkable.  
  
When teams are dealt any type of adversity, people step up. People fill a
void. Although A'ja was our leader before Alaina's injury, she's taken it to
another level. To see a young person do that, I'm proud. I'm proud. That's why
I'm always politicking for her being the national Player of the Year because
of these circumstances that our team has experienced this year. Not just the
wins and the losses and the points and the rebounds and the blocks, but a
national Player of the Year. They don't let their team lose, no matter what
adversity they're dealt with.  
  
A'ja has been dealt a great deal of it this year, her injury, losing Alaina
Coates, having three different starting guards. She still has been able to
perform at a high level.  
  
Then the Stanford question. They are hard to guard. Yes, they have a lot of
moving parts to what they do. Any one person can get hot on their team. But
they got the key ingredient to beating you. If you don't have a star, star
player, you do it by committee. When you do it by committee, you have to play
each committee member, you have to give them their own space. You don't have
to double-team any one person, but you do have to prep for them top to bottom.  
  
It creates a longer scouting report and more information that our players have
to remember and execute.  
  
RICK NIXON: Dawn, really appreciate you jumping on. Welcome to Dallas. We look
forward to seeing you this weekend.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you so much.

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Mississippi State Bulldogs,
Vic Schaefer. Mississippi State is making its first appearance in the Women's
Final Four and will be headed to Dallas here today.  
  
With that, to get things started today, I'll bring in Coach Schaefer. If you
would say a few words, what it means for you and your program to be coming to
Dallas for this year's Final Four.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: We're very excited, humbled and honored to have an opportunity
to continue to play. We feel like we've come out of a tremendous region. We've
had four very tough opponents. I'm really proud of my kids. They have been
tough and resilient through the entire two-week process, as well as the entire
season.  
  
Just are excited to continue to play. I've got some kids from Texas that I get
to bring back home for this great event. Again, just appreciate all the hard
work, commitment and dedication it takes to do something like this. This is my
third Final Four professionally as a coach. I know the commitment that it
takes from an administration, to players, to assistant coaches.  
  
As the head coach, I'm really appreciative and just thankful to be a part of
this.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks so much. We'll start taking questions.  
  
Q. Vic, I wanted to ask, on UConn's broadcast last night, he talked
about a meeting you had in Houston. I guess it was more of a chance meeting.
You never got to go up there like you maybe had planned. Can you talk about
that meeting, what y'all talked about. He said he doesn't take any credit for
what you guys accomplished.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think even more than that meeting that was by chance
in September during recruiting, he and I got to spend about a day and a half
together in Colorado Springs last summer recruiting.  
  
It was really great for me to just talk to him about, you know, the game and,
in particular, offense. Again, for some reason, I've kind of been known
throughout my career as the defensive guy.  
  
Offensively just talked to him a little bit about that particular side of the
game. He shared some stories with me about him early in his career, what kind
of brought him to where he is. I think they're so multi-dimensional
offensively. Of course, all his players are multi-dimensional, can do so many
things.  
  
Again, until you've watched them and played them, I have a true, real
appreciation for them defensively. They score so many points, their defense
gets overlooked. Just like last night, they made Oregon miserable.
Defensively, they were just in passing lanes, refusing to let them make
passes. They took the three-point line, chased them off of that.  
  
Because they are so prolific point-wise, a lot of times people don't pay
attention to that. But their defense is really, really good.  
  
Our conversation, more me picking his brain about, Hey, how did you get to
this point where you're just so doggone good offensively? Kind of like being
around somebody that's 100. If you're 100 years old, I want to know what
you're eating for breakfast, I want to know what time you're eating breakfast,
what you're eating for lunch.  
  
I was pretty specific in trying to get some information out of him. It was
great. He was super.  
  
Q. One of the things he talked about, clearly he talked about your team
is a lot different than last year when you played, and he said he doesn't have
to convince his team of that because they saw what you have done in this
tournament, what you did against Baylor. What about your team? Is there
something you have to convince them that you're a different team than the team
that played UConn last year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think my team realizes that. I think we're a year older, a
year wiser. So I think from that standpoint, our kids believe we're different.  
  
Now, the fact of the matter is, UConn may not have the same personnel, but
they're still the same, you know, dominating UConn program. They're a well-
oiled machine. They have tremendous chemistry.  
  
Even though the numbers or the names may change, the program itself just keeps
rolling. So I think our kids understand that. At the same time, we know we
can't really get caught up in the whole UConn thing. We've got to do what we
do. We've got to be more concerned, I think, about Mississippi State than we
do about anything else.  
  
I think that's probably where we've kind of evolved maybe even from a year
ago. We're going to be more concerned about us, making sure we're doing what
we want to do, how we want to do it, instead of being so consumed with
everything about our opponent. That can get overwhelming, quite frankly.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Auriemma mentioned something about recruiting, how he
and his coaching staff go after players who want to be coached, who want to
live up to the responsibility of playing for Connecticut, the expectations
that go along with it. The kids that you've brought in as seniors, who have
kind of laid the foundation, how do they epitomize that kind of mindset or
mentality to help get you guys where you've gotten?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think they're exactly that. I think they're accountable. I
think they came here with an idea of setting a precedent and being a part of
something special, about being the pioneers to come in here and really create,
you know, something that's never been done.  
  
So I give those kids all the credit. Those four seniors, they'll go down in
history as the all-time winningest program to date, all-time winningest class
to date in the history of the program, and four of the greatest players to
ever play here.  
  
They deserve a lot of credit, obviously, for where we are today, the
turnaround of how we've accomplished this in such a short period of time.  
  
Don't want to take anything away from Coach Fanning. She had some great teams
here during her time, had some really good players, including LaToya Thomas
and Tan White. There was a couple years there in the last two that weren't
real good, but certainly she had some really good teams here. We certainly
don't want to diminish that fact.  
  
Q. Geno talked about that fact that he doesn't think kids have changed
in the sense that they still want to be pushed. In your sense of recruiting, I
know you approach it the same way you approach a scout for a new opponent,
what is the process like to try to find maybe the intangibles that a player
has or the makeup that they have to find out that they want to be coached,
they want to live up to a standard, they want to be a pioneer?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think there's a lot that goes into recruiting. It's
not just walking into a gym and watching somebody play. We're reading the stat
sheet, seeing how many points, rebounds, assists they have.  
  
I told you the story before. We sit at a table all the time and talk about
recruiting. We talk about, Where is the next McDonald's All-American, the top
50 player, next Gatorade Player of the Year. I want to know where the next
Dominique Dillingham is, somebody I recruited for her toughness, for her
competitive spirit, for her fire. Didn't recruit her for her jump shot.  
  
The kid has been a three-and-a-half year starter for us. When you do your
homework as a coach, you have to recruit kids that fit your style, that fit
how you want to play. You know what, they got to fit how you want to prepare.  
  
I think coaches find out all the time sometimes these great players that have
all these gaudy stats in high school, they don't want to come work. You've got
to earn your right to win. You've got to earn your right to win the game. That
comes with effort.  
  
Sometimes, you know, it comes too easy for kids at a young age. At this level
nothing comes easy. You've got to want to work. If you don't, it really can be
a struggle, especially at this level.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer, last year when you hired Carly Thibault as the
assistant coach, what did you see that you liked in her? What has she brought
to the table this year, during the run through the tournament?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, Carly came highly recommended from a number of
people. Anybody that knows me, when I've had to replace an assistant, I really
take my time. I'm not one to rush into anything.  
  
In calling people across the country, from coast-to-coast, her name came up
quite a bit. Of course, I've known Mike a long time, not real well, but known
of him. He and I have crossed paths occasionally and talked.  
  
What she's brought to our program is really, at a young age, she is -- I'm
trying to think of the word. She's mature beyond her years, if that's the
right way to say it. Her knowledge of the game is really off the chart. Her
preparation skills are really off the chart. Her attention to detail, as my
entire staff, those are things that were important to me when I was an
assistant.  
  
I had a saying when I was an assistant, I wasn't paid to be wrong. I didn't
never want to be wrong to Coach Blair. So my assistants are the same way.
That's what I want. That's what I need.  
  
I think if you're going to be successful at this level, you better surround
yourself with really good people. I'm smart enough to know I can't do it by
myself.  
  
Carly has really fit in well here with my staff, with our players, with this
university. But her work ethic, her attention to detail has really been
pleasing for someone, who is, quite frankly, as young as her, not quite had
the experience. But, man, she is off the chart. She's been a home run for me.  
  
Q. Vic, two questions for you. First, I was looking at a story the other
day about the dynamic you and Blair, your daughter, have. When you mentioned a
seventh grade game where you stepped in there, how have you sort of done that
balance? Kim coached her daughter. We've had other coaches that have done
that. How have you kept that balance of when you're a dad and when you're a
coach?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I'm wondering before I answer, has there ever been a father-
daughter in the Final Four? I'm just curious, coach and daughter.  
  
You know, the balance has been real easy. I give her all the credit, and her
teammates credit. They've been great throughout this whole process.  
  
I think for us, most of the time when we see each other at school, it's always
coach and player. My kids grew up having dinner at the dinner table every
night. We sat down together. We talked about the day. We didn't let people go
sit in front of the TV or go up to their room and eat. We always had family
time.  
  
Because of our location, where we live, close to campus, where she lives,
close to campus, we still have those dinners a lot of times, usually on a
Monday night, on our off days. We still have that with her and her twin
brother, Logan, who is a student here.  
  
I can tell you, as a father, I'm miserable with an empty nest (laughter). I
can tell you, I don't like going home to that at all. But it's really been
unique and special. Obviously, she's earned her way. She's been a big
contributor throughout her career, but really down the stretch she's had some
big minutes for us, made some big shots.  
  
Q. Can you reflect a little bit on the path of your career. It's sort of
different than a lot of people do, probably different than your three
counterparts in the Final Four. You were a head coach, then you went about a
15-year period being an assistant coach, then became a head coach again. Can
you talk about what was the reason for why you did it that way. How did you
change as a head coach from the first time you did it to now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That first opportunity in 1990 was at a university that I
dearly love, got my master's from. When you got that job in 1990, I had never
coached women's basketball. I had no contacts in the game. I got that job a
month after signing date, there were three kids on the team. I was a green
tomato as a head coach, so to speak.  
  
I had to go out and recruit. I signed four players out of a newspaper in
Houston, Houston Chronicle. Then few junior college players nobody wanted.
That was my first recruiting class there.  
  
Went through some lean years to start with. But by the fifth year, we were
18-10. I was blessed to be Coach the of Year in the Southland. Coach Blair
told me a year after that, I think I'm going to lose Tom Collen. Think about
coming to Arkansas.  
  
I'm like, Man, I'm just getting this turned around, really happy. It didn't
happen. Tom didn't leave. Next year same thing, same place, at the junior
college national tournament in Tyler, Texas. He told me the same thing again,
I think I'm going to lose Tom, think about coming to Arkansas.  
  
Again, I had a young team, we were really good, going to be really good the
next few years. We loved Huntsville. But it did happen. The truth of the
matter is, we just had the twins. They were a year old. We were $25,000 in
debt. I was making $35,000 a year as a head coach at Sam Houston State. I had
to do it for my family.  
  
Coach offered to double my salary, give me a courtesy car, $1,000 in Reebok
apparel, if I remember it right (laughter). That's kind of what pulled me to
Arkansas, as well as being able to go work with him.  
  
Obviously we had six great years there. Went to the Final Four in '98.  
  
Then in 2003, we got to Texas A&M. That's another story. I really wasn't going
with him. I was going to be the next head coach at New Mexico State.  
  
Long story for another day, but ended up turning that down, took the associate
head coaching job with him at A&M in '03. Eight years later we win the
national championship.  
  
I've had a pretty incredible career. Had a lot of success with Coach. I think
a lot of people questioned five years ago what I was doing, why would I do it
here.  
  
I think what we've shown the country is what I believed when I came here; that
this is a place that wants to win, they're committed to winning. It's a
tremendous university. We have great facilities. It can be done. It just
needed somebody to come in here with a blueprint and a formula. We had that.
We had done it at Arkansas. We had done it at A&M. We just brought the
blueprint with us here and have put it into place.  
  
Q. Vic, I wonder how you approach trying to game plan against UConn.
Kelly Graves of Oregon talked about trying to eliminate catch-and-shoot
threes, pick your poison, if they're going to make 17- or 15-footers against
us, we're going to have to live with that and do our best. When you're looking
at them defensively to try to attack them, what do you see in terms of what
you can do?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't want to give away the game plan. I think obviously
they can do it all. I think that's what Kelly was basically saying. If he felt
like he had to give up something, he was willing to give up the 17-footers,
that's what he was willing to give up.  
  
I'm sitting here right now, was watching film before the phone call. Number
one, what do we do well? Number two, what do they do well? How is that going
to look when you meet head on?  
  
You try to figure out, Okay, is what we do well better than what they do well
better? Whatever which one wins out, you've got to deal with that.  
  
So with them, you know, they're just a well-oiled machine. I mean, that's the
only way to put it. They are a machine. Geno is a great coach. Not only do
they have great players, I mean, we talk about being attached all the time,
chemistry. They are. I mean, that's why they're so good.  
  
I think one thing we've got to do is we got to score. I mean, it's not going
to be a 50-48 game. That's where we've been different in the last two and a
half weeks. We've kind of maybe not focused so much on trying to hold
everybody scoreless, we focus more on, Okay, here is how we can attack and
score a little bit.  
  
If you look at our scores in the NCAA tournament, we've been able to score
some points. I think that's what's different about our team right now. That
was part of the reason for the change in the lineups. We had some kids that
were hot. They needed to be on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about this being your fourth Final Four in your
professional career. Now that you've done it as a head coach, does it feel
different than when you were an assistant? Is it comparable?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, it's my third. It is a little different in that there's
a lot more responsibility than just trying to develop a defensive game plan.
So there's not enough time in the day. The fact of the matter is this: I've
got to spend the bulk of my time with my kids and my staff, trying to get them
ready, you know, for Friday night.  
  
But there's so many other things that are happening that drag you and need
your time. That's where having a great staff comes into play, which I have.  
  
But the time demands are really, really difficult, to be honest with you. At
the same time, I'm not complaining, obviously. I couldn't be prouder. It's a
good problem to have. No doubt about it.  
  
Q. Vic, going back to Sam Houston State, how does an assistant boys'
basketball coach end up as the head basketball coach at Sam Houston State?
What did you learn from that first experience of running a program that you
carry with you?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That's a great question.  
  
You know, in 1985, I got my first job coming out of college. I was the
freshman boys' coach at Milby High School in Houston, HISD. That's the first
year they took the ninth graders to campus. At that time, the ninth and eighth
graders were off campus. I was the first freshman boys' coach at Milby High
School, for coach Boyce Honea, who is a legendary high school coach in the
state of Texas. A tremendous man, he's in the Hall of Fame. Grew up with his
son in my teenage years.  
  
From there, I coached AAU in the summer. I had some really good AAU teams.
After that second summer, I tried to apply everywhere to get into the college
game. Gary Moss was the new head coach at Sam Houston State. He hired me as a
GA. I quit my job as a freshman coach, drove to Huntsville, became a GA there
for two years.  
  
In the middle of the second year there, I lost my dad real suddenly. Not only
did I lose him, but Coach Moss got fired in the middle of his season. So we
finished out the season there.  
  
I went back and got my old freshman boys' high school job back at Milby. We
went 32-2, won the city of Houston championship. I moved back home just to
keep an eye on my mother. When you lose somebody that you've been waking up
next to for 43 years, it can be a bit of a shock. I wanted to make sure she
was okay. Moved back to Houston, got my old job back.  
  
In the spring of '90, Sam Houston State called and said, Hey, are you
interested in the women's job? They had just hired a coach, Debbie, her last
name escapes me, from Missouri. She had been there one year and left after
that one year.  
  
I said, No, I'm not interested.  
  
Anyway, that conversation happened three more times. Finally the last
conversation happened on a Monday morning. After I hung up saying, No, I
wasn't interested, we were in the PE office out in gym out back, Coach Honea
said, Who was that?  
  
That was Sam Houston State. They want to know if I want to come up and
interview for the women's job.  
  
He said, Why don't you do that? I'll cover your classes. He said, It will be a
great experience.  
  
I said, Coach, I don't want that job.  
  
He said, Just go interview, it will be good experience for you.  
  
I said, Coach, I have to go today because the deadline is at 12 noon. If they
don't have my résumé by then, it's too late.  
  
I believe they already made up their mind who they wanted to hire. I went up
there and interviewed, got the job. That's kind of how it all happened.  
  
That was a program that, you know, had just gone Division I. They were still
trying to live in the NIA budget days, yet try to be in Division I. So it was
really difficult.  
  
I remember my budget was $36,000 total. That was recruiting, travel, team
travel, paying for officials, postage for recruiting, telephone, the whole
nine yards. It's crazy.  
  
That's kind of how it all began.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything as a coach during those years that you carry
with you today, how to run a program?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah. Not only that, but, man, I went against some really good
coaches. Obviously Gary Blair was at Stephen F. Austin at the time. Stephen
F., Texas and Texas Tech were the only three schools in the state that were
really committed to women's basketball at that time. Across the country, there
was only another handful.  
  
I had to live going against Stephen F. Austin every year at least twice.  
  
No, you learn, look, first of all, it's different coaching guys from girls.
That was a piece that I had to learn early on. The best advice and the -- I
share this at every clinic I speak at. It's probably the biggest key to my
career. I got it from my wife early in our relationship. It's simply this: if
they don't like you, they're not going to play hard for you.  
  
That doesn't mean you have to be their best friend. But the bottom line is, if
they don't like you, and probably you could add if they don't trust you,
they're not going to play hard for you.  
  
I think that's been a really big, big turning point for me. It's helped me
throughout my career. I'm thankful for that from Holly.  
  
But just how to learn to run a program on a shoestring budget. I mean, you
talk about penny-pinching. I can remember calling restaurants saying, Hey, I'm
going to bring my team in. Would you give us free iced tea, lemonade, if I
bring my team in there. Save $2 times 20, $40. Throughout the year, it's a way
to penny-pinch nickels and dimes. That's what you did.  
  
I can remember going into Black-eyed Pea restaurant and telling them, You
can't order on the right side of the menu, you have to stay on the left.
Everything at the restaurant was too expensive at the Black-eyed Pea.  
  
You learn a lot. You have a great appreciation for so many things at this
level because you've been through the bus league, you've been through the
barbecue circuit, hey, we can't have that for dinner, we can't eat there. Hey,
make sure you clean your plate, appreciate what we have, those kinds of
things.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to reference your statement that you just made about
your past career, perseverance is definitely paying off. I want to say I'm
very happy for your team. I want to reference the 5'5 " point guard who scored
41 points in the last game. You also talked about players trusting you, liking
you. After reading her story about her stepfather passing, then she also
showed a great appreciation for you, her will to win, the 41 points, in my
opinion, says a lot about how your girls feel about you. She referenced you as
a father figure. I want to say you are right on point when you say if they
don't like you, they won't play hard for you. Those girls really show how much
they like you. My next question is, is there anybody on Connecticut's team
that you feel can contain her, Morgan William?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, first of all, thank you for the kind comments. Again,
not every day is peaches and cream. I'm sure there's some practices they don't
walk off the floor in love with their coach. That's part of it. I think kids
want structure, they want discipline.  
  
Again, my kids are loved by my entire staff, our entire community here. I
treat 'em and try to love 'em like my own. That can include sometimes a soft
hand in the back to love 'em, and a firm hand in the back when they stub their
toe. But that's what we do as parents. That's how we try to treat our student-
athletes.  
  
As far as Morgan William goes, I mean, Morgan obviously had a great ballgame
the other night. She is very difficult to deal with. I don't know, I'm sure
they'll have a great plan for her. When she's locked in like she was the other
night, she's very difficult to handle.  
  
Obviously she typically isn't someone we depend on to get 41. But, again,
that's how unique and special our team is right now. You've got to prepare for
a number of different weapons offensively that we have.  
  
Victoria obviously has been a big offensive piece for us throughout the
season. Then you roll out Blair in the NCAA tournament. She gets 39, 21, 18 in
the first two rounds. Now you're thinking, Okay, that kid. Breanna Richardson
is an explosive, dynamic player. Dominique Dillingham has added so much to our
offense with her game.  
  
You can go on and on. Obviously Teaira McCowan and Chinwe, my two-headed
monster down there, they have been fantastic all year long, averaging double-
double between the two of them.  
  
With Morgan, she obviously is an explosive guard. I'm quite confident they're
not just going to let her play HORSE on Friday night. Hopefully we're not
going to let them play HORSE either. I think we've got more kids that can do
the same thing she did. It's just a matter of finding who is hot. That night
it was Morgan William.  
  
Q. With Connecticut's bigs, they have a tendency to get into foul
trouble. What is your strategy to make sure they do get in foul trouble?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I certainly think obviously we're going to do what we
do. We've been scoring a lot of points offensively. We've been doing it a
number of different ways.  
  
When you have a short turnaround like we all have, I think there's just so
much you can plan for and do.  
  
Offensively we've really expanded I think. We're doing a number of different
things. Obviously our bigs are a big part of what we do. We're going to
continue to try to, you know, run some stuff for our bigs, as we try to run
some stuff for our guards.  
  
Obviously our bigs are our aircraft carriers, as I like to call them. They've
been carrying us. Teaira had a big game against Washington. She's had some big
games throughout the season, 25 against Florida earlier in the year. Both her
and Chinwe have been explosive for us down there. We just have to see how the
games going, what people are giving us.  
  
Those two have been seeing a lot of double-teams. When they're doubled, they
have to be able to make good decisions, not turn the ball over, get it to
people who are open. That's what they did against DePaul. That's what allowed
Blair to have the game she had.  
  
We always try to adjust. It will be dictated by what UConn does.  
  
Q. Vic, from your standpoint, even with all the success you've had the
last couple years in the SEC, the confidence building, the tournament run this
year, can one game like Baylor, such an emotional win against a high-caliber
program, can that be kind of a springboard for momentum, confidence, whatever
else, within a team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I certainly think so. We've grown a lot since last year's
debacle up in Bridgeport. That's a humbling experience, going through that. I
think our team has really grown from that, really been part of why we've had
the season we've had.  
  
When you go beat a team like Baylor that's just loaded, I mean loaded from top
to bottom with great players. Of course, Kim is a tremendous coach. Her and
her staff do an unbelievable job. When you beat a program like that, it really
I think, again, says a lot about my kids.  
  
That's who they are. That's who they've been all year. They've been that
tough, physical, aggressive, resilient bunch. We had to go through all those
things on Sunday against Baylor. They are so talented and so, so good.  
  
But our kids just fought. You can't help but come out of a ballgame like that,
playing against a team like Baylor, with continued confidence. But I don't
think you can beat a team like Baylor without going into that game with some
confidence, with an edge about you, knowing you've played three really good
teams in the NCAA tournament, you've come out of the Southeastern Conference,
where you played for two conference championships within a week, that you had
a chance to win a conference championship in the last week outright.  
  
So I think all that goes into it. But certainly I think it was a tremendous
accomplishment over a tremendous basketball program.  
  
Q. You've been around the women's game for a long time, some very good
programs. You've seen teams go on great runs. What separates UConn, being able
to sustain for such a long period of time? Is it getting great talent? Is
there more to that equation that you see with UConn?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think there's a lot in their equation. Again, we have a
saying in our locker room: It's not what we do but how we do it that separates
us from the rest of the country. I think that's UConn. I think Coach Auriemma
and his staff, it's not what they do -- there's lots of programs that have
lots of great players. But they not only have obviously some really good
players, as he said last night on TV, but it's what they do with those kids.
It's the development of those kids. It's the retention of those kids. It's the
accountability that you have with kids.  
  
I think they're cutting edge. I think they have a way they want things done.
They're going to stand firm and hold kids accountable to that. It's a formula
that's been so successful for them for so many years.  
  
Again, I think their plan, if you want to call it that, their strategy, their
philosophy, I think it just dictates and makes you be successful. As coaches,
we all can learn from that.  
  
That's why I wanted to spend time with him this summer. I've been doing it a
long time, 32 years. But I don't know it all. I know they've had so much
success. So when I get a chance to sit down with a Hall of Famer like that,
pick his brain, and he is willing to let me do that, I mean, what a blessing.  
  
I'm really appreciative of him for doing that with me. So you know what, it's
made us better. No question about it, it's made me a better coach. It's
certainly made our team better.  
  
RICK NIXON: Coach Schaefer, again, thanks for being with us. Safe travels to
Dallas. We'll see you soon.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all so much. Appreciate you. Go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches' media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.
UConn will be playing in its record 10th straight Women's Final Four in 2017
and will be playing for a record 12th national championship.  
  
I'll bring Geno into the conversation. Geno, just a quick opening statement,
your feelings on coming back to the Women's Final Four here in Dallas.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick.  
  
Like you said, we've been fortunate enough to be in the Final Four, this is
our 10th year in a row. It just seems like it gets harder and harder to
believe because it is getting harder and harder to accomplish this. The teams
that you have to beat year in and year out are getting better and better.  
  
This year certainly with Albany and Syracuse, UCLA, then Oregon. We're very
fortunate to be able to make another trip to the Final Four. It doesn't get
any easier from here. The teams that are going to be in Dallas are obviously
great, great teams.  
  
We're anxious to get down there. We're leaving today. It's a real quick
turnaround from last night. But I think once we get settled in there tonight,
we'll be like everybody else, and we'll get ready for Friday night.  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll go ahead and take questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Coach, you said something to the effect last night, on a taped
segment on the broadcast, about the stars of this year's team kind of taking
on the identity that the previous players have left. I'm not sure if there was
any buy-in from them. What kind of a process was that for them to take the
next step from role players to 'stars' or the ones who were leading the way?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's the big unknown going into the season, when
you're asking kids to do something that they haven't necessarily done to the
level that you're going to ask them to do it. You have to hope you have the
right kind of kids, the right kind of people.  
  
Certainly they're good players. I mean, obviously we wouldn't be where we are
if they weren't really good players.  
  
But, you know, in order to accomplish what we accomplished, you can't just
have good players, you have to have a certain maturity about you. You have to
approach things, you know, in a way where you do take full responsibility. You
don't have the luxury that they had last year of, Well, if I play great, we
win by a lot. If I don't play great, we win by almost a lot. That was the
world they lived in.  
  
Now you're asking them to go immediately to, If I don't play great, we're
going to lose. So generally you have to suffer a little bit and lose a little
bit to have that realization hit home.  
  
But for these kids, they showed a maturity that I didn't know if they had or
not. They looked around and made a quick decision early on, It's on all of us.
They all took responsibility. That's why we had the success that we had.  
  
Q. Last night on the telecast, there was a reference to last summer,
after the game you played against Mississippi State in the tournament last
year, that Vic Schaefer reached out to you, you got together. Is that
accurate? What was the conversation like when y'all met?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Somebody asked me about that. I didn't know exactly where that
came from. I had a chance to speak with Vic after the tournament last year. We
ran into each other in Houston. I don't know what we were doing down there. I
wish I knew what it was. I can't even remember what it was.  
  
We just ended up talking over, you know, a drink and some food. Believe me, I
didn't give Vic anything he didn't already know. We just discussed, you know,
in general what we do offensively, what our philosophy is. It was just us
basically going back and forth on a couple ideas. It wasn't me, believe me,
saying, Hey, Vic, if you do this, this and this, next year you guys are going
to be in the Final Four. There wasn't anything like that at all.  
  
I think what they did this season was remarkable, not because all of a sudden
they're in the Final Four, but because they already had a good team. They
changed the look of their team, even though they had a lot of the same players
back.  
  
He did some things that were a little bit different than they did last season,
and it showed in their play. It was never more evident than it was the other
night against Baylor.  
  
They're an unbelievably good team. He's done an amazing job. Believe me, I
take none of the credit for that. Trust me.  
  
Q. That was just generally a chance meeting as much as anything? That
wasn't like he reached out and y'all planned to meet or anything like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. He had mentioned to me, Hey, I want to come up to
practice, I want to come up, spend a couple days. It never materialized for a
lot of different reasons. I was still involved with USA Basketball. Obviously,
he's got his thing going. We could never really put it together.  
  
It just kind of happened that we just had one night where we just happened to
be sitting and talking. It just was good. I enjoyed it. It was a learning
thing for me, too. They do things that we don't do. We do things they don't
do. Probably the same conversation you have with a lot of coaches in the off-
season.  
  
Q. Like you said last night, this is a different Mississippi State team
than what you played last year. Because of what they did to Baylor, I'm
assuming that you don't have to convince your players that this isn't the same
team you beat by 60 last year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, no, I don't have to convince them of that at all. The guys
that beat them by 60 aren't really playing in this game, you know. We have
three players that scored a lot of points that night and did a lot of things.
They're not here.  
  
Mississippi State has, if I'm not mistaken, almost their entire team back. And
they're better. You know, we haven't gotten to where we are by pretending that
anybody is not as good, or is not good enough to beat us. That's not how we've
gotten to where we are.  
  
If we're not going to take Oregon lightly, we're certainly not going to take
Mississippi State lightly.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you a question about your coaching staff. As you
mentioned a while ago, you had to coach Team USA in the Olympics. How do you
keep your coaching staff focused when you're busy doing stuff in order to keep
this thing going?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the good thing about it was I didn't have to miss any
what you would call crucial time. You know, a lot of stuff that I did maybe
was in September when the staff was maybe out recruiting. So maybe we didn't
get a kid or didn't spend as much time with a kid because I wasn't there. But,
you know, I don't worry about that that much.  
  
I was never away during practice. I was never away during games. I was never
away during any of the crucial times or any of the important times that you
have to be there to make it all work.  
  
On the other side of that is, whenever I'm away, whether it's for a day, a
week or a month, my coaching staff is so good, they don't miss me one bit. And
my players kind of enjoy it when I'm not around, to be honest with you,
because I'm a pain in the ass.  
  
It actually does everybody good when I'm not around (laughter). My staff, I
don't have the kind of coaching staff where, you know, they follow me around
24/7 and they have to check with me on every single decision that has to be
made in our program. I'm lucky in that respect. If I didn't have that kind of
coaching staff, we might have had some slippage in what we're doing, but that
wasn't the case at all.  
  
Q. The SEC with Mississippi State, then we saw Florida, you look at
South Carolina, I mean, it's just amazing. Before it was Tennessee. I know the
conference, they keep bringing these teams in action. Can you talk about
that.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think it's the natural progression of things.
Everything goes in cycles. There isn't anything that lasts indefinitely. There
was a time when the SEC referred to itself as 'The always difficult SEC.' Not
by the commentators, it really used to bug a lot of people in this part of the
world that the SEC was somehow better than every conference in the country.  
  
They had some great coaches, don't get me wrong, and they had some great
teams. The last time I checked, there's only one SEC team that won a national
championship, and that's Tennessee.  
  
All of a sudden that kind of changed. A lot of the coaches are no longer
coaching in that league. Schools that were struggling back then, whether it
was Kentucky, Mississippi State, Texas A&M, obviously they won a national
championship, but I don't know if they were in the SEC then or not.  
  
So, you know, South Carolina obviously being the most recent, along with
Mississippi State. So you've got teams that really weren't prominent when
Tennessee was dominant. Auburn was more dominant. Georgia was. Vanderbilt was.  
  
Now they still have a lot of quality teams, it's just different names. That's
what's supposed to happen in college basketball. Each year there's supposed to
be more teams that get better and better.  
  
Q. Geno, if you could not coach UConn, what would be the team that you
would most want to coach, male or female? I'll let you go NBA, Olympics,
anywhere else.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh (laughter). Well, I've had the privilege of coaching the
best team in the history of the world, and that's the USA national team. I've
had a chance to coach them for eight years. If you were to ask me if I could
end my career only coaching one team for the rest of my coaching career, I
don't think it could get better than that, especially with the players that
I've had during those eight years.  
  
That's about the ultimate in terms of the talent that I was coaching, the
passion that they play with, the experience that they have. Just everybody
that they are, you know.  
  
When you've coached at that level, you know, you've coached those players,
it's pretty hard to say, I would rather coach anybody else.  
  
Q. Geno, I wondered if I could ask two things real quick. The first
being, when you look at the coaches in this group, you and Tara coached the
Olympic team, and Dawn is the new Olympic coach. You both coached against her
when she was a player. Could you put into historical perspective having three
people who have had that much involvement with the national team, still right
at the top of the college game. Then, if you could maybe talk a little bit
about Vic Schaefer, somebody who was an assistant for a long time, won a
national championship as an assistant, then became a head coach. I know he had
been a head coach before, but now is a head coach of a program that is in a
Final Four.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it really is an interesting dynamic in Dallas this
weekend. Obviously Tara has been to a number of Final Fours. I thought about
that yesterday, about the Final Four history that they have, that we have, USA
Basketball history that she has, that I have. Then you throw into that, you
know, a former player of hers, a former assistant of mine in the Olympics, a
great player at the Olympics that played for Tara and coached on my staff.  
  
You really couldn't orchestrate something like that. It kind of just has to
happen. It's unique. You don't see that generally anywhere, much less in a
Final Four.  
  
Then, as far as Vic is concerned, you know, when you're an assistant for a
long time, you always worry, Am I going to get a great opportunity? Then, when
you get an opportunity, Am I ever going to be able to take advantage of it?
Then you find yourself in the exact same place you were when you were an
assistant.  
  
That to me is a testament to how much he's worked, how hard he's worked, how
much he's given to the game, what he's getting in return. It's what he
deserves. You went to a place that never played at this level, and has been
there now in a short period of time.  
  
The coaches that are in this Final Four, none of them are getting there by
accident. Nobody stumbled into this thing, believe me.  
  
Q. Napheesa Collier obviously had a great season. You seem to have a fun
relationship because you're always teasing her about something. She plays it
pretty close to the vest with the media. You don't see a lot of her
personality. Can you share a little bit more of her personality, what kind of
drives a kid like that, especially the type of sophomore season she's had.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, in some ways she's very introverted, like she comes
across in the press conferences, being interviewed. But away from all that,
she's kind of a kid. She doesn't take herself or things too seriously. She
doesn't really stress about much, including guarding people. She doesn't
really hold onto things. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't wallow in it. She
just moves on to the next thing.  
  
She has tremendous confidence in herself. It's a confidence based on she's
worked at it, she's put the time in. She has a lot of God-given things.  
  
She's a little more mature than her years as a player. As a person, she's
exactly her age. Maybe that helps her a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, Vic Schaefer made a lot of changes to his lineup and rotation,
team runs about 10 deep or so. How does that increase the difficulty in game
planning against Mississippi State? What do you expect to see against
Mississippi State on Friday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think Vic did some really courageous things. It takes
a little bit of courage to, one, extend your bench, because you have to live
with some of the challenges that come from that. I mean, there's a lot of
challenges when you only try to play six players or seven players, like we
have right now. That's not by design, believe me.  
  
But there's a lot of challenges when you're trying to play eight or nine, as
well. He's done some great things. He's moved some starters, made them come
off the bench a couple games.  
  
I think he's done what good coaches should do: he's followed his instincts,
he's followed his gut, and he's done what he thinks is best for his team. It's
worked out. It's worked out great.  
  
You know, a lot of times a lot is made over how many players somebody has.
This team has 10 players or nine players. This team has five post players that
are all really, really good. That is a huge problem. The only thing you can
console yourself with, only five of them play at one time.  
  
What you got to do is you got to deal with the five that are on the floor. We
don't necessarily try to get into how many players are they going to play.
We're more worried about what is their style of play, what are those players
going to do when they get in there, what is their team identity, what are they
going to try to get accomplished against us, and how do we combat that.  
  
But I think what he's done has gotten them to where they are. I don't think
that's going to change. I don't think there's any easy answer for it.  
  
Q. Geno, I wanted to get your impressions of Chloe Pavlech, a first-year
GA on your staff. Would you say her relationship with your players is almost
like peer-to-peer, given they're basically all within the same age bracket?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, Chloe has been great. I've really enjoyed getting to
know her. She's got a great way about her. She really wants to learn. She's in
a tough situation, though. That's the hardest part for someone who is getting
into coaching right out of college. You're not a player, so the players don't
look at you as a player, because they know you talk to the coaching staff all
the time.  
  
You're not one of the coaches because you're not really, like, a coach yet.
You're someone who's in limbo all the time. Navigating that is not easy. If
you try to be too much like a player, then the coaches are like, You're not
too serious about coaching. If you're going to be too much like a coach, the
players are not going to confide in anything.  
  
You really have to walk the fine line. I think she's done a great job of that.
She'll be here again next year. That will make it a little bit easier for her.  
  
My impression of her right now is that she's on the right track to move up in
this business.  
  
Q. Geno, from a big-picture standpoint, so much has been written and
said about the streak, what you've accomplished, the 10 straight Final Fours,
all that sort of thing. From the inside, is there something that gets
overlooked, from your standpoint, maybe under-emphasized that people need to
pay more attention to about what's happened at UConn in terms of the success?
Second question. This year's team, there were even some quotes from you after
last year kind of hinting that this year may be different. When did you learn
in the course of the process that maybe things weren't going to be all that
different with this team, that there was maybe a special spark in this year's
team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know that there is anything magical certainly about
what we do. Not at all. I think what you see is what you get. We try to stress
some things that we think are important.  
  
There's a lot of teams that are really good. I mean, I bet you if you talked
to all the coaches at the Final Four this weekend, you might get four
completely different ideas about how to run a basketball program and how to
manage a season. They all got there, and they're all successful, you know.  
  
I don't think there's anything we do that's exclusive, that's revolutionary
and different. What we do is what works for us. What works for us, you know,
is the attention to little things that we think are important.  
  
That doesn't mean anything we do is different. It's not. There are things that
exist in every program. We just try to emphasize every one of those little
things.  
  
We try to recruit kids that love being coached. You say, Doesn't everybody?
No, not everybody recruits kids that love being coached. A lot of coaches
recruit kids that are really good players. That doesn't mean they love being
coached.  
  
We try, anyway, to recruit kids that we think want to be held accountable.
They want the responsibility that comes with playing at Connecticut, having to
live up to a certain expectation. They want to share. They don't want to
necessarily be the, you know, man, so to speak, on the team. They want to
share. They don't need to be the center of attention.  
  
That's so easy. Why doesn't every coach do that? They don't feel like it or
they don't think it's important. I don't know.  
  
I'm just trying to say what we try to do is try to find the kids that work for
us, for me, for how I am, what I value. That doesn't mean that it's the best
thing or the right thing or the wrong thing. It just works for me.  
  
Obviously, there's a lot of teams that go to the Final Four. They may have the
same philosophy, they may not. It works for them.  
  
So, you know, that's the best way I can answer that.  
  
Q. This year's team. When in the course of either practice or the season
did you get the feeling that this might be something special, that there
wouldn't be the expected dropoff, even with all the talent you lost from last
season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Last night, about 9:00 (laughter).  
  
You know, there was a time during the first two weeks of practice when I knew
we weren't going to be very good, 'cause we couldn't be very good the way we
were practicing, the way our players were approaching certain things.  
  
With two minutes left in the Florida State game, the opening game of the
season, I was convinced that we got major problems; this team is going to
really learn a huge lesson that they haven't had to learn up until now, and
it's going to hit 'em tonight, and we'll be better off for it. If it doesn't
hit 'em tonight, it's going to hit 'em against Baylor, for sure.  
  
We ended up winning that Florida State game. Probably shouldn't have. We
probably shouldn't have. Then we won the Baylor game. I think from that day
on, there was this sense of, We can be pretty good if we can beat those two
teams.  
  
Then when we won at Notre Dame, I think that sealed the deal. That pretty much
made everybody on the team feel like, All right, maybe we should stop talking
about who we don't have and start talking about who we do have.  
  
Q. Coach, going all the way back to the Chattanooga game, a game you win
by almost 40. I remember talking to Gabby afterwards. It seemed at that moment
they embraced the fact they needed to play their game at a different level, to
the UConn standard. Even though you won the close game against Florida State,
is that around the time in which you think they kind of adopted, We're not
living up to what was here before us? The second part is, talk about
Bridgeport, the support you got there, even with it moving out of there next
year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I have a theory on today's players. They will work very,
very, very hard. They will practice hard. They will compete at a real, real
high level, up until a point. I don't think our kids are that much different
than anybody else.  
  
When we were getting ready to play, let's say, Notre Dame, or getting ready to
play Baylor, or Texas, you could see the different look in their eyes in
practice, the different mindset, as opposed to when we were getting ready to
play a team that they didn't think was good enough to beat them.  
  
Maybe that comes from winning all the time. Maybe that is just natural. But I
think maybe around that time, and that's why I think this year it was hard to
coach at times, because you were trying to get them to understand, We're not
coaching for the regular season. You can't just decide who's good and who's
not. We have to be great every night.  
  
It took a while for us to really embrace that. The way you usually teach
players to embrace that is you bench them. You say, Look, you're not going to
play hard every night, you're not going to play as much. We didn't have the
luxury of doing that this year.  
  
We really had to embrace it as a team or we weren't going to have the kind of
success that we had. They did. It's to their credit. And they deserve all the
credit.  
  
Q. And Bridgeport, the support?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I heard a rumor that the NCAA is thinking about moving
the regionals to one site for all the regionals, which -- I don't know if the
NCAA is saying that, but people are suggesting that, which automatically
doesn't make it a regional anymore. The term 'regional' means people in the
region get to see the team live.  
  
I've also been concerned about, Well, we're going to move the regionals out of
the Northeast. I'm sure there's a lot of anti-Connecticut sentiment out there,
Let's get these guys on the road.  
  
Look, I don't care where we play. I don't care what time we play. I don't care
if we play in a parking lot with the lights on at midnight. We've had some
teams that are going to win, no matter what.  
  
I understand the idea that you don't want somebody being close to home all the
time. But one thing we're saying is, Well, we're going to move the regionals
to home court. Maybe now we can't do that. We have to move them to one place.
Those are two really big extremes.  
  
So a place like Bridgeport, whether we're in it or not - obviously if we're in
it, it's better. Our attendance in Bridgeport was higher than almost three
regions combined.  
  
It's a great place to have a regional. Well, they say, Only if Connecticut is
in it. Which regional is any damn good without the home team anyway?  
  
So, you know, there's no secret why the crowd is the way it is at Bridgeport.
One, they love basketball. Two, they think we're going to be in it. They're
going to buy the tickets ahead of time. Even if we're not in it, X number of
people are still going to show up because they're huge basketball fans here.  
  
So I'm not surprised by the turnout, not surprised by the enthusiasm of the
crowd, by the support. It was like that in Albany. It was like that in Rhode
Island a few years ago. There's a lot of really knowledgeable basketball fans
up this way.  
  
We'll see what happens in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could comment, Morgan William had sort
of an amazing game, she's a real little person. She's listed at 5'5 ", but I'm
sure smaller than that. Can you talk about when you're facing a guard that's
that small. She didn't have any turnovers. She can be a difficult person to
guard and stop. Also, what do you think it does when somebody like that has a
game like that? I think a lot of people probably identify with her, were
cheering for her.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it was certainly one of the more remarkable performances
that I've seen in the NCAAs, especially by a kid that isn't necessarily used
to those kind of performances.  
  
So for her to have the kind of game she had in the biggest spot she's probably
ever been in, obviously her game is way bigger than her size. You know, it was
fearless. That's the best way I can describe it. She played the game
fearlessly. A lot of times kids get in that situation, they're afraid to lose.
She was playing all out, and only one thing in her mind: we're going to win.  
  
I was riveted to the TV the entire game. I was really, really impressed with
their team as a whole, but she was just incredible.  
  
I'm going to tell Crystal Dangerfield, who may be able to look her eye-to-eye,
This is a big game that could be won by little people, so you better get your
butt in gear.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks, Geno. We appreciate you being with us today.
Congratulations. We look forward to seeing you here in Dallas this afternoon.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. Thanks for having me.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 90, Oregon - 52  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I first want to congratulate coach Auriemma on a great game and
a great season so far. First chance I've ever had to play UConn and kind of
see up close exactly what they're about, how they play, and I'm not going to
make many headlines with this, but they're really, really good. I think we had
our team ready. Our team was confident going in. I just don't think we were
able to handle that that early, I think just kind of the shock of how good
they are, and got us on our heels quickly. I thought we kind of rebounded a
little bit in the second quarter, and again, in the third quarter just
unfortunately the turnovers doomed us right from the get-go, and that
defensive pressure I think really set the tone.  
  
I do want to say that I'm really proud of my team. I don't think anybody saw
this happening. But what I talked to them about after the game is this is
where we want to get to. I just -- you know, they've given us so much this
year. They've worked so hard. Our chemistry is phenomenal. We just made two
trips to the East Coast back-to-back with finals in between, and not once did
anybody on my team ever complain. They didn't complain about an 8:30 a.m.
start on Saturday our time, and they just gave it everything we had, that they
had.  
  
Just really proud of their effort. I'm happy for our seniors to be able to
leave a legacy to the University of Oregon and do something that our
University has never done in women's basketball. I think there are only good
things ahead, and I look forward to that.  
  
Q. Sabrina, an awful lot of talk is made of UConn's offense, but can you
talk about how frustrating it can be to play that defense?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, they're a great offensive team. They don't really beat
themselves. They don't turn the ball over, and they have weapons everywhere,
so it's definitely hard to play defensively, so we're going to work on it and
get better.  
  
Q. Sabrina, curious, you had spoken throughout this time about not
knowing what you didn't know, and I'm wondering when you sort of take the
totality of this experience in the NCAA Tournament now start to finish, do you
feel like you have a measuring stick for where you want this team to get to
over the next three years?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I definitely think now we have a feel for it,
especially playing these last two weeks into March. I think we're just going
to be excited come next year to see what we're going to reach. I think sky's
the limit for us next year as we continue to get better and work together.  
  
Q. Maite, 22 turnovers led to 32 points. Can you talk about what they
were doing defensively to turn you guys over?  
MAITE CAZORLA: They were pressuring us. They were denying us all passing
lanes. I think it was just our mistake. We didn't come to get the ball. We
just was standing there waiting for the ball to come to us. I think it was the
pressure.  
  
Q. Ruthy, from the tempo heroics at the end to tonight's disappointment
but yet getting the opportunity to go against UConn, what did you learn about
your game during this tournament, and what will you work on this off-season?  
RUTHY HEBARD: We got to go against UConn and everybody in this tournament, I
think we all learned a lot. I definitely learned what I need to work on, the
strength in my left hand and getting an outside shot for sure. I'm going to
work on it in the off-season.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I'm curious what's going through your head right now and
just this run; obviously you guys came from a long ways away, all the way
across the country.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we're obviously going to learn from this loss. I think
you have to learn from every loss, but we're going to put it behind us and
just enjoy this experience. It doesn't come around often, and we sure didn't
expect it to come around this soon. So I think we're all just enjoying the
moment and definitely living in the moment and not trying to worry too much
about what happens.  
  
Q. Sabrina, a lot of players when they're playing UConn and down by a
lot look defeated. You didn't look defeated at any time. In fact, you came out
and started the second half, were joking with your teammates. I wonder if you
could take me through what you were saying to them at that time and just in
general how you managed to stay so positive throughout.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I know we talked about it in the locker room and we
were in there trying to figure out ways to fix our mistakes, and then I said,
guys, we should just live in this moment. It doesn't come around often, and
just enjoy it. Enjoy playing against the No. 1 team in the country, and we're
going to try and do what they do because I think we can become the next UConn
here at Oregon.  
  
So then, yeah, we were joking around. We were obviously taking it seriously,
but I was just enjoying the moment to be honest. I think it was really fun.
The atmosphere was great, and playing against them is something that we'd like
to do more often and definitely learn from what they do there.  
  
Q. Ruthy, how is it tough to guard the perimeter with Katie Lou, Gabby
and Napheesa? How difficult was it for you tonight?  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's definitely tough. We're used to big post players and
they're a smaller team, more athletic, so we definitely used the scout and we
were prepared for it, and I think it'll be something we work on, too, for the
post to get faster and get used to playing inside and out.  
  
Q. Maite, I know you pride yourself on defense. What kind of things did
you learn about the defensive game from UConn that you might be able to steal
something here or there?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I think they're a really good defensive team more than
offensive. I think we need to learn from them. They don't make mistakes,
neither offensive or defensive, so I think that's one thing I take away from
them.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I wonder what it was like for you to see Jacinta and
Mar'Shay get to go out there and just have a couple of minutes on the court
and kind of have their college careers and be able to play in the NCAA
Tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well, they mean so much to our team and our program
since the beginning. They've kind of carried us and definitely guided us
through this whole journey that we had. So I think they enjoyed there time
there at the end, just being with us and playing those last minutes, and their
presence will definitely last forever in this program.  
  
Q. You mentioned trying to become the next UConn. What do you think it
will take to close that gap that you had tonight? Is it just more experience,
or is it an attitude? What do you think separates them from the pack?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I think it's going to be a little of everything.
Experience is definitely going to help, especially now that we are a young
group. I think seeing what it's like, and we have to hold ourselves to a
different standard. They hold themselves to a different standard. They don't
beat themselves, and I think come next year and the years following, we're
going to start holding ourselves to a different standard and not beating
ourselves, either.  
  
Q. Kelly, you talked a little bit about it, but just put in perspective
what this run will do for you guys moving forward? With so many young talented
players I've got to think the future is bright for the Ducks.  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. No doubt. This is all part of the process. I thought
Geno put it really good the other day when he said they don't know that
they're not supposed to come in and just beat people like we are. But guys,
our last three weeks of the season we beat Washington who was a 3 seed, we
beat Maryland, a 3 seed, we won at Duke, a 2 seed, lost to Stanford, who's
going -- we've played three of the Final Four teams. I just think all of this
is part of the process, part of the growing up. I think a run like this will
make it easier to motivate our team in the off-season. Hey, we got a taste of
it, we see what it's like, we want to go back. One of our goals will be to
host the first and second round so we don't have to make two trips cross
country. We traveled over 6,000 miles for this tournament.  
  
All those things will, I think, really help us, and obviously gives these guys
confidence, that they can win in the tournament.  
  
Q. I imagine it was impossible to simulate what UConn does, especially
in one day's practice. What was it like going against them? What did you learn
about playing them that you didn't know just watching them from afar?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, you know, you watch them on film and you see, hey, we can
do this and we can do that. But I think the speed of the game. They just play
so fast. And when you're trying to -- especially when you're a young team, and
I don't want to use youth as an excuse. This is our 37th game. But when you're
trying to process that, it takes some time, and it's got to be more of a --
just a natural reaction instead of a thought process, and we were thinking,
you know, and therefore -- it looks like a post player is open inside and you
want to make that pass, and before you know it, Gabby Williams, a tremendous
athlete, steals the interior pass.  
  
You know, it's just -- that stuff is tough, and then once it gets rolling, you
know, they become even better. But I think the student-athletes said it great;
they don't beat themselves. They play both ends of the floor, and they play
for 40 minutes.  
  
So we played them in stretches fairly well, but not -- obviously not for 40
minutes, and you just can't have those let-ups because that 10-0 run in a
minute and a half crushes you, and then you try to dig out of it, and then,
bam, it's another 10-0 run. We'll learn from it. We'll get better. I think,
like I said, it's all part of the process.  
  
Q. When Collier and Williams come out and start making some perimeter
shots, run me through how that changes how you have to try to defend them.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we went with kind of our two big kids. We were hoping that
we could at least punish them at our end, offensive end by getting the ball
inside and we didn't do a great job of it. We knew we were going to give up
something at the other end, and Gabby Williams has shown at times that maybe
she's got as comfortable shooting that 17-footer as she was tonight, and it
was -- you've got to kind of give up something. I think when you're maybe not
quite as good, you have to kind of pick your poison. That was one we picked.
We chose wrong. Those kids did a great job. They're just great players. They
really are.  
  
I think that set the tone for them.  
  
And shooting is contagious, good shooting and bad shooting, and once she
started making them, it seemed like Saniya was making them, and I thought we
did a good job on Katie Lou and Kia for the most part, but those two did a
heck of a job.  
  
Q. I'm curious what you did to stop the turnovers in the second half.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, took a deep breath. That helped. I had to joke with them a
little bit. You know, listen, the first half, it was, I think, 28 to whatever
in points off turnovers, 28-6, so we're down 25, and 22 of those were from the
margin in points off turnovers. We just said, man, if we could just not throw
it to them, just throw it to us, we might be a lot better. Plus we went to a
little more high-low stuff in the second half, kind of changed our approach,
got away from a lot of ball screens, and I think that helped, too.  
  
But like anything, you settle down and adjust.  
  
Q. You talked about this earlier, but it seemed like you let Gabby and
Napheesa to a degree take those mid-range jumpers. Do you think that's the
best way teams have a shot at beating UConn, and if not, what can teams do to
have a shot?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we didn't mean to give them that much room. I think our
freshmen centers, both of them, got a little gun shy, didn't want to get too
close because Gabby did beat them off the dribble a couple times. Going in, we
wanted to do two things: Eliminate catch-and-shoot threes, and eliminate lay-
ups. You know, if they were going to make -- if Gabby was going to make
17-footers and Napheesa was going to make those shots, hey, you know, all the
more power to them. But those are the two things that we needed to take away
in our opinion, and that's just our opinion. We had one day to prepare for
the. If I was in their league, maybe I'd have a whole different approach, but
you try to cram in as much as you can for that test, and it didn't work out
tonight.  
  
Q. I couldn't help but notice there was a lot of giggling on the dais
when Sabrina was asked how she was handling the composure, or keeping her
composure. Wanted to talk a little bit about how much of that was a discussion
letting Maite handle the ball and getting Sabrina off the ball versus just
kind of necessity of what UConn was doing.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I thought they did a great job of taking Sabrina out the
best they could. I mean, she worked hard just to get catches, and we didn't do
a great job of setting very good screens, or she didn't do a great job of
using those screens, and they just do a good job of blowing them up. It's
tough to get good looks against them.  
  
And I'm glad that a couple of the reporters, that they mentioned this. I think
everybody talks about their offense. I've always felt what sets them apart
from everybody else is the defense. They give you nothing, and we've been a
really good offensive team. I think we're one of the more efficient teams in
the country, and we were playing on our heels all night long, and it was
survival mode at times.  
  
To me, that's what really sets their program apart.  
  
Q. With their defense, what makes them so good? Is it just the
athleticism and ability to switch or the intensity with which they play?  
KELLY GRAVES: C, all of the above. You know? It truly is, great athletes.
They're interchangeable, so they switch screens, and we don't see a lot of
that. It's hard to take advantage of that stuff. There were times when Saniya
and Dangerfield were on our posts and we tried to roll them down, but there's
so much pressure on the ball that it's hard to see them, and I think they're
just well skilled. I know Coach challenges them each and every day. I know how
he operates and how he coaches, and they just get better, and it's part of the
culture, and that's the area where we've got to continue to improve. You know,
it's defense like that is a culture-based deal, and you don't build that in
one or two years. That's longevity, and that's kids coming in as freshmen and
getting broken down and saying, this is how we do it.  
  
I coached Morgan Tuck and Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson two years with
USA Basketball. I got to know those kids, and I know what they went through as
young kids, and that's how you get better. It's how you get better.  
  
And so, yeah, they just -- professionally as a coach, I was glad to play them,
you know, because it helped me be a better coach. I know it will help my
players be better players.  
  
Q. Throughout this run you guys talked about playing these four games
without a lot of pressure on yourselves and getting this far. Are you looking
forward to seeing how this group which is pretty much all coming back improves
and handles expectations next year?  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. No doubt. I can't wait, actually. I can't wait. I
think this is going to be a fun group to watch mature, and like I said, I
truly believe from the bottom of my heart that we can be the kind of program
that can be in this position and perhaps beyond year in and year out. That's
our goal. Whether that happens, I know it's fragile, these tournaments,
there's a lot of really good programs that never get to a Final Four, never
win a National Championship, but that's why I left my former school. You know,
I want to be on this kind of stage and have a chance, and I think we have the
makeup, we have the resources, we have the University brand, we have
everything, and now we have really, really good student-athletes to be able to
make that a reality in the future.  
  
In the meantime, I wish coach Geno the best. I do have to give a shout-out to
the Pac-12 and Stanford and tell Coach Vanderveer that I'm really happy for
her and her team. They earned it, and we wish them the best in the Final Four,
too.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 90, Oregon - 52  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, there's not much you can say about what just happened.
Right from the opening tap, we just had a look and a feel about how we were
playing and what we were trying to do. And I thought our defense was
spectacular right from the opening possession and stayed that way pretty much
throughout the whole game.  
  
I couldn't be happier for this group. They had a lot of question marks going
into the season, and maybe they didn't have any in their own minds. Everybody
else did, including me. But they seemed to have answered every single one of
those questions, and they deserve to be in the Final Four. They've earned it.
I'm proud of them, and I'm happy for them.  
  
Q. Kia and Gabby, did you guys have to take ownership of this team early
on to ensure you guys were going to have the kind of success that you wanted
to have?  
KIA NURSE: Well, I think both of us were forced into leadership roles because
we were becoming the older guys on the team, and I think that was a challenge
that we accepted, and I'm extremely proud of how Gabby stepped up to the
challenge and has done a great job all season, being vocal. This is the thing
that neither of us have had to do at all in our careers, and to have done it
with the help of the coaches and the help of some of the players who have come
before us and taught us the way, I think it's becoming more of a habit for us
now.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, just going off of what Kia said, we were just kind of
thrown into this role. I mean, those guys did everything for us last year,
last two years, but the thing about them, too, is they showed us and they
taught us how to do it ourselves. They knew that once we got into this
position that we would be ready for it because they showed us how to do it.  
  
Q. Coach said how this was a special time to be in the Final Four since
everyone except for you guys thought you might be struggling for. Does it make
it sweeter than maybe the last couple where you guys kind of knew you were
going to get there whereas this year less was expected from everybody except
for you guys to get back to the Final Four?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, it feels really good. I think with us, too, we've seen
it, you know, every day in practice. We see things that other people don't
see. I guess for us it's not as surprising, but we did definitely still
surprise ourselves. It feels good that we were able to fill in those shoes.  
  
KIA NURSE: I mean, going off of what Gab just said, obviously this is a
special one for us. For us to be in this position when people didn't think we
were going to be, and for us to have played as well as we did today to get
there, it's a good feeling.  
  
Q. Gabby, when you came off the court against UCLA, wasn't a lot of
smiles, you guys said the last couple of minutes was tough. Was there a
conscious effort to really come out hard tonight?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, we always want to throw the first punch, and it was kind
of like we didn't want to give them any hope. You know, we were lucky enough
to come out to a good start, and I think we executed our game plan really
well. The key was not letting them back in because that team really knows how
to fight, so we just had to stay tough.  
  
Q. When Stewie would talk about what her goals were, it was in terms of
trying to be as close to perfection as possible. I wonder if both of you view
it that way, and do you feel that this season has lived up to those goals?  
KIA NURSE: Well, where we are and the position that we're in and the school
that we go to, perfection is a word that gets thrown around a lot, and I think
that starts in practice, when we do drills, where we have to make a certain
number of shots in a row, without any mishaps, without any balls being thrown
out of the place, and I think for us to have a season like this, for us to
have done it the way we did it, I'm proud of the team, I'm proud of how we
stuck through it and proud of how we worked to get to where we are today.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think sometimes it doesn't feel perfect, and the
coaches kind of put the pressure on us, and you know, we lose a lot in
practice, and I think that's where that kind of perfection idea comes from,
because we just have such high standards for ourselves, and the coaches put so
much on us so that when we get into the game, it's easier almost. It's fun.  
  
Q. Going off of that, a lot has been made of this season, lots of
streaks going on, and that history, that perfection. What do you feel this
team or when will this team be able to take ownership of that success, of that
hard work that's happening in practice that no one else sees?  
KIA NURSE: I think we have an opportunity to do it right now. The streak,
we're a part of it. We didn't do it all on our own. There was a lot of people
who came before us to start the streak, and we are kind of carrying on that
legacy that they left, and that's something that we focus on every day. We're
focused on the fact that UConn is built into what UConn is today because of
everybody who came before what we're doing right now.  
  
So to understand that, to want to go out and play great Connecticut basketball
every game is a testament to those people who have done it before us.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I agree with Kia, and I think every team has an
identity. I'm glad that we found ours kind of at the right time, and I think
the momentum we have is really good.  
  
With that, I think we just want to add to the tradition. We want to add to the
culture, and no team wants to be the team that's responsible for losing that,
for being the end of it.  
  
Q. Of all the streaks that are alive right now, is 10 straight Final
Fours one that you really are proud of?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to put it into any kind of context, you
know? I don't know what the previous record was. So I don't have anything to
compare it to.  
  
It's such a hard feat to accomplish in so many ways. It only takes one loss.
You're now playing best out of five or best out of seven.  
  
So in all those 10 years, all it took was one loss at the wrong time during
March and you're out. So for us to have gone 10 months of March in a row and
not having lost a game through a whole different cast of characters, over all
that time, that's pretty darned good. That is pretty darned -- that's probably
more than anything what really hits home for me.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you kind of said it before, but so much less was
expected from this group coming into the season by everyone but them, and to
have them get back to the Final Four and keep that streak going, does that
make it more special in a sense than some of the others where you kind of knew
that you were expected to get there and win a championship, or has this group
had less expectations from everybody else?  
GENO AURIEMMA: It has a certain pattern to it, the seasons, and there's themes
that run through seasons, either because a team wants an identity or because
it's cast upon them, you know. So it seemed to me like these last couple have
been all about Stewie and that group and her commitment to saying, I want to
win four National Championships. So that became the dominant theme, and these
guys were like a part of it. You know?  
  
And it became about four in a row last year. Never been done before. All the
great things that were going on, and rightly so, that became the thing, and
because we had the three best players in the country, three of the best
players in the country at their positions, it was like a foregone conclusion.
And the players that we have today, for the first time in their careers,
they've owned the whole month of March. They weren't just along for the ride.
It's theirs. And that's a huge step. That's what I told them in the locker
room. That's a big step to go from riding in the backseat on a trip that
you're going to, to all of a sudden you're in charge of driving the bus and
you're responsible for getting us there.  
  
A lot of times people have to lose to learn how to win, and for them to just
step in right where the other team left off and take immediate ownership of
it, that says a lot about who they are. You know, I can't say enough about
each and every one of them, but especially that starting five. I mean, there's
just something unique about them right now that's going on, and they deserve
all of it. And they don't have to share it with anybody; it's not anyone
else's but theirs, and they're enjoying it.  
  
Q. Napheesa has obviously been great all year. Did you expect her to
continue to play as well as she has in this tournament?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, you never know what's going to happen to kids
when they get in this environment, you know? You don't know. Sometimes they
think themselves into a mess, like they're just playing the regular season and
then somebody said, well, you know, this is one-and-done now. We don't have
three games this week and three games next week. You lose one and you're out.
Sometimes that does funny things to players.  
  
So you know, I don't know. I didn't know what to expect. But having watched
Pheesa play all year long, I can't describe what she does. She's effortless in
what she does. Seriously, it's like a self-driving car. It's just effortless.
She just goes. I mean, she's effortless on defense, too. Don't get me wrong.
But the offense for her just comes effortless. I can't even explain it. She'll
take some shots, I'll just shake my head, and there's no way to explain what
she does. It's unbelievable. She had a bad night tonight. She missed eight
shots. That's a bad night for her. She felt the pressure of the tournament, I
think.  
  
Q. You ran Ruthy off the baseline all game long. Was that something you
guys instituted in your game plan because that took her out of her game and
rhythm in the paint?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, we know we can't just stand there and slug it out with
teams. We're just not big enough. So that first half, I thought our quickness
gave Oregon a lot of problems. They're very disciplined, but yet they're not
very methodical. They're a very disciplined team that plays with a sense of
freedom that they can make the play they feel like they want to make, and what
happened in that first 15 minutes was everything that they tried to do, they
found that they couldn't just make the next pass, make the next cut. You know,
they're used to being able to do that, and tonight they couldn't do it, and
their bail-out, throw it into the post and get a bucket, once Gabby and Pheesa
started taking that away -- and that's not such a bad thing if we're not
making shots, but the fact that we're scoring every time down the floor and
they're having a problem at their end, I think it just compounds the problem
for the other team. They're a really good team, but they struggled, and we
made them struggle, not because they're a bad team, they struggled because we
made them struggle.  
  
Q. When you talk about patterns, could you liken this with one major
exception to 2003 after that whole group graduated but of course you still had
Diana and nobody else, and also when Pheesa starts, everyone said no
Americans, and now you're getting three in the votes?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, 2003, those first couple practices, that first week of
practice, maybe the first two weeks of practice, I remember looking at one of
our assistants, and I thought, we're going to win a National Championship
because Diana had the ability to take two freshmen and two other kids that had
never started a game and make them look like veterans. She did that to them.
She elevated their game by who she was, the way she played, how she talked to
them, how she led them.  
  
Going into this season, we didn't have anybody like that, so I didn't know
what was going to happen. I didn't know who was going to be responsible for
any of this stuff, and maybe that's the way it needed to be this year, so that
they all had to depend on each other instead of all depending on one person.
And they never were allowed to take a break because they all had to be there
every night or we weren't going to be able to do what we've done.  
  
So you know, them becoming All-Americans, they earned it. Their reputation
didn't get it for them. Oh, they play at UConn so they get special treatment.
They earned it this year. They played the best schedule, they beat the best
teams, and they did it under the glare of the lights that they play under all
the time, and you know, maybe Gabby should have made first-team All-American,
as well, I don't know, on the AP. I know it's a lot to ask to get three kids
in the top five. But the fact that those three were three of the top 10
players in the country, they earned it, and they deserve it.  
  
Q. Playing Mississippi State on Friday in the Final Four, I'm guessing
you probably watched some of the game last night --  
GENO AURIEMMA: I watched the whole game last night. That's not the same
Mississippi State team we played last year here. That's a whole different
team. They have a lot of the same players, but that's a whole different team.
They looked amazing last night. I mean, going into the NCAA Tournament, I
thought Baylor had the best chance of winning based on if you check all the
boxes and say, here's what you need to win, you need size, you need
experience, you need athletic ability, you need good guard play, you have to
have depth. So when you check off all the boxes, you go, wow, they're the only
team that has all that. And for Mississippi State to keep answering and keep
answering and keep answering and keep answering the entire 40 minutes, that
was an amazing performance.  
  
We're playing the same team we played last year in the regionals, but we're
not playing the same team. I think Vic should have been Coach of the Year.
That was an amazing performance that that team put together last year.  
  
Q. Obviously your scoring is noticed, the turnovers defensive-wise is
noticed. Can you speak about one thing that probably wasn't noticed tonight is
probably the rebounding, which took away a lot of their second-chance shots
and created more opportunities for you that probably is not going to show up
on the stat sheet?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. You know, we talk a lot about rebounding at both ends is
really the key to every game if you think about it. What did they shoot today?
They shot 42 percent against us, and that is because they shot 75 percent in
the third quarter. So if you eliminate that, there's not a lot of made shots
on your first attempt. So we're pretty good at guarding people in their first
attempt.  
  
But what happens is most people when they offensive rebound, their next
attempt they shoot 80 percent because you don't miss lay-ups. So your shooting
percentage goes up if you can get second shots, create more possessions, all
the stuff like you mentioned.  
  
So if we can limit people to one shot, it's really hard to score a lot of
points against us, so the game plan today was we weren't going to give them a
lot of threes, and we weren't going to put them on the free-throw line. They
shot four free throws, and they made five threes. So normally they get about
30 points from the three-point line and the foul line, and today they got 18.
So those were the two things we were trying to do more than anything, and we
knew how big they were, but our quickness, I think, negated their size today.
Sometimes size wins over quickness; today quickness wins over size.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Good morning, everyone. Yesterday was a great day in the
University of Oregon sports history, not only this team moving on to our first
Elite 8, but our men last night going to their first Final Four since 1939. I
think a couple of their players commented to us that we helped inspire them,
and now hopefully we can use the inspiration that they have given us to carry
us tomorrow.  
  
But my coach used to always say when I was in school, he said, you know, if
what you did yesterday looks good to you today, then you haven't done much
today. So we're excited to move on. Our team earned this right to be able to
have a chance to play UConn. Really proud of our effort for the entire
tournament, and certainly yesterday. I think this group has shown a real
resilience, and we look forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I'm guessing you guys watched the game last night, the men's
game. What was it like? Where did you guys watch it? Just seeing the men's
program get to their first Final Four in 75 years, Coach said it gives you
guys a little inspiration, but what does it mean to you guys?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well, we watched it, some of us together, some of us
individually. It was pretty late, so we laid in bed and watched it. But it's
awesome to see what they're accomplishing. They work hard day in and day out.
We're with them all the time in the training room, and it's just really
awesome to see. Dana is doing a great job with them, and they work hard just
like we work hard, and they're definitely inspiring us to try and work just as
hard as they are and try and accomplish what they are.  
  
Q. You guys are playing some of your best defense of the year. What's
your kind of defensive mentality at this time of year? Has it changed at all
since January?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Not really, we just have to make them hit shots, difficult
shots. That's all we can do. If they make it, then that's good for them, but
we just have to make them difficult.  
  
Q. Your entire lives, UConn women's basketball has been a powerhouse.
I'm sure you all grew up probably watching a lot of their games. What's it
like for you guys to play this team? Is it special, or do you try and view it
as just another step in what you're trying to accomplish?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, what an exciting opportunity. You know, for any athlete or
competitor, this is what you live for. You want to play at the biggest stage
against the best team. Tomorrow can't come soon enough.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we're excited for this opportunity, especially as a
young group. I think it's going to test us in many ways, and I think we're
just excited to see where we stand and get a shot at playing against the No. 1
team in the country.  
  
Q. In your view, besides the fact that they have great players, what
makes them so successful and dominate year in and year out?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, their culture. You know, they recruit great kids and
kids that want to compete and kids that want to win. They don't really have
any knuckleheads on their team. So I mean, they have great culture, great
kids, and Geno is one of a kind, so I think that definitely helps them in
achieving what they have achieved thus far and what they're going to achieve
in the future.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Mallory, can you talk about in a Napheesa Collier, what
kind of a challenge she presents for you guys, and what is it that you see in
her that makes her such a great player inside-out and how are you going to
combat that?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's a great player. I think we're blessed to be able to
play against great post players, outside players all year long. So I think
we're just going to focus on making shots difficult and playing great defense.  
  
MAITE CAZORLA: Going off what Ruthy said, she is kind of an all-around player,
so she can play outside and inside, but being able to -- like having the
height advantage is going to be really helpful for us tomorrow, but being able
to make her hit those shots from the high post is going to be probably key
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mallory, when Gabby Williams committed to UConn, her dad suggested to
Geno that they recruit another kid from that part of the country. Run me
through your experience with Gabby and the Williams family, any good stories
you may have from your time playing against them or meeting them.  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: I played against Gabby my freshman and sophomore year in high
school, and every year we did play them, it was an honor because it's Gabby,
and she was the best, one of the most decorated players to come out of
northern Nevada. She's an awesome basketball player. She's just a competitor,
and their family is a great family.  
  
We were friends off the court, too, as well, but just being able to see her
success is amazing, and from such a small town to be on this big of a stage is
amazing for her.  
  
Q. Sabrina, hearing your answer before reminded me of your coach, and
his laid-back attitude with the exciting opportunity and the knucklehead
comment. He uses that word, also. Talk about the relationship you have in one
year with the big guy sitting on the end of the stage there.  
KELLY GRAVES: Good-looking, big guy.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I know as a freshman, I've definitely gotten to know
him well during our recruiting process. He was always there. I think he maybe
missed one or two of my AAU games my whole junior year, and I think the same
with all of us. He was always there at all of our games. We just grew like a
really good relationship with him off the court, not necessarily on the court.
And I definitely think that that helps us as people, and outside of the
basketball court. But I don't know, that comment, he definitely likes the
whole knucklehead thing. I've heard it a few times.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: It's better than what my coach used to call me. We can't say it
out here.  
  
Q. Lexi, as a shooter, what kind of defensive challenges or what kind of
challenges does UConn pose on defense to someone who likes to shoot the three
ball?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, they're a great defensive team, so it's going to be a big
test for us, for everyone, and you know, I have great guards that push the
ball and find me in transition. You know, I'm not too worried, and then you
have our posts that draw so much attention.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I was wondering, you guys talked the other day about you
went to Spain for a preseason trip and that helped you guys all get to know
each other better. Can you just talk about that trip and how you guys got to
know each other better and how it brought the freshmen together?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well -- how long did we go, 12 days? We were there for
12 days, and just being out of the country for 12 days with a group of girls
that you're just starting to get to know already builds a great relationship.
Things are obviously different outside of America. We couldn't walk places
alone. We had to stay as a group in an unfamiliar territory. So I think just
all being together, we visited, like, museums and churches and cathedrals. And
I think just being able to be together for 12 days in a foreign country was
something that I think all of us definitely, like, look up to. This happens
once every four years, so I think we were really excited that it happened this
year with so many new people. We all got to know each other really well.  
  
Q. Mallory, can you talk about playing against Gabby, her athleticism
and how difficult it is to play somebody like that who can be so quick but has
the ability to play against a taller kid?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Well, I mean, the last time I played her was my sophomore
year. But being able to watch her, she's so versatile, and it's just amazing
because she can play down low, but she also has the outside game, being able
to drive from the high post and things like that, but she's also an amazing
rebounder. She can jump out of the gym. She's just an overall amazing athlete.  
  
Q. Lexi, seems like you haven't been at Oregon that long, but you're
kind of the elder statesman already. When you heard about this recruiting
class coming to Oregon, I'm sure you even hosted some of them and knew them a
little bit. When did you realize that the future could be now this year when
they're all true freshmen instead of a couple years from now?  
LEXI BANDO: Well, first off, I was so excited for this class to come in. There
was so much hype around them, and the hype was real. You know, incredible
players, incredible people off the court, and it's just a blessing to be able
to play with them. You know, I don't think people thought we were going to get
to this stage this early, but you know, these freshmen have led us here, and
it's been an incredible journey.  
  
Q. You would be the first double-digit seed to make the women's Final
Four. I realize you've got to play the game first, but if you do that, is that
a necessary step in the evolution of women's college basketball?  
And then my second question would be about the Pac-12; you've had Cheryl
Miller's era, you had Stanford winning championships. But now it looks like
the Pac-12 is doing what the SEC did years ago where they're realizing en
masse that we can really do well in women's basketball. We've got tons of
resources and beautiful campuses, so why don't we make a push; is that what's
going on, or is it just individual?  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, there was a lot in that question. The first part, in
terms of the Final Four, you know, we're playing this for us. I think that's
what we're looking forward to. I don't know if that's going to make a
statement in a bigger picture of things. But was it necessarily a goal of ours
when we set out on this season's journey? It's in front of us now, so it's
obviously something we're thinking about. You know, the Pac-12 for many years
-- and I watched it from a short distance when I was at Gonzaga -- was
Stanford and then everybody else, several teams pretty good and some not so
good, and I think what's happened, everybody has just gotten better. There are
no gimmes anymore. 1 through 12, a lot of programs are stepping up, with
Oregon State and Washington in last year's Final Four just shows how the
conference has evolved.  
  
Yeah, I think all recruits should look to come west. It's beautiful out there.
We're laid back, like Doug likes to say, about some of our coaches. And you
know, it's just a wonderful conference, great coaches, great players, awesome
places to visit when you're on the road. You know, I just think it's a
conference that will continue to get better and better. I truly do.  
  
Q. Did you think three years ago that you'd be this quickly getting to a
chance to get to the Final Four as a group, especially the group you brought
in this year, that it would be this quick a turnaround for this program?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, I'm a typical coach. I don't look that far ahead. I
like to look at the next day. But I mean, maybe not in our third year, but we
certainly expected to be a good program. I mean, there's no doubt about it,
and the way we've recruited and my staff, they deserve so much credit. They've
been phenomenal. Great recruiters, great teachers, and great people, and I
think that's kind of very much helped us get to this spot today.  
  
But yeah, I mean, the honest truth is that's why I left Gonzaga. I had a great
thing going there. We could have always been competitive, won championships,
been a threat to get to the second weekend of the tournament, but I think at
Oregon, we have the resources, the brand, the administration, the support.
Everything that we have there will help enable us to get to the lofty goals.  
  
I mean, you look at the University athletic department, and we're pretty
competitive in every single sport that we offer, and that's pretty neat. Our
kids get to rub shoulders with some of the nation's elite athletes and world's
elite athletes, and that's special. I saw that, and I have Oregon ties. My
family has Oregon ties, and I just thought it was a no-brainer to me, and I'm
really excited.  
  
To put a timeline on it, coaches can't do that. That's tough. That's tough to
think that we can get to this spot and have a chance to get to a Final Four in
our third year with so many young kids. But it's here now, so we're going to
seize upon the opportunity.  
  
Q. Today you got more resources around than existed in different ways
than before. For example, I'd say that it was not long ago that here in the
Pac-12 the scores were in the paper in the morning, when they ran scores. Now
you've got the Pac-12 Network and everybody can just get on their computers.
How much of a help is that to you when you're recruiting?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, I think the Pac-12 Network is huge. Now, I know we play
those 8:00 games sometimes; I know you're in bed already. So I don't know how
many people on the East Coast are watching. But I think it's been huge. It's
been critical.  
  
I think it's allowed those players on the West Coast the opportunity to stay
home. They don't have to go to the East Coast or the South to get the
attention nationally that they had before. So it's just opened up a lot more
doors, and I think you are seeing players on the West Coast stay on the West
Coast to play.  
  
So yeah, I think it's great. I've always felt that getting on TV is one of the
most important things you can do for a program, and certainly it's helped our
conference.  
  
Q. What kind of a performance will it take for you guys or anyone to
beat UConn this year?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, it's going to take our absolute best. There's no doubt
about it, and we've got to play for 40 minutes. You know, watching them play
and what Coach Auriemma has done is incredible. It truly is. I think they've
set a standard that is good for our sport.  
  
You know, I hear people say all the time, oh, their dominance isn't good for
the sport. Really? I think it's great for the sport. It makes us all
accountable. We need to get better. We've got to improve our game.  
  
At the same time, they're tough to watch because you know, now we've got to
play them. But they are a lot of fun to watch. They play the game the right
way. They share the ball. They play hard. They play very smart. They never
beat themselves. They play together, and then what they do is they play for 40
minutes, and if you let down even for a minute, they can spur a 10-0 run and
you're buried, and that's what they do.  
  
People can play with them for a time, but can they play with them for 40
minutes? And that's the challenge we have ahead of us. We've got to play a
40-minute game. Things are going to go wrong. We've got to lift our heads up
and fight through it and continue to fight, and this team has shown that kind
of resilience. I'm not going to sit here and just say we're happy to be here.
We are happy to be here, but I have a really good basketball team, and I have
a basketball team who believes in themselves and in each other, and so we're
excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Geno Auriemma was one of the coaches that was quoted in your press
release when you were hired at Oregon, had nice things to say about you. How
close are you with Geno and how has that relationship developed throughout the
years?  
KELLY GRAVES: Obviously I admire him a lot. We've had a chance to spend a
little bit of time together. We're not calling each other every week to check
up, but we have a friendly relationship, and I think there's mutual
admiration. I really appreciated the things he said when I was first hired at
Oregon. You know, he has a close Nike relationship, just like we do at the
University. And the things he said yesterday, that means a lot to me. And I
share the same admiration of him. I think he's -- listen, I'm going to go out
and say, I think he's the best coach in basketball, male, female, men's
basketball, women's basketball. He's just absolutely phenomenal, what he does,
and how he motivates and coaches, and it's going to be an honor to play
tomorrow, and that being said, I hope I kick his butt.  
  
But I'm really looking forward to testing ourselves against the very best.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, have you played UConn before at any point in
your career at Gonzaga, Oregon? Also, a lot of teams when they play them for
the first time, there's that mystique, see the jersey, see the UConn, and
you're already down 10-0. You said they don't really seem to care who they're
playing, they just play basketball. Does that help you that there doesn't seem
to be that awe factor?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I hope so. And to answer your first question, I have never
played UConn, and I hope -- I mean, if they had that issue, they would have
maybe shown that against Duke. That's a pretty big brand. Maryland, another
big brand, and they haven't shown those kind of in-awe feelings or behaviors.
Hopefully that's not the case tomorrow. I can't answer that because we haven't
played them. But I have a way of keeping our kids focused and grounded, so I
think we're just going to be worried about ourselves and how we perform, and
if it's good enough tomorrow, it's good enough. If it's not, it's not. But
hopefully they're not just looking at that jersey on the opponent.  
  
Q. When you get a win like you had yesterday, the first thing you hear
up here is right now we're going to enjoy this one tonight and then we'll get
ready. It's UConn. How long did enjoy this tonight last?  
KELLY GRAVES: Until I called my wife and talked to her, and we had some fun
words. And then after that, it was watching tape. That's not always pleasant,
you know, when you're sitting there trying to figure out how the heck you can
stop those guys. But for players, I always tell them enjoy it tonight because
we don't show them any film or talk to them until the next morning anyway. But
as coaches, your work begins as soon as the work just ended. That's just the
nature of the business. They've got several months to rest and pat ourselves
on the back and things like that once this tournament is over.  
  
Q. As you were assembling this recruiting class going to their AAU
tournaments and whatnot, did you have a sense each piece that you added that
this was becoming something really special?  
KELLY GRAVES: I did. I did. You know, our first year there was tough. We went
13-17, and the one thing that kept us going was we were on the recruiting
trail, it seemed endlessly. My family actually stayed in Spokane. My middle
son was a senior at Gonzaga Prep in Spokane, so they actually stayed there the
entire year, and I see that as a blessing because I didn't have any -- there
was no guilt. There was no guilt, like Honey, how come you're not home
tonight? I was able to go on the road and spend a lot of time recruiting. Same
with my staff.  
  
And we knew what we were able to get on the recruiting trail, and with each
"yes," each commitment, it kind of reenergized us and kept us going through
what was a tough year. I hadn't had many losing seasons as a coach, and that's
how we kind of base our happiness, unfortunately, is on the won-loss record.
But with each success on the recruiting trail, it kind of gave us more
momentum and confidence, and it really kind of got us through that year.  
  
But with each commitment, seriously, we were starting to go, wow, this is
something special, this is something special. And we had a great recruiting
year, and that was just -- the cherry on top was Sabrina. We waited a long
time for that commitment, but she kind of solidified everything. She was that
Alpha that you need to kind of put it all together. So it was quite a journey
that first year.  
  
Q. What was Oregon's pitch to you? Did they feel like women's basketball
was a sport that hadn't measured up to, say, more recently, football or track
and field in a long time? Did they think, this is a sport that's emerging,
we've got a lot of resources we can put into it, and then what made you
finally decide, all right, I'm taking this job?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, Lisa Peterson, our associate athletic director back there,
was a great salesperson. There's no doubt about it. It was an easy sell, quite
frankly. I loved Gonzaga. I absolutely loved it. My family and I would have
been happy to stay there forever.  
  
But I think professionally, every coach wants to be challenged a little bit,
and I knew going to the Pac-12 would be a challenge that I was ready for. We'd
won 10 straight championships, and one of the things Lisa told me was, well,
good luck winning your 11th, like is this what you really want? So there were
some coaching colleagues that I relied on and talked to, and they all
encouraged me to take that next step. You know, and my wife is born and raised
in Portland. All her family lives in Portland. We have a vacation home about
an hour and a half from Eugene that's our favorite spot on earth. It was seven
hours from Spokane, but an hour and a half from Eugene so we were down in the
area a lot. I have a lot of friends that live in the area. It was the only
place I would have ever left for. Like I said, I loved Gonzaga. And how great
was yesterday, for a Gonzaga/Duck fan to have two teams go to the Final Four?  
  
You know, and the pitch they made and the -- I'm trying to say the support
that I knew we were going to get sold me on it. Like I said, I'm happy to be
there. I'm happy to be a Duck, and privileged to be the coach there.  
  
Q. You never told me what their pitch was.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, their pitch was to come home a little bit. We want to be a
National Championship program. I mean, they threw all that, and it matched,
because that's what I want, too. Not that you can't get there from Gonzaga,
and the men are obviously showing that. However, it's different in the men's
game than it is the women's game. The last so-called mid-major to go to the
Final Four on the women's side was 2001 with Jackie Stiles, one of the
preeminent players in the history of our game, and that's a long time ago. So
it's a lot more difficult on the women's side to get there, and professionally
I wanted that challenge to do it, and I think Oregon offered me that.  
  
Q. How could you watch film yesterday when Gonzaga's men and the Oregon
men were playing for a chance to go to the Final Four? That's your two
schools? How could you sit there and watch film when history could be made
right there? And we talked the other day about Oregon basketball versus Oregon
football and putting basketball on the map a little bit more. You guys have
the big tournament next year, the Phil Knight thing for the mean and the
women, which was really going to be the showcase, like, wow, Oregon
basketball, all these teams coming here to play for Phil Knight. But now with
the men in the Final Four and you guys a step away from the Final Four, that
national picture is coming a little bit earlier than that I would think.  
KELLY GRAVES: Pretty cool. I mean, it's pretty cool. To answer the first part
of your question, business before pleasure, all right. Business before
pleasure. And you see these bags under the eyes? You can do both. You can
watch and enjoy the games on TV and then watch your next opponent, too. You
know, sleep is overrated, quite frankly.  
  
And then I have a great staff, who, they are on this thing, big-time. But
yeah, I think we've been known as a track and field school and a football
school. I think it's really special.  
  
You know, to me what's really, really cool is I go through a lot of our -- on
Facebook, I get so many messages and texts and tweets and all that kind of
stuff, like everybody does, but some of our past alums, who I never coached,
have changed their Facebook profiles, pictures, to them in their Duck uniform.
And they've reached out, some of our great players -- and there is a history,
a tradition at the University of Oregon of good basketball, winning
basketball, championship basketball. It's neat to see them kind of reconnect
and be proud of their program and reach out, and I think that's something that
Oregon has been waiting for. And now we just hope to follow the lead of our
men. They just keep one-upping us. For crying out loud. But good for Dana and
good for his guys.  
  
Q. I first met you when Gonzaga wasn't Gonzaga yet and you took a trip
across the country to play St. Joseph's and then you were going home. I think
I remember the motivation for that.  
KELLY GRAVES: We were really good. We were on the ascent, I guess I can say
that. And somebody told me, a very wise person, told me you need to play on
the East Coast so people can see how good you guys really are, so we started
doing that. That trip was one of the first ones we took to the East Coast, and
we tried to get back at least to the Midwest, sometimes to the South, and then
the East Coast a lot, so people could see how good Gonzaga was. I remember
that trip. We got them that morning. I think it was kids' day, too. Yeah, it
was loud. Yeah, that was a fun trip, a really fun trip.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: It's cold. Other than that, you know, we're in a game that we
want to be in, obviously. It's a game that everybody wants to be in. It's the
last step, really, to where every kid wants to be. Every kid wants to be in
the Final Four. It's what they talk about when they go to college, playing in
the Final Four.  
  
So the day before the game and then all day tomorrow is probably the most
stressful time. The actual game itself is fun to play in. I know the players
are excited about it, and it's good that we're playing a team that we've not
played and don't know that much about. So there's a little bit of a difference
preparing for them than it would be, say, if it was Maryland or somebody else
that we had played already during the year. So that should be fun the next
couple days. We're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what have you seen about Oregon that's
impressed you on film or watching them yesterday at all?  
SANIYA CHONG: Well, looking at them, we know they have some pretty good
guards, and they definitely can get into the lane. And when they're coming off
ball screens, they're pretty good in kick-outs, so we're pretty aware of that,
and we're going to stop that.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Like Saniya said, they have some really good guards and some
tall posts, so we're going to try to keep them off the line and keep the ball
away from the big guys.  
  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, they pretty much covered it, but obviously focusing on great
team defense tomorrow and understanding that they have a lot of pieces that
they can use, and for us it's not going to be an individual performance on
defense as it usually is, it's going to be a team thing, focus and emphasis.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, like Kia said, focusing mainly on defense tomorrow.
They have a couple bigs and really good guards that we need to stop.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think everyone pretty much covered everything. We've
got to stop dribble penetration, make sure we have good perimeter defense, and
just make their big guys run.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, two-part question: Do you have your phone with you? Are
you watching Karlie right now? And could you explain how your relationship
with your sisters has helped you get to this point?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Well, I'm trying to get back as quickly as possible to
watch Karlie play. It's definitely been a great experience being able to watch
her succeed so much in this tournament, and she's motivated me so much
throughout my life, and I'm really proud to be her sister.  
  
Q. Kia, Coach said that it was nice to play somebody new that you
haven't played before. You guys have the same sort of feeling that you've
played Maryland, played other teams that are still alive, but this is a team
you haven't played ever?  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, absolutely. It's fun to be in a situation where it's kind of
out of the usual. It's a team that they've had a great run so far. There's a
reason that they're here, that they've been successful with their
multidimensional pieces. And I think for us coming up today and tomorrow,
being prepared as much as we can, understanding that we have to be great and
better at things that we didn't do well in the last game and trying to fix
those for this next one.  
  
Q. Kia, you played a pretty key role as a freshman in a National
Championship run. Can you just address how impressed you are watch these
Oregon freshmen, how composed they are, how they're handling the high-pressure
stakes?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, your first NCAA Tournament is never an easy thing, and I
think they're doing a great job handling, not only the stakes and the high
pressure in every single game, but also the distractions and everything else
that comes along with it. Obviously they've done a great job for their team.
They've been a big piece of what they do, and it'll be a great defensive
match-up tomorrow.  
  
Q. I'm curious just how much interest or how much you watched Sabrina
play in high school. Sounded like you maybe saw a couple of games in northern
California.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. She's one of those kids that was good for a long time.
You know, she was on everybody's radar as a young player. It didn't just
happen as a high school senior or junior. You know, there's a lot of things
about her game that are just really fun to watch. I did get a chance to see
her play a lot in high school, both during the summer and a couple times in
California. And it's not really a surprise what she's doing because she has
the kind of a game that is a little bit older than she is, which is not usual.
You know, usually kids play right about their age. She plays a little bit
older because her game is not necessarily based on how fast she is or her
ability to -- it's not like -- it's a complete difference than Jordin Canada,
let's say. She just has her own unique style, the way she plays, and it's fun
to watch, and it's effective, and it's exactly what this team needs for them.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you weren't really surprised about what Oregon is
doing; what was it about Kelly Graves and that marriage with Oregon women's
basketball that you thought would make them kind of a rising power?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, a couple things. I don't know every sport at Oregon. I'm
not that familiar with every single one of their sports. But it seems to me
that most of their sports are pretty good, and they're pretty good nationally.
I remember seeing their baseball team play our baseball team in the NCAA
Tournament, and I thought -- the only thing they need is the right person.
It's not like somebody has got to go in there and reinvent something. It's
already there. It's a great place, great facilities, and they have a national
brand that they didn't used to have, say, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. They
were maybe more of a West Coast team. Now they seem to be a national team.  
  
I used to tell my friends that you knew Oregon had arrived -- it had nothing
to do with anything big. But their football program just captured a lot of
people's imagination back in the day, you know, and that's kind of how it all
made sense to the East Coast people, because of how quickly they became
significant in football, which seems to be what everybody drives everything on
these days.  
  
I remember reading in the paper, it was really funny, Terrelle Pryor, when he
was coming out of high school was like the No. 1 football recruit in America.
And we recruit a lot of kids from western Pennsylvania, and I grew up in
Philadelphia. So when I read who his final schools were, it was exactly who
you would think: Penn State, Pittsburgh, Ohio State, and Oregon. I'm like,
you've got to be kidding me. That's when you say, all right, it's a little bit
different than it was 25 years ago. So all they needed was just the right
person, and his success at Gonzaga, I mean, they didn't have to look far, and
they got the right guy. They got the right coach.  
  
Like anything else, you know, when you've got the right person at the top and
you get the support of the university, this is what happens, and it should
happen more places.  
  
Q. We seem to talk about it every year, but attendance this year at the
Regionals, except for this place, has been pretty pathetic. I think 3,000
people were down in Oklahoma City and then Lexington and 4,500 out west, and
probably going to be a lot worse tomorrow night. Any thoughts on what they can
potentially do to make these Regionals, get people to show up to them as
opposed to this year where it just wasn't very good?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. That's a good question that seems to be popping
up a lot more. I don't know what exactly the answer is to be honest with you.
Women's basketball is kind of unique, you know? Like, I think the biggest
mistake that women's basketball has made over the years is trying to be like
men's basketball, and at some point they're going to realize they're not. And
once they realize they're not, then women's basketball can start working on
what's best for women's basketball.  
  
You know, the whole idea of, early on even, the huge arenas, the big places,
the crazy starting times. It's like everything they did was, well, if the men
can do it, we can do it. Well, no you can't, so stop pretending you can. It's
like a reminder all the time. Women's basketball fans are not basketball fans,
they're fans of their team for the most part, and then you've got some places
where they're really women's basketball fans.  
  
And you know, until people start betting a lot of money on women's basketball,
that's just the way it's going to be.  
  
So we have a unique situation that needs to be handled. I'm not saying I know
what all the answers are, but there's certain places in America that there's a
lot of really good women's basketball fans, and there's a lot of places that
it's not. So to put Regionals in those places doesn't make any sense.  
  
However, I don't blame necessarily the NCAA and the committees because a lot
of places don't want to host the Regionals. So you might end up having a
situation like they have in all the other sports, where you're going to end up
going and playing more home sites, unfortunately. But that's the reality.  
  
Q. As far as Katie Lou goes, where has she kind of grown the most since
she got to UConn, and is there any particular challenge with a West Coast kid
and anything you have to focus on when they make the trip out east?  
GENO AURIEMMA: How much time do you have?  
  
Q. As long as you have. I have a flight back at 8:00 tonight.  
GENO AURIEMMA: It still won't be enough time.  
  
Yeah, it presents a unique challenge when you get somebody that has to travel
that far to go to school, number one, and that would be no matter what.  
  
Number two, I guess kids grow up differently out there. There's just a
different mindset, a different attitude, a different mentality. And that's not
like across the board 100 percent, because Diana Taurasi's personality was
completely different than Lou's, and Lou is different than Kaleena Lewis, and
Kaleena Lewis was different than Charde Houston or Wilnette Crockett.  
  
So we've had a bunch of kids from California, and they've all been a little
bit different on their own, but there's this, hey, don't worry about it,
everything will be fine. It doesn't fly real well in my world, hey, don't
worry about it, everything will be fine.  
  
So one of the biggest challenges is that you have to try to convince them that
everything is important, every little thing is important. And a lot of times
with Lou, she wants to decide what's important, and I've said this before: The
worst thing that can happen to a kid is when they make a lot of shots at an
early age, and Lou did that, Diana did that, Kaleena did that. And when they
get here, there's a lot of things that they don't necessarily think are
important in the game of basketball, and it's a struggle in the beginning. And
then once they realize it, then it just (snaps fingers).  
  
Like, I think from my experience, California basketball players -- and Lou
especially, is a good example -- they're like Italian car drivers in Italy.
Like red lights, stop signs, whatever; they're just a suggestion. You don't
necessarily have to do it. So Lou, get your hands up on defense when a guy is
a good three-point shooter like the Korver kid. It's not like she's going to
do it, but it's a suggestion. She might do it, she might not. And it pisses me
off, don't get me wrong, but that's life.  
  
Q. Historically your program doesn't lose to unranked teams. You don't
have a history of upsets. How do you keep your team focused on the next game
and keep them from not looking ahead?  
GENO AURIEMMA: By being pissy every day, and it's not healthy. You have to get
the right kind of kids generally speaking. I find myself saying that a lot,
generally speaking, because it's almost impossible anymore to categorize
something as exactly this. But when you start with the right players that,
one, want to be on a great team or they wouldn't come here; two, they want to
be really good because they sense that if they come to Connecticut, they have
a chance to be something really special if they work at it. So once they
decide to make that commitment and they're willing to give up a little bit of
their ego for it, then you can appeal to them about what it takes to get
better and how much you have to improve every minute of every day, and how you
have to prove every game that you're as good as you think you are.  
  
So going out and going through the motions and losing to somebody that has no
business beating you, that makes you like everybody else, so why did you come
here? I find myself saying that -- Chloe, how many times do I say that, right?
She's new to our program. I must say that every day. If you want to be like
everybody else, why did you come here? So we're trying to be different. We're
trying to do things that are hard to do, that are not the norm. So if you're
just going to go out and half-ass through something, then why did you come
here? And then after a while, they get tired of hearing that and they don't
want to hear it anymore.  
  
But I don't think it's anything other than we appeal to them, and we won't put
up with it if they don't. And generally, we have enough good players that I
can teach them a lesson and bench their butts. This year they got me, though.
I can't do it, I've got to play them, whether they put their hand up on
defense or not. I've got to play them. But that's changing in a couple months.  
  
Q. Both Oregon and Connecticut have strong Nike ties and you guys are
going out to play there in Eugene next year, albeit not against the Ducks. Is
there some kind of Nike family thing going where you guys are all part of the
same --  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, we're acquaintances with Nike, yeah. Oregon is related to
Nike. It's a big difference. They're part of the close-knit family. We're an
acquaintance, although a strong one. We do like to think of it as family, when
we all get together as coaches, all the Nike coaches, and that's where we kind
of establish a certain bond, a certain familiarity with each other. You know,
that's kind of -- even before Kelly got involved in USA Basketball, that was
kind of my first really getting to know Kelly, at all those Nike trips. And
you do get to interact with other coaches, and some you do get to be friends
with, and you do get to follow their careers and all that.  
  
And Nike always has been very, very adamant about we are all part of a family
thing, and that's how it's handled. That's how it's run. That's how it's
gotten to be where it is. That's why they are who they are, because of the way
they treat people and the way we treat each other. You know? I don't know,
maybe there's an extra pair of sneakers in Kelly's room last night for beating
an Under Armour school. There is a little bit of competition there, I know.  
  
Q. Geno, you've every year seemed to say that this game tomorrow night,
somebody has to step up, some player usually carries you to the Final Four. Do
you have any idea tomorrow night who may be the one to step up and be that
player?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No. If you'd have asked me last year, it would be easy for the
most part. I've got three guys to pick from, for the most par, and one you
knew for the most part. But I don't know, this year it's been kind of
different. I mean, it's like Napheesa has been pretty constant, Lou has been
pretty constant, Kia has been amazing this tournament. And then Gabby is just
-- some games she's the complete difference-maker, in spite of all the other
players. And then yesterday it was Saniya.  
  
I really don't know. I wish I could tell you, yeah, these two guys are. But
I'm watching Notre Dame play Stanford, and the kid from Notre Dame has 21 in
the first half. You want somebody to step up and do that. You want somebody
tomorrow to go, yeah, I got this. Whether it's on our team or their team, it's
probably going to happen. But as to who it's going to be, I don't know. I
don't know. Hopefully it's not just one. Hopefully it's a couple of them.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Oregon - 77, Maryland - 63  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I just want to congratulate Coach Frese and her team. I'll tell
you, I have had zero sleep over the last four days, and a lot of it is just
because I've been watching film of them. They're so impressive, and she's got
a great team, and they had an awesome season.  
  
Also, obviously very happy that we're moving on. I continue to be amazed at
this team. You know, just the fact that over the last five days we went cross-
country twice, had final exams, played a great team -- three great teams in
this tournament. And you know, they continue to show poise down the stretch,
and I'll tell you, it's just impressive to watch. We continue to get better
and better as a basketball team. We're excited to move on, regardless of who
we play next.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how were you guys able to control the tempo of this game and
keep them well under their normal scoring average?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, we just buckled down on defense, and we got back in
transition and tried to stop their easy transition buckets. But we did what we
do offensively. We got it side-top-side, pounded it down low to the bigs and
did what we usually do.  
  
Q. Oti, obviously you've had one of your biggest games of your college
career here on this level. What does it feel like, and what was your mentality
coming into this game when Mallory picked up her fourth foul?  
OTI GELDON: It felt great. Coming off the bench, I just had to make sure I did
whatever I needed to do for the team, which was defense and rebounding, so I
just had to make sure I kept doing that.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Oti, it seemed like it was sort of a team effort to slow
down Bri Jones. If you could take me through what the mindset was going in,
how you go about doing that, and when you knew it was working the way it
ultimately did.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's an amazing player. We definitely scout her a lot,
how to guard her, how to try to stop her. I think we just focused on getting
low and trying to force out of the paint, which was definitely tough, but I
think we did a pretty good job of it.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, can you talk about how you guys have evolved in
your freshman year? Do you think you're at a point now where -- obviously the
team is playing its best -- that you've gotten over whatever freshman things
you might have had, and has that helped during the tournament?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Like Coach always says, we're not freshmen anymore, we're 30, 35
games in. So I think once we step on the court, we're all just ball players.
It doesn't matter grade you're in, how young you are, so I think we just go on
the court every day wanting to win, and we try our best.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I mean, 30-plus games in, we're
not freshmen anymore. Especially now, this late in the tournament, we've just
got to come out every game and work hard and try and get as many wins as we
can.  
  
Q. Coach Frese talked about how this team, the Oregon team, reminds her
of her own National Championship team in 2006, as you guys start mostly
underclassmen. What has it been like playing in the tournament and that
experience and having this type of run?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, we're blessed. We're blessed to be in this position,
and I think we're just excited about everything. No one's been here. None of
our kids have ever experienced anything like that. So I think we're just
excited to be able to advance and play another day and see where that takes
us.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, it's an amazing feeling to be here, and I think every day
we just go out and work hard and try to win the game so we can get another
game.  
  
OTI GELDON: Yeah, piggy-backing off what they said, it's really exciting. We
just need to make sure we stay focused and continue to do what we're doing
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. This question is for Sabrina: You were hitting your shots. You were
clearly hitting clutch threes, but also No. 10, Lexi Bando, she was seeming to
have like an issue missing the three. But you guys never quit on her or gave
up on her, and she answered and responded later in the second half. Did you
say anything to her or did you guys just -- it was just kind of a rhythm
thing, we're going to keep coming to you until you get on fire?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I definitely said a few things to her. Sorry, just saying.
But she's the best shooter in America, so we all hold her to a high standard,
and I definitely hold her to a high standard. I told her before the game, if
she stops shooting, she's being selfish. She needs to let that ball fly, and I
told her she needed to quicken her shot up a little bit. I think she was
taking too much time to get it up and thinking about, you know, she wanted
this to go in. So I told her just quicken her shot up and just let it fly, and
she did.  
  
Q. Brenda Frese said they don't know any better, that they should be
nervous at this time because you have such a young team. What do you think
about that? She has that experience with having a really young team go all the
way to the Final Four. Do you know any better? Are you at all nervous about
the fact that you're now in the Elite 8, one step away from the Final Four?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I don't think so. I think Coach said it before the game that
it's just another game. We're just on a bigger stage, but it's still the same
game. We're all comfortable playing, and I think we're just going to take it
game by game and keep doing what we do.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I don't think we're really nervous. We have nothing to
lose. It's kind of fun to see. We all laugh and giggle and just are really
excited to be here and enjoy this opportunity that we have. So I think we
continue to enjoy this opportunity and work hard and good things will come to
us.  
  
OTI GELDON: I think the Pac-12 prepared us well for this tournament. Maryland
was definitely a really good team, but we've played Stanford and UCLA and
teams like that, so I think we were prepared for them when we came into this
game today.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you spoke yesterday about saying you didn't know what to
expect come March, this being your first time in. But here you are running
this team, talking to Lexi through her shooting problems. You're going to
coach the 3-on-3 team coming down. Obviously leadership is not an issue for
you when it comes to that and making those series of threes in the first half
of this game. Here you are for the first time; how comfortable is it? How much
does this fit and how much is it you as a player now?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, basketball is basketball regardless of really what
stage you're on, and I hold these kids accountable, preseason and now. I want
everyone to try their best, exceed all the expectations that people have for
us, especially as freshmen. So I think that just builds into the leadership
that I have for this team, and I think our coaches do a really good job on
setting a vision for us, and we're trying to achieve everything that we set
out to achieve.  
  
Q. If UConn manages to beat UCLA, you're going to face UConn. It's going
to be the potential for one of the greatest upsets in history to cap off this
run. Have you allowed yourself to think about it in those terms?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, regardless what team is going to win tonight, we're
going to be prepared. So whatever is going to happen, when that ball goes in
the air is going to happen, but I know that we're not going to go down easy.
We're going to give every team a fight. We're going to play our hardest, and
if that means we upset the No. 1 team in the country, then that's what's going
to happen.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how eager were you to face Destiny, obviously one of the
top-rated point guards in your class, and based on the numbers you outplayed
her. Was that even more satisfying as a part of the win?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, not at all. It was my team versus her team, it wasn't me
versus her. The numbers and all that doesn't matter to me. I think I was just
excited that our team withstood their run and we withstood what they had to
offer and got the win.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you talk a little bit about some of the aspects of the
Oregon game that you'd like to see maybe tighten up or really hit strides a
little sooner for the next game as you advance in the tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think we need to take care of the ball a little more. We
got a little bit careless with it there in the second half, so I think we just
need to take care of the ball, continue to move it side-top-side. We'll hit
shots. We do that pretty well. We keep pounding it in down low to our great
post players, we'll hit the mid-range shots. I think if we continue to do what
we're doing, we'll be fine come Monday.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Like she said, take care of the ball, making sure you hit every
rebound and definitely get a fight up there in the air, and I think with that,
we'll definitely be ready.  
  
OTI GELDON: If we continue to do well on defense and transition, stopping them
in transition, I think we'll continue to do well.  
  
Q. Sabrina, on the flipside of you guys playing so loose and care-free,
when you are in control of the game whether it's against Duke or tonight
against Maryland, can you feel the other team kind of crumbling under the
weight of expectations and getting tight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I don't think a lot of teams are really prepared for us to
come out how we did, and the atmosphere was great. It was loud, and I don't
think they were really prepared for what we had to offer that late. But no,
we're just excited. We get the ball to the people that need to have the ball
in their hands that late in the game, and we do what we do.  
  
Q. You had mentioned yesterday that these guys probably don't realize
what they're doing at this point; can you just address the poise and that
whole aspect of this? Are they playing with house money at this point? Are you
surprised at how loose they are and what they're doing?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, you just said all of it, really. I think it's all in the
attitude. I think they are playing loose. They're a loose team, so it's not
like we're -- we try to make them that way.  
  
They just continue to show great poise, and I think Oti had a great response
to a question. I think the Pac-12 has really prepared us for this moment.
Whoever we play in this next game is going to be like our 11th game against a
team on the 1, 2, or 3 seed line. And we've played three or four against 4
seeds.  
  
So we've played against a lot of really good teams. We've played them tough.
We've won a few. So I think our kids, the more you win these close games and
these big games, they start to believe. Like they said, they really don't have
a lot to lose.  
  
Q. Coach, most people get one 40-year-old freshman point guard in a
generation and you had Vandersloot. Talk about what it's like to have somebody
like Sabrina. She acts so much older than she is as a freshman, the way she
takes responsibility for things and the way that she seems to conduct herself
and take care of business.  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. Good comparison. Her and Courtney share a lot of the
same traits that have nothing to do with skills on the basketball court.
They're great leaders. They're hard workers. They have a competitive spirit
that defines them. I think they give their teammates a lot of confidence
knowing that, hey, tonight we're going to have the best player on the floor,
and all those things are so valuable.  
  
And then you add to that all the things she can do on the court, a diverse
range of talents. It's not just the shooting, it's the penetration, it's her
elite vision that she has, especially in transition, her ability to scrap out
rebounds for a 5'10" slow kid. You know, she's the whole package. She truly
is.  
  
Q. Kelly, two-part question. Maryland came in averaging 90 points a
game, best scoring offense in the country. You hold them to a season low 63.
What was working?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, that was the key to the game. I think we did a few things
well. Number one, early on, we just tried to go to 2-2-1, just a little tempo
press to slow them down. I think, number two, we didn't turn the ball over a
lot, so they weren't able to get out and get easy baskets in transition.
Thirdly, I thought we shot a decent percentage, especially in the second half.
We shot the ball really well, and we played the game at our tempo.  
  
Offensively we wanted to, like Sabrina likes to say, side-top-side. We kept
moving the basketball and making them defend. You know, we just -- really, I
thought defensively and tempo-wise, we played about as good a game as we can
play, because to beat them you've got to lessen the number of possessions.  
  
Q. We had talked the other day about trying to counteract Maryland's
experience. You hold Shatori 6 for 18 in shooting, Bri missed a bunch of lay-
ups. What were you able to do to frustrate them?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you know, we're big. We're taller than the average team,
so that helps. Even though we committed some fouls that I wish we wouldn't
have, and we'll talk about that in the day in between, we can match teams'
size and make it difficult for them to shoot over us.  
  
I thought inside, playing them to a one-rebound difference was key. They've
been crushing people on the boards, and we did a good job there. They didn't
kill us on second-chance points. And I think lastly, they didn't make a three.
And if you can make these guys shoot twos, you've got a chance.  
  
Q. Just to jump off that point, not just the fact that they had no made
threes, but they only attempted six. What were you doing schematically to
chase them off the line?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, that's just what we were doing. We were trying to chase
them off the line. You can't leave No. 12, and I thought with Walker-
Kimbrough, we did just a really good job of getting over the top of screens. I
thought consistently, defensively, our team did a great job of staying
focused. You know, sometimes you might go under a ball screen and that gives
her license to take that shot. We consistently went over the top, and they
really played it well.  
  
I think it's just kind of a focus thing. And again, they didn't get a lot of
opportunity in transition, which is where they get it. Slocum and Walker-
Kimbrough, they do a good job of probing and pushing the ball in transition.
That's when they get those kick-out threes, and we just didn't allow a lot of
that tonight.  
  
Q. You guys have been a pretty good transition defensive team all year,
but you actually are 236th in the country in terms of the half court. That's
the whole season, though. Is there a dramatic difference in how well you
played defensively in the half court? What is responsible for this run in
large part?  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. That's the area we've improved the most from day one.
I don't know if you have any game left, but if you'd played us early in the
season, you'd have been an All-American. We couldn't guard anybody, and we've
gotten better and better and better, and I think that's where our team has
shown the most growth. Your defense is what's tested in the tournament, and
we've passed it three times, those tests.  
  
Q. What was the locker room like? Obviously Mark Campbell's birthday and
he's now got that winner stays shirt going, you guys got the mojo in the
locker room.  
KELLY GRAVES: I gave them double trouble tonight. I did the same thing. It was
pretty euphoric. It was pretty euphoric. We had a lot of fun, and I'm just
excited that they're excited. I'm wet all over the place here, but it's really
worth it. There's nothing sweeter than victory.  
  
Q. You had five players that went into double digits. Just talk about
the distribution of the ball on offense.  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought offensively we were on point tonight. We had a few too
many turnovers, as they already talked about, but I thought we had long,
drawn-out possessions. I thought in that stretch in the third quarter we
started to separate a little bit. They were switching up their defenses, and
we were able to hit Lexi Bando a couple times in that corner, and those are
big lifts. You know, she can get three at a time, it just makes us a lot
tougher to guard because we've got Ruthy inside that demands some attention.
We have Sabrina, who can just do a lot with the ball in her hand, and I
thought Maite Cazorla tonight was tremendous. She rarely gets the attention
she deserves, but she had an excellent game, excellent floor game. Didn't come
out I don't think, and just solid at the point.  
  
I think that's just kind of how we play. We share the ball, and I think we
play the right way.  
  
Q. What is it about Oti that you think she's raised her level on the
biggest stage to help you guys advance?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, she's fearless, won a couple of State championships in
high school. She gives us an energy that others don't, and let's face it, we
got in some foul trouble inside, so she had to play a little bit. But I
completely trust her. She's so versatile and attacks the rebounds with
abandon. You know, and her confidence, you can see, her confidence is just
rising game in, game out.  
  
Q. You guys have shot the three well all year. What were you able to do,
especially second half, to open things up for yourself inside?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think they may have pressed a little bit. They started
to pick us up full court, put some pressure on us. That spreads out the
defense, and we were able to reverse the ball quickly and find that shooter in
the corner. They switched a little bit more to a zone in the second half, and
again, tried to trap ball screens, and when you do that on us, we have elite
passers, Maite Cazorla and Sabrina are great passers, so they'll find Bando
over there. They know where she's at.  
  
Q. You talked about experience. Your players talked about experience.
Would you say that was the answer, because it seemed like you had an answer
for every time Maryland shot a switch, whether they went to full court,
whether they went to zone, whether they double-teamed a player. You guys
always had an answer.  
And the second question is do you think that gives you an advantage against
a top-ranked team like a UConn or a UCLA or whoever wins today?  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you know, the experience thing now, the point is kind of
moot because we have three games of experience now in this tournament, like I
said, plus a tough, tough Pac-12 schedule.  
  
Yeah, I think in our league, if you knew our league, there's different teams,
different styles. We've got the teams that slow it down and really focus on
defense. We've got the athletic teams that like to push tempo and pressure-
defend. So we've kind of seen it all at this point, and now it's just a matter
of our players executing, playing smart, and we have really smart players, and
it helps to have two elite play makers in Maite and Sabrina who have excelled
on an international level.  
  
I think we're prepared going in, and my staff does an awesome job. I'm blessed
with the best assistant coaches in the world who prepare these guys for game
situations.  
  
Q. No matter what happens in this game that's being played right now,
you're going to have a chance to make some history, either by being the lowest
seed to ever make it to the Final Four or a chance to have the type of upset
victory over UConn that no one has ever done. No one has ever stopped a streak
that long. Have you given yourself a chance to think about that in these
moments afterwards, and do you think a team like this, a team on a roll, and a
team that doesn't have enough experience to necessarily know what they're
doing is the best position to do it?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't know. I don't know. You know, we obviously haven't been
in this situation. These guys haven't. It's going to take -- either UCLA or
UConn, it doesn't matter. It's going to take our absolute best performance of
the year to move on. And quite frankly, I haven't really even thought about it
yet. I'm kind of taking this win in. Just happy for my team. I truly am. I'm
proud of them and just happy for them. I mean, they've worked really hard, and
I know, so has Maryland, so has everybody else has worked hard, but this is a
really special group, and they're showing that right now.  
  
Yeah, I'll enjoy it. Talk to me tomorrow. I might have a different answer for
you.  
  
Q. One other person that doesn't seem to get enough credit around here
is you. You are now the first person to take two double-seeded teams to the
Elite 8 in the history of the tournament. Let's talk for a second about you
and what you're doing to get these teams prepared and why this doesn't seem to
be a problem for you.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I wouldn't say it's not a problem. I mean, you know, I
don't know. I think I just have -- I'm able to compartmentalize. I'm able to
put things in perspective. I don't really ever get too high or too low, try to
keep the kids focused. The one thing I have been able to do over the years, I
think this is my ninth or tenth win as a double-digit seed. I think it's just
throw out the seeds, who cares, we're a good team. We are a good basketball
team, we're in the field, we're a good team. And I always say a good team with
nothing to lose is a dangerous team.  
  
I think our kids just can play loose because they don't see me uptight. I'm
not going to overplay the next opponent's hand, just like we didn't overplay
this one. I just think that's what you've got to do. I think kids like the
consistency. If you build every team up and they can't play, you start to lose
credibility. I think consistency has always been the best medicine.  
  
Plus we let them know that we've had success as a lower digit so that they can
believe in their coach a little bit. You know, you kind of play on any
advantage that you can have. But listen, I've never scored a basket in the
NCAA Tournament. It's all about the players. It truly is.

### [Brionna Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26977)

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Oregon - 77, Maryland - 63  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, like I just told the team in the locker room, I'm not
going to let one game define the season that we had this year, and I'm
extremely proud of this team and everything we've been through. But I'll tell
you this: Oregon is for real. I thought they were sensational tonight. I
thought they punched first. I thought they were fearless, aggressive,
confident, really punished us in terms of any mistakes, any breakdowns that we
would have.  
  
Most proud of our seniors. You know, 125 career wins they leave with, six
conference titles, two Final Fours, and everything that they've meant to
Maryland for us.  
  
Q. Destiny, this was your lowest point total of the season. Can you
describe what they were doing on defense that held you guys?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I just think it was just one of those days. We were clicking
on offense, things were just -- we kind of lost our game, and I think, even
though this was a low-scoring game, we were trying our best, doing anything we
could do. I don't think there's really an answer for it.  
  
Q. Shatori, was there anything they were doing defensively to kind of
throw you off there a little bit off your game?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Their defense was pretty good, making my shots
difficult. I give credit to the defense, their defense.  
  
Q. Shatori, beyond the three-point shots not falling, they seemed to be
able to run you guys off the line for most of the night. What were they able
to do in that respect? What allowed them to do that?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: I think at times we were maybe overthinking it. It
took us a little bit to get in our rhythm, and they took advantage, they
scored. And I mean, they played a great game, both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Bri, the double-teaming through much of the night, was that what
allowed them to frustrate you early on? Seemed like you found your footing
later on, but was that the key for them inside?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think early on, I just wasn't being as patient as I normally
was, but credit to them for -- they came out hard on defense, and I think once
we settled in, we worked out of the double-team better.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys struggled to kind of create any momentum, get
anything going in transition or fast. Why was that? What was Oregon doing to
stop that?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Just like Tori said, they were just playing a good game on
both ends of the floor, and they were just being an overall better team
tonight.  
  
Q. Bri and Shatori, I know it's tough right now, but four years at this
program; what have these four years meant to your life?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think I couldn't imagine playing in any other school, and I'm
glad that I chose Maryland. And just the player I've developed myself into,
and I think credit to the coaches and the players I've gotten a chance to play
with, and it's just been an amazing experience.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, this definitely has been an amazing
experience, an amazing four years. I just want to thank Coach B for everything
she's done for me. My teammates this year, my past teammates, I can't repay
this University for everything they've done for me. They've opened so many
doors. I'm glad I spent my four years here at the University of Maryland.  
  
Q. Destiny, watching you dribble out the last few seconds, obviously not
the way you pictured this game going. What's going through your mind during
that time, and are you going to lock that moment away and use it as motivation
do you think going forward?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: The thing that really sucks that was going through my head at
that last minute is that we sent them out this way. And you know, it sucks
when you have two amazing people and two amazing players, and you know they
deserve so much more. And I mean, we clawed and we fought for them, and I wish
we could have done more, and that was the thing that was going through my head
at those last seconds.  
  
Q. Brenda, the team had such great ball security the last two games,
today 21 turnovers. Was that more indicative of what Oregon was able to do
defensively or some unforced errors on your end?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think it was a blend of both. I think defensively they gave us
a lot of different looks with what they were doing, but obviously it's
uncharacteristic for Dez to have five turnovers. We were high in the guard
area, so definitely a blend of most.  
  
Q. Brenda, the six three-point attempts total is much lower than you
guys typically have. What were they doing schematically that allowed that to
happen, especially in your half-court sets?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, it's tough to get threes up when you turn the ball over 21
times, so that impacts your offense with what you're doing. But we weren't
patient. I mean, we talked about moving the ball and being able to cut and
penetrate to kick. I thought they did a much better job on our dribble
penetration and being physical than we were able to do. Every time they
penetrated on us, they got wide-open kicks and dump-downs against our defense.  
  
Q. In such a low-scoring game, do you think that affected the players as
the game went along and they kept trailing? Did they start pressing a little
bit too much, or what was going on?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, I thought we pressed early. They took the air
out of the ball, which was a really smart move by them. We've seen that in the
past. But we didn't handle it well at all.  
  
You know, then it felt like every time we would get it to within six points,
we would have some sort of breakdown, whether it was off of an O board,
whether it was a defensive stop, and then they would break it back open.  
  
Q. You've had your own spectacular freshman with Destiny this year. Can
you talk for a second about the duo of Hebard and Ionescu and what it was like
playing against those two?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I said this coming in: I thought Oregon -- I likened them
to our 2006 National Championship team and how they played when we started two
freshmen and two sophomores. They're just fearless. They don't know any
better, that they should be nervous about this moment. They're confident.
They're really disciplined, and they make you pay for your mistakes.  
  
But they are beyond their years when you talk about as freshmen in terms of
how they're playing.  
  
Q. A lot of the conversation coming into this bracket was about
Maryland-UConn and Duke-Maryland. The fact we didn't see those match-ups come
to pass, what do you think that said about the depth of talent in the game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, no question, when you talk about the depth. I was thinking
about that. When you look at the teams that are in the Sweet 16, and you look
at the talented freshmen for Oregon, you look at our freshmen with Destiny and
our freshman class. And if you went across the board with the teams that are
out there in the Sweet 16, our game is getting there. It's not all the way
there in terms of top-5 talent, but in terms of the depth, it's starting to
get there. You've got the Cinderella teams with Oregon and Quinnipiac now in
terms of what they're able to do.  
  
Q. Bri has faced double-teams all year and done pretty well. Was it
something about them having someone who's 6'4 ", 6'5", did that kind of throw
her off?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought their length and physicality gave her some
problems. I think in the other positions, we didn't relocate and dive and cut
as move as much also to offset that to be able to help her play through the
double-teams.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what was the game plan coming into tonight, into
today, playing them that didn't work, that made you switch to full-court press
and double-team?  
BRENDA FRESE: I have to pick one thing? You know, disappointed in terms of the
different areas we've been able to excel, obviously, that they took away, our
transition game, obviously rebounding, to be only plus one on the glass.  
  
But for us we really felt like the pick on balls in terms of defensively was
going to be a big area as well as us attacking it off the bounce on the
offensive end. I really thought those actions we didn't handle well. We didn't
defend like we had in the first two rounds, and credit their aggressiveness on
the offensive end.  
  
Q. At three-quarter court you went to relatively early on, and then the
full. Was that just an effort to speed up the game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, I mean, when you watch us play, that's something
we've been very successful with over the course of the season, and yeah, I
knew they were going to try to take possessions away from us to be able to
stop our transition game. You know, when they were working the shot clock,
you're definitely trying to speed them up in terms of their possessions.  
  
Q. Bigger picture, this team seemed like it was built in a lot of ways
to face UConn. We've talked about that in the past, in terms of limited
possessions, rebounding, Destiny at the point. How disappointing is it for you
not only to see the season come to an end but to not get that chance at a team
that you guys played really tough this year and last year?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, it's disappointing, like I said, in terms of our
ending because we haven't played like this for a long time. So for it to rear
its ugly head tonight. And obviously as competitors, yeah, that's why we
continue to put them on our schedule. If you want to be the best, you've got
to play the best, and we definitely wanted to have another opportunity and
felt when we play Maryland basketball that good things happen for us.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk about this year the Big Ten maybe not getting
respected by the Committee, you getting sent here, McGuff's team being a 4
seed. The Pac-12 seems to be doing really well in terms of conferencing. I
know these things are cyclical. But what does the Big Ten conference have to
do to play the seeding game a little bit better, for lack of a better word?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, it starts -- obviously, we had some uncharacteristic, out
of conference, non-conference losses that impacted the Big Ten as a whole, so
it starts there in terms of how we're all trying to be able to schedule. And
then in the tournament, when you talk about having two teams in the Sweet 16
is a great thing, but we've got to be able to get more depth to be able to
advance out further.  
  
Q. Kind of the same thing I asked to Bri and Shatori; what have they
meant to you and this program the last four years, and how much will this team
miss them going forward with such a young team now?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I mean, everything. Like I told them in the locker room,
you know, they -- that's why we're in coaching. When you talk about their four
years and their progression and how they came in as freshmen and where they
were, to be able to see them lead this team to new heights, six freshmen this
year, their leadership, everything that they put on the table.  
  
But I know, as we have all year, Bri and Shatori didn't come in like this. It
was a progression, and like we talked about in the locker room, they're going
to hand the baton off to the next wave of players. They have a perfect example
all season of how to work and how to get here early and stay late and how to
put yourself in a position to be really, really successful.  
  
But I can't say enough in terms of what they embodied on the court, off the
court, and I know they're going to continue on and do great things.  
  
Q. Do you see Shatori as the best wing in this draft and Bri as the best
big in this draft coming up?  
BRENDA FRESE: Gosh, I haven't really studied it. I think the draft is more
about what each team needs. I think obviously the two of them have solidified
themselves in this senior class as just dominant players that can come in and
have a big impact. I'm confident wherever they're selected they're going to
have really successful careers.

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Kari Korver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30452)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

  
_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 86, UCLA - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UCLA.  
  
An opening statement from Coach Close.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Well, you know, credit to UConn. They are so consistent in their
standard of excellence.  
  
I thought we were prepared. I thought we believed in what we were doing. We
just had that segment in the first half for about eight minutes where we sort
of lost our focus and our discipline.  
  
When you lose that, they capitalize. So credit to them. They've set the bar of
excellence, and they've kept it there for a really long time. It's just a
really big commitment to all the little details, a lot of the little inches.  
  
I think I shared it with you last year, this is my least favorite statement to
make because I don't want it to end. I just love these young women. These
guys, I mean, this little kid from L.A. here said, Hey, I want to stay home, I
want to build a program, take a risk, do something special. We fell short, but
that's exactly what she's done.  
  
Kari Korver, she's one of my very first phone calls within my first week of
when I got the job. She believed in our mission, not just on the court. We do
things a little differently at UCLA. She believed in it before it ever bore
fruit on the court.  
  
I told the three seniors that I'm different, I'm better because of them. I
feel like I've received way more than I've ever given. I hate to see it end.
But I couldn't be any more proud of their fight. On the court in the second
half, I thought they fought their guts out, really responded.  
  
I couldn't be any more proud of their fight, but I'm even more proud of the
way they represent UCLA, their character, the way they pour out and invest in
each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, you got off to such a good start. What was it? Did
they do anything different when they went on the run? What was the difference
in the first bit?  
KARI KORVER: I think we didn't rebound particularly well. We had a 10-minute
stretch where we didn't get any rebounds. They had a bunch of transition
threes where we weren't getting matched up very well. They had second-chance
points. They hit threes in transition.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Kari. We also had some mental lapses in the
second quarter. That's when they got on their run.  
  
For a second, we kind of looked defeated. That's when they capitalized on
their opportunities to score in transition and get offensive rebounds. I think
it was just our lack of focus.  
  
Q. You were on the team that played UConn a couple years ago. How do you
think your team has evolved in that time?  
KARI KORVER: We're such a better team than that year. We're a lot closer. Our
chemistry is so much better. We share the ball so much better. We're way more
of a hard-working team.  
  
Yeah, our culture has completely changed since that time.  
  
Q. Kari, your coach said you needed to play your best game of the season
to beat these guys. Do you think this was your best game of the season? Do you
think it came close?  
KARI KORVER: I think there were spurts. But, no, I don't think this was our
best game of the season. Like I said earlier, we didn't rebound particularly
well. We know if we're going to win this game, we have to rebound.  
  
Yeah, we had some good spurts in there.  
  
Q. Jordin, all year you've been dominant. To do it today, 20 points, 11
assists, two turnovers, against this UConn team, do you think you made a
statement about the kind of player you have become?  
JORDIN CANADA: I mean, doesn't matter if I'm playing UConn. I really don't
care who I'm playing, honestly. It's all about what I can do to bring energy
to my teammates, what can I do to make my teammates better, and to grow, as
well.  
  
I mean, obviously I had a good game, but that doesn't even matter because we
lost. Yeah, I mean, that's all I can say. Like, I don't really care who we're
playing. I just focus on myself and my team and what I can do to get better.  
  
Q. Jordin, after the game, Coach Auriemma stopped in line and talked to
you a little bit longer than the rest of the players. Say what he said to
you.  
JORDIN CANADA: I'm assuming he thought I was a senior because he said,
Congrats on a great career, good luck on the next level (smiling).  
  
I just took it and ran with it. I told him, Thank you. Maybe that. That's what
he said to me. I just said, Thank you.  
  
Q. For both players, could you talk about your impressions of Saniya
Chong.  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, I felt like some of her success was my fault. There were
times when I was trying to help in, and I shouldn't have. She got open threes.
One time I was pressuring her, she got a wide-open layup. She did a great job,
and I need to do a better job.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: She played her role. She knows who she is as a player. She
helped her team the best way she could.  
  
Q. Jordin, you talked about what Geno said to you. What did Cori say to
you as you came off the court?  
COACH CLOSE: I don't even know.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: She told me we're going to continue to build the program, that
she was proud of me, proud of our team.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Glad you were listening (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, ladies. Congratulations on a
great season. We'll open it up for questions with Coach Close.  
  
Q. The game before, you were watching that Oregon-Maryland game, you
were giving high fives to the Oregon players as they came off the court. Did
that help give you a little extra not momentum or emphasis, but the fact that
they just pulled off a huge upset, another Pac-12 team, you came off to a
strong start?  
COACH CLOSE: I don't know what it did to us. Our players didn't even know that
was happening. I just am proud of Oregon. I think the way that we have built
the Pac-12 is caring about the Pac-12 more than caring about our own
individual success.  
  
I think as now rising tides lifts all boats. But we've said, Hey, we're going
to raise the level of the Pac-12 together. I was just sincerely excited for
them. We recruit against each other all the time. A lot of the players on
their team, I have recruited. I know their staff very well. One of their
assistant coaches is one of my best friends in the business.  
  
I was sincerely excited for them. I don't know how it affected us. But I want
to give them a lot of credit and tell them I'm really excited for them.  
  
Q. How deflating is it when someone like Saniya Chong has the game she
does? You did a good job against a couple of their starters.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I don't think it's deflating. I think that's what they do.
They don't rely just on one individual player. They're a really solid team. I
mean, you've heard Geno talk about that for years; that when you go to UConn,
you're ready, and it's not about you, right?  
  
Didn't matter to Katie Lou or Collier. Hey, that's my team. When she does
well, we do well.  
  
I don't think it's deflating. I think that's a compliment to them. That didn't
surprise me. You can't do a good job on just two or three players with
Connecticut. You have to do a phenomenal, A-plus job on the team. I've watched
her a lot on film. She did a great job all year long for them.  
  
Didn't surprise me at all. It's never about the individual. It's always about
the team. I think she was just ready when her number was called and her
opportunity came.  
  
Q. You only had six turnovers against UConn, which is the least they've
forced this season. Do you think that's a key for another team to beat UConn?
If not, what do you think is?  
COACH CLOSE: I think, because they're so efficient, you have to control
possessions. So that can happen in different ways. That can either happen in
turnover margin, getting easier shots, or it can happen in rebounding.  
  
In that segment, I think at halftime they had 17 points off of our turnovers
or second-chance points. I think you can't let them have more shots on the
goal than you because they're just too efficient. You have to get more shots
on the goal because there's not another team in the country that's as
efficient as them. You have to get more opportunities.  
  
You have to win the possessions battle. Yes, I think we did okay, but we only
took care of half of it. We took care of the ball, but we needed to take care
of the rebounding and second-chance opportunities. We needed to get some more
of those opportunities. The compliment to them on their rebounding is they
only really crashed two people. The fact they get so many second-shot
opportunities, what a compliment to their perseverance.  
  
Q. Did you think you would match up better with Collier and Williams?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, it's very difficult. When you have to chase on screens and
you got a hedge on really good three-point shooters, that's always going to
leave you a little bit vulnerable for slips and rolls to the basket. They run
so much in the middle of the floor, it makes it hard to rotate and help
because who are you going to come off of. Obviously not any of their players.
They shot the three so well.  
  
You know, I thought we would have to play our best defensive game. I thought
we would have to do it really consistently. I think any time we had a mental
lapse or we were a step late, then, you know, it's the inches.  
  
One of my staff members said to the team in the locker room, You didn't lose
it by the feet, you lost it by the inches. You can't give up any inches.  
  
I thought we matched up okay. I knew we would have to be absolutely locked in.
Those hedges and pick'n rolls either off the stagger screens where you have to
hedge for a second to buy time for the person coming off, or on the screen and
rolls, I knew we would have to be extremely quick on those exchanges. We
weren't.  
  
Q. UConn couldn't literally put you away or dominate you like they have
previous teams in this tournament. What do you think you need to do as far as
for next season to beat a team like a Baylor, Texas, Notre Dame, UConn?  
COACH CLOSE: I think we've already shown we can do that with some of those
other teams.  
  
I will tell you we have a very good, teachable moment right in front of us.
Our second and third games of the year are against Baylor and UConn at home in
November.  
  
We're going to have a chance to see if we've learned anything from this
experience.  
  
I really believe we're knocking at the door of the nation's elite on a
consistent basis, but we haven't thrown the door down. That's what you got to
do. You got to want it so bad that you're not knocking on the door, you're
throwing it open, busting through that next level.  
  
We're close, but it's the difference of this much. I think this game, what we
talked about in the locker room, is about those inches. I mean, you can tell,
I'm becoming such a softy in my old age, they get me to cry at a moment's
notice. I love them. I believe they're invested, not only in competing for a
national championship, but they're investing at growing at every opportunity,
pouring into each other.  
  
I believe you will see the difference right off the bat because we will work
all spring, all summer for those little inches.  
  
You can't have a mental lapse. You can't go into yourself. There were a couple
times we were mad we missed a basket, then in transition defense we weren't
quite quick enough matching up and communicating. Bam, give up a three. That's
a five-point swing. We missed a layup, gave up a three. We will learn from
those inches.  
  
We have to be ready to bust the door down, not be okay knocking on it.  
  
Q. You and Oregon came across country, got set with early afternoon
playing times on top of that. Talk for a second what the impact is on having
to adjust to flying all the way over here, then playing so early in the day
for you guys.  
COACH CLOSE: I think if you're a competitor, you got to be -- obviously didn't
bother Oregon. So I think at that point you got to say, Hey, whenever you
decide to let me toss this ball up, I'm thankful to be here and you will get
my best.  
  
I think it's a lack of mental toughness for us to even acknowledge it. You're
getting a chance to play in the Sweet 16. I don't care if it's 6:00 in the
morning, get yourself ready to play.  
  
Q. Two parts to this. Jordin dismissed it a little bit in terms of who
she was playing. For her to put up 20-11-2, and Monique having 17-16 against
their bigs on the inside, are those markers, in your mind, for what you can
do? Do you see them as reasons to be more confident going into the Baylor-
UConn vortex next November?  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah. But I think they've been proving that all year. I think
that's what you saw from Jordin, That's what my job is, that's what people
expect from me, that's what I have to deliver for my team.  
  
Monique only had six -- I don't know how many rebounds she had at halftime.
Not very many. We really challenged her. For her to deliver on such a high
level in the second half with her rebounding, I thought she really stepped up
and did a really good job. I thought she was really confident from the start.
Really proud of her.  
  
Jordin and Monique, they sort of hold the torch. They know that they have to
show up every single day, that we are playing around them. They may be the
focal point, but you need every single person.  
  
I think just like Samuelson and Collier and those guys were focal points,
obviously Gabby Williams, you saw Chong, you need everybody all the time.  
  
But they are, they're the pillars of sort of what we're building around. With
great privilege, they get the most touches, most plays run for them. They also
get the biggest wrath from me. Much is given, much is required.  
  
They will need to carry that torch at an even higher level this off-season.
Talking to Jordin the other day, I said, You're going to have to be the one
that says, Hey, if you want to be ready -- I didn't say this, I said, If you
want to be ready to be at your best, if you want to be ready for when UConn
comes in our building, you're showing up at this time, doing this work. Anyone
that wants to be ready, you better show up.  
  
That's the kind of leadership that Monique and Jordin give us. We will go as
they go.  
  
Q. Your thoughts from a coaching perspective. How do you create a new
team next season knowing you have some pieces leaving? Sounds like you have an
idea of what you want the team to look like. There might be a different
culture because they're new pieces. How do you balance that?  
COACH CLOSE: I think it's about people and relationships. Every year is a new
puzzle. Every year, it's not a scientific formula, it's an absolute art piece.  
  
I don't think you can create a beautiful art piece without really knowing what
you have. I think it's going to be a lot about caring about individuals,
taking the time to invest if in them as young women, understanding how they
fit together. We're not individual pieces that we're throwing together, we're
really trying to build a complementary puzzle.  
  
I don't think you can know that until you invest in the people. I think that's
what we're doing. The mission of our program is to be an elite basketball
program that teaches, mentors and equips young women for life beyond UCLA.  
  
The reality of that is you have to know them in order to push them to that
end. If we want to be an elite basketball program that's competing for a
national championship every year, you got to do the work with the people. You
got to invest in them sincerely, push them to grow. You can't push people to
gears they don't even know they have if you don't have a relationship of
trust. It will start there.  
  
I have phenomenal assistant coaches and staff. It will be about, Hey, how do
we adjust? We're not going to run always the same stuff and just recycle.
We'll say, Hey, what puts our players in the best possible position? It's all
about investing in relationships and player development.  
  
Q. On Monday night, what do the Ducks have to do?  
COACH CLOSE: I mean, the good news is that March, you have to have great guard
play. Oregon has great guard play. They're going to have to read the screen
and roll really well, handle all those switches. There's not a mismatch. A lot
of times when people switch as much as they do, there's a mismatch you can
exploit. I think that's going to be harder.  
  
They're going to have to shoot the three well. They have to get enough stops
that they can play up-tempo and shoot the three. I think they're going to have
trade some threes and twos.  
  
Their kids, they don't know they're young. I've been watching them all year
grow. They just love playing together. It's going to be a tall challenge, but
I'm excited to watch them compete.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time this weekend.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Thank you all. I appreciate the media and how you guys are
growing our game. Thank you and you guys keep it up.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 86, UCLA - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UConn. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach Auriemma.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, you know, we played a really, really good team.
They are hard to play against. And today was a struggle for us. Even when we
got up 20, I didn't think it was like being up 20 against somebody else, where
you know it's going to go from 20 to 30. I never had that feeling.  
  
It was a grind for our guys. We felt it a little bit in the fourth quarter.  
  
These two here, especially, they were amazing. They just keep playing and
playing and playing, just keep making plays when we need them to make a play.
Between the two of them and Saniya, they were just really, really, really
good.  
  
We got our work cut out for us on Monday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Gabby, can you talk about Saniya's contributions today. Seemed like
her baskets came at big moments, breaking the press when they brought the
press to you.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, at times it seemed like she was the only person we could
really trust with the ball. She was able to penetrate the zone, which is what
you have to do against a team like that. She handled their full-court
pressure. She just played really confidently tonight.  
  
Q. Gabby, Saniya on the defensive end it seemed like was everywhere she
needed to be today. What do you see from her at that end both in a game-by-
game basis and today?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, she stepped up. They're not an easy team to guard. I
mean, the matchups are pretty tough. I was really impressed with how she did
on the glass. She was boxing out guys that were a lot bigger than her. She
tried to stop dribble-penetration as best she can. I think she did a really
good job with that.  
  
Q. Gabby, it's not very often that you get matched up with somebody
that's almost as athletic as you are. Monique Billings has that type of
jumping ability, the length, is very similar in style to you. Can you talk for
a second about what it was like to actually face somebody that can compete
with you athletically, not just basketball-wise.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It was tough. It was a challenge. Usually, you know, I try to
use my athleticism as my advantage. I couldn't really do that tonight. So I
had to find another way to, you know, guard her to match up with her.  
  
I'm glad I was able to see that, you know, going into next game.  
  
Q. Gabby, during the handshakes, many of you guys didn't really have a
smile on your face, yet you won. Why was that?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think we were just kind of exhausted. It was a long final
three minutes. We were happy, you know, once we got back into the locker room.
We didn't end the game as well as we would have liked to. I think the look on
our face is just a result of how the last few minutes kind of dragged for us.  
  
Q. Did you get a chance to see Oregon before you played today? What do
you think of that matchup come Monday?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, we watched the game. We've been watching them the whole
tournament. We've been watching everybody.  
  
So it's the same thing. They're here for a reason. Right now they're a really
good team obviously. They're a lot similar to UCLA in that they have really
good perimeter players. They're really good on the glass.  
  
We're just going to have to go in with kind of a similar game plan, I think.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: You know, like Gabby said, they're a really good team.
There's no bad teams left. Monday is going to be a hard game as well. We're
really going to have to stop them on the three-point line because they have
some really good guards.  
  
Q. Napheesa, you had your customary offensive game today. Three blocked
shots, tie-up during a team moment. Did this feel like a big step forward for
you defensively as well?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think every game I try to get better on defense because
it's one of my weakest points in my game right now. I'm just trying as hard as
I can in the games, trying to do those hustle plays.  
  
Q. Napheesa, Gabby was saying that last three minutes seemed like it
would never end. How did you keep finding a way to make one more play? How did
you find that within yourselves?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Well, the time I was in, because I fouled out at the end
(smiling), we tried to keep them off the three-point line and tried to box
out, which we didn't do as well as we did in the beginning of the game.  
  
Because we were fouling, because we kept reviewing plays, that made it drag
out longer. From the bench, from my standpoint on the bench, it seemed like
that really dragged it on, like I said, just because we weren't really, you
know, stopping them on the perimeter as much.  
  
Q. For both players. It's only three minutes in, but when you're down
9-2, is that a bit of a wake-up call for you?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: We like to say that, you know, to play with us, it's a
marathon, it's not a sprint. They came out hard. They came out aggressive. But
there was 37 minutes left to play.  
  
I think we got a lot of good shots up in those first few minutes, they just
weren't falling. Once they started to fall, once we started to execute better
on defense, the game kind of fell into place.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, teams are going to go on runs. I think the important
thing is to stop the runs as quickly as we can. I think we did that. Then go
out there more and try to score.  
  
Our shots started falling, so I think that's what happened. So I think we
adjusted to it pretty well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll see you tomorrow. We'll take questions
for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, at this point in her career, how nice is it to see Saniya come
out tonight in this spot and play this well?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I was just looking at the stat sheet. That's probably more
points tonight that she scored than in maybe the three previous NCAA
tournaments combined. That's how little she played the last three years.  
  
I said before the conference tournament at Mohegan, there's three guys we need
to play at their level, Saniya is one of them, Crystal is the other one.
Today, the effort and play of Saniya, I thought it was the difference in the
game. You know what you're going to get from those other guys. They did what
they always do, for the most part.  
  
Saniya made some big plays, big shots. She's as good now as she can be. It's
at the perfect time in her career. I mean, she's a senior. Sometimes it never
happens. I'm really thrilled for her that it's happening. She deserves it.
She's hung in there.  
  
Q. Geno, Gabby was saying a little bit earlier, to play with us it's a
marathon, not a sprint. Is it the same thing when you look at Saniya in terms
of her development?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I was really anxious to see how Saniya's game would
transfer over to the college game because when she played in high school, it
was chaotic. They would just run up and down the floor. They would try to
score 100 every night in a high school game.  
  
I went to see her play one night. I don't know, she must have had 45 points or
something. If she could have passed it to herself, she would have, back then.  
  
When she got here, it just was a real struggle for her. It was a real
struggle. A real struggle to play with other good players on the floor, to not
just be able to do whatever you feel like doing; that you have to share the
ball, you have to play some defense, you got to be mentally ready. You know,
it was really a struggle for her.  
  
She would get it going for a week. We would always say, All right, this is it.
Then it would go away. Then she would get it back for another week. All right,
we got it. Then it would go away. It was like that every year.  
  
This year, you know, it's all kind of fallen into place for her. She deserves
it. She's worked hard. She deserves it.  
  
Q. Coach, a similar question that I asked your player. You looked pretty
frustrated, as well. What part of the game were you guys not executing that
was obviously frustrating you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, as I said, you know, when we got up 20, it
wasn't going to be just roll over and get up a bunch. That doesn't happen
generally at this time of the year.  
  
But I didn't think we really took advantage of a lot of things that we could
have taken advantage of, the way they were playing against us. Some of that
was we were tired. We played a lot of minutes. Some of it, we made some
bonehead mistakes, you know.  
  
I don't mind us making physical mistakes, either 'cause we're tired or we're
just not good enough, whatever the case may be. But we got tired mentally, and
that bothered me a little bit. At this time of year, where you are mentally is
going to be the difference maker in the games at this time of the year.  
  
Everybody's good. Everybody's physically capable. So I was kind of
disappointed. And I know they were, too, because they pride themselves on
being able to finish things out.  
  
Plus, you know, the fouls, the waiting. It was just a drag. It was.  
  
Q. Geno, I know in your former job as USA Basketball coach, you said you
hated it when they said they have nothing to lose against the other team.
Oregon has so much youth. What has impressed you about them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They were too young to know any better. They didn't realize
they're supposed to be, like, nervous. They don't realize this is supposed to
be really hard, you know. You're not supposed to just walk into the NCAA
tournament and just start beating teams with three freshmen in the starting
lineup, and a freshman point guard.  
  
I'm not even the least bit surprised at what they're doing. Not even a little
bit. I remember when Kelly got the job. I told everybody in the coaching
profession, I said, They're going to be in the Final Four sooner than anybody
thinks. As I said earlier today, it better not be this soon. But they're going
to be there because he's a hell of a coach. You can recruit pretty good
players to the University of Oregon. He's done that.  
  
They are a really, really good team. If you got really good guards, you can
have a really good team. They've got some pretty good guards.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked about Saniya figuring it out, out on the court. To
what extent do you see the figuring out on the defensive end, what she is for
you as a defensive weapon at this point?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, that was a big struggle for her, playing defense,
because, again, it was something different for her. I think the thing that
kids generally learn when they come to play at UConn is you can't shoot your
way into our lineup. I mean, Lou does. She don't guard anybody. She doesn't
even pretend. At least some people pretend. She don't even know how to
pretend.  
  
But Saniya knew. She came here, we got some pretty good players on the team.
Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Kelly Faris. We got guys that are pretty good.
She knew. If I don't play defense, I'm not going to play.  
  
It was a real struggle for her. It finally dawned on her. She's become a
really good defender, really good. I trust her. Never thought I'd say that,
but I trust her. She has put a lot of time and effort into this. It means a
lot to her right now.  
  
We put her in a situation that I wanted her on the free-throw line at the end
of the game because I trust her. And we put her on Jordin Canada a lot,
because I trust her. That's the best thing that you can get from your coach,
is they trust you.  
  
Q. To talk about Oregon, how you were saying they were young, they don't
know any better, are you also concerned about their play as far as, like, when
Maryland tried to defend them, Maryland threw everything at them, the same
thing how you sometimes win, teams try to catch at you, you throw different
defenses? Oregon seemed like they had an answer for every defense thrown at
them. Is that definitely one of the major concern, going into the game
Monday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, yeah. It always is at this time of the year. This is the
hardest time of the year to be a good defensive team because all the bad
offensive teams are home. They're not playing. So everybody you play at this
time of the year knows what they're doing on offense, for the most part. So
you got to be good defensively at this time of the year.  
  
But, even more important than that, you got to get great possessions and you
got to score over and over and over and over and over again. You go long
stretches without scoring at this time of the year, you're going to lose, or
you're going to put yourself in position to lose.  
  
Sometimes the pressure that teams put on you by scoring, and I think that's
what they did to Maryland today, they would come down and get a bucket, and
Maryland would miss, then they would go down and run 28 seconds off the shot
clock, get another bucket, and Maryland would come down and miss. After a
while, the pressure to have to score gets to kids.  
  
Yeah, I don't know if we can defend them on Monday. I really don't. We'll come
up with something. But this time of the year, I want to try to get to 90 and
take my chances. I don't want to try to win a game 65-60. That's probably not
going to work.  
  
Q. Jordin Canada said after the game you congratulated her for a great
career. Did you know she was a junior?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. We recruited her coming out of high school. She's become
a really, really good player. I don't think she was this good when she was
coming out of high school. She was good, and I thought she would get better.
But she's worked really hard to improve offensively. She makes shots now that
she didn't make back then.  
  
We played them two years ago, and we didn't have to guard her that much. Now,
you see, she controls the entire game for them. She not only gets the ball to
players, but she gets in the lane and she causes problems. You got to kind of
build your defense around how to guard her.  
  
I know, I mean, you watch a majority of their games, and there hasn't been too
many people that have been able to guard her. I just wanted to kind of let her
know that, that her career has been great. For a minute there, I did think she
was a senior 'cause... Did she sit out a year maybe? No. Seems like she's been
there forever. When kids start out as a freshman, they feel like they've been
there forever.  
  
I remembered after the fact that she has another year left. She's just gotten
better and better every year. I was really impressed with her.  
  
Q. This team that you just played was incredibly athletic as well as
long. Strikes me that Oregon doesn't have that pure athleticism at the same
level. Is that your impression? Does that make a difference in how you're
going to be able to run your stuff?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're a completely different kind of team. You know,
Doug Bruno and I have that conversation all the time, about what really
constitutes athletic. People have this vision of what a great athlete is. It
usually involves somebody that looks like LeBron, you know. Somebody that
there isn't anything on the basketball court they physically can't do.  
  
Well, that's one definition of an athlete. Bruno and I talk about the kind of
athletes that have an amazing set of eyes. Like, they see things nobody else
can see. Their feet, they move to spots way before anybody knows they're
supposed to be there. Their minds are really just quicker than everybody
else's. They're one step ahead of everybody else.  
  
So Oregon's got a bunch of those kids. They're athletic in a different way
than UCLA is. Doesn't mean they're better or worse. But they're different. I
don't think a lot of times that gets recognized. We try to do that. We try to
recruit kids that have that, you know, and can run and jump, like Gabby. We
try to do that, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Just talk for a second about the freshmen in this tournament. You
have your own, Sabrina is unbelievable, Maryland has one in Destiny.  
KELLY GRAVES: Agreed. Yeah, no doubt about it. I don't know all of them.
Destiny, of course, very familiar with, because over the last three or four
days, I've seen a lot of film on her. Very, very impressive, plus she's a West
Coast kid, so I had a chance to watch her in high school, as well.  
  
I can mainly just speak to these three. It's incredible what they've done. Not
too many teams are going to go this far relying so much on freshmen, and we
really didn't have much experience with the rest of the team. I think coming
into the season, we had six years of Duck experience, so it's not like we had
a Walker-Kimbrough and a Jones who can help those two freshmen that they have.
We kind of went into this thing sight unseen.  
  
But been very impressed with their professionalism, each and every day, their
coachability, and just their effort. They play really hard.  
  
Q. Kelly, how has the team responded the last couple days to all the
travel and finals being done and really focused in on Maryland and what they
do?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they've handled it, I think, a lot better than their
coach. I've got a cold. And that's a lot of travel. But they're 18- to
21-year-olds, and I think they've handled it well. Two cross-country trips in
a matter of five or six days, I think, would take its toll on anybody. Add to
that two days of finals in between, and it's understandable that they might be
tired. But we're certainly not going to use that as an excuse by any means,
and I think that come tomorrow at tip-off, we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. Was there a moment in the season where you saw the freshmen coming
together or a game where you kind of said, okay, they're starting to get this,
and this could be a special group?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think early on, we had a game against Michigan State
where we just kind of put it all together, won by 30-something points. And in
that game I think the freshmen really shined. But that was early, so we didn't
really at that time even know what we had.  
  
I thought it kind of started to come together when Sabrina came back from an
injury. She missed about a month. We lost four games during that stretch, and
we made kind of a miracle comeback at Cal. They were ranked at the time. Ruthy
made a tremendous defensive play that led to a basket, which gave us a chance
then to have Sabrina's basket at the end. Mallory played really well that
weekend.  
  
So I think that was kind of the weekend that we figured, hey, you know, we can
do this. I know we're young, but we can play, and I think from then on, we
actually played really, really well the rest of Pac-12 play. I would say maybe
the Cal game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about coming out of the Pac-12 Conference
and what you think that has done for your young team coming into the NCAA
Tournament?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they had to grow up fast because it's such a competitive
league, as is evident by five teams in the Sweet 16. You know, we were joking,
I don't think there's a -- in fact, I know there's not a team in the
tournament that has played more teams in the 1 and 2 seed lines. We've played
seven games against teams on those seed lines, and so, you know, we've kind of
seen a little bit of everything. We've seen teams in our conference that have
athleticism, others that have size, others that have quickness, some really
offensive-oriented teams, and some great defensive teams, so we've seen a
little bit of everything when you run that gauntlet. So they had to grow up
fast.  
  
You know, and I think playing in the Pac-12 has, I think, prepared us for this
moment, no doubt.  
  
Q. You were saying kind of in Eugene how Maryland has kind of played
with a little bit of a chip on their shoulder. Have you seen that on film over
the last couple games you've broken down? Could you describe how that chip has
come to fruition?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, chip or no chip, they're really good. Whatever they need
to be motivated, I think only adds to what they already have. I mean, they are
a great team. You know, I'm -- not baffled, but you wonder why they were a 3
seed with their résumé. It's incredible, who they've played, who they've
beaten. The only two teams they lost to are still playing, one of whom is
considered the best team in the country.  
  
They're just really good, and the more you watch them, the more you realize
that we've got our work cut out for us. They really don't have many holes.
Certainly offensively they have no holes. We've still got to play the game.
We're going to find them. We're going to do what we can to counteract where
they're good, and so we're up and ready for the challenge, no doubt.  
  
Q. I know you left Gonzaga because you wanted to be at the football
school that Oregon has, but it seems like you and the men's program have
turned it into a basketball school the way you're both advancing in the NCAA
Tournament. Any thoughts on how this might be a basketball school as opposed
to the football school it's been for so many years?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I might make people angry if I say it's a basketball
school because football is a big deal there. It's incredible the success that
our men have had. They're great -- I love the staff. They're so open to
helping my staff and us and working with us. The young men they have on their
team are incredible, good friends with our team. I think there's really good
synergy between the two programs, and you know, we've had some of our biggest
thrills on this trip. Actually one of our biggest thrills -- okay, our two
games were better, but the third-best part of the last trip was we all got a
chance to go to a sports bar together, have dinner and watch our men win. So
pretty neat.  
  
And then last night, of course, we sat around and watched that, too. We all
cheer for each other. I think it just goes to show you the commitment that
Oregon has to athletics. I mean, it's incredible. You look up and down, and I
would say we're a track-and-field school if you want to know the truth, cross
country. I mean, there is not a sport that we don't excel at, and I think as a
student-athlete, it's pretty neat that they get to rub shoulders with some of
the elite athletes in the country.  
  
Q. It seems like a lot of the things that you guys do well are things
that Maryland does well. Ruthy and Bri have similar offensive games, Sabrina
matches up pretty well with Destiny, and in terms of the three-point shooting
of Lexi and Shatori, do you see it that way? Do you see the two as parallel
teams, and if so, do you think that helps you or hurts you going into
tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I don't know if it'll help or hurt. We'll find that out
soon enough. Yeah, I guess we do mirror ourselves. We just don't play at the
fast pace they do. We don't push it as much as they do in transition. I think
we're capable, but I think early in the year we tried to do that, and we had
basketballs going off walls and into our poor fans' faces and hands. We just
weren't able to play at that pace, so we've kind of dialed it back a little
bit, become a little bit more half-court oriented. But I think potentially,
yeah, this is a team that can get out and go.  
  
I just think what's important in this game, we've got to somehow limit the
number of possessions. If we play this game in the 90s tomorrow, we're
probably in trouble. If we can keep it between 75 and 80, okay, now, that's a
different story. But yeah, I guess when you look at it that way, we do mirror
each other in a lot of different ways. We're just not as experienced.  
  
Jones, watching her on film, is very impressive. I'm not sure we've seen a
better post player all year. It's incredible. Her positioning, her patience,
balance, strength. I mean, she's the whole package in there. I'm assuming
she's going to have a heck of a pro career.  
  
Q. When you're game planning against a team like Maryland that has such
strong senior leadership, is there anything you can do to counteract that
because they've see it all, been to Final Fours. Is there anything you can do
to counteract that experience?  
KELLY GRAVES: Not really. This moment obviously is not going to be too big.
I'm hoping it's not too big for these guys. I'm hoping it won't be because
they don't know any better. They've only been to one NCAA and they've won two
games. They've never lost. But yeah, there's no substitute for experience, and
to have two great leaders as well as great players as those two are, I think,
can only be a benefit for them, plus they have a championship coach. You know,
she's got that pedigree.  
  
So they have a lot going for them in that experience.  
  
Q. Just to jump off what you said in terms of pace, you guys did slow it
down significantly, and it seemed to happen after you had the 0-3 start in
Pac-12 play. Was that the key to finding it, and if not, what other factors
did play a part in going from that team to the team you are now?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think getting Sabrina back helped, just gave us another
ball handler. We don't have a ton of play makers, so we have to do it kind of
the old-fashioned way, through ball screens, through patience, through ball
movement, through spacing, those kind of things, and I think it was just a
natural progression. I think when you have and rely on so many young kids like
we do, they always play faster than they should. I'm sure Brionna did not play
the way she's playing now as a freshman. You try to do things too fast. And I
encouraged Ruthy to watch her and learn from how she's playing the game
because I think Ruthy is going to have that same kind of ability early on.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
KELLY GRAVES: No. I think we're just slowing things down, just -- as the
natural evolution of a basketball team, with young kids. You just play faster
early, and they're just getting -- we're getting better. I say "they." We are
just getting better offensively.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on tomorrow, but it came out yesterday that you
might have a team in the 3-on-3 tournament for USA Basketball with some of
your freshmen. I know you're a big USA Basketball guy. How neat is that that
you could have three Ducks playing together for this tournament, and are you
going to coach them as the Duck team for the USA Basketball Tournament?  
KELLY GRAVES: I am not going to coach the team. I'm probably going to go on a
little vacation with my family for the weekend because I don't see them as
often as I'd like this time of year. No, they'll be in good hands. Sabrina can
coach them. She's fine. It's just a great opportunity, and I don't know where
we're headed with 3-on-3. My guess is that the NCAA has added sand volleyball.
Maybe there's a point here in the near future where we add 3-on-3 basketball
as a sport. And I think we're headed that way in the Olympics, as well. I just
think it's a great opportunity. There's, I think, six or seven Pac-12 schools
that are sending teams there. I think we're the only conference that maybe USA
Basketball reached out to carte blanche, saying anybody that wants to send a
team. So hey, sign me up. Any chance they have to play more basketball and
compete, I think the better.  
  
Q. Seems like Oti has had a big role for you guys in the tournament.
What kind of element does she give you guys off the bench that just kind of
helps to give you guys a little bit of a punch?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, she's versatile. Oti is just a versatile player, can guard
guards, she can guard big kids. She's excellent on the offensive boards. She's
given us a little different game at the high post, so when we go with her at
the high post instead of Mallory, Mallory has got nice mid-range jump shot,
and Oti can attack the basket a little bit more from there, so it just gives
us a different look, just energy. She's a fun-loving kid and she kind of keeps
the team loose and works her butt off. There are a lot of different areas
she's helping us.  
  
Q. With UConn buying up all the tickets for this event, if you guys are
able to keep it close against Maryland later, are you kind of hoping the crowd
will root for the 10 seed?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, I know our fan base is really ticked off because
they couldn't make the trip cross-country. I'm just kidding. Yeah, I don't
know. I think generally we cheer for underdogs, and my guess is we're
considered quite an underdog. You know, if that comes to fruition, maybe that
happens. I don't know. And I don't think -- I think our team has shown with
wins in some big places this year on the road, I don't think the crowd matters
that much to them. Yeah, I don't think they really play to that or focus on
it. But we could sure use the support. So if the UConn fans do want to cheer
for green and yellow, that's fine, I'll take it.  
  
Q. Defensively was the Duke game one of your better games, and is it
going to take that level of performance and maybe even above that to beat
Maryland?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, yeah. We, I thought, played here. We're going to need to
play there defensively in this next game. Again, we talk about players
evolving, a young team evolving, and defense is usually the thing that takes
the longest. That's a program, that's a culture that you have to build to play
great team defense, and we're just starting to get it a little better. We're
playing to a scout better. Our fundamentals are better. The team concept, the
understanding of how to play within the team defensively is getting better.
Just the natural evolution of things.  
  
As good as we were there, though, we've got to be a lot better. This is a --
well, as a coach it's going to be fun to watch. These are two of the best
offensive teams in the country that we have a chance to watch this weekend in
UConn and Maryland. So I'll be taking some notes, as well.  
  
Q. Specific to your offensive attack and the role that Lexi has played,
both the big shots she's had, but simply the fact that you talk about limited
possessions and efficiency, how effective she's been from three-point range
and how important that has been.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah. Well, she's a great shooter, no doubt about it, but she
never takes a bad shot, you know. And she's got some kids around her that --
she's got a good inside attack that teams have to play for, so she's the
beneficiary of maybe some extra help or some double-teams inside. We're a good
passing team. We like to make the extra pass, and so that helps somebody like
her.  
  
But she's actually become better at creating her own shots. She can actually
now penetrate a little bit, so it keeps them a little more honest. So she's
getting better in her own game. No, I think -- even when teams try to take her
out, it spreads the floor a lot more for the other four to make things happen.
So she's just -- just having her out there is always a benefit, whether she's
making them or not, they have to play her for the shot.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how well do you know their point guard Destiny, and what
challenges do their guards present you guys?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I played with Destiny Slocum and Kaila Charles, their post
player, as well. We played together at the McDonald's game, and she's a great
point guard. But I don't think it'll cause us too much trouble. We play
against great guards in the Pac-12, and I think we're going to be ready
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For all three of you, just talk about the run you guys have been on.
Coach said you're playing with house money and you don't know any better, just
keep on playing basketball. What's it been like to play in your first NCAA
Tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, we're the underdogs. I think we've been that
all year, especially having six freshmen on the team, and we're playing with
nothing to lose. I mean, I think we've been saying that. Our coach has been
saying that all year, and a team with nothing to lose is a team that's going
to be tough to beat.  
  
So I think we come out, we play every game like it's going to be our last,
because we never do know when it's going to be our last game of the season,
and that's definitely something that I tell the team all the time. You've got
to do everything the best you can because you never know when the ball is
going to stop bouncing. So we come in every day, we play hard, and I think
we're peaking at the right time, so we're going to come out tomorrow and we're
going to give it everything we have and see where that takes us.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's been an amazing experience. Like Sabrina said, there's
nothing to lose, so it's really fun to just go out and give your all and know
at the end of the day when you give your all, you can't be disappointed in
that.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: I have to agree with both of what they said. We have to give
it our all and we are the underdogs. But like Sabrina said, the underdogs are
the ones that nobody expects to win. So we're the team that everybody fears a
little bit more.  
  
Q. Ladies, a lot has been made of the six freshmen, the youth of your
team, but if you had to describe Oregon women's basketball, what would you use
to describe how your team has played this season?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I know we have a lot of freshmen, but I think it's just -- we
play with a lot of heart. We play for each other, and that's definitely what's
got us this far.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think probably one word that would describe us is, like,
relationships. I think, especially having six freshmen, we came in, we had to
get to know each other quickly and get to know the upperclassmen quickly, and
our coaches, you know, we had to get to know them through our recruiting
process. So I think definitely the relationship aspect of this team outside of
basketball has helped us mold together on the court and play for someone other
than ourselves.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: They both covered that one.  
  
Q. Ruthy, I'm wondering, Kelly Graves is saying that he's been telling
you to look at Bri Jones a little bit and just kind of see as a player you
might be able to play at her level maybe when you become an upperclassman.
What is it like seeing her on film and is that kind of one of your goals to
play at that level?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's definitely a great basketball player. Her composure
and her ability to finish around the rim is really motivating, and I'm really
excited to play against her tomorrow.  
  
Q. People like us make a big deal about the cross-country travel and the
early start time tomorrow, but as Coach said, you're 18- to 21-year-old kids,
it makes no difference, you just play basketball. Does it matter you're
playing early and does it matter you've flown back and forth twice in a
week?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Well, I mean, we did fly back home to Eugene for two days.
But personally I don't think I got used to the -- back to the West Coast time
because I was already adjusted to the East Coast time. Travel shouldn't really
be a factor in the way that we play. I know it is difficult, but I think we'll
be fine tomorrow morning getting up early and being able to play.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, like Mallory, I'm not really used to the West Coast time
again, so I think we'll be ready to play.  
  
Q. Sabrina, it seems like you have relished taking the big shot. You've
had a number of them, and I'm wondering how long that's been the case for you
and whether you see the NCAA Tournament as an opportunity to do that once
again in a big spot?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I've never really taken game-winning shots prior to my
freshman year coming in here at Oregon. But I think just the competitiveness
in me always wants the ball in my hands at that crunch time, and I think my
teammates believe in me to make game-winning shots. I think that's what it is,
because I've never really practiced game-winning shots prior to this. I mean,
I dream about it all the time and whatnot, yeah.  
  
Q. As freshmen, was there a moment that you can point to where you guys
felt like you were starting to come together and could be part of something
special?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I always knew we were going to be something special, just with
the recruiting class and everything. I think the four games in Spain really
helped us out, and we kind of clicked from the start, and definitely just the
preseason really helped us mesh together, and it went from there.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I agree with Ruthy. I think that Spain trip really
helped us as a young team. We had the 10 practices earlier than most people
that weren't able to go on a trip. So I think that definitely helped us form
relationships and start -- and, of course, the first few practices of the
season weren't great for us. We weren't used to each other. It was pretty much
a brand-new team. But Coach always told us to stick together and continue
doing what we've been doing, so it pays off now. We know each other. We know
each other really well on and off the court, so I think that helps us this
late into March.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Agree with both of them. Just the Spain trip, I think that
really was the building block in what made -- it's going to make this team so
great. That was just a good experience overall, and we've just all come closer
as a team.  
  
Q. For all three of you, obviously it's the first time that Oregon has
been to the Sweet 16. How are you sort of balancing having fun during this
experience and sort of taking that all in, but also realizing that you have a
goal after this weekend to get to the Final Four?  
SABRINA IONESCU: You know, I think we're just enjoying the moment and living
in the moment. This is never going to come -- we're never going to be able to
relive this moment again as freshmen. But I definitely think it gives us a
taste for the next years, the following years. We're excited for next year and
the year after that, especially as a young team. But we definitely want to
continue just coming out and giving it everything we have on the court and
just enjoying the experience.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's just really exciting. I think we're just going to keep
playing hard and see how far that takes us, and whatever happens, I think
we're going to be really proud of ourselves, and I think we should be.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: The experience is amazing overall. It's just an honor to just
make it this far in the Sweet 16, but I know we all have been working super
hard to get here. Just all the hard work we've been putting in has paid off.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, I know you're focused on tomorrow, but it came out
yesterday that you guys are potentially playing in the USA Basketball 3-on-3
tournament in a couple of weeks. Coach said Sabrina, you'd be coaching the
team. Talk about that, playing 3-on-3 is different than playing 5-on-5 and how
you guys got involved in this and what you're looking forward to.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I already was joking around that we're going to start
having plays and play calls, whatever, yesterday. But we both -- we've both
done USA and I think we got a taste of that. But I think we're definitely just
focusing on tomorrow and where we're at now, but I definitely think it's going
to be a great experience for us, and we practice 3-on-3, 4-on-4, 2-on-2 every
day in practice here at Oregon, so I think we're kind of used to playing not
5-on-5. But I think we're excited just for the opportunity to represent our
country in that.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, I think we're really excited, and it's going to be really
fun.  
  
Q. Ruthy, just in terms of the comparison to Bri Jones, you guys do a
lot of the same things, not just scoring around the basket, but efficient, not
a lot of wasted movement. Do you see a lot of your game in her, and are there
any other people that you have patterned your game after right around the
post?  
RUTHY HEBARD: She's definitely a great player, and the way she finishes is
something I'd like to continue to do as well. She's really composed and a
strong player. We watched film on her, and her ability to move people is
something I definitely want to get better on, and her offensive rebounding is
great. So I'm definitely going to try to watch her and try to be a little more
like her in those areas.  
  
Q. He talked about starting out and the building blocks. In terms of
getting solidified, how much has the Pac-12 schedule helped you because, by
comparison, you guys' non-conference schedule may be a little bit higher.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Definitely playing against really top teams like Washington,
UCLA, I think, has helped us get here, too, and I think helped us just prepare
for Temple and Duke as well, just because we got to play against top teams
every day, I think.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, going off that, there's no days off, really. There's no
games off in the Pac-12. There's no night where it's going to be easy to get a
win. I mean, every win is a hard-fought win. So I think that definitely helps
us coming in late into March. We're going to come play against top teams in
the country, and we pretty much do that every night in the Pac-12 back at
home. So I think having such a tough schedule in the conference is going to
help us now.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Adding off of that, just the Pac-12 really prepares you for
March and the NCAA Tournament. Like they both said, you never really take a
night off, so it just prepares you really well.  
  
Q. I know you guys were only home for a couple days and exams were
thrown in there, but I'm guessing there's a buzz around the campus with what
you and the men have done in March. It's a football school, but becoming a
basketball school pretty quickly with the success you guys have had. What's it
been like around campus and watching the men play last night?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Just around campus, we have this academic center, and
everybody in there talks about how well both the men and women have been
playing, and it's really nice to see that the campus has been engaged in
watching the games and just seeing how well basketball has been doing at
Oregon.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, going off of that, the buzz around campus has been
great. We always get told congratulations wherever we're going. I think that's
something great to see, that people are paying attention and seeing how much
growth we've been doing. And the men's team, they've been great to us as well.
We get tweets after every game, congratulations, and that kind of goes both
ways. We congratulate them as well. We see them every day in the training room
and on the court, so I think it's great to see that relationship between men's
basketball and women's basketball, and then, of course, the rest of the
University.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, like they said, it's been great. It's really helpful for
us to get congratulations from students and teachers, so it's really nice.  
  
Q. For both of you, Ruthy and Sabrina, between the numbers, Ruthy, that
you've been putting up in March, and Sabrina, the numbers you're putting up,
but also the poise you showed the other night when you were bumped during the
Duke game, I'm curious whether you think that it's overstated how much veteran
leadership matters compared to having teams where the freshmen are doing so
much of the heavy lifting. Obviously your opponent, too, with Destiny, who
runs the team, that some of you have been friends with. Do you think that's
overstated or do you think there's an advantage perhaps in having youth on
your side?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I think it's highlighted all year that we were freshmen, but
Coach Graves always says, we're not freshmen anymore. After 10 games, 15 games
in, we're just ballplayers. And I think focusing on that and knowing what we
can do to help the team out is just what I try to focus on and not think about
youth as much.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, the leadership definitely helps because, you
know, we've never experienced anything like this just coming into freshman
year. I know we were all kind of nervous, where do we go to classes, where do
we -- when is practice, how early do we have to get to practice? So definitely
that side of basketball and school has definitely helped us having some
upperclassmen.  
  
But I think once the ball starts bouncing and once it's up in the air on that
tipped ball, it's just basketball, regardless of if you're a senior or you're
a freshman. No one is taking it easy on you because you are a freshman, and
we're coming at everyone just as they're basketball players, we don't care
what grade they're in. But I definitely think the experience helps. We have no
idea what to expect coming into March. We had no idea. Definitely Pac-12, we
didn't know it was going to be that difficult playing against all those teams
every single night that we played.  
  
But I think that's just going to help us next year. I think we're going to be
well-prepared for the Pac-12 and definitely late into March.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Obviously Destiny has had a tremendous freshman year and Sabrina for
Oregon has had a tremendous freshman year. Talk about the guard play and how
these freshman point guards have been incredible across the landscape.  
BRENDA FRESE: Right. I mean, I think for both of them, they're just fearless.
They're confident. You know, the biggest compliment I can give them both is
that they don't play like freshmen. When you talk about Destiny, you can
continue to see what makes her so special. She is beyond her years. When you
talk about -- the point guard position is just like being the quarterback in
terms of what it requires, and for both of them to slide into their team for
Destiny, two seniors on our rosters, and to come in seamlessly, has been
remarkable to watch.  
  
Q. Curious when you've looked at video and getting ready for this team
tomorrow, it seems like there's sort of an answer to the things that you guys
do best on a personnel basis. For Bree, there's Ruthy and for Shatori, there's
Lexi and for Destiny, there's Sabrina. Is that what you've seen and what else
has stood out for you as you get ready for Oregon tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I think both teams you can obviously see have balanced
scoring across the board, and when you talk about the inside-outside play for
both teams, you can see where the production is spread in terms of the two
teams.  
  
Obviously any time you get to a Sweet 16, that's the great teams that are left
in the bracket, so both teams are going to battle it out for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Since Oregon beat Temple, their attitude has kind of been loose and
they're kind of playing with house money given their youth and this is their
first experience in the tournament together. Does that make them a dangerous
team with the talent they have that's so young?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I liken them to our 2006 National Championship team when
we started two freshmen, two sophomores, and a junior. That team just played
-- they had nothing to lose. They didn't understand the expectations and what
was at stake, advancing each round. So you can, you can see that there's no
pressure on their shoulders, that they're excited to be here, and they're
playing with -- they're peaking at the right time. They're playing with a lot
of confidence.  
  
Q. If you could talk to us about how you go through the games and how
that changes from the beginning of the season and now being in the tournament,
what's your preparation? What are things that you do to get yourself ready for
the team?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, it's both. I mean, throughout the season, I constantly
go back and watch. Every time we play a game, I go back to evaluate our own
team to be able to see where our strengths and where our weaknesses are. I
just continue -- even now in March, you continue to keep learning about your
own team, who's your best inbounder, who's your best late-game finisher, who
do you want at the free-throw line. That's a constant, wherever we're going.  
  
And then you have the preparation on the other side to get ready for your
opponent, and that requires a lot of film across the board between our staff.
I take in as many games as I can until I feel like I've mastered the other
team, so to speak, in terms of what kind of philosophy they have and how they
want to play and what we can take away.  
  
Q. Can you address what Ashlyn Barrett has meant to this team, what she
has taught your players, and then what you plan to do? Is she coming this
weekend, and if not, how do you plan to let her know what's happening?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, for Ashlyn and her family, it was more than we
could ever have envisioned. The initial was obviously wanting her to be a part
of our team and being able to give her an experience back that I know having
gone through, having my own son, when he was sick, and the hospital visits and
kind of what that relief meant.  
  
For our team, they're inspired every day by her. They know how sick of a
little girl she is and everything that she's been through. We've watched her
going from being a mobile child, where she was walking and running to now
being in a wheelchair, and just more and more experiences, times, where she's
having to go to the hospital and to the ER room. Ashlyn had a benefit last
night back in Maryland. Obviously we couldn't attend. They're trying to get
her to some new doctors up in Boston, which is going to require a lot for
their family to be able to do. We were able to Skype in, FaceTime last night,
which was a big deal.  
  
I think the travel would be really tough for Ashlyn to be able to be a part of
this. For us, it's text messages and phone calls back to her mom and pictures
back and forth is just how we can stay connected.  
  
Q. The first two rounds you got to play at home, amazing environments.
What's the challenge been like, if there has been one, to get the team ready
to play on the road so far away from home and a game of this magnitude?  
BRENDA FRESE: It's been easy, to be quite honest. It's no different than the
travel that takes place during your non-conference and regular season, and so
for us, four, four and a half hours, to be able to get up here. You're playing
in the Sweet 16, so you know, it's not hard to motivate your team in terms of
where we're at. Our kids are on spring break, so they're not missing any
school time. They're in a great place. They're ready to play.  
  
Q. I'm curious how you came to the decision as to where and who sits in
what order on your bench in a given game, whether that's static from game to
game, how those choices came about, and if there are any particular reasons
why you came to that decision.  
BRENDA FRESE: That's an unusual question, you're right. It varies from year to
year with what you're doing. I know early I emulated my mentor Bill Fennelly
when I came into coaching, and we sat in the middle of the bench as coaches
and players were to our right and to our left. It's evolved over the years for
whatever reason. We talk about it leading up to a season where we feel like
different staff members need to be placed within the bench. That starts at the
beginning of the season.  
  
So where the players go, I don't know how they choose their seats, but you
know, our staff is consistent in terms of -- it's like going into your
classroom each and every day. You have your same seats, and that stays
consistent for us throughout the season.  
  
Q. Has there been a moment where that's come into play, where it's been
significant to have a coach nearby at a particular time that you can think of
offhand? In other words, has the order made an impact?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I definitely utilize my coaches where I think their
strengths fall. There's different interactions. We ask our players to come up
towards the bench with our guard and post coaches and different ones that just
from meaningful conversations that are going to take place.  
  
Q. Just wondering, Lexi Bando in Oregon, she's had some really big
three-point shooting games recently and some that haven't been as spectacular.
What have you seen in those games where she is having good shooting successes
from beyond the arc?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, we've told our team as we've watched film, timely
threes. I feel like her shots right now in the tournament are timely threes,
and you've got to be able to find her. She is shooting the ball extremely
well, and you have to be there on the catch.  
  
Q. There have been a few issues about the ticketing here, and you've
talked about how disappointing it is that some Maryland fans can't make it up
here. Do you think there should be some changes in terms of holding some
tickets until people know where people are going, or how do you address this
in the future? Obviously you can't do anything about this tournament, but in
the future.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, absolutely. You know, I mean, you're talking about holding
a block, right, for fans, whether that's 500, 200. I mean, the ability, then,
after if you don't use that block, I'm sure the UConn fans would go back and
purchase them. But when teams work so hard all season to only have 100 tickets
available is disappointing. It's disappointing for our fans that can drive it,
when you talk about a region that you're supposed to be put geographically
placed for your fans, to be able to get there that now are priced out or the
tickets are sold out. Definitely. I hope the article brings awareness to the
NCAA in terms of, you know, allowing some sort of fairness and equity across
the board.  
  
Q. How do the seniors in your program help bring along the freshmen and
get them ready for games like this?  
BRENDA FRESE: I can't say enough for our seniors, Shatori and Bri, what
they've done all season long, and it started from our first practice in the
summer to our foreign trip to Italy. They've embraced them. They have just
layered them in confidence. They've believed in them. They've really allowed
them to really kind of mingle -- mix the team to really make them really
tight. So that leadership is critical when you talk about now, every round you
advance, you see it gets closer and closer, the confidence level that's
required per round. The two of them have done a remarkable job with their
leadership.  
  
Q. I know you haven't played Kelly many times as a coach as Oregon. Talk
about what he's brought to that program at Oregon before his time at
Gonzaga.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I've never coached against Kelly, but have always -- from
afar, the success that he had at Gonzaga and now being really able to be
scout-specific with his team and his program, he's a hell of a coach. I mean,
he is tremendous. When you talk about his game planning, his prepping, to take
three freshmen in the starting lineup and take the team -- he's ahead of where
they should be, the success that they've had coming into the Sweet 16. So
really, really impressed with what him and his staff have done.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Chloe Pavlech and what she meant to the
program and how weird it is to know that she's on the other sideline
potentially on Monday night?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, well, you know, we got to have that experience when Chloe
came down to College Park. So now to be back again, you know, she's meant
everything to our program, so I'm not surprised, obviously, to see her now get
a chance in coaching. She has tremendous energy. She could do anything, TV,
coaching. She has a personality bigger than life. You know, the kids adore
her. She brought everything to the table in her four years at Maryland.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about her path
when she was at Maryland. You know, she really wanted to go one of two ways,
whether it's coaching or into TV, and so, I mean, as a journalism major, she
really looked at both parts, and as a point guard you're that floor general,
that leader. Like I said, Chloe has a bright path in any direction of life
that she wants to go. Whoever meets her, you can see her charisma, and she's
going to be very, very successful in life.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. I'm curious how you come to the
decision about which players sit where on the bench, what that process is
like, how it happens. Is there an order? Is there any superstition that goes
into it? How does that come to pass for each of you guys?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: I'm not particularly sure about the bench sitting,
but I know every time we come off the bench, you tap everyone's hands up, and
everyone stands up and slides down and you sit by Coach Terry Nooner.  
  
Q. Destiny, I was just curious how well you know Sabrina from McDonald's
All-American or different tournaments and just your scouting report on
Oregon?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with her, both from the West Coast.
I played her AAU team a few times. She was on my team for McDonald's. I mean,
we're friends, so I know her in that way. Scouting report on Oregon, led by
their freshmen, really, really good shooting team, so I think that's something
we've just got to look out for.  
  
Q. I'm just curious how familiar you were with Oregon, if you ever were
a part of their recruiting for them being on the West Coast.  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, I took an unofficial visit there, so I know the coaching
staff pretty well and some of the recruits, so in that way I'm pretty
familiar.  
  
Q. For the seniors, when you guys were freshmen, what did the seniors do
for you to incorporate you into the program and then how have you don that for
the younger?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think early on when we first got to campus, they took us
under their wing and showed us everything about what Maryland basketball is
about, in practice, outside of practice. And I think we tried to do the same
thing for the freshmen coming in this year and just tried to show them what
Maryland is all about.  
  
Q. For all three of you, Maryland fans have been having problems getting
tickets to this event, obviously, because UConn fans bought them up a long
time ago. Can you guys address playing -- your fans not being able to get up
here, and have any of your friends or family had trouble getting tickets and
not being able to make it here?  
BRIONNA JONES: Yeah, we were aware of the ticket situation, but I feel like
we've been -- we played in hostile environments before when we played the Big
Ten championship, that was in Indianapolis against Purdue. That was close to
their home, and they had a lot of fans there. We played in a hostile
environment against Louisville. It's not nothing that we've never seen before,
so I think we'll be ready for it.  
  
Q. Bri, Oregon obviously has some length in the front court. What are
your thoughts on matching up with them, and is it kind of a personal challenge
to you when other teams have players that can maybe try to match you in the
post?  
BRIONNA JONES: I enjoy playing against post players, bigger post players. I
was really excited for this match-up, just getting to be able to match up with
people more my size. I'm just really looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Destiny, just curious what the week has been in terms of response
from people who may have seen the big shot; it seemed to go viral, and whether
that's sort of the attention-getting moment that you've talked about, trying
to leave your mark on the season, on your career at Maryland, whether you felt
like that was sort of laying down a marker?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I wouldn't think of it as like a marker, I think of it just
kind of -- it was just a lucky shot that went in. It was just kind of a
motivation for our team in that game. It's just kind of something -- social
media was blowing up, and I have like more important goals than people talking
about that shot. So now I'm taking a break with social media and trying to
focus on what's important to our team and things we've been working on since
June.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
DESTINY SLOCUM: It's for like two weeks.  
  
Q. Brionna, a follow-up on their bigs, they have Ruthy, obviously down
low is a very good player and then Mallory shoots that mid-range jump shot.
How unique is that challenge to have two bigs with different types of
offensive games?  
BRIONNA JONES: It's definitely a unique situation, but I think we've played
different post players in our conference, in our non-conference that are
similar. They have post players that can shoot the jumper or post players in
the low post. I think I'm definitely prepared for that match-up.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask each of you if you could reflect on times when,
either individually or as a team, you've been having some challenges and what
your coaching staff has done to get you through in the middle of a game in
order to be where you are right now.  
BRIONNA JONES: I think for some games, like when we start out slow, for one,
our coach is definitely really good at motivating us, and tells us to pick it
up and just locking back into that moment, and you can't get it back all in
one possession, just taking it one possession at a time to get back to our
normal strategies.  
  
Q. Shatori, can you address what Ashlyn Barrett has meant to this team
and how you plan to keep in touch with her through this weekend?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, she means a lot to our team. We like to think
of each other as sisters. This whole organization is just like a big family,
and we look at Ashlyn like she's our little sister because she is our little
sister. She sat and signed our national letter of intent just like all of us
did, so she's just as important to the team as we are. And I don't think she
realizes how much she means to our team, just coming in smiling every day,
when we know she's facing challenges every single day. And that means the
world to us because if she can do that, we can do what we do and push through
anything. And yeah, we Skyped with her yesterday. She had an event. So we're
just going to try to just keep in touch and play for her. (I think the very
first answer was Shatori).  
  
Q. Bri and Shatori, can you talk about playing with each other the last
couple years and reflect on what your time at Maryland has been like?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think coming in, we were just two freshmen, like, trying to
just get a grasp on what Maryland was about. And I think through our years,
we've grown, and I know Shatori is a really competitive person, and I think
she's brought out that in our entire team, and I think she pushes us to be
better every day, and I think just having her for the last four years, it's
been a blessing to be able to play with her.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Bri is a blessing to have down low, and I promise I
would probably have like 600 more turnovers if it wasn't for her. We give a
lot to credit to Bri. I mean, she's our engine. We play through her. I mean,
she's a mismatch problem on all cylinders, and just to see her grow from her
freshman year, coming in with a torn ACL and to see her fight that whole year
and where she's at now is just so crazy to see and watch.  
  
Q. Bri, can you talk about the season? Did you personally expect to have
this kind of dominant role throughout college basketball? You've established
yourself maybe as the best center in the country.  
BRIONNA JONES: I think just every year I've tried to come in and prove my game
and do something better every year. And I think just this being my final year
and just having the sense of urgency of wanting to come out and do whatever I
can for this team, offensively, defensively, just doing whatever I can in my
power to make this team better, I think that's my approach to the season. And
it's just paid off through all the hard work that we've put in through my four
years.  
  
Q. Shatori, would you say this year's team has more of an edge given how
last year's season ended and how much that loss has fueled the run that you're
on now?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we will never forget how
we felt last year, how we sent our seniors out last year. It shouldn't have
went that way, especially all the hard work they put in for their four years.
Part of us, we've been playing for them especially, and like I said, I
remember how I felt, so I would never want our six freshmen to feel that way.
So that's why me and Bri try to lead by example and definitely try to make a
statement every time we step on the court.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, hi, everybody. Sorry we're running a little behind. We had
three kids with a final exam, so we couldn't leave any earlier. You'd think we
would be used to the traffic, but we weren't. But we're excited to be here.
Appreciate all of you helping us grow our game and giving coverage to the
journey of these women. We're excited about the opportunity to continue the
dance and to continue to get better, and we'll just go from there.  
  
Q. You made it a point, it seems like, to go out to Baylor and play them
and go out to South Carolina and play them, obviously hostile environments.
Talk about what your team learned from those games and how you will try to use
it tomorrow in what's probably going to be a real hostile environment.  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think, add the Pac-12 hostile environments to that, as
well. I think it's just a maturation process. You learn to focus on the things
under your control. You know some things are going to be a little bit more
difficult, but it's not something that's going to be unfamiliar. You know, I
think that's one thing I've really enjoyed about this team is they really
don't put too much into that kind of stuff. They're just like, hey, we can't
control that; it is what it is. We're used to it, we've embraced it, and I
think having good point-guard play helps, too.  
  
Q. I remember you and I talked a while ago about when you first got the
UCLA job, you came to UConn and went to practice a few times.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Talk about that experience, when it was, and what it meant to be in a
UConn practice and now you're playing them again?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, great people, that I think -- one of the things I think is
really important is that they're really interested in growing the game, not
just growing UConn, not just -- I think it's bigger than themselves, and I was
a beneficiary of that. I'm a big believer that you've got to learn from the
best, and so I think I've gone back four times, and I brought our entire staff
back, I think maybe our second year at UCLA. And spent, I think, three days
watching practice, and they were gracious to let us pick their brains a little
bit, and it just was a great experience.  
  
Obviously, I've had some great experiences at UCLA. I had the opportunity to
seek out mentorship by John Wooden, as well. I think for me it's just enjoying
being a consummate learner, and you know, I really want our program to be a
consistent, elite program that's playing at the top. So why wouldn't I go seek
out wisdom from the people that are there?  
  
Q. What year was the first time you came to see them? And also, since
you did learn from Coach Wooden, also, just comparing the two of them.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, I'm really old, so I'm not sure exactly what the year is. I
think the first time I went back was spring of maybe 2011, 2012. I think it
was the spring of that -- I think we were not in the tournament my first year
at UCLA, and I went back myself. And I think I spent three days there, and
then I actually went to Notre Dame on my way back and spent three days there.  
  
But the second part of your question, in terms of Coach Wooden, I think Coach
Wooden and Coach Auriemma have a very high attention to detail, and they are
always going to be pushing the envelope of your best, and I think that's the
big -- I think their styles are vastly different, but that's something they
really share in common is an extreme attention to detail and a consistency to
push that envelope, that there's more, there's more, even to help their
players find gears inside of them that maybe they didn't even know they had.  
  
Q. Two questions sort of jumping off of that point. My memory is that
you have the pyramid of success in your office. You have the first two lit up
at this point. If there's a victory over UConn, if you guys come in and snap
that streak, do you think that the third part of the pyramid will be lit up?
And just also related to that, I'm curious whether you have used the history
and the history of UCLA and the history of coming in and facing a team that
has that record as motivation, as a part of your preparation, getting ready
for this game?  
CORI CLOSE: I'll work my way backwards, and let me know if I forget anything.  
  
I think, no, I haven't, but it is interesting. A few days ago, Nan Wooden
called me, it was her birthday and she was calling to congratulate us on the
game Monday night. But she definitely reminds me of who broke that record, so
there's some other people who have reminded us.  
  
I think that I've really actually tried to stay away from everything that
doesn't have to do with the next 40 minutes. And I think that's part of why
people have a hard time is because they get distracted by a lot of the other
things that really have nothing to do with us. And as much as we are attached
to the history of UCLA and the motivation, I don't think we need any
motivation at this point. You know, if I'm focusing on motivation in the Sweet
16 game, I probably have some bigger problems.  
  
You know, I've really just tried to narrow the focus and tried to know our
team, how do we play our best, stay focused on that.  
  
In terms of the pyramid of success, and I think you're referring to in our
office, we had it -- we called it second-level living, and we were just
literally building the foundations and moving our way up. I think it's really
just -- it's a vivid reminder that we're trusting the process. We're not
talking about the championships. We're doing the work and making the
commitments that lead to those things, and you know, I'll light up a lot of
things if we're able to do that.  
  
But the bottom line for me is that my commitment to these young women is to
create a transformational experience that not only helps them reach their
potential on the court, but helps them long after the ball goes flat.  
  
Part of it is a reminder to the players, but maybe some of it is just a
reminder to me, that it's just one block at a time, one step at a time, and
stay focused on that.  
  
Q. You've talked about learning from coaches, and then also what your
philosophy is and cultivating young women. When you put all of that together,
what would you say is your approach to the season that you've had, but then
does that change when you enter into the postseason tournaments?  
CORI CLOSE: We try not to. I mean, I think that's why you really embrace, like
the gentleman said, about going to play at South Carolina, going to play at
Baylor, playing in the No. 1 conference in the country, is that so when you
get to this point, it doesn't feel like this huge change, we've got to do
something different, we've got to be something different. I think that's
really -- we're trying to build habits that prepare us for moments like this,
and so I really hope it isn't that different. I mean, obviously there's more
media attention, there's more -- longer times being in the locker room before
you ever practice, little things like that, but that's just part of the fun
vibe of being in the March Madness and the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But I really am trying to keep it consistent in our preparation. I've been
challenging our team the whole year, and I just said, hey, you've got to fall
in love with the preparation, and you've got to fall in love with making a
play for somebody else. And it's got to be selfless basketball, and you've got
to enjoy the process of getting better and pushing those comfort zones. It's
gotten us to this point, so I'm going to keep with it.  
  
Q. During the season, technically you played what we referred to as the
AP league, western division. We look out there one night and suddenly you were
diving, then you were rising. Can you talk about the ability to sustain those
ups and downs and get to where you are now?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think, you know, life has disappointments, and basketball
has disappointments, and it has growth opportunities. I think, you know, we
obviously aren't undefeated, but we look back on every single one of the
processes where we've had ups and downs, and I bet if you asked our players,
they would be able to say, oh, we learned this from this point, we learned
this from this point, and I think really just taking a growth mindset to all
the ups and downs that happen in a season and trying to let it teach your
heart.  
  
Just a few weeks ago or a couple weeks ago when we lost in the semifinals of
the Pac-12 tournament, I just was so -- I just was really aware that this was
going to teach our hearts, and I saw how our invested our team was, and I
think that's the way it is all the way through the year. When a team is really
invested, every time there's an up, every time there's a down, there's an
opportunity to grow.  
  
Q. I know you probably didn't spend too much time this year watching
UConn. They're obviously on TV enough that you saw them a few times, but now
that you've probably spent the last week or so paying attention, what has
impressed you most about what they do now?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think that the thing that's impressed me about their
program over time, and this is why I think they play better than their
individual pieces on paper are supposed to -- and this is the year, of course,
that everybody would have said that -- is their ability to pass the ball.
Every single person on their team can pass it, and I think, therefore, they
create such easier opportunities for each other.  
  
There's a lot of times when I'm watching film that you'll say, oh, that
offense or that action created a great opportunity, but the passer couldn't
find them. Passer couldn't get it to them. And UConn teams, year in and year
out, they pass the ball so well that they make their unit better than the sum
total of their parts.  
  
I think this year maybe more than any year, because there's not this go-to
player -- like we're going to run this play and we're going to go get Stewie a
touch here and that's the end of it. It's all these different players making
plays at different times.  
  
I've watched a fair amount of film now, and it's just remarkable the
efficiency, and I think their ability to not talk about just one player, to
have different players be involved in so many different plays. Obviously I've
been watching Katie Lou Samuelson since she was really young. I've got one of
her high school teammates on my team in Ally Rosenblum. There's some obviously
great individual players.  
  
But that isn't what's impressed me the most. They use each other's strengths
to make life easier for somebody else.  
  
Q. In terms of Jordin's development this year, her numbers were already
terrific last year, but her assist percentage jumped over 40 percent, one of a
handful of players in the country that that's the case, and her turnover
percentage went way down, actually the lowest of anybody in the top 20 in
assist percentage. What do you account for that change? How do you go about
doing that? Generally assist percentage leads to more turnovers because you're
trying for more. She's managed to do them both. How has she done it?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think every year that Jordin has been here, I think she's
really changed in her habits, her work ethic, as well as in her mental
approach to the game.  
  
I think she was such a dynamic scorer coming out of high school that it was
really hard for her to step back and think of the game globally first. Like my
job isn't first to score. I mean, every time in high school when things got
hard, you put the team on your back and you went and got buckets, and that was
it. Even she talked about this recently, just she thought defense was
everybody else's job. And I think the combination of her falling in love with
defense, I know that sounds like a weird answer to your question, but I think
it's given us easy opportunities and numbers breaks where those assist-to-
turnover decisions are really a much easier situation for her.  
  
But I've really seen just a student of the game. Her and I watch individual
film together every week, and watching her see the game sort of just from a
deeper standpoint, and now she'll come to me in practice and go, what about
this. It happened on the plane yesterday. She's like, I think if we put Kari
in this action at this point, this will cause some troubles on the switch or
whatever else. It's really fun to watch her really think the game.  
  
I think when you make other people better and your turnovers go down, it's
because you're anticipating more than you're reacting, and she's starting to
see, oh, this is going to happen. When I do this, it's going to cause this,
this and this. And I think she reacted to plays maybe in her first two years,
and this year she's anticipating plays.  
  
Q. Have you seen anybody as athletic as UConn's Gabby Williams up
front?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I'd say Monique Billings is right up there, so I think
that's going to be a really interesting match-up. I obviously really respect
Gabby Williams and her athleticism. More than her athleticism, though, it's
her consistency and determination to try to be involved in every play.  
  
But I really like Monique Billings' athleticism, too. I really think that's
going to be a really fun match-up to watch out there because they both have
the ability to affect every play on both ends of the floor.  
  
And to the end that which person can make those plays consistently, that'll be
an interesting one. But obvious respect for Gabby, but I also have a lot of
respect for Monique Billings, as well.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you saw, Becky Hammond was reportedly offered the
Florida job. You know, a job used to be a very difficult position to be in.
There's a chance to have a raise and to continue to grow the women's game,
which I think is something that is so significant in your life, as well. But
obviously the chance to be a trailblazer, also, in the NBA. What are your
thoughts on it, and what would your take be?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, you know, I think my take would be you've got to really know
your own heart and what your own sort of calling is to make a difference, and
I think that's different for different people.  
  
For me, my heart is really with college-aged young women, and I think it's a
unique age. So for me it wouldn't really be a question. But I also really --
I've been inspired by watching her journey in the NBA, and I know how many
other people are, and she's really good friends with Jenny Huth on my staff.
They grew up together in Colorado. I just really respect what she's been
willing to do not only for women and opportunities, but think about all the
little girls that have watched that and gone, maybe that could be me.  
  
So as a fellow coach, you know, I think she's just got to know what the
deepest calling is in her heart, in her life. And I think you can make a
difference in our game and make a difference in people's lives in lots of
different ways, and I'll be really excited to see what she chooses because we
know whatever she chooses, she will do a lot of good.  
  
Q. Just making the trip out here again, is it a little more comforting
that your kids have been to Bridgeport, gone through the East Coast routine
and they can be comfortable going into tomorrow's game?  
CORI CLOSE: It's always interesting for us. We had three kids have final exams
as I mentioned earlier. We're finished, I think, as of this afternoon. We've
got a couple papers that need to be turned in, but last year we were done just
the way the calendar fell, so that added a little bit. But it was fun just
listening to our players as we flew in, as drove in, there is a sense of
familiarity, and I think it's a difference. Last year was the first time we'd
been to a Sweet 16, and I think since 1999 -- my numbers might not be exactly
right -- but I think this year we expect to be here. We expect to compete at
the highest levels. We expect to play our best when our best is needed.  
  
I just think there's sort of a different level of just confidence. Our culture
has grown a little bit. That's just a building -- it's sort of one of those
building-block things. There's just a mental expectation.  
  
But I think there is a familiarity. I think there's a little bit of comfort
there, but I think most of that is just a maturation process, and our
expectancy to be at the highest level this time of year.  
  
Q. You guys went out to Baylor and played, you guys went out to South
Carolina and played, pretty hostile environments. Can you talk about what you
learned from those games and how you intend to put that to good use tomorrow
in what's probably going to be a hostile environment?  
KARI KORVER: I think in both those games, we had really good starts. I think
we had really good first halves. Against Baylor, I know we had the lead going
into halftime. I can't remember for sure about South Carolina, and then we
just didn't play for four quarters. And that's something we've been trying to
learn the whole year is we need to play basketball for four quarters if we're
going to go and beat great teams like that in their place, so we've been
learning that throughout the year.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Korver, our consistency in that has grown
tremendously, and I think something else that we need to focus on and got
better at is our defensive rebounding. We lost the battle of the boards from
both teams, and we have to rebound in order to win this game. I mean, Collier
and Williams, they're great at rebounding, so we have to make sure that we're
boxing them out and we're staying consistent in that as well.  
  
Q. Jordin, after last year, numbers were already very solid. Your assist
numbers have risen this year, but your turnover have gone down. I'm wondering
how you account for those two things and what you think has led to your
assists and turnovers being so much more efficient this year?  
JORDIN CANADA: I think for me what I really focused on this past year is
slowing the game down for myself. I think the first two years I was just
playing fast and not really playing efficient enough. And I think this year I
really tried to focus on that and put my teammates in positions to succeed,
coming off screens, reading the defense. I think that's something that helped
me, and then once I got to learn that and practiced that more and more, the
game kind of slowed down for me, so I was able to make great decisions.  
  
Q. For both of you, you've probably seen a few UConn games on TV, but
having watched film the last couple days, what's most impressed you about them
seeing them on film?  
KARI KORVER: I think their offense, the way that they move the ball and they
all are involved, and it's not a ton of dribbling. It's just they find the
most open person and get them the ball and they score or their transition, as
well, is really impressive.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: I think their defense, how they're able to just shut down
teams, no matter who they're playing. It could be a top-10 team, it could just
be another team. It doesn't matter. The way they play defense is team
basketball. Like I just love the way that they play defense.  
  
Q. Turning that question on its head, for those of us who haven't been
able to see you play out on the West Coast, what are the aspects of the UCLA
game that you think will be on full display or will need to be on full display
in order to be successful?  
JORDIN CANADA: I think transition offense is where we thrive the most. We get
out and we push and we run, and we're able to do that when we get defensive
stops. I think that's one of our best attributes of our game is transition
offense.  
  
KARI KORVER: I think to add to that, on defense we've gotten a ton better.
When we started the year, we let teams score in the 80s so then we had to
score like in the 80s or 90s to win. And now I think we can really hold teams
to a lot lower point value, so I think our defense.  
  
Q. To be in the building where the Sweet 16 disappointment happened last
year, is that significant for both of you, and have you allowed yourself to
think about that in terms of how you want to hopefully look for a different
ending this time around?  
JORDIN CANADA: I mean, obviously it's kind of hard coming back to the same gym
that you lost, but at the same time, you're not thinking about that. That was
last year; this is a different year. You're focusing on what you can do to get
better as a team, and the way we've been playing these past couple weeks
actually has prepared us for this moment. So I mean, we're not really worried.
I haven't even been thinking about last year's game. That's a game that
happened in the past, so we're moving forward.  
  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, I would agree with Jordin. I think walking into the locker
room initially was kind of weird because we were in that locker last year, and
Coach is crying, and you're losing your seniors and all of that. But we're
focused on the game tomorrow; we're not focused on last year.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys play in one of the toughest conferences in the
country; how well does that prepare you for a team like UConn? And also you've
played in front of hostile crowds in that conference, as well, and tomorrow
afternoon will probably be another hostile crowd I would think.  
KARI KORVER: That's a great -- I love the Pac-12. Every night you have to come
and you have to play a great game in order to win. There's no nights off. I
think there's times where we lost on the road this year and we were
disappointed in the Pac-12, but now look at -- like Oregon is in the Sweet 16
and we have five teams in the Sweet 16, I think. So those losses, they don't
feel as bad. We still would have liked to win, we still think we could have
won, but we're in a great conference, so we're prepared.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Kari. I think that something we have learned
playing in that conference is fighting for 40 minutes and being consistent and
learning how to just play hard, everyone, whoever is in the game for however
long. We need to focus on that and being consistent, and this conference has
definitely prepared us for that. Every night you're going to get a good game.
It doesn't matter. It's highly doubtful that you're going to get a game where
you blow out teams by 20 or 15-plus, like you're going to get a good game
every night.  
  
So it's just being consistent and making sure we're fighting for 40 minutes.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
BRIDGEPORT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+BRIDGEPORT)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

  
_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think at this time of the year, there really isn't a lot of
statements you can make other than we're anxious to play. I think that's what
-- everybody is probably feeling the same thing. We're just anxious to play.  
  
We talked about this weekend is a tough weekend, and everybody talks about the
Final Four and how great it is to get to the Final Four and play in the Final
Four and play for a National Championship. But this weekend is a tough weekend
because it took a long time, took 12 months to get back to this spot, and
could be over tomorrow at 4:00.  
  
I think everybody is just anxious to play.  
  
Q. For all the history that these two programs have in college
basketball, them on the men's side and you on the women's, you haven't played
them very much. But talk about what Cori has done there the last couple years
and the history of the programs.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think this might be the third time -- the fourth time
that we would have played, I believe. We played at UCLA in the 1998-'99
season. It was our third game of the year at Pauley Pavilion. And we played
UCLA at our place, and then we played them at Mohegan two years ago. So this
will be the fourth time.  
  
They had a rough stretch there from the time, '98-'99 to a couple years ago.
They had some good teams, but not to the level that Cori has been able to get
them to now.  
  
I always thought it could be pretty unique. I've always said whenever you're
at a school that has a great tradition in men's basketball, it just sets
itself up to be really, really good in women's basketball, if you want it to
be, if you get the right coaches and the school is behind it 100 percent,
which seems to be the case. And Cori has done a great job recruiting, which,
it is UCLA; I don't think they're worried about shovelling anything in March.  
  
We're planning to play them again next year at their place, and hopefully we
can keep it going.  
  
Q. What's Lou's identity these days? She came in as the three-point
shooter, but she's had five assists in four of the last seven games. She's had
five rebounds in like six games recently. What's her identity now?  
GENO AURIEMMA: How many rebounds? Five? All of them on purpose? (Laughter).  
  
You know, whenever you get a kid that can really make shots, you can't win
making shots, obviously. Bruno and I talk about this all the time. It is
called basketball. You've still got to put the ball in the basket. So whenever
you get kids that can make shots, you've got something that's pretty special,
obviously.  
  
Speaking from experience, having gone through this with my son, kids who can
make a lot of shots early on in their careers, they're a handful to coach.
Because if you're not careful, the world revolves around the next jump shot,
and when Lou got here, that's kind of what the perception was. That was her
reputation. She makes a lot of shots from a lot of different places.  
  
And whenever we get a kid like that, Kaleena was the same way, Diana was the
same way, must be something in the water out there, you have to really impress
upon them that there's so many other factors to basketball other than making
shots, and once they discover all those things, they really -- they just take
off because they start to see the beauty of the game in other areas other than
just shooting it.  
  
We're nowhere near where we need to be with Lou in terms of the other stuff
other than making shots. But she's way far removed from where she was when she
got here in terms of wanting to be a better rebounder, wanting to be a better
defender. She had seven steals one night. I mean, she would go months without
getting seven steals. So she's trying to do things that add value to your team
other than just shooting the ball, and obviously the tournament certainly
reflects that.  
  
Q. You've probably seen this week, you became a viral sensation on the
comments that you made last year at the Final Four about kids being me, me,
me, and body language and stuff like that. And first part, are you happy -- it
kicked off -- a lot of parents, I know, talking to their kids about that. Are
you happy that that's engendered that kind of conversation? And the second
part is LaVar Ball from UCLA's kids, he's become a lot of me, me, me himself,
and I'm wondering can you compartmentalize him like Earl Woods and someone
like that, or are you afraid that some parents will take the nod from him and
start speaking like he will?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, I think I was responding to a question last year,
and it had a lot to do with our philosophy of recruiting and what we're
looking for and what we try to do. I know some people may have interpreted it
as I'm complaining about today's kids. I'm not complaining about today's kids
at all. What I was describing is something that's been going on for as long as
they've played sports. I'm just -- I was just commenting on this is what I
look for. This is what's important to us, and this is what I see, and it's
been like that since I started coaching 40 years ago.  
  
The difference today is the advent of the social media gives more people more
access to information, and it allows them to promote themselves a little bit
more than in the past.  
  
Kids inherently want to be good teammates. I really believe that with all my
heart. Most kids when they're on a team, I guarantee you, you go watch any
seven-year-olds or eight-year-olds, they want to be good teammates. You watch
them play. When they get a little bit older and they start having a little
more success and then the parents get involved, they become not so great
teammates because they're told a lot of times that you're not going to get
anywhere unless you shine.  
  
So now back in the day, we had AAU tournaments. You had to win X number of
games to qualify for the National Championship, and you played on your team,
and you had to live in your state or whatever, your area, to play. And you
played, and if you lost, you went home, and it was devastating, and that's
Rebecca and Jamelle Elliot and Jen Rizzotti and Nykesha Sales, Megan
Patterson, as far back as them.  
  
Well, that's changed. Now when kids go to these tournaments, they're not going
there to win games. They're going there so that the coach can see them exhibit
their skills, so this idea of winning for the weekend doesn't exist anymore.
So it's not their fault. That's just the way it is. You know, I try, when we
go recruiting, to identify those kids who still have a tremendous interest in
being great teammates. We're not always successful. Believe me, I've had my
share of guys that were really hard to coach for that reason, and you can
trace it back generally to the parents, without question. You can trace it
back to the parents.  
  
And to your second question, I don't know Mr. Ball. I don't know him at all. I
enjoy watching his son play. And I would say that is he an exception to the
rule? Yeah, because how many fathers have a kid that good? So he can do what
he's doing and get away with it, which is fine. I mean, he's just being him,
and the son is just being him.  
  
I root for the kid because I think he's a hell of a player, and I wouldn't
want to be in his situation. I mean, I would next year when he signs, I'd want
to be in his situation, but I wouldn't want to be that guy that every time he
meets somebody the first thing they talk about is his father. I wouldn't want
to be that guy, but that's just me.  
  
But I don't think you're going to see a lot of what you're seeing right now.
You know, you mentioned Tiger's dad. I don't remember Tiger's dad being that
out front like it is today because all these things didn't exist back then; so
you can do it now, so people take advantage of it. But you'd better have a kid
that can back it up when you start talking like that, and he probably does. He
probably does.  
  
Q. Napheesa has talked a lot about this season about the confidence she
has played with that's allowed her to make the jump from freshman to sophomore
year, but if you look at her numbers, it's just consistent day after day, game
after game. Can you talk about that consistency from practice to game for
someone so young? And second part would be if there's one thing that has made
her a finalist for three major awards as National Player of the Year, what
would you say it is?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think you hit it right on the head: She's the same
every day. So what you're seeing in every game is what she does every day in
practice. Nothing ever changes. She's a lot like Maya Moore in that respect.
From the day Maya Moore walked into practice the very first day until she
graduated, she was the same every day. There were no bad days. There were no
bad attitude days, there were no bad effort days. I mean, there are a lot of
bad defensive days Napheesa has, don't get me wrong. She's still a work in
progress in that area.  
  
But there's very few kids that come in right away and give you the kind of
consistent effort that you're getting from Pheesa every day, from day one.
Last year she just didn't have the confidence maybe or didn't pick up things
as quickly as she's doing it now, and we had a couple guys that said, Pheesa,
if you don't get it, you're not going to play much, and that's okay because
we're going to win anyway. And now this year she's worked a little bit harder
to get things. She's a better player. She did more things over the summer to
get herself ready. And if you think about it, there may not be another player
in the country that can do as many things on the offensive end as Pheesa can,
and I don't care who they are going to talk about. She's not going to get
national Player of the Year; I get that.  
  
But I'll tell you what, if I could only take one player in America on the
offensive end, out of any other player that's playing college basketball
today, and you'd say, check every box, what can't she do, I would take Pheesa
over anybody in the country on the offensive end, and she does it every game.
And she'll probably suck tomorrow. (Laughter).  
  
Q. This may not be central to your preparation, but I'm wondering if you
could take me through how you decide who sits where on the bench, where
coaches are sitting, how that decision is made for you, and if that's evolved
through the years.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, through the years, it's always been -- since we've had
this many full-time assistants, since we've had three full-time assistants,
before that it was I'm on the end of the bench and Chris was sitting next to
me. Now I'm two down because Shea and Marisa sit there, and CD sits to my
right, and that's always been the case since we've had three full-timers.  
  
Where the players sit, I have no control over that. I just show up, and the
very first game I look down the bench, and I go, okay, that's where these guys
decided to sit. I don't move them around.  
  
Now, the young guys think if they sit closer to me, they're going to get in
earlier. What they don't understand is when they sit closer to me, they get an
earful, and sometimes by the end of their career they've moved down the bench.  
  
During timeouts, we have a certain seating order. I want there to be that
consistency, so we put an X on one of the chairs, and that's where our guard
will sit, and then we've got two on each side. But other than that, we're
probably like everybody else.  
  
Q. The trio of Jordin Canada, Monique Billings, and Kari Korver, as you
prepare for them, what do you see from those girls?  
GENO AURIEMMA: We were just watching some of them this morning, and they are
really a unique bunch when you think about it because we -- I mean, I didn't
get to see the Korver kid play much in high school at all. I don't know why, I
just didn't. But I saw a lot of Jordin Canada and Monique Billings. I saw a
lot of them, and I really, really loved them as high school players. And
naturally we don't get to see them that much being out here, but their
development coincides exactly with UCLA's growth.  
  
And it's pretty cool because they've got -- one kid can really shoot it,
another one is great with the ball, and another one just goes and gets every
rebound and is athletic as all get-out. So they've got a really good kind of
-- pieces of the puzzle all kind of fit for them, and Cori does a really good
job of giving them the kind of freedom that kids like that need to just play a
little bit. She's not -- at least it doesn't appear to be, like one of these
over- controlling coaches that's got the kids like that. The kids are kind of
free to play and just be Cali, just kind of do their thing. I kind of like
that.  
  
But I'm just glad we're not in our bracket and not in their bracket, because
I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be in their bracket. They remind me of
our '91 team. I watched them play the other day. There was about 10 minutes
left -- eight minutes left in the game, and I remember saying, I think they're
going to win. I couldn't believe it. And everybody in the place was going
nuts. I thought, oh, my God, this is like 1991, replaying itself. And Trish,
that potty-mouth coach of theirs, if I ever said some of the stuff that she
said, I'd get crucified. I told her that, too. Catholic school girl like
herself? She should be ashamed of herself.  
  
Q. Kia, this is for you because you've been shooting lights out. It's no
secret that your family is super competitive between your brother in the NHL,
you've got a sister playing hockey, your dad, your mom also playing college
sports. Is that part of the reason why you're so good in the postseason,
because of the competitiveness that you get from your family?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, competitive edge is definitely something that my family has
naturally, and it's something that you have to have when you grow up in a
house like that. And I think fortunately enough to have seen all of them
succeed in their sports, and to have seen them do the best they can in their
postseasons, I think you get that experience even though you're not there,
kind of live vicariously through them. And they are people who are continually
supportive, the people who are going to push you to be your best, and just
trying to continue to fill the footsteps that they've left before me.  
  
Q. A lot of players in various sports get pestered by family and friends
for gear, for shoes, for things like that. It's a little bit different
situation for both of you because you both have so many family members who
have played. I'm just wondering, is that an experience that each of you have,
and more specifically, whether it's from family or friends?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, my sister, my best friend from home, and then my
niece's god-mom are all coming up, and I left a huge stack of clothes for them
on my bed for when they arrive. They don't have the -- it's always nice to
give back to everyone else. We do get a lot of stuff, and we're very lucky, so
I love to give my stuff away.  
  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, I would say she's dead on, and it's always fun to have your
family members decked out in UConn gear. Just walking around and seeing them
and seeing the support that we have, not only from our amazing fans, but to be
a part of that. Even if you walk around campus, everybody is in UConn gear,
and I had a friend come up from Canada, and she said that's something that's
so different. At the University campus, everybody is so into your school and
your team spirit.  
  
We do have a lot of stuff. It's fun to have your family decked out in it, so
if they ask, sometimes it's easy to just, here's a T-shirt.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about UCLA? I'm sure you've watched some film
on them, but what's impressed you about what they've done so far this
season?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think the thing that has impressed me the most is their
transition offense, the way they're able to attack off a rebound, off of a
defensive stop I think is a lot better than a lot of teams that we've faced so
far. So we're just going to have to find a way to keep them -- slow them down
basically and keep them off the offensive boards.  
  
KIA NURSE: Obviously they have a great floor general in Jordin Canada, and
what she does, her ability to push the ball in transition, find open
teammates, and keep them running, they kind of go as she goes. So I think
obviously that's a tough match-up on the outside, especially with the shooting
of Korver, as well. And then you have an inside match-up with Billings that's
difficult. So to have those dimensions in a team, that's a big reason why
you're in the Sweet 16 and you've been as successful as you are this season
for UCLA.  
  
Q. Kia, obviously this team the last few years had a ton of people
contributing, but the idea was that Stewie was the clear No. 1 scorer at the
end of the day, someone who got the ball the most. It doesn't seem like there
is that person on this team. It could be any one of four, five, six people.
The change there, do you think it matters? Do you think that someone needs to
be identified? The other night it was you, it's Katie Lou at different times.
What do you think that impact has on this team, and does it matter?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, I think every team has a different identity, and the team
this year is much different than the team that we had last year. I think for
us personally, the ability to have five or six different people who can be the
leading scorer one night or be the leading rebounder, to have an impact on the
game every single time they go in there, it becomes much more difficult for
teams to play against. To have that match-up nightmare that you have as
apparently a center in Gabby, to have that, to have that dimension to our team
is extremely important, and we're very fortunate to have it.  
  
Q. Gabby, just the extent to which you've been able to dominate on the
defensive end, do you view that as your stock in trade, or do you see offense
as a really significant part of what you're trying to bring on a night-to-
night basis, as well?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think this team has a lot of offensive threats, so I kind of
took it upon myself, and Kia does it, too, where we try to set the tempo
defensively. I think my defense is a lot better than my offense, so I try to
take pride in that, and yeah, I would say I try to make defense a big part of
my identity.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 76, Notre Dame 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Erica McCall, Karlie Samuelson, Brittany
McPhee, and Alanna Smith. We'll begin with an opening statement from the head
coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I am so excited that this team battled in the second half and
came back. We're so excited to go to Dallas.  
  
First, I wanted to congratulate Notre Dame. They're an excellent team.
Obviously, it was a really tough, tough game, a really well-fought game.  
  
I thought our second half -- at halftime, we tried to make some little
adjustments, give some people ideas. But really the leadership of our seniors,
Bird (McCall) talking, "Stay with it!" I kind of used the analogy a little
bit, we're in Kentucky, and this is horse-racing country. What Kentucky Derby
winner starts out and goes pole to pole?  
  
It took us a while to get going, but then when we got going, we were charging
down that stretch and came across that finish line. Great plays by Karlie
knocking down shots. Huge second half defensively and offensively by Brit.
Bird rebounding, staying in there and battling. I thought we made some really
tough shots. When we needed our defense to step up, we stepped up really well.  
  
These four women, plus I thought Marta (Sniezek) did a really nice job and
stayed with things. They're an excellent team and we have to play really well,
and we did. So we're going to Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. There was a moment in the third quarter where you seemed to be almost
begging Marta to push the ball up the court, to push, push, push. There was
still 16, 17 minutes left at that point. How much did it feel like a race
against time at that point?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think just pushing on them, being aggressive was what we
wanted to do. Push them back on their heels. They were up coming into the
second half. I was just trying to get the pace going, and she did a really
good job.  
  
Q. Brit, the change in defense on you with Ogunbowale, I know you went
against her pretty much the entire game, but what did you do differently in
the second half to shut her down?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think I'm not used to guarding someone who can take it in
transition like that. At the beginning, she was getting easy buckets coming
down because I was late and looking at other shooters. I think finding her and
sticking with her the whole time was helpful.  
  
Q. Bird, can you describe what was going on in the last 2.3 seconds and
how you got the block on Arike?  
ERICA McCALL: A lot of prayers. I was talking to God the whole time. "Please
don't let her make this shot!" She came out and I was like, oh, my goodness,
she's about to get the shot up. She took a dribble, and I'm like I'm going for
it, whether I got the foul or not. I got a nice clean block off of it. We got
the win. Whew, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Her getting the ball in that situation? It looked like she's their
big gun, obviously.  
ERICA McCALL: Oh, yeah, we knew she was going to get it. We prepared for it.
Brit covered out, and we just had to help her out on the shot. So we got that
blocked shot and got the win.  
  
Q. What did Tara say during that timeout? There were two timeouts. One
was a 30-second. Do you remember specifically what the instructions were?  
ERICA McCALL: Each of us had a specific assignment on each person, like no
threes, no fouls, don't let the ball go in. Me, it was just make sure my
player doesn't get the ball. Just really chased out and just it really showed
itself out.  
  
Q. Brittany, I guess considering how the team shot in the second
quarter, did it kind of surprise you, or maybe do you think that was why Notre
Dame kind of let off on you and maybe some of the other shooters in the third
quarter when you all got it going?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, it was a little bit different. We thought they were
just going to come out in the triangle-and-2 again. The biggest thing about
the second quarter is Karlie wasn't out there. She really draws a lot of
attention. When she was back in, I had a little more space to attack.  
  
Q. We expected what we saw from the three ladies next to you, but you
were a very key ingredient, Alanna, at the end. Can you talk about your game
in the second half?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I was just trying to play my part, play my role on the
court. And whether that's playing good defense and helping up or staying on a
shootout or posting up big and taking an open shot, then that's what I'll do.
I'll play my role.  
  
I think that pass from Marta was very smart. I had a huge height advantage
inside, and I was able to get it. I think that was a really good play for us.  
  
Q. For Karlie and Erica, how does it feel to be going back to the Final
Four? First time since 2014. What are your thoughts and emotions? What are you
going to tell your teammates about it?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Going our freshman year was pretty amazing. I thought about
that since then. I thought about it my sophomore year, junior year. We wanted
to get it this year for sure.  
  
I mean, after the game, I started crying, just the emotions. It's an amazing
feeling to be back, and we're ready to play.  
  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I've been trying to get back to the Final Four ever since
my freshman year. One thing I really wanted to make the seniors we went with
proud, Chiney (Ogwumike) and Mikaela (Ruef), and show them that the people you
played with, trained us and brought us up. Hopefully, we're making them proud.
It's a really exciting moment. I'm exciting I get to share with my teammates.
It's just amazing.  
  
Q. Karlie, your dad has put in a whole lot of frequent flyer miles. I
guess he was saying earlier -- I don't think he's even really seen the inside
of the hotel room. Obviously, with that finish, that rewarded him coming back.
What were you kind of thinking there at halftime when you all were down?  
I guess, how does it really feel to give him that kind of reward for him
coming in here and sticking with it?  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I went to hug him after a little bit of celebration. He said
I made him cry too. I'm just so thankful that he's coming out here and my mom
is supporting me at home with the dogs and Bonnie.  
  
Yeah, he hasn't slept. He went from my game to Lou's game to our game back to
Lou's game. I'm just really thankful to have so much support from my family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Are you folks all done with finals now?  
ERICA McCALL: Yes.  
  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yes.  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yes.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yes.  
  
Q. When was the last final?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Thursday night.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Spring break.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, they can
be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, elaborate on what turned the game around in the third
quarter.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I just think that in the locker room -- you know,
we've been down before. Our team just said, "We've been down more. We've come
back. Just keep fighting, keep battling. Believe in yourself."  
  
We had that great third quarter. We got right back in it. And one of the
things our whole team -- like the whole bench was so excited -- screaming,
cheering, running out on the floor to bring everybody in -- played with
tremendous energy.  
  
In the beginning, I don't think we played the defense that we needed to or
wanted to, but I thought we played much better defense in the third quarter. I
think that that really contributed too. And people knocked down some shots.
They just said, heck, we don't want to go home. I think more than anything
this is a group of people that really love playing with each other.  
  
It's a long season, and you can always try to find a time to take a play off
and people really stayed focused the whole game as much as they could.  
  
Q. Tara, what was the strategy in the final 2.3 seconds? Obviously, you
got a big block. Did anybody take her off the flare? What was her strategy?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think, first of all, Kate Paye scouted the team. She did a
great job. She knew what they were running. We went over it with the team. We
wanted a big presence on the ball so they couldn't lob in. We knew they were
going to lob. We thought it was going to go to 24. We had a big presence on
the ball. We were switching off screens, getting out and contesting each shot.  
  
I think, as people really -- they just focused as much as you could and
understood it just came down to this one play. If you want it, you've got to
make this one play.  
  
So we had used -- we had no more fouls to give. We had another time-out in
case they scored. So if they had scored, we were taking a time-out and
advancing it. Obviously, they didn't. So we didn't have to go there.  
  
Q. Now, Ogunbowale only had four points in the second half.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. Was it strictly McPhee, or what was going on?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She worked really hard on her. She told me in the locker
room, she goes, "I want to guard her in the second half." Because I just --
I'm like, well, do we need to change up on her? No, I understand what she's
doing. Brit had a big game on both sides of the floor -- I mean, both ends of
the floor, playing great defense, and also knocking down her shots.  
  
I think that in the beginning sometimes it takes us a while to figure out what
combinations look good. Marta made some big plays, made some great passes.
Karlie shot, Brit shot, Alanna hit a shot, and we were off to the races.  
  
Q. In the first half when things wasn't going well, Notre Dame was in a
zone.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, Triangle-and-two. They were Diamond-and-one on Karlie,
when Karlie came out, they were zone mostly. When Karlie and Brit started
going, they put two people on them. Notre Dame is a fantastic offensive team,
but we knew we had to work really hard at defense. I was not pleased with our
defense. I was kind of on people about it.  
  
The first shot of the game, I'm like, "Bri, where are you? You're a defender."
I didn't want Karlie getting another foul either. So I just said, "Second
half, you got to let it go and be real aggressive." I thought we got more
aggressive.  
  
Alanna had a big steal, and we got that three in transition that Brit hit.
When we got to six -- I think when you're down sometimes a lot and then you're
only down like six, it looks like nothing. Then you're up, and you're like
whoa. We just had tremendous energy in that second half.  
  
I think also playing against the teams we played, playing in Washington -- at
halftime too, I told our team, Ogunbowale had 21. Well, she's on track. She
only had 42, not 44 like Kelsey Plum did. So keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Coach, I mean, with all the comebacks this team has made, obviously,
this one means the most. What about this did you kind of see in their resolve
that maybe was different from some of the other ones? Maybe just one you had
two days ago.  
TARA VANDERVEER: We've been on the road for 11 days. We had mixed success
here. We kept keeping things really positive and talking to each other. We
joke about omens, that we wore black last time we played Notre Dame. This was
the hotel that Washington was in. Just little things to kind of -- there's
another good omen.  
  
And just I think the fact, again, that this team, no one cares who gets the
credit. They just want to win. And everyone's excited for everyone else. And
they're a very close team. I think that sometimes, when you get a one-point
win, it's just that one rebound. It's just that one free throw. It's just that
one stop when you need it. They just were able to, I think, stay very focused
and really want it for each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: All right. Thank you very much.

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 76, Notre Dame 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Arike Ogunbowale and Lindsay Allen.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: We lost it in the third quarter. I don't know what happened. We
just couldn't score, and we couldn't defend. I think the more they got on a
run, the tighter we got on offense. That was a killer.  
  
I thought (Brittany) McPhee was fabulous. She was the difference in the game.
We were worried about (Erica) McCall and (Karlie) Samuelson, and McPhee did
it.  
  
Q. That last play and/or any options you had on the last play from out
of bounds.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think the last play we were just trying to go up and get a
good shot. Just see our options. We had Arike coming off the screen and we
also had Marina (Mabrey) coming off that flare in the corner. We figured we'd
get a pretty good shot, and we did. It just didn't go down.  
  
Q. Arike, you were named Most Outstanding Player. Talk about your play
and looking forward to next year.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, awards don't really mean anything when you don't
reach the goal that you planned at the beginning of the season. But we have a
good team next year. I'm just going to look forward to that.  
  
Q. Arike, how did you see the last shot? And then part two, what did you
think happened in the third quarter?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Like she said, we had a good look, and it just didn't go
down. The third quarter, I think they just -- they were hitting shots and
going on a run. We weren't responding at times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Lindsay, obviously, not how you wanted it to end. Could you just give
kind of a summarizing talk about your experience at Notre Dame, your four
years here.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I mean, these four years here have been something beyond my
imagination. I could never imagine coming here to Notre Dame and playing for
Coach McGraw. I just wanted this so bad for my teammates. It's so sad to end
at this moment.  
  
These four years have been the best years of my life. I've had some of the
greatest teammates ever. It's just been a really great experience to play here
at this elite level and play for Coach McGraw.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any final questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, after 56 percent in the first half, I think it was only 33 in
the second. How much of that was just fatigue?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we just got outplayed. I think we just felt some
pressure. We weren't as loose as we were on Friday. Our shot selection was
really questionable.  
  
Q. Coach, could you describe the play that was set up in the final
seconds. Obviously, McCall might have been anticipating. I'm not sure.  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was a screen for Arike. She was wide open, and she probably
could have shot it. That's hindsight.  
  
We got her open. She got the ball, and she made her decision. I thought it was
a good one.  
  
Q. If you could, talk about the defensive rotations that left their
shooters open on the perimeter, particularly there in the second half.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We played a lot of different defenses, but we had trouble
seeing when they ran through the baseline. I don't know if it was
communication or just not being aware. I thought we left them open pretty
consistently in the third quarter, and that obviously was the difference in
the game.  
  
Q. Coach, with Stanford's height, how much did that magnify Brianna's
absence?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think that's where we lost the game. I think we lost it
on the three-point line. We talked about, do we need to go big? But I mean, I
thought we did a really good job on McCall. She didn't have her normal game.  
  
I thought Smith made some shots late that we really -- we could have guarded
better. But really, I thought it was McPhee was the problem. So it was more
than the wings and the zone and the guards.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Bri Roberson, Karlie Samuelson, Kaylee
Johnson, Brittany McPhee, and Erica McCall.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Let's start with Karlie. This is a 9:00 a.m. game West Coast time. Is
that any kind of a factor for you folks, or do you feel like you could play at
3:00 in the morning?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I don't think time is a factor. We were in Kansas for a
while, and we came straight to Kentucky. I think we're acclimated to the time.  
  
Q. Let's go down the list. Bri, playing against Lindsay Allen again, can
you talk a little bit about what the challenge there is. You've played against
pretty top point guards this season, but what about her specifically?  
BRIANA ROBERSON: She's a very composed guard, a great guard. She has a lot of
tools in her arsenal. I'm very confident in our game plan and preparation for
her as far as guarding her and guarding every guard on their team.  
  
Q. Brit, I don't know who's going to be playing against Arike
Ogunbowale, but she looks like a scoring machine at this point, and she's
really strong, and she's only 5'8 ", but they throw lob passes to her. What
are you seeing from her? And what's the challenge of facing a kid like that?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: She's just always looking to score, so just being at ease,
guard her right when she gets the ball and knowing her favorite moves and
tendencies is going to be key. Obviously, she's going to get some points, but
trying to contain her to a reasonable amount.  
  
Q. Erica, you had, obviously, a huge game against Notre Dame last year.
They claim revenge is not a key motive for them because everybody wants to get
to the Final Four so bad, but revenge not a motive? Do you buy that?  
ERICA McCALL: They said so. Like I said, everyone wants to get to the Final
Four. We just compete well together, so I think they're just looking forward
to this exciting game the same as we are. So it should be fun.  
  
Q. I might as well, since I've got the microphone, I might as well ask
Kaylee. You had a huge game against Notre Dame too last year, probably the
best game you ever played, I would imagine. Do you guys feel you're playing
with house money at this point because you're playing against a top-seeded
team that has been gearing up for the Final Four all along? Do you feel like
you're loose as the underdog?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Like Bird (Erica McCall) said, we're just really excited for a
great game. We know we have to compete. We know they're going to come out and
be competitive. I mean, we definitely have like this sense of urgency they
instilled in us at this point. We're ready to go. We're excited. Just got to
know our next game is our biggest game.  
  
Q. For Erica, does it seem repetitive or -- I mean, to be playing kind
of the same team, I guess now for three straight Marches. Is it kind of
repetitive, or is it one of those things you kind of want to see maybe the
same team you faced to really show how far you all have come, and especially
since they're top seeded, how good you all can be?  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I think it's good to play the team you're comfortable
with, that you know some type of -- like I know the scouting report on them. I
think the NCAA committee just really likes this matchup, and they want to see
it time and time again. It means it must be pretty iconic.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you know, of course, they lost (Briana) Turner. Were you
surprised at anything you saw that they did Friday that may have been
different from what you expected?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No, honestly, I really was focused on Texas. I watched --
obviously, last night I watched Notre Dame. They have a very challenging team,
and it's hard when someone goes down, but it was the next person up. I thought
Erin Boley played really well. (Kristina) Nelson played well. They've got some
great players.  
  
I don't think I was surprised. They're a very talented team, and they knew
they had to play well, and they did.  
  
Q. When this bracket was coming together, did you kind of see the
potential for this kind of matchup looming? Maybe in your mind, especially
given the history, kind of prepare yourself -- well, you know, we could see
them again.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know you can see them again when you're in the bracket. I
guess you could say that about anyone in the tournament just because you never
know what's going to happen. I think this year especially there have been more
upsets, closer games with higher and lower seeds. So I don't think anything
was predictable per se. Obviously, when you have an injury with a key player,
anything could happen in the Purdue game. I don't think we were guaranteed
coming out of Kansas, and, obviously, Texas is a great matchup. So we really
focus on the one game that we're playing, and today we're focused on Notre
Dame.  
  
Q. Being from the Pac-12 the last couple years in the postseason, what
we're seeing now with Oregon against Maryland, what role did your program play
in setting a standard that other programs had to raise themselves to meet?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think Stanford made a commitment to women's
basketball back when I was hired by Andy Geiger, and we were able to recruit
nationally. Now I think with -- I think it's Pac-12 Network, we've had great
teams and great players in the Pac-12 for 30 years. A lot of times, people
haven't seen them or heard about them. And without maybe Pac-12 Network or
without even sometimes the opportunities to see these teams, an Oregon team
might not have even been in the tournament in the past.  
  
Obviously, they're doing really well, and it's something that I'm really proud
to be a part of the league that is a premier league with great players. I
think that this tournament swing last year, this year will only make it kind
of harder, my job harder in a good way -- more competitive top to bottom.  
  
But the Pac-12 has always been extremely competitive with great players, and
people sometimes haven't known about them. And a lot of those teams have not
gotten maybe a first round home game or gotten a decent seed so they can even
move on. But having five teams in the Sweet 16, I think, has been awesome.  
  
Is Oregon winning right now? Great. That's great.  
  
Q. Tara, is the loss of Turner sort of the equivalent of what it would
be for you to lose McCall?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You never want to lose anybody. I think their team has --
they have a lot of offensive weapons. She did some things that are really
special, but I think that they're able to -- you know, they're able to kind of
put the puzzle together differently with different (players) -- they have
really outstanding, outstanding offensive players.  
  
I think Erica, for us, we can -- I mean, we've had games where she has
struggled or maybe hasn't played that well. She, for us, is -- she's so
important for us emotionally. So in some ways, I think it would be probably a
bigger loss for us.  
  
Q. The players didn't seem to have much worry about a 9:00 a.m. Pacific
game. Do you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No, not at all. Part of it is because we've been on this time
zone. It was a little -- I think it was a little difficult in the bracket to
be in the real, real late game and then real early morning game. But I think
we learned a lot from last time around in that we're working really hard to
get right back, get hydrated, do some recovery, and get a good night's sleep,
and we've emphasized that with our team.  
  
Q. Coach, Notre Dame, we saw last night, they can hit four, five, six,
seven threes in a row. Have you played a team this year with that kind of
prowess from outside the arc? How do you feel you defended them? Does Notre
Dame remind you of somebody you played this year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Actually, Washington is a team that can really hit threes.
There are a lot of teams in our conference. Oregon is a very good three-point
shooting team, UCLA. A lot of teams that are doing really well in the
tournament.  
  
We know that that's something that we'll have to contend with, but they really
-- both teams were shooting 50 percent last night at halftime, and I'm not
sure for the whole game. But I just thought, wow -- I told our team when I
went into the locker room, I said the baskets are working.  
  
So it should make for a very, very exciting game.  
  
Q. Tara, Muffet McGraw was saying the reason they don't play you in the
regular season is that they generally try to use their trips for recruiting
purposes, in part, and they haven't been recruiting in California a lot. Would
you like to play them in the regular season?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It would be fine, yeah. I think that football has a good
home-and-home series with them. I think we probably -- you know, we had never
played Notre Dame in the NCAA until two years ago. In all my 30 years, I can
never ever remember playing Notre Dame. But I think next year we'll be
probably in a different bracket.  
  
But it would be great to play Notre Dame. They have a great program. We did
play them home and away just in a regular, like just home and away, I think in
like 1993 -- with Molly Goodenbour, Molly's year, so '92, '93, something like
that.  
  
Q. So for next year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm just thinking variety maybe. I don't know. Do they just
like use the same -- I don't know. You know, maybe, just thinking maybe.  
  
Q. I just wanted to finish up with a question about Arike Ogunbowale
because it was sort of a revelation to those of us who really haven't seen a
lot of her.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah.  
  
Q. This kid is 5'8 ", and they're throwing lob passes to her, and she's
doing everything all over the court. First of all, who's going to guard her?
And what's the challenge of stopping her?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I just said, first of all, she's versatile. She's strong.
She's got great hands. She gives you inside and outside dimension. I mean, if
you have a small person on her, she'll post them up. If you have a big one,
she'll pull them away.  
  
I think we'll just have to try the spaghetti approach and throw it up on the
wall and see if it sticks.  
  
Q. Along that line, when a team has that much balanced scoring as Notre
Dame did, how much tougher does that make preparing for or adjusting for them?
It's one thing to focus maybe on someone like Turner, but without her, they
spread the ball around, how much tougher is that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, we do analytics, and their offense is in the 98th,
99th percentile in catch-and-shoot and finishing at the basket. I mean, their
offense is phenomenal. So I think we have a good offense too, but we're going
to have to come out and play well offensively, and we're going to have to play
well defensively.  
  
I think the job that Bri and Marta did last night with McCarty was a
phenomenal job. She ended up with eight points, but I know at least two or
four of them may have been way at the end of the game, no threes.  
  
Our team is a blue-collar team. Maybe Notre Dame isn't, but we have to be a
blue-collar team, and we're going to have to bring our hard hats and boots and
come to work because it's not going to -- it's not going to be just playing
like a pickup game out there. We're going to have to really be aggressive and
play hard.  
  
Q. From an appeal standpoint, when you have two powerhouse programs like
this meeting each other, how much do you feel like -- even if it is year after
year after year, how much do you feel like that could really kind of raise the
profile of a sport in general?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think last year -- last year when we played, it was a great
game. The year before, I don't think we were as competitive as we needed to be
with them.  
  
They have a great, outstanding players, and have been, I think, one of the top
teams year in and year out. That's a real credit to Muffet. She is an
excellent teacher and an excellent basketball coach. And they have very
talented players.  
  
I think it's a real credit to her that she played so well yesterday without
maybe their leading scorer, and other people stepped up for them. I think it's
great for women's basketball to have marquee teams playing each other. We want
to play well, and our team is very excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: All right. Thank you all. We'll see you tomorrow.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined at the podium by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Lindsay Allen, Erin Boley, Arike Ogunbowale, Marina Mabrey,
and Kathryn Westbeld.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Arike, when you look back on last night's game, are you still
kind of amazed by some of the shots you got, and by how they fell?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think it was a great game in total. I think our whole team
played really well together without Brianna (Turner), and I'm just really
excited to play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know coaches don't like to talk about revenge, but I
wonder about the players. You know, especially since you had such a
disappointing upset against Stanford last year. Obviously, the big motivation
is to get to the Final Four, but how much is revenge, sheer revenge a factor
in this game?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I don't see it as revenge, I don't think, because, I mean, we
beat them two years ago, and they beat us last year. I guess this game could
technically be a tiebreaker type of game. So I think the real motivation is to
get to the Final Four and continue to play.  
  
Q. Any of the young ladies, what do you recall about last year's game
against Stanford that still sticks with you?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I think something that really sticks out to me is the
feeling in the locker room afterwards. Our seniors were heartbroken. I think
for me that just kind of stuck. It's something I don't want any of our seniors
to have to go through, especially Sunday. So I think that's the motivation
that's sticking with me.  
  
Q. I know each year is different, but, Lindsay, when you face a team as
often as Stanford, how differently do you kind of prepare for them this time?
Is it just because of the stakes, or do you just kind of rely on past
experience against them?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think it's mostly just looking at their team and their makeup
and then looking at their offense and what they run. Most teams run the same
kind of sets year to year, just different players in different spots. So I
think just noticing who's hot at the time, who they have, who they normally go
to in crunch situations, and then just kind of figuring out from there.  
  
Q. Marina, this is almost like a home game for you in the sense that you
have way more fans than Stanford has. You had a large contingent the other
night. How much of a factor is that for you folks? Do you hear the crowd? Is
that something you feed off of? What kind of a factor is that for you?  
MARINA MABREY: We have the best fans in the country. So we always like to see
them in the stands cheering for us. It definitely helps us with momentum when
we score a couple baskets and they're loud and encouraging.  
  
Q. Anyone else?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I agree with her.  
  
Q. How much time with your coach would you expect with one day to
prepare, is it just a matter of refining what you put in for last night?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it is. Obviously I think it's tough to go over
everything that Stanford does in one day. I think with this team it's just
kind of refining things, looking at mismatches we have and making sure we're
exploiting those and just remembering those and having that muscle memory to
continue through this game.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when a team has a game like last night where six players
were in double figures and you're able to spread it out, especially under the
adverse circumstances, what does that kind of say about the team? Or what did
that kind of reveal about this team that you didn't know before?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think just overall it was a really fun game to be a part of.
When we're sharing the ball and we're being unselfish, we're happy for
everyone's success, and everyone's getting hype and everyone's laughing and
smiling and things like that, it's just a fun game to be a part of. It's just
been fun over the past season to just being able to enjoy it, especially this
past game.  
  
We're playing with a ton of confidence, a ton of swagger, and just trying to
continue that into the next game.  
  
Q. Question for Erin: You coming back last night and having a home
crowd, kind of the same homecoming theme, how much of a release was it for you
to have that kind of game and kind of get that whole thing behind you and just
look at it as just another game?  
ERIN BOLEY: I don't know if I would say it was a relief, but like Lindsay
said, it was a fun game to be a part of. Now I'm just focused on the game for
Sunday. I think it's the same kind of mindset going in tomorrow as we had
yesterday.  
  
Q. Lindsay, for those of us who haven't seen a lot of your games this
year, how interesting is it to have a 5'8 " player that you're throwing lobs
to down low, somebody who's so strong as Arike? It seems to me that she's an
extremely unusual player. What is it like from your vantage point to watch her
in action?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Watching Arike play is just like -- I mean, it's always a fun
experience. Sometimes I just get caught watching her when I should be playing
alongside her.  
  
But she's such a unique player because she's so strong, and just able to kind
of bully people down low, but also she's super quick with the ball, and she's
able to slash and find the driving lane and can also shoot the three.  
  
She's worked on her game so hard and so long this past summer. So you see what
she did this past summer. I think playing with her is a lot of fun because you
get that energy from her, you get that swagger and that confidence from her,
and it's just really infectious and it kind of just spreads throughout the
whole team.  
  
Q. Last night was the most minutes you played in a long time. How's the
ankle today?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: Not too bad. I've got to do a little work, but it feels
pretty good right now.  
  
Q. Arike, with the kind of game you all had last night, now is the kind
of thing where there's no defined go-to player as it might have looked with
Brianna. Now all of you have to be accounted for in some way.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we all just need to step up, which we did, and we
all have amazing players. The freshmen were both national players of the year
and we have a lot of McDonald's All-American players. I think we just work
well as a team, and we all bring individual traits that will help this team be
successful, and it showed last night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
Q. Coach, do you like matching wits with Tara (VanDerveer)?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's a phenomenal coach. Definitely a Hall of Fame coach who
always gets the best out of her teams. She is just incredibly smart, which
makes her teams really smart.  
  
It's not a really fun game to play. I always look at teams that are just well
coached and really smart. They're very, very difficult to beat.  
  
Q. Muffet, what is the specific challenge of playing this Stanford team?
Obviously, this is the post-Ogwumike era for them, but they have a lot of
weapons now, and they play great defense. I was just wondering, from your
standpoint, what do you see in this particular team that may be different from
previous Stanford teams?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think experience and poise. They definitely scored the ball a
lot better than they did last year, but just their game experience, they never
get rattled, never lose their poise. They have a lot of different weapons, a
lot of different people that can hurt you. Everybody plays their role exactly.
Nobody tries to do too much. So they're a really tough matchup for us.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of what your program has done over the last eight,
nine, ten years and the ability to kind of maintain the standard class after
class, could that have happened without the National Championship in 2001?
Even though it was a different era, did you need that building block for this
current era?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think it helped me a little bit, just knowing that
we were capable of getting there. But I really think Skylar (Diggins) did so
much to change the culture of our program when she came in. She just set a new
tone and changed things, changed -- really brought the level up in terms of
practicing. We were able to carry it on after she left. That was probably her
biggest legacy for us.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you try not to look too far down the road, not past the
next game, in fact, but when this bracket was set up and you saw that Stanford
was in it, did the thought cross your mind, oh, no, we've got to go through
them again possibly. Did that kind of prepare you for this moment?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think the first look at the bracket actually came
when the three were revealed and we hadn't been up yet, and my first thought
was Ohio State is going to be in our bracket. Then we started thinking, uh-oh,
we got Texas. We got Stanford. That's a tough four teams we're going to have
to eventually play.  
  
So, you know, I think it was good to look at it that way, but without Bri, it
kind of changes things a little bit for us. But it was an opportunity for us
to look at what we did last year and to see if we could take one more step.  
  
Q. Muffet, the players kind of downplayed the revenge factor, and I was
kind of curious to hear what your point of view is on that. Is it the rubber
game of a three-game set? Or are you itching to pay them back for last year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think whenever you lose a game during the year, you lose a
game, you want to play that team again. When it's the last game of the season,
you don't get a chance to do that again. I think we know what we're up
against, we know how good they are.  
  
I won't say we look forward to it because we know it's going to be a tough
matchup.  
  
Q. Do you recruit many players -- do you and Stanford go after the same
players a lot?  
MUFFET McGRAW: All the time. Yes, we have very similar things we look for in
players, and we constantly recruit against them.  
  
Q. Which brings me to the other question, though: You've only played
twice in the regular season. Why is that? Your football teams play each other
every year. You've got two schools that are high-caliber basketball with big
academic reputations. Why don't you play each other in the regular season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we've talked about playing. The biggest thing, we
don't have any kids from the West Coast generally. When we set our schedule,
we like to go home so players can play in front of their home crowds. We're
not really recruiting a lot in California right now. If that changes, I think
that's a reason to go out there.  
  
We had been playing USC and UCLA. We'd been going out with football. When USC
played, we'd go out and play the night before. So it was kind of a rivalry
game.  
  
But it's something, I think we would look to explore, but you travel so much
being in the ACC, it's not exactly a great footprint for us. So we try not to
travel too much outside of the conference season if we can.  
  
Q. You were talking last night how proud you were of the underclassmen
and how they kind of came together. Maybe you'd seen this kind of coming
along, but for them to step up in a game like that without your top player,
what, in retrospect, did that reveal about these guys?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think I really envisioned the game going like it did,
as well as it did. I knew that Arike would be terrific because that's the kind
of player she was in high school. She's really sacrificed a lot to get the
ball to Bri.  
  
I knew Marina was capable. So I think it was an opportunity for them to
showcase what they could do while still playing team basketball and still
having a lot of assists.  
  
I think it showed we are a team that's hard to guard. We are a team that you
have to respect everyone on the floor, which makes us really hard to guard. I
think it opens up different things for us in the offense that we didn't get.
Obviously, it took away a lot of things that we normally get, but we're
playing a little different right now, and I think it's kind of a free, loose,
fun type of game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? Thank you very much.

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Shayla Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28374)

### [Kelsey Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28375)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Notre Dame 99, Ohio State 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Ohio
State women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Kevin McGuff and
students Kelsey Mitchell and Shayla Cooper. We will begin with an opening
statement by the head coach.  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: We can take questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll go straight to questions. Questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did this Notre Dame show you guys anything you weren't
expecting? Was there anything you guys didn't see in preparation that that
team brought out?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Everything they did today was something our coaches touched
on, and we harped on for a whole week. I just think they outplayed us
defensively and offensively.  
  
Q. Kevin, from a program standpoint, is this a good measuring stick of
really where you want to go still? Because they had an answer for everything,
and they were just a buzz saw at the end.  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Notre Dame played great. They really did. They played an
excellent game. Give them all the credit in the world. Any mistake we made,
they made us pay for. They executed on offense extremely well and clearly shot
the ball also extremely well.  
  
They played a great game. They were certainly the better team today and
deserved to win. As we aspire to continue to grow the program, that's what we
kind of want to look like in a game like this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we can stick to questions for the student-athletes, then
we'll open it up for the head coach.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did this game have the feel of maybe reversing the Maryland
game, where maybe you guys weren't necessarily playing poorly but the other
team was just hitting a lot of consecutive shots?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Yeah, exactly what you said. They kept getting possession
after possession, and after a while, they got themselves in a rhythm, and we
couldn't run them off the three like we needed to, especially in the clutch
time. Like the second quarter was really important and crucial because that's
when they kind of took it away from us.  
  
Q. Shayla, with the way that Notre Dame can move the ball, how difficult
was it to close out, especially on threes and long jumpers and things like
that?  
SHAYLA COOPER: It was not as difficult as it may have seemed. It was just
knowing the scout a little better, knowing where the shooters are, knowing
who's on the floor and who's going to shoot it. I think we could have done a
better job with that.  
  
Q. Shayla, how would you describe and maybe summarize your Ohio State
career with all that you've been through the last couple of years?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I would summarize it as a great experience. I've grown as a
person, as a player.  
  
I just want to thank Coach McGuff for giving me the opportunity to play here
and my teammates for picking me up when I was down and the coaching staff for
making me a better player.  
  
Q. You described this group as a special one since the start of the
season. I know it's still fresh, but when you look back on this group and what
you guys were able to accomplish this season, what were your initial
thoughts?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: We've been through a lot as a team. We've been through
everything. From the ups and downs, the losses, the crazy practices that we
have sometimes, to the arguments among teammates. I think it's made us great
people. I think we can only go up from here. I think this game has taught us a
lot about ourselves and where we need to grow as players and as people in
general. And specifically, as a culture and as a team and as a program, Notre
Dame is a fantastic team. I think they've done a great job with the things
they've accomplished.  
  
I think us playing them tonight can only show us where we need to get better
at. I just want to say thank you to my teammates and this program for
supporting us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Coach, how much was a load was (Arike) Ogunbowale tonight?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Arike played great tonight. She's an outstanding player. What
she did tonight, she scored from the three-point line, she drove the ball, she
posted up. She really showed her versatility, and that really gave us
problems.  
  
Q. Kevin, it seemed like the response was a little bit better to start
out the third quarter. What do you think changed over those next six, seven
minutes that kind of put the game out of reach?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, we had a great start to the third quarter. I really liked
what we were doing on both ends of the floor. We started defending better
during that stretch, but then we quit rebounding, and I think ultimately
they've got some easy put-backs and kind of got the momentum back in their
favor. I think that's what really kind of put them on that path to pull away.  
  
Q. Kelsey said this was sort of a gauge also of where the program is. I
guess it's dangerous to take one game as a barometer, but what can get better?
How do you get to that level?  
KEVIN McGUFF: We have to continue to evolve. We've grown as a team and as a
program, but we're not there yet. I think, culturally, we've taken some great
steps, but we're still not where we want to be. Hopefully, this game will give
us some experience that we need, and we can carry that forward to next season.  
  
I told the team afterwards that, when I was an assistant coach at Notre Dame,
we lost in the Sweet 16, then we lost in the Sweet 16, and then we won a
National Championship.  
  
So a lot of this is you've got to stick to it. You've got to keep fighting.
You've got to keep grinding. Year round, you've got to make sure you
continuing to get better. You've got to evolve culturally, and that stuff
takes time. I think we've grown leaps and bounds, but we're not there yet.
Hopefully, this is another experience that will help us continue to grow to
get to where we ultimately want to be.  
  
Q. Do you have a comment on Erin Boley and how much of a load she was to
handle tonight?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, she shot the ball really, really well. For someone her
size, she's kind of a unique player that way. Her three-point shooting was
really hard for us to handle. Our post players kind of tried to chase her
around on the perimeter, and it was a problem for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you return a lot next year. Obviously, lose Shayla, but kind
of going off what you just said, how encouraging is it to know that you return
nine players who played significant minutes? And then could you just touch on
what Shayla meant to the program and to you.  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Shayla, it's been really fun to see her grow. She's grown
off and on the court. I'm excited for her because she's got a great future
ahead. She's done a great job academically. She's a really bright kid. She'll
play basketball for a long time, and after that, she'll put herself in
position to have a great career, whatever it is she chooses to do. It's been
really fun to see her grow. That's the biggest thing.  
  
We have a great opportunity. We return a lot of great players and a lot of
good kids. Hopefully, as we continue to get experience in games like this,
that can be really valuable for us. It's a big off-season for us. It's hard in
women's basketball to really jump into that elite group at the top. Notre Dame
and Connecticut and Baylor, they've been doing it for a long time. They're not
going to go anywhere. You have to really, really fight and scratch and claw,
and we've got to have a phenomenal off-season.  
  
But I think we have the right kids in the program to do that. So I'm
encouraged about that. We'll get back. We'll get a little bit of rest, and
we'll put a plan together to make sure we have a great spring, summer, and
fall, and we'll be ready to go next year.  
  
Q. Obviously, this is a disappointing game, but how do you compare that
with some of the successes you've had this season?  
KEVIN McGUFF: It's tough. It's really hard because our kids have really
invested so much in this season, and all of a sudden it comes to a screeching
halt when you lose.  
  
It's hard to reflect back right away. We won the Big Ten. We got to the Sweet
16. So we've accomplished quite a bit. It will probably be a little bit easier
in the coming days and weeks to really reflect. Right now it's just so tough
after this loss.  
  
Q. Early on in the game, the three-point game is what kept you guys in
it. Was that something you practiced on or prepared for? Was that part of the
game plan?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I knew they were going to play a lot of zone. So we were
going to have to hit some shots on the perimeter. I don't want to totally rely
on that because I thought with Tori (McCoy) and Alexa (Hart) and Steph
(Mavunga) we'd have a size advantage. So we trying to get some balance in what
we were doing. So we shot the three well early. Now, we missed some shots
early that we normally make, and Notre Dame got off to a really good start,
and I thought that kind of affected us a little bit. But we certainly did
shoot the three well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: Thank you.

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Erin Boley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33293)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Notre Dame 99, Ohio State 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Erin Boley and Arike Ogunbowale. We'll begin with an opening
statement from the head coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm just so proud of this team right now, especially our
freshmen and sophomores. Our young players stepped up in a big game. I thought
Erin played her best game of the season. Arike with a career high in a huge
game without Bri. It was a struggle for us this week trying to overcome that.
Just so proud of the resilience of this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Erin and Arike, you just came out confident and loose. Can you
talk about that?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think -- well, Coach said it's evident we don't have Bri
in the paint. So it spaced out a little bit more. Coach told us to shoot our
shot and be confident in, so that's what we tried to do.  
  
ERIN BOLEY: We came out focused. Everybody was pretty loose and focused. I
thought we did a good job of coming out prepared and ready to play.  
  
Q. Not an oversimplification, but was the lane open because there aren't
two people down there guarding Bri?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah. There's a lot of usually help side with her, but they
have to really honor us because we have four or five plays players on the
court that can shoot the three. So you couldn't sag off too much or we would
get a three. So they had to really step up to their man.  
  
Q. Arike, did you feel any pressure to step up a little bit more on the
offensive end to make up for Brianna's loss?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: No, not pressure. I knew I had to play like I normally do
and work within the offense and just be confident.  
  
Q. Erin, how is it to be back in this state and play in front of family
and friends?  
ERIN BOLEY: It's good to be back in Kentucky. I had a lot of family and
friends that came that don't usually get to see a game. It was good to be back
home.  
  
Q. Will you guys stay and watch this next game? What do you know about
either Stanford or Texas? To either one of you.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we'll probably watch the fourth quarter and go and
get some rest -- or the first quarter.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
And we'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Again, Coach, not perhaps an oversimplification, but in terms of what
you devised, did you just tell them go?  
MUFFET McGRAW: What we looked at was the ability to post up our guards. So we
wanted to take advantage of that because we had Erin and Kat (Westbeld) at the
free-throw line. They had to guard them, so we could stretch the defense a
little bit more. They had to guard everybody and it opened things up for Arike
and Jackie around the basket. Then they had some mismatches with their post on
the perimeter. So I thought we did a really good job of taking advantage of
those mismatches.  
  
Q. Just elaborate a little bit on how good was Arike tonight.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she was fabulous. I had to chuckle when she said she felt
pressure. That's a word she doesn't know the meaning of. She is absolutely
fearless. She was somebody, I think, who was pretty excited when we talked
about how we're going to play from here on out because she's capable. She
sacrifices a lot for the team willingly, and it was great for her to be able
to open things up and play her game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the play of Westbeld playing with Bri
out.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Kat is the glue to our team. She's somebody we have to have in
the game. 11 rebounds, but she works the high post and the zone offense so
well. She works the pick-and-roll so well. She makes it hard to guard because
you have to guard her on the perimeter as well. Just such a smart player. She
was hurting a little bit, and she really just kept on going.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the significance of the way Erin played
given that she's coming back home and given the increased role she had?  
MUFFET McGRAW: A lot of times I worry when a kid goes home because they're
trying a little too hard to impress their family and friends. It's a big game
for them. I was just so proud of her because she was able to relax, to play
her game, and play the best game of the season in such a big game coming home.
It was just so rewarding to see that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 77, Texas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined by Tara VanDerveer and student-
athletes Erica McCall and Karlie Samuelson. We'll begin with an opening
statement from the head coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're really excited to be playing in the Sunday championship
game. I'm really proud of our team's second half effort. First, I want to
congratulate Texas on a great game and a great season, and just an awesome job
that Karen (Aston) is doing with her team.  
  
We really had to battle, and I'm really proud of the two young women next to
me and everyone in the locker room. Our staff did a great job scouting,
working really hard to get ready for Texas and we are absolutely thrilled to
be playing Notre Dame on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, 23 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists -- not a bad game. Do you
feel that you saved your best games for the big stage?  
ERICA McCALL: I certainly don't try to (laughter). It just happened to be this
game. Me and Tara talked about how well I played last year. I just feel really
comfortable in this gym. My teammates got me the ball, and I'm happy with how
I finished down low.  
  
Q. What was it like facing Joyner Holmes in this game? I mean, they
obviously had Kelsey Lang had 12 rebounds, but what was it like specifically
with Joyner Holmes?  
ERICA McCALL: She's really fast, aggressive. She's really impressive how she's
playing as a freshman. We knew it was going to be a battle, and we knew we had
to get her on the boards and box her out, because she was going to be a beast
on the boards. We knew, if we did that job, it was going to be easier for us
to push the ball in and make shots.  
  
Q. Karlie, Coach Aston was saying that your team's quick start in the
second half really kind of rattled their players. And those two threes you hit
obviously were a big part of that. Did you have any difference in mindset?
What got you going in the second half? Was it just you hit your shots and
simple as that? What was it like for you?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think we talked about coming out with more energy in the
second half. In the second quarter, our energy was a little bit low. Coach
Kate tells me to keep shooting no matter what. But threes get people going.
Brit (McPhee) hit one right after, and that was a good six-point play we had.  
  
Q. Erica, second time so far this tournament you guys have erased a
seven-point deficit at the half. What does that do confidence-wise knowing
that this team is never out of it?  
ERICA McCALL: That just shows our heart. I definitely feel confident going
into the next game knowing that we're just a fighting team. No matter how far
down we get, we're going to come back and fight with every rebound, every
shot.  
  
I was really proud of how we performed. Definitely going to give us a big
boost going into the next game.  
  
Q. For both players, obviously, you beat Notre Dame here last year.
You're going to get another shot at them. They're obviously going to be out
for revenge. How exciting is it or how strange is it for you two to be going
back into the same place against the same opponent in almost identical
circumstances as last year except that this is the finals rather than the
semifinals?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think it's exciting. We're here in Lexington again,
playing Notre Dame. It is the next game this time, so it is a little bit
different. But we're excited. They're a great team. I think it's going to be a
really good game.  
  
ERICA McCALL: I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I think they have really
great players that we can match up well with. It's going to be fun, and I'm
really excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Following up on what you said earlier about their second-half fight,
what things did you talk to them about at halftime? Particularly with that
second quarter, where they went ahead and seemed to have the momentum at that
point.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I don't know that it's anything that I'm telling them at
halftime, to be honest with you. I think you have great senior leaders with
Karlie Samuelson, Bri Roberson and Erica McCall. This is a team that really is
a very close team and they want to keep playing together. They know that there
was 20 minutes they had to play better to keep playing because that's the only
way you keep playing.  
  
Obviously, hitting those two threes at the beginning of the second half helped
a lot because then it erased the lead. But we have been down -- we've been
down 18 and come back, and our team really has confidence in their ability. I
feel like we are a second-half team, and we played a lot better in the second
half, moved the ball better. You know, we were able to get a lot of different
people in and try to keep people fresh, and I think that's going to be real
key for us on Sunday.  
  
Q. Tara, Karen was saying that she thought your team just executed
better, and part of that was just because of better, more experience. Would
you see it that way too?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think that they have -- I think they have some real
experienced players too. I think that our team buys in to what we have said.
These are the things we're looking for, and they don't go rogue. They don't
just go do their own thing.  
  
I think that we really ask our team to focus and execute, and I think this
team is executing really well, but a lot of it is people are willing to do the
dirty work. Somebody like Kaylee (Johnson) is setting great screens, or
someone like Marta (Sniezek) is very unselfish making passes and getting
assists.  
  
Just the leadership on this team, the cohesiveness is why we're in the
position we're in as far as I'm concerned.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk a little bit about the job Briana Roberson did on
Brooke McCarty. It was, I guess, partly Marta Sniezek too.  
TARA VANDERVEER: It was both Marta and Bri. Brooke is a terrific player. She's
a leading scorer. You cannot leave her open for threes. How many did she get?
She got one off, but she did not score a lot of threes on us. People worked
very hard on her.  
  
Other people -- you know, we played against such great players in our
conference, Kelsey Plum, Jordin Canada. I think this gave our team confidence.
Bri hangs her hat on her defense, and she really worked it, and Marta knows we
need her to play defense too, and she really stepped up tonight.  
  
I think Brooke is a tremendous player. So we knew we had to work hard on her.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a stretch late in the fourth quarter where they had
gotten within four, and then you all started a parade to the foul line. I
think you made 7 of 8 at one stretch. How did you tell them to really kind of
attack? What kind of vulnerability did you see with Texas inside where you can
attack them and draw those fouls, even if they don't make the basket?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that that is something that we identified, spreading
out and looking to take people off the dribble a little bit. But they're a
very, very good defensive team. I think that we tried to get out in
transition. I thought we ran some good sets. I thought Bri's three was one of
the biggest baskets of the game, and I think that's when it was a four-point
game. Bri hit that three and put it up to seven. You can double-check that.  
  
But we need people -- Marta had some good looks. We need more contributions
defensively, and I thought we got some from -- obviously, Bird (Erica McCall)
played well, Brit, and Alanna (Smith), and that spurt we got going with other
people. And we rebounded well. We didn't give them second shots.  
  
Q. Just your memories of last year's game with Notre Dame and how big of
a victory that was for your squad.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, it was a big victory. We were the four seed, and
they were the one seed, and they have a terrific team. I was just feeling,
just coming in here, I think the fact that we played the late game and it was
so emotional -- I think our team felt so high that we had a hard time turning
it around.  
  
We're excited, obviously, that we beat Texas, and we're excited to be playing
on Sunday, but we know the big game is on Sunday, and I know that our team
will be ready.  
  
It's kind of the rubber match. We beat them last year. They beat us the year
before. I'm a bridge player, so here we go. A bad bridge player. A bad one.  
  
Q. Is it kind of crazy it's in the same place? I know it's a different
round, but the same place, same court?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think that -- I don't try to second-guess kind of
where we're playing or what we're playing. I'm excited to be playing on
Sunday. Would we rather be playing them in Stockton? Probably, with our fans
there. But I'm excited to be playing, and we're looking forward to the game.  
  
We want to play better than we did tonight. I know our team is extremely
motivated, as their team will be. We will have to play very well.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 77, Texas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Texas
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach Karen Aston
and student-athletes Ariel Atkins and Joyner Holmes.  
  
We'll open it up with an opening statement from the head coach.  
  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, just congratulations to Stanford and to Tara
(VanDerveer). I thought that their team showed a lot of resiliency and
toughness in the second half. In turn, I thought ours showed a lot in the
first half.  
  
We got off to a rough start, and then we regrouped and played really well in
the first half. They just executed some things in the third quarter that got
us a little off balance, and we just couldn't answer. We didn't answer at
times. We didn't answer their quickness to the ball, and at times we didn't
answer from an execution standpoint. I thought they executed some things down
the stretch really well. And we just didn't.  
  
Some of it, I think, is just the difference in experience. It reminded me a
little bit of last year when we played UCLA and we had some older players that
had been through some things and really knew how to execute down the stretch
and be tough down the stretch in a Sweet 16 game. It looked almost flipped
this year where we had young players make mistakes they'll learn from, and we
didn't execute as good as we need to. But, again, a lot of credit to Stanford.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, the first few minutes of the third kind of changed things. Can
you say specifically what Coach is talking about, the execution part of what
Stanford did right that you guys didn't do right that you did in the first
half?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Kind of like she said, they had experience. They were using
their angles well on the court. They were running their plays. They are
finding the open man, rebounding.  
  
Q. Ariel, you guys struggled most of the second half with shooting. Was
it more that they played great defense or that you just couldn't get shots to
fall?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think it was our execution. I think we kind of got antsy, and
I think they did a good job of packing the paint on us.  
  
Q. For Joyner, your rebounding has been this team's strength. Had you
seen a team that kind of got in the lane like that, like Stanford?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Honestly, it kind of reminded me of the beginning of the year
against South Carolina. They had some big girls, and they out-rebounded us
down the stretch, and I just felt that was the turning point of the game.  
  
I know we got a couple offensive boards, and it changed the momentum of the
game. I just feel we could have gotten on the offensive boards a little bit
harder.  
  
Q. Both of you are coming back again next year. Can you talk about the
team that you'll have and how you can use this experience to hopefully make a
deeper run next season in the tournament.  
JOYNER HOLMES: I know as we were walking down here Coach was telling Ariel
that most of the things I've done this year and the team has done this year we
wouldn't be able to do without our older players. I just feel this game here
and this feeling here is our motivation for next year. I know we have a lot of
players coming back, and we have a transfer. So I think we'll be pretty good
next year. We've just got to put the work in over the summer.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we have a lot of work to do, but we can't go without
giving credit to our seniors. They came in with Coach Aston and her staff, and
they helped us bring this program back to the national light. I'm really
thankful for them. They really helped us become who we are. I'm definitely
going to take a lot from them going into the next year.  
  
JOYNER HOLMES: I don't think we could have got as far as we got without them.  
  
Q. Ariel, great season no matter what, but three straight Sweet 16s.
What do you think it's going to take to get over that hump?  
ARIEL ATKINS: If I knew the answer, I would tell you, but I'm going to figure
it out this summer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Joyner, you're only a freshman, but what did you learn this year that
you can apply to next year to make the team even better with you being a
sophomore?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I just feel like just listen to my older players and listen to
my coaches. I don't think I've ever played on a team that just has so much --
I think, not just experience-wise, but people that actually motivate you and
talk to you and tell you what you're doing wrong and tell you what you're
doing right. I feel like, just coming back, I've got to work hard in the
offseason. I didn't really participate in the offseason as much as I could
last summer because I was injured.  
  
I just think going into that with a good mindset and just remembering this
feeling, like I said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Brooke had a very uncharacteristic game. What did they do to
stop her on offense?  
KAREN ASTON: I thought that -- I mean, they had some quickness on her that was
able to shadow her. I mean, they did a great job of shadowing her most of the
game. They beat screens. Did a good job helping when she was screened for.  
  
But I also think that that goes back to my statement in the beginning, which
was that I just didn't -- I didn't think we executed things at the level that
you have to in the Sweet 16. There's a lot that goes into that -- I mean,
screening, angles, passing the ball at the right time, setting good screens,
you know, people waiting on them. There's just an execution that has to be at
a really high level.  
  
I thought that we made some adjustments in the first half to open things up on
the inside, and we just -- we got antsy once they made the run, and I thought
we didn't wait on things to happen offensively like we did in the second
quarter and like you need to at this level.  
  
Again, there's always times when you shut people down and someone else has to
answer. We just didn't necessarily have that tonight. I thought we did a great
job with them in some areas. They had other players answer the bell. You have
to have that happen when people focus on players that have been scoring.  
  
Q. In the last game against NC State, you said in the final four or so
minutes, you could just tell in your players' eyes and their communication
they were going to win. Did you see that same urgency at the end of the game
today?  
KAREN ASTON: You know, there's times -- and I felt this in the locker room --
that I have been disappointed in their effort in games. I felt like we didn't
have a sense of urgency that you have to have, and there's only been a couple
of those this whole entire year. But we did have a few that I was quite
disappointed in.  
  
That's not what I would call this game. First of all, I'm really proud of our
seniors. I thought they laid it all out there today and gave their best
effort, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished here at Texas. And I
wouldn't say that our team didn't have urgency. I just think they executed
better than we did. And we made some mistakes on defense that they made us pay
for, and that's execution.  
  
And they were just better than we were in that area. Some of it was youth, and
some of it was we didn't -- we got antsy, and we didn't execute well.  
  
Q. Samuelson took eight threes, and Brooke didn't even take a three
until about 1:30. What were they doing right to set her up in situations where
she could be effective?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, she's a really experienced player, and, again, execution
has a lot of pieces to it. It's the passing. It's the people doing the
passing. It's the ones doing the screening. And it's the one reading screens.  
  
When she got free a couple of times, quite honestly, we just made mistakes. We
made mistakes on defense, and if you look at the first half, we didn't make
very many mistakes, and we just made a couple of mistakes, and they made us
pay for it. I think that's what gave them the confidence and maybe shattered
ours a little bit. It rattled us a little bit.  
  
Q. Going back to Bri and Kelsey, they both have had huge milestones this
season, and they're the first group that you recruited and have kind of come
full circle. Can you talk about what they've meant overall to the program the
last four years.  
KAREN ASTON: I told them in the locker room that we're absolutely supposed to
win games, and that's what we're all here to do at Texas. But when I look at
those two, and when they came to Texas, I mean, we weren't very good, and they
bought into a vision, and they trusted the vision throughout their career. I
mean, they've been to three Sweet 16s in four years.  
  
More importantly, it's really how much they've developed as people. I mean,
when you look at their academic success that they've had, it's pretty amazing.
When you look at what kind of leadership skills they've learned, what kind of
young women they are now as they begin to think about walking across that
stage in the spring. I mean, that's what I'm so proud of as a coach. And,
again, I understand what I'm here for, but I also know that -- I guess maybe
I'm getting old, but when you get a little bit older, you really begin to
appreciate the maturation of a player and what they become as a woman.  
  
I can't say enough about those two and what kind of people they are and what
kind of student-athletes they've been at Texas.  
  
Q. Coach, two questions: One, do you label this a successful season? And
two, with the players you've got coming back, coupled with the two All-
Americans you've got coming as freshmen, do you think the expectations will be
even greater next year?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I don't think they can be any greater because we expected
to go to a Final Four. I mean, that was our goal. And it was a realistic goal.
So I don't know that our expectations will be any different next year. We
expect to be challenging for the Big 12 championship. We expect to be a
contender. We expect to win 20 games. I think that's always a benchmark of
when you asked me if it was a successful season, we won 25 games. Last year we
won over 30, and I think when you get to 30, you're really special. I thought
last year was a really special year. Any time you start winning 30 games, as
Stanford has done this year, you have a really special team.  
  
I definitely think that, when you look at the journey this team had, starting
at Stanford, it was quite a journey. And a lot of people really grew up. A lot
of young players really grew up this year. I'm tremendously excited about the
future, as I have been, not just because of who we have coming in, but just
who we have returning.  
  
You're talking about a lot of young players that got a lot of really valuable
experience against quality opponents that they'll be ready and they'll learn
from it, and they'll be motivated by it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara Vanderveer. We'll open it up for questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. With what we've seen over the past month and a half from (Alanna)
Smith, just what got her to that kind of production, averaging 5.5 points a
game for her first year and a half at Stanford and then going to averaging
almost 18 a game?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Her freshman year -- actually, Alanna and I were talking
today about her freshman year being a very big adjustment on a lot of fronts.
First, they were done with school in November. So she had a whole year off in
school. Getting back into academics was a challenge for her. Being homesick,
being away from home, being that far from home -- she actually, she was ill,
so she wasn't 100 percent in the fall. And it was just a big adjustment for
her.  
  
Then I think the beginning of this year, she really developed and really put
in some extra time, and I think gained her confidence in a couple games, had a
couple games where she scored well. I think her dad is a former basketball
player, and her parents have been always really supportive of her.  
  
In talking with her dad, I think we're just on the same page in terms of what
we tell her, and I think that's helpful for her. She's just being more
aggressive.  
  
Q. How much value is that earlier victory over Texas at this point in
the season? Is it just like ancient history at this point? Obviously, Smith
was not what she is now at that point. Their great freshman, Joyner (Holmes),
was not what she is now. How much value is that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think there's value in the fact that you've matched up with
them before. You can look at different matchups and see if you like them or if
you don't like them. Obviously, they've improved a lot. They've had a great
season, and I think we've improved a lot.  
  
I think it's -- I call it kind of a heavyweight fight. We know what to expect,
and they know what to expect. We just have to get it done. But I do think it's
helpful for us to have played them and to know their style and to have played
against a lot of their players obviously.  
  
Q. Currently, Samuelson, she's obviously been a great three-point
shooter for years, but her development this year is pretty interesting. She's
really become a much more well-rounded player. Can you talk a little bit about
her improvement this year.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that it's happened on a lot of fronts. As a senior,
she recognizes what she has to do. She's really stepped up to be a leader,
number one. She's a great leader of our team, scorer, defender, and we really
asked her to do everything.  
  
Her game is anchored by her 3-point shot. You've got to get out on her, and
then she can take her pull-up, or she can take it to the rim, and her passing
has improved a lot. But she's always been an extremely intelligent player, and
now I think, in some ways, the game slowed down for her even a little bit
more.  
  
But she is having a great senior year.  
  
Q. You've obviously played in many big gyms but maybe none bigger than
this one. Do you as a coach do anything to prepare your team for depth
perception and any other things that Rupp Arena makes challenging?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Nope, I don't talk about it. We've played really well here.
We like this gym.  
  
Q. Follow-up question: You obviously have coached before the advent of
the three-point and after. When the three-point first started, did you know
that it would have as dramatic an impact on the game as it has? And do you
think it has had that dramatic of an impact?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I like that question a lot. You know why? When we were
looking at it, the women's basketball committee, whoever was adding that rule,
we actually took our team to China the summer before that rule came in, and we
played in a game where one player made 10 3s. Now, I'm going to say 20 years
ago or even 25 years ago, that seemed outrageous, but now it's not that
outrageous. That just shows you how far -- but for me, I'm like, we're going
to take advantage of that 3-point line.  
  
In my first year back with the 3-point line, there were coaches who did not
allow their teams to take 3s. So it has come a long way. But I will say that,
for us, I think the use of the 3-point line was one of the main reasons why we
won our first National Championship. We embraced the 3-point line. We didn't
have the biggest team, the most physical teams, and we had to be more of a
finesse team, a shooting team. So someone like Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding,
Sonja Henning, those are players that really took advantage of the 3-point
line. I've always liked it.  
  
Now, the other thing, just to let you know this too, the way they encourage
their shooters to be 3-point shooters, they would, at a certain point -- and
I'm not sure what number it was, but your first 3 was a 3, like as a team, and
then when you hit a certain number, you could get four points or five points.
So they would, in their games, in their scrimmage games or whatever, Chinese
games, not FIBA games, they would do things to really encourage three-point
shooting because they felt that was a way they could compete.  
  
Q. This is your second year back here in Rupp. Having played on Monday
night, could you talk about how you all traveled from there to here. How much
of an adjustment time-wise or jet lag-wise do you have to make when you have
that kind of short turnaround?  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, it's great to be back. A lot's happened since
last year. We're really excited to be playing here. Originally, we planned to
go after our game on Monday, to go back to California, kind of regroup, do
laundry, get organized. Kids would have some finals to take, things like that.  
  
We were also the only one in the pod that had a Monday game. Everyone else
played Sunday. So I was a little -- I was already kind of in my mind thinking
maybe that was something we should be doing. And once they said our airplane
had mechanical problems, I'm not really excited about getting on an airplane
with mechanical problems. And once they said it was maybe going to go get in
by 2:00, we might get out by 3:00, I'm like, I think we should just bag that
plan A and go with plan B.  
  
So we went back to the hotel. There were some people that did go back to
Stanford, but the team and myself and most of our staff stayed in Manhattan,
Kansas. They were phenomenal. They did our laundry. They helped us stay in the
hotel and get a bus, and then we were able to get a flight to come out here on
Tuesday. I think that was a really good thing for us. Our team was really
tired. We were able to get a good night sleep Tuesday night. Monday night, we
got a decent night's sleep because you're not traveling. Tuesday night, a very
good night's sleep. And Wednesday night -- I feel we're in really great shape.
We don't feel rushed. Everything's been great.  
  
Q. Just as a follow-up, when you talk about all those circumstances, but
when you kind of look at some of those logistics to begin with, was it ever
kind of on your mind to maybe do that anyway, maybe just come straight looking
at the --  
TARA VANDERVEER: I did think about it. I actually talked to a couple of
players on the team about it, but we kind of went back and forth a little bit.
We had done that before with a team, and it just felt too long. I think the
fact we were planning to go back didn't get weighed on our mind like, oh,
we're going for a long trip. When it became staying the extra days, it worked
out great.  
  
I think it just worked out perfectly. We're in great shape. We're very excited
to be here. I think our team is well rested. Most players are finished with
their finals. That was another thing, figuring out final exams. When we got
that all worked out, I think, when they're done, they'll feel better.  
  
Q. What stands out to you watching the recent tapes of Joyner Holmes
compared to what you saw the first week of the season?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She didn't play much that first game. She's a terrific
freshman. Sometimes, honestly, she's a woman with girls. She is so physically
strong, and her rebounding is off the charts. They really rebound well. She
gets on that glass. She's versatile. I saw her knocking down 3s, handling the
ball. She's just a terrific player. I think Karen and her staff has done a
great job with her and the whole team.  
  
Q. Was Monday's game more indicative of how you thought this team could
play in the postseason?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, it was sure better than Saturday's. You know, we had
been off for a while after the Pac-12. I'm really excited that we had seven
teams in the tournament, all seven teams won, and we had five teams in the
Sweet 16. I think that that just really is validation of how strong our
conference is.  
  
When you're playing teams that really know you and you're playing -- it's a
brutal schedule. The West Coast, you're traveling a lot, and you're just -- I
just think that the teams know you, and the kids know each other. So it's kind
of fun to get out of your league a little bit and play against different
teams.  
  
I don't know that that was any more indication of how we can play. I think
it's good that -- I hope we can bring that momentum here, just continue to
play well. I think it's good for our team to go on the road and maybe not have
the comforts of home. But you have to battle, and you have to stick together.
I think it maybe brought our team closer.  
  
So all those things hopefully will pay off for us when we play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys play Texas every year. One, how did that all get
started? And, two, what do you like about the rivalry?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm not sure exactly how it got started, but we started quite
a few years ago. We haven't played every year, but a lot of it has to do with
the fact that we like to play places where our kids are from, and Texas is a
great recruiting base. We've had players on our team. (Chiney/Nneka) Ogwumike
is from Texas. So we kind of promised players they'll go back to where they're
from.  
  
So playing Texas, and we actually did that with Baylor for Ogwumike.  
  
Texas, they're not in our league, but it's a direct flight from San Jose. You
can get in and out of Austin a lot easier than some of the other Big 12
schools that you have to make a lot of connections to. They're a great
program, and I think those are pretty much the main reasons.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Great. Thank you all very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for Stanford
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by Erica McCall, Briana
Roberson, and Karlie Samuelson.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, could you tell us what your thoughts are about playing Texas
again after beating them back in November. What kind of a game are you
expecting from them this time? What are the lessons that you learned from the
last time you played them?  
ERICA McCALL: I'm really excited. Texas is a great team. They've won a lot.
It's been cool to see both of our progress. It's just going to be a big match.
It's going to be very aggressive. It's going to be tough, but I think we can
pull it out.  
  
Things we learned from the last game, I think our defense. I think we've
totally transformed our defense from just playing with the Pac-12. I think
they're going to see a different defensive style that they didn't see the last
game. So I think it's going to be fun. I think that answers your question.  
  
Q. How do you think Texas has changed since the last time you played
them?  
ERICA McCALL: I think that they've really grown into their own offense,
especially the freshman Joyner Holmes. I've been seeing her going crazy in
games. Her rebounding abilities are absolutely crazy. And, of course, Brooke
McCarty, her shot is really good.  
  
I think that's the best way to improve. Like Tara said, they've really grown
into their offense. Everyone seems to know their own role, same with us too.
So I think it's going to be exciting.  
  
Q. Karlie, No. 2 in the country in 3-point field-goal percentage, but
you don't take a lot of 3s. You just make what you take. One, what makes you
effective at that particular shot? And after you answer that, why don't you
take more?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: That's the shot that I practice the most. Every day, I
think, before or after practice, I'm shooting 3soff the pass. So that's just
the shot I practice the most. And I think what you practice the most will be
what you're best at.  
  
In terms of taking more, I think sometimes teams do a good job of finding me,
and there's not really a point of like forcing up shots. I mean, you got to
take what the team gives you. So I think we have a lot of great shooters on my
team, and my teammates find me really well. I think you have to guard
everybody on our team. So it's just take what the defense gives you.  
  
Q. Bri, you're playing in a huge arena here as you did last year. Was
there a problem with depth perception in this place on shooting last year that
you had to adjust to? Does it help having played here before?  
BRIANA ROBERSON: I would say most definitely, coming back and being in a
familiar environment is really good. Yeah, as far as depth perception, I feel
like we all did well last game. But definitely coming back and being familiar
with the arena and knowing kind of how the courts are and everything, I think
that's good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 23, 2017

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our head coach is on his way to the podium. Thank you for
joining us for the press conference for the Ohio State head women's basketball
coach, Kevin McGuff. Again, if you could please check your cell phone and make
sure the ringer is turned off and raise your hand prior to asking any question
and please identify your name and which organization that you represent as
well.  
  
We will open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, obviously, this is a very different team you're coaching this
year, but what do you take away from last year's Sweet 16? Is there a certain
sense of hunger you feel it created with this team?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think last year we were happy to be there. We had just had a
tough injury with one of our starters, kind of like what happened with Notre
Dame. We showed up. We played really hard. We didn't play particularly well
against a very good Tennessee team.  
  
But I think we're certainly a different team with a different mindset. I like
the way we've been playing. So I think it will be a different situation for
us.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. Brianna Turner injury, does that change your approach at
all, either offensively or defensively?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, I feel really bad for that kid. It's just terrible,
like you hate to see an injury like that at any point in the year, especially
right now. She's such a great player. It seems like to me she'd been playing
her best basketball here late in the year. So it's really tough.  
  
It doesn't change a whole lot. I think Notre Dame obviously will be very well
prepared. They had this week of practice to prepare themselves without her.
They may play a little differently, which may force us to play a little
differently in how we guard them and so forth. But I know they'll be ready,
they'll be prepared, and they'll probably have a real sense of urgency to
prove to everybody that they're still the great team they were before she got
hurt. I know they'll be ready, and we have to make sure we're ready for them
whether she's playing or not.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've been deep all year, but now your production with your
depth seems to be kind of at another level. Could you explain maybe what
you've seen in that.  
KEVIN McGUFF: We've got some kids coming off the bench playing really well.
Obviously, with the injury to Steph(anie Mavunga), Tori (McCoy)'s been playing
really well. We've had more people have an opportunity, and they've stepped up
and been real productive. We're at our best when we spread the ball around and
spread the scoring around. Hopefully, we can do that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about wanting to play your best basketball and this
team to play its best basketball towards the end of the season. Throwing out
the Purdue game, do you feel that's been the case these last couple of
weeks?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I do. We played really well in February, and things
started really coming together for us. Towards March is when you've got to
play our best basketball. We had a really good week of practice so far, and
hopefully that shows up tomorrow night.  
  
Q. With the kind of game that Linnae (Harper) had last week, was that
kind of -- I don't want to say the pinnacle game, but was that the kind of
game that you know she was always capable of?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Linnae's a great player. She's a very unique player
because for a 5'8", quote, unquote, perimeter player, she rebounds and plays
around the basket as well as anyone I've seen for her size, and she does some
things that most kids her size can't do. We saw it all come together from her
against Kentucky. We needed a game like that from her, and she delivered.  
  
Q. I guess it's one thing when it's against a former team, but maybe my
question was more, had you kind of seen her building up to that kind of
game?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yes, yes. She's had -- you know, she's had games where she's had
double-digit rebound games. She's had games where she's had a lot of assists,
and she kind of put it all together with the points and the assists and the
rebounds in that Kentucky game. She's shown that she could do that, and
certainly that was great to see her put it all together.  
  
Q. Kevin, we've seen a couple of better defensive performances for the
team, especially the last couple of weeks. What do you think in particular it
is about the team that's allowed the defense to get better around tournament
time?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Our preparation has been a little bit better. We've been a
little more focused and sharp in practice and showing up in the games. That
will be one of the big keys tomorrow night. Notre Dame is one of, if not the
best teams in the country in terms of offensive execution. So we'll have to be
really on point defensively if we want to give ourselves a chance to win.  
  
Q. I'd asked you this last week, I guess, about travel and adjustments
and everything if you had gotten to this point. I guess it's one thing when
you're just a couple of hours away, or three hours away, but how has your
routine kind of been affected by being back in the same venue within a week?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think it's great. I think just some familiarity with -- we're
in the same hotel. Heck, I'm in the same room I was last week. So it's been --
we had a good week so far. We got back. We got a little bit of rest. We
started practicing. Got the same bus driver, same bus, came back down. So I
think our kids are comfortable with that.  
  
Among all the other things, there's certainly going to be some nerves and some
jitters, but just hopefully that will at least give us a level of comfort that
we otherwise wouldn't have.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked about the team last year being happy to be there
given the circumstances. Did you notice earlier this year that this team kind
of had higher expectations of itself, and what do you think played into
that?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I mean, we added some really talented players. So I think
our kids from day one have had high expectations for what we could accomplish
this season, and we should. We've got a good team. We've got a lot of talent.
We've got a chance to do something special. It's going to be very difficult
here. There's great teams, starting with Notre Dame, but you get to the Sweet
16, and you've got to play somebody good.  
  
But to your point, we've had high expectations from day one.  
  
Q. And I know we saw her practicing earlier this week. Is Steph still a
game-time decision at this point?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, she's been good so far this week and further along than
she was last week, but I would say that would be a game-time decision.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
Q. I guess in kind of facing a former mentor of yours, any kind of
emotions in that? Or is it just a thing where it's just a basketball game at
this point?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I have great respect for Muffet (McGraw). She's a close
friend and her family. I had a wonderful, wonderful experience working there,
both personally and professionally. It was a real important time in my life
and my career. I couldn't say enough positive things about that experience.  
  
So it's no fun to coach against somebody you're close with, and I root for
them every game except for when they play us. So we're going to go out, and
we're going to compete, and one of us is going to win, and one of us is going
to lose, and we'll both move on.  
  
Like I said, I have great respect for her and her program and wish them
nothing but the best except for tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The press conference has concluded. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for Notre
Dame head coach Muffet McGraw. If you can raise your hand to identify
yourself, we'll bring you a microphone. We'll go ahead and open it up for
questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Obviously, with Brianna's injury, that has forced some adjustments. I
guess the immediate question is, what was the initial adjustment like for this
team, mentally as well as strategically?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's most difficult mentally, for sure. I think she's
everybody's kind of favorite player. They like her so much and respect her so
much. So it was a lot more than just about the game. Everyone knows what it's
like to go through an injury and how devastated she was, a player of her
caliber, so important to our team. I think it was just a lot of things going
through everybody's mind when she went down. It was really difficult to try to
kind of get our focus back.  
  
Q. In the days since, how have you kind of tweaked your strategy toward
this game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have really good guards, and I think we can still run a lot
of the same stuff. We'll just have to score in different ways. We probably
won't throw as many lobs. That's the biggest thing to change. I think
defensively, she's a huge presence for us defensively. So that's going to
force us to make some changes defensively.  
  
But offensively, I think we'll still be able to run a lot of the same stuff.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you expound on your relationship with Kevin and maybe
what you recall from his six years with you at Notre Dame.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, he was a terrific coach, I thought from the first moment
I hired him, I knew he was going to be really good with guard play. He was a
very good teacher of the game, having played the game, understand the game.
X-and-O's-wise, I thought he was very proficient. He was somebody that could
remain fairly calm in situations on the bench where he could not let the
emotions get in the way of what we were trying to do. So I think he always had
that sort of presence on the bench for us.  
  
Q. Specifically, which player on your team takes Brianna's spot in the
lineup? And does the role of that player/position, is it different because of
the nature of the injured player?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, no one can take her place. She's just a very, very
special player. So to lose her, we really need a lot of different people doing
different things. We'll look to our freshmen. We'll look also to Coco Nelson.
And between of three of them, try to figure out how many minutes we can get
out of each one. It will clearly be different than when the guards are in for
Bri than for Coco.  
  
Q. You had alluded to this earlier about your guards and how they can
score. How much does having so much balance throughout your lineup scoring-
wise kind of mitigate that? I mean, as much as you talk about her being a
special player, that you do have depth?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, not quite as much, but I definitely think our guards are
capable of having big nights, any one of them. I think the ones coming off the
bench, I think we look at Jackie Young and Erin Boley, they're big scorers
coming out of high school. You've got Arike and Marina who have already had
big games. Then you've got Lindsay Allen at the point putting everything
together.  
  
I definitely think our guards coming out of high school, they were the focus.
They were the ones that did the scoring. So mentality-wise, it's an easy step
for them to look to score a little bit more.  
  
Q. Speaking of Erin, what has her adjustment been like in this
program?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she's really gotten comfortable. I think it probably
took her until January to really get comfortable. Offensively, I think she
figured it out pretty quickly. She's a really smart player who knows how she
can get her shots. She knew how she could fit into the offense. She's not had
any problems adjusting at the offensive end.  
  
I think the difference was it's a little complicated. There's a lot to learn.
It's difficult for all the freshmen coming in and to see how quickly they can
assimilate the pace of the game into what they're doing.  
  
Defensively, we probably do a few more things she didn't do in high school,
and that's probably been her biggest adjustment. But she's somebody that
really wants to learn and wants to get better and wants to contribute.
Whatever you tell her, she's going to go out and try to do it.  
  
Q. Talk about the fact that this isn't your first rodeo. You've been
through this a few years ago. After all the different places you've coached,
there has to be a time, five or six minutes at least, where you realized what
happened, and then you figure out how to adjust to it. Talk about that
transition that goes on and how experience helps you move on to figuring out
what you're going to do.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have been in this position before, unfortunately, and I
think, as a coach, it's fun. It's a little challenging. You kind of look and
go how can we retool the offense in a couple of days? What new things can we
do? What can we stick with that's working? We just have different people in
different spots. So there's been a lot of meetings, a lot of X and Oing with
the staff trying to look at defensively what's our best plan, offensively
what's our best plan. So it's something that you don't expect to have to do in
March, but it certainly has been the kind of challenge that you loved as a
coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned your staff too. You've got two coaches that have been
head coaches at other places. They've gone through this. Niele Ivey herself
had a similar situation with injuries. So much experience there, and the staff
has really been a source of strength for you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, they're terrific. They're the best staff in the country.
I definitely -- I lean on them all the time. It's great to have that kind of
experience in the room when we're looking around and deciding how we're going
to approach this game and what's going to be the best way for this team to
play.  
  
Q. Coach, this might be the biggest arena that your players have played
in. Maybe they've played here before, I don't know. It's the biggest one I've
ever been in. Is depth perception an issue with you as a coach? And if so, how
do you go about the day before to adjust yourself, acclimate yourself to a
place like this?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We did play here last year, and it is a very big arena. We
played at Louisville, which is a pretty big arena, played in a couple other
places. We were in Oklahoma City one year. I think we played in some big
arenas, but I think it's a little different. I think, when we go out to do our
pregame shooting and our practice shooting, I think the guards will be able to
adjust. It will be a little different with people back there, but I don't
think they'll have any problem adjusting.  
  
Q. When you look at Ohio State, obviously, you talk about Kelsey
Mitchell, but what's the hardest thing about trying to slow them down or stop
them?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, Kelsey is a special player. She really is phenomenal.
She's a lot more fun to watch when you're not sitting on the other bench.
She's just so up tempo, and she can get her shots so many different ways.
She's just dangerous in the open court. I think she's obviously the player
that makes them go, but she's certainly not their only player. I don't think
you can really key on her and leave anybody else, because they have so many
people capable of scoring. They're maybe the team with the most depth in the
NCAA Tournament. They're just a really, really solid team at both the guard
and post positions.  
  
Q. You played here in this tournament last year in Sweet 16. Have you
used that as motivation at all for this team to go back here again and maybe
hoping for different results?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're definitely hoping for different results. You know,
I think losing in the round of 16 last year was really disappointing for us. I
think it definitely motivated us throughout the year. It was something I think
that we didn't talk about a lot during the year, but I think it was in the
back of everyone's mind.  
  
Q. What has this winning streak kind of revealed about your team that
maybe you were missing before or maybe you hadn't seen before?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We don't ever talk about that because we've won a lot of games
over the last couple of years. We really try not to get hung up on how many
we've won in the past. We're always looking forward to the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you. We will begin the Notre Dame
student-athlete basketball press conference here in a minute.  
  
Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre Dame women's
basketball team. We're joined by Lindsay Allen and Arike Ogunbowale. We will
open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you all talk about being back in this regional year two. I
asked Muffet if she used it as motivation because of the loss last year, and
she said not really. But she thinks, just without saying, it motivated you
guys. Can you just each talk a little bit about that.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's good to be back here after what happened
last year. Obviously, because of that situation, we're motivated. But also
because of Bri's injury, we have a little more motivation from that. So I
think Coach doesn't really have to say anything to us. I think we're all self-
motivated, and we're all such a close team that we're all kind of on the same
page.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I would have to agree with her. It's motivation in its own
to try to get to a Final Four or Elite Eight or whatever. But also losing here
is just a year away, and it's just really exciting to be back here.  
  
Q. Lindsay first, Arike second: You lose maybe one of your best friends
to the ACL injury. Can you talk about behind, off the court, how you guys
react to that emotionally, mentally, whatever?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's very, very tough to deal with, I think.
Especially just in the moment. I think it was tough emotionally to recover
from because it happened before halftime. So we had the whole halftime period
to kind of dwell on it and kind of sit on it. So that was tough. And then
actually finding out the news, it was hard because we just feel for Bri. We're
not concerned whether she'll be back or not. We're just really concerned with
Bri as a person. So I think that was a tough thing to deal with there.  
  
I think Bri has been so positive about it. I don't know how she does it. I
personally would be devastated. But seeing her and how she dealt with it kind
of makes you feel better. IT makes you realize she's taking it well, so why
can't we take it well? Her energy that she has is so very important to us.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I have to agree with her. Usually people, they get down
about ACLs. Anybody would, but Bri's been the same person, same personality,
still petty, still sarcastic, still making jokes. Her energy lightens our day
and makes us want to win and do well for her because she's one of our best
players. It's really good she's in high spirits, and it keeps our team,
honestly, in high spirits.  
  
Q. How do you think you'll adjust to it? How did you adjust to her loss
on the court? Do you think you'll do better with it now you've had a few days
to absorb it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think Coach gave us a clear plan of attack, and that was good
for us to be able to have that to be able to move on to not having her on the
court. I think it's going to be much more open in the middle. So I think, with
the guards, we are going to be able to drive and kick more, just find our
driving lanes, kick for threes, play with just kind of more open space and
just being able to read. We'll be able to have five people out there that
should threes at times, so I think that will be really huge for us, just
stretch the defense out and be able to play our game.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Ohio State, and what makes them strong?
Also, any indication on who will guard Kelsey in the game tomorrow?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think Ohio State, obviously, has one of the best
players in the country in Kelsey Mitchell. She's incredibly tough to guard.
She can shoot the three. She can drive by you. She finishes really well. She's
super fast, and they really like to run out on transition. Make her miss, make
sure we're slowing her down, and make sure we know where she is at all times.  
  
Q. Ladies, you had a chance this season to go against Kelsey Plum.
You've had a chance to go against Lexie Brown. You went against Asia Durr.
You've gone against Morrisette from Purdue. You've played a lot of teams that
had that one guard, that prolific scoring guard. How important is that
experience this year defensively playing against a player like Kelsey
Mitchell?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think it's just good practice. Those games aren't one and
done. No matter what the result, even though you want to win, it doesn't
matter. Now I think we've had a solid five games against players who have had
that one guard that you have to really focus on. I think it's just great
practice for us going into the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys played here last year from what I understand, but
when you play at an arena this big that you don't play in very often, is there
an adjustment that you have to go through as a guard? Especially with the
depth perception. What can you do to get ready for that?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it helps a lot having practiced and then having
shootaround tomorrow before the game, just getting a bunch of shots up as
guards. We're going to focus on that a lot today probably. Just getting
comfortable out there, getting comfortable with the air quality, little things
like that, the depth perception behind the basket. And just being able to kind
of get a feel for the arena and just get adjusted to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the Texas women's basketball team.
We're joined by Ariel Atkins, Joyner Holmes and Brooke McCarty.  
  
We'll go ahead and open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, what is the biggest growth you guys have made as a team since
last playing Stanford in the season opener?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think biggest area we've grown in is learning how to prepare
for teams. I think we take it a lot more serious, and I think we take it day
by day.  
  
Q. Brooke, as I mentioned to Coach earlier, you guys already play in a
big gymnasium. I don't know if you've seen this place yet, but this may be the
biggest one you'll ever play in. Do you as a player have to get accustomed to
a gym like this for depth perception? What can you do to get ready for a big
gym like this?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Well, we do have a big gymnasium at home, but like you said,
this one is huge. I think it's just going out there and getting a feel for the
gym and the stands and everything that's going to be in it. I think it's just
in practice getting more comfortable in there.  
  
Q. Joyner, can you talk a little bit about what that first game against
Stanford was like for you personally. It was your first college game, I guess.
You obviously struggled. I was wondering what it was like just going into it,
how did you feel after it, and how do you feel about how things have
progressed since then?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Going into the first game, I was real nervous. It was my first
college game. So I think, like when I got on the floor, I wasn't really
comfortable with myself like I am now. I knew my teammates are going to be
there for me.  
  
I know I didn't have my best showing, but recently as I've been playing and
going along, I think I've gotten more comfortable. My teammates have made me
feel like I'm part of the team and I can do as much as they can. I know they
have my back, so regardless of what I do, they're not going to put me down or
anything like that. Just as the season progressed, they talked to me and my
coaches talked to me, so just making sure I listen to them and follow what
they say.  
  
Q. Ariel, Stanford has the No. 2 3-point shooter in the country, as you
probably know, (Karlie) Samuelson. You've seen great 3-point shooters on other
teams, but what can you do to help prevent her from going off? And will you,
as the biggest guard on the team, are you going to be assigned to her? Or can
you talk about things like that?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think as the game goes on, it will probably be between me, Bri
(Taylor), Lashann (Higgs), between our guards. But like you said, she's the
second best 3-point shooter in the nation, and I think she's going to make
shots. That's what she does. So we just got to play basketball.  
  
Q. Joyner, Coach VanDerveer has boasted a lot about how the Pac-12 has
done so well this year and how the Pac-12 prepared her team for this
tournament. The Big 12, you've seen a lot of good teams in there. How has the
Big 12 prepared you for this kind of competition?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Playing in the Big 12 this year, I mean, going up against girls
bigger than me, taller than me, stronger than me, I think it's just made me a
better player.  
  
I think this year mainly I'm just trying to focus on players' tendencies. I
think playing against a lot of forwards and stuff has been the hardest job for
me this year. Just focusing on their tendencies and stuff, but I think the Big
12 has prepared me a lot just for the upcoming tournament and the upcoming
games that we have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then the
press conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Ohio
State women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by student-athletes
Sierra Calhoun, Shayla Cooper, and Kiara Lewis.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shayla, obviously, it was different circumstances last year in the
Sweet 16 with injuries and things like that. What do you feel like this team
took away from that experience? And how do you think you'll use that this
week?  
SHAYLA COOPER: From that experience, we just learned how to fight through it.
Adversity is going to come, but you have to fight through it. I feel like this
team has been through a lot this season, and I feel like we fought through it,
and that's something that carried on from last season.  
  
Q. Sierra, I think you're shooting 56 percent from three in the last 11
games, something pretty remarkably good. What has attributed to that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: I think I've just been focused. My teammates have been finding
me in the right areas, and I've just been ready.  
  
Q. Kiara, your first tournament experience last weekend, what was that
like for you? What kind of emotions and feelings do you take into this week?  
KIARA LEWIS: It was exciting. Just watching when I was in grade school and
high school, I wanted to be in this position. I think it's exciting to be in
the Sweet 16. It's one of the reasons I came to Ohio State.  
  
Q. Shayla, Brianna Turner goes down with injury. How does that affect
you guys in preparation? Do you do something different because she's not
there, or just status quo?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I don't think we do anything different. I think we are going to
approach the game with the same mindset, attacking them. Without having her in
the paint as a shot blocker, I think it will open it up a little bit more.  
  
Q. You guys are playing in a different gym this week, but is there some
benefit to being back in Lexington, having the same bus driver and having the
different hotel, things like that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: Yeah, I think, but I feel we're coming into the game ready.
We've got some confidence in us. We're in the Sweet 16. I feel like we're
really prepared. We've got a great game plan coming in, and I think we should
do well.  
  
Q. Shayla, Coach talks a lot about playing your best basketball toward
the end of the season. Obviously, throwing out the Purdue game, do you think
this team is playing its best basketball going into the deeper rounds of the
tournament?  
SHAYLA COOPER: Yeah, I think we are playing great Ohio State basketball. I
feel like everyone's giving their all on the court. No matter what it is, if
it's offensively or defensively, I feel like everyone is tuned in to what
Coach is saying and we're communicating well. I just feel like it's a great
atmosphere for us.  
  
Q. Kiara, how do you feel this team has done defensively the last couple
of games? I think you've held back-to-back teams to under 35 percent shooting.
What do you think has been different for the defense?  
KIARA LEWIS: I think just knowing the scout, knowing who each player is. And
just playing team defense, knowing that we can't let one person just get off
on us. So I think just being real focused and locked in.  
  
Q. Sierra, this might be the biggest gym you guys will play in all year,
if not ever. As a three-point shooter, do you have to prepare for depth
perception in a place like this? If so, how do you prepare for something like
that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: I think, as a shooter, you treat every gym the same. This is a
big gym. Nothing changes, yeah.  
  
Q. Shayla, Coach was saying a few minutes ago that last year you guys,
coming into the Sweet 16 you had the mentality of being happy to be there,
given the injury situations. Do you think the expectations were a little bit
different and greater for this team early in the season? What kind of told you
that, that the expectations were better?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I think because of the competition level that we had started in
practice. Coach knew we were a special group of kids, and I just feel like
that, with that, we had a lot of goals in mind, you know, making it to the
Final Four. So this is just one step closer to what we had in mind.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then the
press conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

## March 23, 2017

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Texas
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach Karen Aston.  
  
If you would raise your hand, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions for
the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Tara had mentioned earlier that she watches Joyner Holmes
sometimes, and she's a woman playing against girls. I'm just curious how she's
grown into who she is over the course of the season from that first game
against Stanford.  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I definitely think that Joyner has matured as a basketball
player. I mean, to go back and look at that film in that first game against
Stanford is almost comical, just from the standpoint of how young we were in a
lot of areas and how really disconnected we were, in particular on the
defensive end, mainly because of youth and inexperience.  
  
With Joyner, the special thing about her is not necessarily that she is, I
think, a woman yet -- and I think she would definitely admit that she's not --
but her kind of unique ability to be able to learn from her mistakes pretty
quickly. Sometimes freshmen and even -- I would say even as they become
sophomores, it still takes them quite a long time to adjust to things and get
over failures and move on. She has a pretty good grasp of that. As probably
as, I would say, immature she is off the court a bit, she has gained some
maturity as the season's gone along.  
  
Q. Tara told a funny story about three-point shots. Their team went to
China the year before it was introduced as a shot here, and some girl hit ten
threes on them, and she didn't know what the heck was going on. Do you as a
coach remember when the three-pointer was instituted and what your thoughts
were at the time of what it might do to the game?  
KAREN ASTON: I definitely don't remember what year it was. I do remember some
different things about the game, just because I still played a year or two
even with the six-on-six, when I was young, when I was in high school. To me,
the most significant difference as a player was when we changed the ball, the
size of the ball I thought was really, really significant.  
  
I was not a college coach when we went to the three. So I don't necessarily
remember that significance as much as maybe Tara does, but it has absolutely
changed the game. It is a huge part of, I think, women's basketball and men's
basketball at this point.  
  
Q. Karen, your team is obviously a lot better than it was back when you
played Stanford earlier, especially with Holmes. In what ways do you think
Stanford has also improved since then? Especially with the emergence of Alanna
Smith down the stretch of the season.  
KAREN ASTON: I think that is probably the most significant change in them from
a personnel perspective is Alanna, and we know her well. We recruited her. We
were well aware of Alanna as soon as she showed up on Stanford's campus.  
  
She has definitely grown as a basketball player, and that just speaks to the
evolution of kids. As they get into, I think, that second semester of their
sophomore year, second round of conference play is usually when those lights
start to shine bright if they're really talented players, and she is. So she's
made a big difference in them.  
  
I think the other piece of growth in Stanford's team has been probably on the
defensive end, not necessarily that they're better defensively or different,
but I think that they look like their attention to game plans is really,
really good, and their solidness on defense is -- it jumps out at you for
sure.  
  
Again, when we played them, it was early. It was the first game of the season
for us, so we had not even seen their team at all, other than I think they
played one game before they played us. So not near as much film and a lot of
growth from both teams.  
  
Q. Coach, Samuelson is No. 2 in the country in three-point field-goal
percentage. What makes her effective behind the three? Is it anything
different than you've seen? And who might guard that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think what makes her effective, it's her team. You wouldn't
just -- it's not just her. It's the fact that they have a really good concept
of their offensive flow. I think they screen really well. That's another thing
that jumps out at me is their efficiency on screens and screen angles. They're
really good at it, and they understand their job. When you get to this part of
the season, when you get to the Sweet 16, nothing is easy, and people are
paying attention to detail at a very high level, and they do their job to get
her the shots that she needs.  
  
The other part about Samuelson that's grown in her game -- I wouldn't even
necessarily say just recently, but in her career -- has been her ability to
play off the bounce. I think, when she first started, it was catch and shoot,
and she's added other dimensions to her game, and it's made her more difficult
to guard.  
  
Q. Since that three-game losing streak in late February, you all have
won 5-of-6. What do you feel like you all learned from that losing streak
that's helping you right now?  
KAREN ASTON: I think what we've learned the most is to sort of try to stay in
the moment. Our team won 19 games in a row, pretty much staying in the moment.
I don't know if fatigue set in with our young kids or whether we just got out
of the moment. I don't even know that they've know. We've talked about it, and
it's a pretty honest group of kids. They always manage to tell you how they
feel, even if it's something you don't want to hear.  
  
And we've talked about it at length, and I'm not sure it's even something they
know, but I think it's definitely something they learned from in the sense of
either you have to get over fatigue and you have to fight through it, or you
really just stay in the moment and try to do the best you can do that day or
for that team that you're preparing for.  
  
That stretch we went through at the end of that 19-game win streak was really
tough, and it would have taken a very mature team to go through that stretch
and then go through the two or three games that we fell short on, and we may
have just not been mature enough to handle that. I say that, but all three of
those games we lost were in the last second and could have easily all three
have been won. So shots didn't go our way. That's part of life.  
  
I think the other thing was just to handle adversity because the first one,
the other team made a shot at the buzzer, and that may have bled into the
other losses. You know, you have to have a short memory in this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you play in a big gym, but Rupp is probably going to be the
biggest one your players will ever play in. Is depth perception something that
you guys talk about? And how do they go about their business of getting
accustomed to a big open space like that?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that's what today is about. That's why you come
here and have a chance to practice the day before. Fortunately for us -- I say
fortunately that we're playing at 9:30. I'm not sure about that. But we do get
a shootaround. So we have an opportunity to get two different times in the gym
before we play tomorrow night, and I think that will be helpful for our
players.  
  
But you hit it right on the head, we do play in a big gym. We've played in
some environments that have been different. I mean, that's the thing about
this team, there's not a whole lot we haven't seen, and it may be a little bit
bigger than what we're accustomed to, but we've been in an awful lot of
different environments this year. Schedule allowed us to do that. So it's a
reflection for our kids and for our team. It's pretty significant. I don't
know that there's anything we haven't seen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The press conference has been concluded.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 94, Baylor - 85, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, congratulations.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you very much. I'm honored and humbled to be here. So
proud of my girls and our team. What a tremendous effort today against a heck
of a basketball team in Baylor University. Kim and her team are absolutely
phenomenal. It took a gut-check, gut-wrenching performance by our kids today,
and we delivered.  
  
I thought our kids were unflappable. I thought they were resilient. They
showed tremendous toughness, a lot of character, and their heart. You have no
idea what's inside their breastplate, but you saw it today displayed
firsthand. They just played with a tremendous amount of poise. Our point guard
was as good as they get today. She put us on her back. She led us. She was
obviously feeling it.  
  
Ran a couple different things for her. Just had to keep going back because
they were having a hard time dealing with it. She wanted the ball.  
  
Thought Tori was back to herself today. I welcomed her to the party about
midway through the third quarter. Told her that.  
  
It sure helps to have that out there on the perimeter, that big two guard that
can get you a bucket, can rise up and jump over people.  
  
For our seniors, they believed in a vision when it wasn't real easy to
believe. I'm really happy for them. I know how hard they've worked. I know the
blood, sweat and tears, the commitment they've put into this.  
  
I couldn't be happier for them. I couldn't be happier for our university,
administration. Tremendous basketball at Mississippi State. We're seventh in
the country in attendance, and our administration supports these young ladies
and gives them every opportunity to be successful. They're reaping the
dividends, because these kids are doing everything that they're supposed to do
right now.  
  
I'm awfully proud of them. Giving God the glory for number 33 today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Morgan, 41 points today, 7 assists. I don't think you had a turnover.
What allowed you to do what you did tonight?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Just confidence. I mean, I came out here early to shoot
because I had issues the last couple games. I was feeling it. Coach let me
make them. It opened shots for my teammates, too. When I was open, I knew I
could knock down the shot. That really helped us from inside-out. It was just
tough to guard us.  
  
Q. Morgan, I didn't see the interview that you and Coach gave to TV.
Looked like a very emotional interview. You said you did it for your dad.
Explain what the thoughts were. Were they going through your head during the
game? Were they there afterwards? What were the thoughts?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I mean, I was just using it as motivation. He's the reason I
am where I am today in basketball. He just did so much for me working out when
I was younger. Everyone doubted me because of my height. Did so much work in
the gym. For me to come out and do that, it's amazing. I just wish he was here
to see it.  
  
Q. Victoria, a big moment in the ballgame you get called for a charge on
one end. How difficult was it to kind of maintain your composure there?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: If you was on the court, you wouldn't say I maintained my
composure.  
  
I just tried to keep it together for my teammates because if the call didn't
go my way, another call would go our way on the other end. I just kept playing
and knew we had to keep playing in order to win the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, I know you've been struggling to hit shots. What did it
feel like to get those first three under your belt? What did it feel like to
get back in the groove and start hitting shots again consistently?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It felt good. But mainly today I was really focused on my
defense, because I knew our defense was going to win the game. Like Coach say,
keep shooting, the shots will fall eventually. I was just mainly worried about
my defense.  
  
Q. Morgan, 24 lead changes. What was it like to be in that sort of
matchup with the stakes as high as they were tonight?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I mean, that's why it's a game of runs. We live for moments
like this, back-to-back lead changes. We just know we got to make a run when
they make a run. Got to get stops in. Once we make our run, we got to get
stops and keep running from there. I feel like we did that. We got a stop, and
we kept executing. After that, we got a lead.  
  
Q. Dominique, you spent a lot of time on the bench in the second half.
When you were inserted into the game at a pretty critical moment, what was
that like? Could you share why you weren't in the game more?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I just knew I had to stay ready. I knew my time was
going to come to play defense. So I just had to keep myself ready. I was just
happy for my teammates. They played really well tonight. Coach needed a little
more offense tonight. I'm completely fine with that. I was ready when my time
was called. I was ready to play defense.  
  
Q. Dom, Bre, Victoria, can you tell us your feelings about watching
Morgan be huge tonight.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I'm just so happy for her. I'm just so proud of her. I
know she does it for her dad. I just feel so proud for her because I know how
hard she worked for this moment. I know people doubt our team, but people
doubt her as a point guard just because how small she is. They're not that
valid in that. I love the way she plays. She was just awesome tonight.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: That was really good. Basically same thing Dom said. We
live and die by Morgan at times. So her and her point guard play, she just
gets us going. We know when Morgan's going, we're all going.  
  
Just to see her come out, six of eight from the three, it was amazing. When
you just see her going, we're like, Give her the ball. We can't stop her, so
just keep giving her the ball.  
  
To see her have a game like this, it's amazing. Like you say, everybody doubts
us and they always doubt her. I just got to say congrats.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Thank you.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Well, I know tonight she got my assists up. I had six.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Career high (laughter).  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I'll take that (laughter).  
  
But I'm just proud of her. She can do this on any given night. You never know
with her. If she's in attack mode, she's going and doing it. I am super proud
of her. She's my point guard. We're together a whole 'nother year. I don't
know about those two down there, but I'm happy to have her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student-athletes go back to the locker
room, and we'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Vic, we talked about the size yesterday a lot. The guards were really
critical in this game. How big were those guards, especially with Victoria and
Morgan, against a team that we kind of hyped up as having a lot more size?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I thought even though Kalani went 11-13, and Nina was 7-11, I
thought the game turned into a guard game toward the end of the half. I love
my guards. I am not trading 'em for anybody.  
  
I thought after watching them against Louisville in person, I thought we could
do some things.  
  
You know, again, at some point I think you've got to learn to stop -- stop
worrying about trying to guard somebody and try to figure out, Okay, let's
just try to score more than they do.  
  
Boy, I thought we were really good offensively. It starts with Morgan. But it
also starts with Tori making a couple shots early, because you can just see
our team relax. When she's taking good shots, she took a couple bad ones in
the first half, but just getting her back to the party. I mean, I did, I told
her in the -- I think it was the second or third quarter, I said, Welcome back
to the party, baby. You're playing good. It just relaxes the whole team when
she plays like that.  
  
Morgan obviously was feeling it. I was running about three different things
for her, just trying to mix it up so they couldn't get comfortable with her.
They had two different people on her. Every time we switched, she switched
somebody on her. We went right back to the first play.  
  
Just tried to really be engaged offensively, hoped that we could get enough
stops down the stretch.  
  
Q. About the size, you talked about the size of the heart of the kids
that you have. How much has Morgan used the death of her father as motivation?
Has that been throughout the three years of her career?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously it was a tragic thing. It was sudden. I still
remember where I was standing when I got the phone call. Her dad was so proud
that she was coming to Mississippi State. I had just been with him at the
Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Game. Like she said, he ate, drank and slept
training her.  
  
You know, yesterday was the three-year anniversary of his passing. I remember
going to the funeral and all that, again, before she ever stepped foot on
campus.  
  
It's tough for her. That's the kind of kid, though, she is. She appreciates
everything that he done for her to get her to this point. You know, Morgan
rooms with Blair. She's at my house probably more than anybody on the team.
She's very, very special to Holly and I.  
  
You know, she's obviously very special to Blair. So it's tough sometimes for
kids. But I thought she bottled it up nicely today and really played to an
audience of one.  
  
Q. You mentioned you told Victoria, Welcome to the party. Do you know
what she was doing wrong or if she was doing anything wrong prior to this
game, or was she just not hitting shots? Was it as simple as that? Was there
something she needed to adjust or anything like that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think, again, nobody knows us better than the people in our
league, number one. She gets everybody's best defender, everybody's best
defensive game plan. But the other piece was, you know, we watched some film
together one morning. We talked about good shot, bad shot, you're running out
of your shot here, stay in your shot.  
  
Sometimes it's just as simple as, you know what, you're making three out of
ten, how about following your shot and go getting some of those misses? What
that creates is a little more focus.  
  
If you tell somebody, Go follow your shot every time you shoot it, now they
tend to stay in their shot and they don't tend to drift, they tend to follow
it. Now they stay with a good foundation. We talked about that a little bit.  
  
She's been shooting it great in practice. Last four, five days, those kids
were chomping at the bit to get back in the starting lineup. I knew yesterday
I was going to do it, get them back in, so...  
  
What a great day to get back in and play like they did.  
  
Q. Vic, you told Victoria, Welcome back to the party. What do you think
got her into the party?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, all I've done is just tried to tell her, Hey, you're
shooting it good. You shot it well today in practice. You're making good
decisions.  
  
I think you've got to fill her head, anybody, you got to keep being positive
with kids. I think that was the biggest thing with her, is just trying to stay
positive with her.  
  
But at the same time, you know, the definition of insanity is to do the same
thing over and over again if it is not working. Just trying to coach her,
teach her, let her know the importance of getting her back.  
  
I told her before we left town, Hey, we won't win this weekend without you. We
won't win without you being an impact player.  
  
But I've told y'all every press conference, I don't worry about Tori. I've
just seen her do it way too many times. She made that shot off the glass, I've
seen her make a hundred of them. It's not that she's calling it, but I've
still seen her make 'em.  
  
So, it doesn't surprise me.  
  
Q. Coach, when Geno Auriemma goes out to recruit, he's able to tell the
players, Come play for us at UConn, you have better than even odds of playing
for a national championship. Till now you haven't had that ability to say
that. Could you describe what goes into taking a program from where you
started to this level this quickly? What does this accomplishment now means
for you and the future at MSU?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I do have a little experience of being with a national
championship team when we won it in 2011 at A&M. I know what it looks like. I
knew what this looked like with this team. I've told them since day one, I
thought they were a Final Four team. I thought they were good enough to win
it.  
  
What it takes to get it to this level this quick is a tremendous commitment
from your administration. We knew what 13-17 looked like that first season. We
didn't panic. We signed those four freshmen, though, before we ever played a
game, because we might not have got them if they'd have seen us play that
first year.  
  
At the same time, those kids, we went and got kids that could impact our
program at that time, then we backed it up with a top-20 recruiting class.
Since then we've had another top-20 recruiting class.  
  
But I tell you, the biggest key for me was Johnnie Harris coming with me. I
couldn't have done it without her. I wasn't coming to Mississippi State
without her. This would never have happened if she said, Vic, I'm not going.
That was the first thing.  
  
I'm smart enough to know I cannot do it by myself. I have to have a great
staff. I have an unbelievable staff. Great role models, great coaches, great
teachers of the game.  
  
What goes into it is a commitment and a love for kids that it's got to be your
every thought every day all day long. I mean, we're in the kid business.
Sometimes you have to make decisions that have nothing to do with basketball,
but if you really care about the kid, and that's first and foremost with us, I
think those are the things you have to do.  
  
My staff deserves so much credit, so much credit, for where we are today, what
we're doing with these young ladies. Again, I think, just like Geno would tell
you, it's the quality of the young ladies that we have, their character, what
they're made of, what's inside their breastplate. That's the piece that is
hard to get to know when you're recruiting. That's the piece that I want my
staff to get to know before we ever make a commitment to a young lady.  
  
We got to make sure they're committed like we are because nobody works harder
in the country than my staff, I promise you.  
  
Q. I wanted to comment both on the number of turnovers against a pretty
good ball-handling team and your ability then to capitalize on those. I
noticed in the first half especially you didn't face much foul trouble at all,
but you were pulling players almost immediately after they were blown for a
foul. Is that part of your normal practice, to keep people conscious of
defending that well, but not doing it without swatting at the ball?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Those two bigs, I try to rotate them in and out. I don't want
them to get back-to-backs. Chinwe was starting earlier. Teaira came off the
bench, she was SEC Six Player of the Year. Teaira has been playing better, so
I've been starting her. I don't need Teaira in foul trouble. Those two good a
little bit of yo-yo, so to speak. The rest of the kids, I don't think I pulled
them as much as those two.  
  
Just trying to keep them in the game, impacting the game, is really big for
us. Teaira obviously had a huge game for us on Friday.  
  
I knew Baylor was probably going to come after her a little bit today. They
went right to her early and often, got a quick one on her. So that's kind of
the game I have to play with those two down there. That's two aircraft
carriers that do a great job for us and have really impacted our team and our
program.  
  
Those two have great chemistry. When one's in, the other's out, they're both
cheering for each other. There's a lot of love between those two.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck next week at the Final Four.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 94, Baylor - 85, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. Questions for Coach or the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Kalani, particularly for the seniors, how difficult was this?  
KALANI BROWN: It's a disappointment. Just sorry I couldn't get them there.  
  
Q. Kim, the sets where Mississippi State ran, how much had you guys seen
that in film preparation? What was the difficulty in stopping it?  
COACH MULKEY: In stopping William?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the kid hit 41 points. They doubled the number of threes
they even make all year. I've said all year that when you beat us, you're
going to have to hit 10 or more threes or beat us on the offensive boards, and
they did.  
  
Their one kid kicked our rear. We saw all those screens, to answer your
question. Vivians, she did more of it than she usually does, because the
ball's usually in her hands.  
  
But kudos to her. I knew we were in trouble when they were hitting bank shot
threes to start the game when the shot clock was winding down. What do you do?  
  
Q. Kim, what did you think about your team's resilience despite them
hitting shots at the biggest times?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, we had a shot to win the game. Jones I thought took a good
look there at the end of regulation, blocked it, or two or three of them
collapsed on her there.  
  
I'll say it again. As good as they played and as poorly as we played in
handling the basketball, we still had an opportunity to win, and we didn't.  
  
Guys, I played the position of point guard. If you look at Nina Davis' stats
and you look at Kalani's stats, she didn't miss much. The problem was we
couldn't get them the ball enough. That goes back to ball pressure, being able
to run the show out there. 17 turnovers to 4, you shouldn't even be in the
ballgame, not at the Elite 8 level.  
  
We hung around. We hung in there. Ended up being a high-scoring game. But when
you've got that much down the block, you better find them every time and have
the ability to get them the ball.  
  
Then you turn around the defensive end of the floor, you let a point guard
score 41 on you. Don't know how to say it any simpler.  
  
Q. Kalani, like Kim said, the posts were scoring. You only had 13 shots.
Were they denying? Were you not showing your numbers? What was the difference
down low for you not to get more shots?  
KALANI BROWN: I guess they were denying me the ball. That's pretty much it. It
made it hard for me to get open. Made it hard for me to get post touches.  
  
Q. Kim, Wallace didn't have her best game. What do you tell her after a
game like that?  
COACH MULKEY: Nothing. She's crying. She's upset. I just went in the locker
room and apologized to the four seniors that I couldn't as their coach get
them to a Final Four. I thanked them for four wonderful years of Elite 8
basketball. Many players and schools across the country would trade places
with them in a heartbeat.  
  
But at Baylor, we have expectations that are higher than an Elite 8, whether
that's egotistical, fair, it is what it is. We have to keep feeding that
monster we started 17 years ago. You don't really say anything to anybody's
else. You say the Lord's prayer and come to the press conference.  
  
Q. Coach, you turned and smiled to your bench after Morgan hit that bank
three at the end of the first quarter. Was there a sense, as the game went on,
that you could tell when a player gets that hot, that just about everything
she throws up is going to go in?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, you can get a sense of, you know, the kid's playing
unbelievable. She did. Is that her career high? Have they made 10 threes all
year?  
  
We seem to be very poor defensively or bring out the best in people. She was
very good today. She took her team on her shoulders, and consequently they're
there in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Kim, Vivians got off to a hot start as well. Y'all cooled her off. I
don't know if that was all Alexis? You went to zone a little bit. Talk about
what you were able to do against her.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Alexis Prince fought through a lot of picks today, and was
late on a lot of them. That's tough. When you're constantly being hit on
screens, you know, it wears on you.  
  
She took it off the dribble a lot. She hit big shots. She hit big shots. She's
a big-time player.  
  
I don't know that we did anything to her. She hit 26, 24. Those two players
really beat you.  
  
Q. Coach, what legacy has your senior class laid out? What kind of
foundation have they laid for those coming back?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think their record speaks for itself. I think the number
of Big 12 championships that they've won, both regular season and tournament,
four Elite 8s. Looks pretty good on someone's résumé.  
  
Those kids are all graduates, or are getting ready to graduate in May. You
have just four outstanding players, All-Americans, All-Conference. Good
students.  
  
Their legacy is what it is. They've kept us at an elite level. I just hate for
them, because they really are Final Four type of kids. This was a Final Four
type of team. But we just didn't get it done today.  
  
Q. Coach, Kalani had a great game, despite the difficulty of getting the
passes in to her today. Could you compare her potential as a sophomore right
now to Brittney Griner and some of the other bigs you've coached.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think Brittney Griner's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of
player. She plays above the rim. It wouldn't be fair to compare Kalani or any
player to Brittney Griner that is a post player.  
  
I think Kalani, from her freshman year to a sophomore year, is a completely
different presence in the paint for us both offensively and defensively. I
think she worked extremely hard in the summer to be able to play for longer
periods of time.  
  
I think everything that we really do goes through Kalani. Unfortunately we
couldn't get her the ball enough today.  
  
Q. This game was previewed by the media - hopefully we're not the fake
media, but as the media - as being a battle of the bigs, given the height you
have inside, their potential as well. You clearly got the better of that
battle today, but it ended up coming down to the guard play for Mississippi
State. Can you comment on that, please.  
COACH MULKEY: I think you said it best. I don't know what else I can add to
what you said.  
  
I thought, as I said earlier, that we didn't get the ball to the bigs enough.
Credit Mississippi State's defense for creating turnovers. It was ridiculous.
I mean, guys, it was just one turnover after another after another after
another after another. What do you do?  
  
We got to fix it, because we have all those bigs back. We have Cox and
Beatrice and Kalani. They're as good as any bigs in the country. But we have
to fix this turnover problem. We got to fix, I guess you'd say, point guard
play.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to Vic Schaefer after the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Congratulated him and wished him nothing but luck. I can't
remember any more than that. They were so excited. You don't want to take away
from their excitement by talking too much. But just congratulated all of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season. Take care.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, your thoughts.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: It's a great day to be a Bulldog. Really excited about the
opportunity in front of us tomorrow. Again, awfully proud of my team.  
  
Just to rehash with Washington, how good they are, how well-coached they are.
It was a tremendous victory for us.  
  
Proud of our second and fourth quarters. I thought those were big for us. I
thought our conditioning, just our physical presence, really took over.  
  
Looking ahead to Baylor, obviously extremely talented, well-coached basketball
team. I've known Coach Mulkey a long time. Had a little bit of experience
dealing with her teams. This team is no different.  
  
They are big, strong, physical. They were even more impressive -- I told the
kids this morning in film, I don't watch a lot of film, I don't watch a lot of
games during the season, of people outside of our league. But for some reason,
it worked out, I know I saw them more than anyone else outside of our
conference.  
  
Seeing them yesterday in person was really impressive. Again, it's kind of
like the old days. Some of y'all haven't been around long enough to know. In
the old days, you could have one in-person off-campus scouting of opponents.
Today the rules don't allow that. In the old days you could do that one time.  
  
When you scout in person, the thing that the film doesn't show is quickness,
speed, how truly big someone is. Yesterday I got that up close and in person.  
  
We're excited. We've had a good film skull session this morning with our team.
We're excited about the opportunity. Again, I think our league hopefully
prepares us for this moment. I think our kids are excited about the
opportunity in front of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Teaira, when you look at Baylor, if you've had a chance to see much
of them, what stands out to you about their interior players?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, they're all tall. They're a very tall team. Just going
in guarding them, like we have smaller guards, but I think it will be a good
matchup.  
  
Q. Teaira, Coach Schaefer mentioned yesterday trying to bottle up that
performance and get back-to-back big performances out of you. What are you
doing to try to prepare yourself to come out with the same kind of intensity
as yesterday?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It's nothing that I don't do on an everyday basis in practice.
Just put myself in that situation. Just telling myself you have to go out,
have another good game, put two good games back-to-back.  
  
Q. Dom, can you describe the different challenge of facing, like Teaira
just said, a team with as much size as they have in the post, in the
backcourt, how that's going to be different from the last two?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Last game at Washington, they didn't have as big of a
post player as we do in Osahor. She could step away from the basket, hit the
three. DePaul, they could step away from the basket, hit the basket.  
  
Baylor, they're more pound it in, inside. We prepared for this all year. We
played South Carolina twice already. I feel like they're very similar to South
Carolina. I think we're prepared. We'll have a good game plan.  
  
Q. Victoria, how long can you celebrate yesterday, and how quickly do
you have to get ready for a team like Baylor?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I feel like we celebrated all night last night. This
morning, we focused on Baylor now. We started with film. Now we just got to go
to practice and put what the coach says in.  
  
Q. Morgan, Dom just mentioned the South Carolina comparison, which is a
pretty strong comparison. You played them three times. They have the big
guards, the big women inside. Talk specifically about that guard matchup.
Baylor has a lot of guards. Is that similar to what you faced when you went
against South Carolina?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, pretty much every opponent I face is pretty much bigger
than me, so... I just feel like we got to play tough, physical and aggressive,
like Coach Schaefer always tells us. We just got to play our game plan,
pressure the ball, make sure they not getting no easy looks.  
  
Q. This program, this team in particular, seems to thrive on the
underdog mentality. Coach was talking about how y'all deserved a little more
respect. What was y'all's thoughts going into the game last night when you see
experts picking Washington? What was y'all's thoughts? How do you feel like
you guys have thrived under that?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I believe we were the higher seed, so we believed we
should win. I believe with Coach Schaefer that we don't get the respect that
we should. We've worked so hard to be here. I don't think we get the credit we
deserve sometimes. We've beaten a lot of great teams already this year. We're
going to try to beat another great team on Sunday.  
  
Q. Dom, anything different about this year's training and conditioning
program? Why has it been so successful?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: We have a new strength coach this year, Coach Harvey. I
think he's practically pushed us to our limits, past our limits. I think he
gets the best out of us. He knows us. He's very personable with us. I think he
knows how to get everything out of us.  
  
He's really just been great with us this year. Our practices, like Coach
Schaefer said yesterday, we're not sitting around every eight, ten minutes
getting water. Our infrastructures are very fast-paced. Play a game every day.
It's called Bulldog. We play multiple times a day. It's a really fast-paced
game. If you're not in shape, you're not going to be able to play.  
  
Practice really helps with our conditioning.  
  
Q. Teaira, have you ever gone against anybody else that's 6'7 " like you
are? How do you see that matchup unfolding tomorrow?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I don't think I have. Well, I played against Kalani in AAU one
summer. That's the last time I played against her. That's probably the last
time.  
  
But Asia, I played against Asia. She's kind of my size.  
  
I think it's just going to be size going against size. It's going to be a
great matchup.  
  
Q. Breanna, defensive theme. What is the challenge for the threes and
the fours to try to negate some of the size that Baylor is going to bring?  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: I think for us, the main thing is a high-level matchup.
With us to help Teaira and the bigs out, we just denying the high post. We
might give her a couple of shots. Other than that, we're defending her off the
bounce. We deny high/low, it should shut most of their stuff down.  
  
Q. Teaira, was Baylor part of your recruiting process at all? Who was it
for you, Mississippi State and other finalists?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Baylor recruited me a lot in high school. Like, they were on
me hard. I had to look at how many bigs they had, like, what all was said
there.  
  
I just came to where I thought I would be best fit and could contribute to the
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you return to the locker room. Have a good
practice, and good luck. We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Victoria Vivians' stats for the season. The thought
process behind her not being a starter at this point in the season, how that
works for you. Looks like it is working for you.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, it's not just her. We've shuffled our lineup here in the
NCAA tournament a little bit. I think it's really worked well for us. We've
had some kids step up. We actually rolled four new starters out in our
regional.  
  
Morgan was the only one that remained. Teaira was the sixth Player of the Year
coming off the bench in the Southeastern Conference. I've been starting
Roshunda Johnson, Blair Schaefer, and Ketara Chapel at two, three and four.
Been bringing Victoria and Dom and Bre off the bench.  
  
The switch with Teaira and Chinwe really was Chinwe has been getting in foul
trouble early. I thought maybe she would relax a little bit coming off the
bench. Teaira has earned the right to start. She's had a heck of a year.  
  
I didn't want to put her in the starting lineup in the middle of conference
'cause, number one, it was working. Number two, I wanted her to be the sixth
Player of the Year in the league. That was a goal for her. About halfway
through the year, she deserved to start. She never said anything, but you want
to be honest with your kids. I was honest with her. I said, Hey, you're
outplaying Chi right now. Let's keep it the way it is. Go win the sixth Player
of the Year award. She kind of lit up. That was kind of a goal for her.  
  
For young kids, sometimes that's what they need. They need a vision. They need
someone to point 'em in the right direction. She went and got it.  
  
These other three, it's just been something that's worked. Who is to say that
is going to be what we'll be tomorrow. The unknown has kind of worked for us
the last couple weeks. I'm not going to change the unknown right now.  
  
Q. With all the talk about Baylor's size, I'm not sure if it gets lost
in the shuffle, but one player who is not talked about as much is Nina Davis.
She was conference Player of the Year. What kind of challenge does she present
when she's not the focal point of a team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I can tell you, we talked at length morning about Nina Davis.
I'm very familiar with her, her accomplishments.  
  
We're having to deal with a great team that has size. I think that's the best
way we can do it. I think y'all picked the size piece this morning. We
addressed it.  
  
As for the coach, Baylor's a great basketball team. Tremendous leadership at
point. Big, long two guard that can rise up and shoot it over the top of you.
Athleticism everywhere.  
  
But size and strength certainly stands out. Again, when you're sitting there
press row last night, at one point they rolled out 6'7", 6'5", like we have,
but we don't play ours together. They do. Then they had Nina Davis at the
three.  
  
Really obviously a tremendous basketball team that's highly skilled, well
coached. There's a reason why they're a No. 1 seed. Been in the top four all
year.  
  
That being said, in film this morning, it wasn't about size, it was about
everything. There's probably not enough time in the day to deal with all that.  
  
Q. Coach, your daughter averages five points for the season, but is
averaging 16 in the NCAA tournament. What has clicked?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, Coach is playing her a little bit more. That's probably
helped a little bit.  
  
You know, I think for her, it's just -- she has seized the moment. I watch her
and Roshunda every day. They have great chemistry together, playing together,
in that game we call Bulldog. When I insert both those kids in the starting
lineup, I've been looking at that all year long.  
  
Again, the media is caught up in who is out there when we're jumping center.
I'm caught up with who is out there during the course of a ballgame, who is on
the floor when it's really important, compared to when there's 20 minutes in
the first quarter, 10 minutes in the first quarter.  
  
For her, again, she's prepared all her life for this moment. There's no moment
too big for her. She's shooting the ball well. If y'all want to start trying
to figure things out, figure out that this time of year, it's about getting
hot.  
  
I got 13 players, really good players. Some of 'em are hot right now. It's my
job to play those that are hot. She's making shots. She took a couple bad
shots last night, but it's 'cause she's trying.  
  
Nobody wants to win more than her. She's a competitor. She's tough. Step in
front of a freight train and take a charge. She's my best help-side defender.
Brings a lot to the table. Probably best thing she does is she sets good
screens. If anybody is paying attention to what she does, she is a hell of a
screener. Tough.  
  
There's a lot of reasons to play her right now. Again, I think it's a kid
coming of age, maturing. Even though physically she might not look as imposing
as some others, she's smart. She's always a half a step ahead in her brain, in
her mind. That's what you got to be when you're only 5'6" playing at this
level. You better have something else going for you.  
  
Right now she's got a pretty good shot and she's smart.  
  
Q. Vic, back to what I asked about the underdog mentality. Is that
something that you harp on with some of these players? Morgan might not be
bigger than some of the girls she's up against. Jazz talked about the other
day she has a chip on her shoulder. Is that something you harp on with this
group, that not many people expect them to go as far as they've made it?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, not really, to be honest with you. I was a little
disappointed last night. I think everybody in the room got my message. We
finished second in the Southeastern Conference and played for two SEC
Championships. I think the lack of respect I feel like our team got, it's also
kind of a slap in the face on our league.  
  
Our league is a monster of a league, as y'all know that's covered us. It's
more of standing up for my league, standing up for the second-place team in
our league, a team that played for two SEC Championships within a week, has
played for three SEC Championships in the last two years.  
  
Sometimes these people that are picking people, they hadn't seen us play. They
don't know anything about our kids. They don't know anything about what we do
or how we do it.  
  
What's important to me is what's in our locker room. It's not what you do, but
how you do it that separates yourself from the rest of the country.  
  
I don't really talk to these kids about that. I think, you know, kids, they're
all about social media. I don't have to tell them too many things that they
don't already know. I think they saw it before I did, to be honest with you.
Somebody had to tell me who picked who. I could give a rat's you know what.
Doesn't matter to me.  
  
I'm just going to get these kids ready. You tell me who we're playing, when
and where, we're going to be there. That's how I feel about it.  
  
I think throughout the course of our season, it prepares us. You better have
that kind of mentality, because if you don't, you'll never get to this point,
dealing with the monsters we got to deal with in our league. I mean, it's just
a heck of a league.  
  
So anyway.  
  
Q. Vic, in building this program as quickly as you have, obviously your
need to recruit talent, but what were you looking for? What made you say, This
is a girl I need to get? What kind of qualities?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, again, I think if you see us play, we talk about being a
tough, physical, aggressive basketball team. That doesn't say anything about
your jump shot.  
  
Two kids transformed our team in a really short period of time. Let me back
up.  
  
The senior class that I have is the all-time winningest class in the history
of the program. They'll go down as the four best players to ever play there.
Dominique Dillingham and Savannah Carter, a junior college kid, I recruited
those kids not because of their jump shot, I recruited them because of their
toughness and their competitive spirit.  
  
The little team that I inherited when I got there in 2012, it's what we were
missing. That first year, when we went 13-17, I knew that was coming down the
pike. We didn't recruit anybody. When we took the job in April, we didn't add
anybody to the team. We took those kids that we inherited, we coached them
just as hard and just as tough that we're coaching these kids.  
  
Those kids made a commitment to change. I give those kids a lot of credit. But
when we were recruiting, we had to recruit the competitive spirit. We had to
recruit a toughness, because we just didn't have any.  
  
Again, to survive in our league at this level, you better have some toughness
to you. You better be competitive. If you're not competitive, you got no
chance. You'll be gobbled up and spit out. It's just the way it is.  
  
So that was a piece we had to have. Those two kids changed practices. They
brought it every day. So then, with those two kids, that whole first class
with Bre and Ketara added to it, Chinwe, they kind of transformed what it
looks like today. But the next class was the same way: tough, physical,
aggressive, but skilled.  
  
Remember, that was a top-20 class with Victoria, Blair, Morgan. That was a
real competitive class that had a skill set. Then every class after that I
think has had both.  
  
Again, if you're going to live at this level, you've got to recruit, not only
tough, physical, aggressive kids, but they have to have a skill set. You can't
function one-dimensional. We got too many good coaches. They'll just take that
away, then you'll be miserable because you can't do anything.  
  
I think that's the piece that we've been able to do at Mississippi State and
kind of change our program.  
  
Q. Coach, this game called Bulldog keeps coming up. How does it work?  
COACH SCHAEFER: So there's 24 seconds on the shot clock. You play for four
minutes. There's 24 seconds on the shot clock. We don't call a lot of fouls,
except for the obvious.  
  
Whenever you score, you're trying to score as fast as you can. Whatever's on
the shot clock, that's how many points you get. So if you get an offensive
board and a stick-back, you might get 23 points, okay? If the other team
scores, you get it in, streak down the floor and score with 18 seconds, you
get 18 points.  
  
That's the game that we're playing. I mean, we're pressing. Both teams are
pressing. We're picking up full court. It's one of these (indicating back and
forth).  
  
Just like last night, we get down 7 in the first half, but these kids have
been down 77 in Bulldog and come back to win.  
  
What you guys haven't seen, what I'm telling you, we have a maroon and gray
team. The gray team, by the way, has been starting lately. The gray team has
been beating the maroon team for about two weeks, more often than not.  
  
Everybody in the media wants to know, Gosh, how do you all of a sudden flip
the switch, play these kids? I've been watching them kick their butt for two
weeks. At some point, you know what, they've earned the right.  
  
So that's the piece that you don't see. But that's, in essence, the game of
Bulldog. You're trying to score as fast and as quick as you can, get up and
down, really have a fast-paced tempo.  
  
I think you saw last night in the second and fourth quarter, tempo, we got
down, tempo got sped up. We started playing good. We start doing some good
things.  
  
Q. Vic, depth and conditioning have been a big reason why you're here.
Baylor is very similar in that regard. Got me thinking about, what has been
Anthony's role? Why did you go with him? He has had a lot of credentials. What
has he implemented that's been different this year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: It's the first strength coach we've been able to hire strictly
for women's basketball at Mississippi State. Obviously he came from the NBA,
worked for the Detroit Pistons. Had been with the Orlando Magic. He had some
experience at a pretty high level.  
  
He really wanted the job. He wanted to get back into college athletics. Took a
pay cut to get into college athletics. That says volumes about him personally,
his involvement, his investment in our program.  
  
He's a stickler. He wants the kids to send him pictures of what they're
eating. He's on 'em when he knows they're not eating right. Which, you know
what, our kids don't eat right. I wish I could sit up here and brag about how
good they eat. But they're kids. They like to eat junk. They like to eat fast
food.  
  
You know what, 10 to 15 years ago, I'd have probably been right there with him
complaining. But at the end of the day, as I get older, I've kind of -- our
football coach at Mississippi State, pregame meal for our football team, he
doesn't care what they eat as long as they eat. If they want burgers, give
them burgers. If they want wings, give 'em wings.  
  
You know what, if you're going to put a piece of grilled chicken in front of
somebody and a dry baked potato and green beans and they look at it and go,
Huh-uh, I'd rather them eat the burger and fries. If the kid doesn't want it,
they're not going to eat it.  
  
I've changed. I'm proud of myself. 20 years ago I'd have been shoving that dry
chicken in front of them and making them eat that. I think that's good. I
think you've got to adapt to kids.  
  
He's been good in that regard. You know, he pays attention. It's been good.  
  
I think what they probably would tell you, too, is our practices, even though
we're really intense and go really hard, we probably aren't going as long as I
have in the past.  
  
Again, maybe that's me getting a little older and a little wiser, I don't
know. Maybe that's me getting soft. That's how I feel about it. At the end of
the day we're 32-4. Maybe I need to soften up.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a chance to visit with one of your former players last
night. She said you have made an impact in her life; that she would not be
where she is today. To get a chance to visit with someone like that from more
than 25 years, what does that say about the journey that you've been on, even
though you might have grown a little soft, that you've still made an
impression on someone from that far back?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, it was really special to see Jennifer here. Y'all don't
know this, but in 1990, when I got my first head coaching job at Sam Houston
State, I'd never been a women's coach. I had coached women's tennis at Milby
High School in Houston, Texas. That was the extent of my experience coaching
women. I'd been a freshmen boys high school coach. Coached the first ninth
grade boys team that ever went to campus in HISD at Milby. Had been an
assistant at Sam Houston State from '87 to '89, then went back to Milby as the
freshman boys coach.  
  
In 1990 when I got the job at Sam Houston State, there were three kids on the
team, I didn't have the first contact or know where to find the first
basketball player. I recruited Jennifer out of the newspaper. She was All-
Greater Houston, in Houston, Texas. That's where I found her name.  
  
To see her at the game last night, to know she just got on an airplane with
her son and flew up here to watch us play. She stopped by Starkville four
years ago. She was in the area working. But that's pretty special.  
  
Back then, y'all, I was a young guy that was pretty naïve, too, to what I was
doing, in understanding the importance of what I was doing. I probably wasn't
the easiest guy to play for.  
  
I give her a lot of credit. I give all those kids a lot of credit. I'm a lot
different today, have a much greater appreciation for where I am, what I'm
doing, who I'm doing it with.  
  
You know, Jennifer, for her to say that, that's awfully kind. She's pretty
successful. I'm proud of her for that, so... Thanks for bringing that up. I'll
try to get out of here without crying.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let you go at any time.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't have practice till 12. Anybody got anything else?  
  
Q. Coach, historically the best players in the state of Mississippi went
out of state for their college basketball careers. How have you been able to
change that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, I think the thing that most impresses me about our
state is we have so many good people, good families. It's a down-to-earth,
hard-working state.  
  
I think those kids and their families realize, they don't have to go somewhere
else to play top-10 basketball. They can come right to Mississippi State. They
know their kids are going to be well taken care of. They could put their head
on a pillow at night, close their eyes, go, Coach Schaefer and his staff are
going to take good care of my baby. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter
how old those girls get, they're always going to be somebody's baby.  
  
I have a tremendous staff. We take great pride in making sure we are taking
good care of these kids. It's not just about basketball. My staff is the best.
I have great role models for these young ladies. When they come down the hall
every day, sign my door, which they have to, outside of basketball, I want to
see them outside of a practice uniform.  
  
When they come sign my door every day, they have to walk by three full-time
assistant coaches' doors. They get to see firsthand what a professional looks
like, how they act, how they talk on the phone, how they dress. These are
things to me that are very important in today's world. They're a great role
model for our young ladies.  
  
So I think that's what it is. I think we've done a good job of closing the
borders and keeping those kids at State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go now.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Baylor. We'll go straight to questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, can you talk about how the offense has evolved, is different
from last season, how you guys have broken up the shot disparities, because
the numbers of shots everybody is taking is different from last season.  
NINA DAVIS: We're a team with a lot of talent. We have a lot of depth. We can
score at every position one through five. We share the ball well. As you can
see, we have a good assist-to-turnover ratio. We're just a team that know how
to play together.  
  
We get out and run. We take great shots. We kind of go from the inside-out. We
have perimeter players that can knock down the three. We have bigs that can
pound it on the inside.  
  
Q. Kalani, what are your initial impressions of Teaira McCowan?  
KALANI BROWN: Big, strong. Big in the post. Got to block her out and do my
work early or get punished. You can't get deep. Just do my work early, run the
floor hard.  
  
Q. Alexis Jones, you're working your way back in. How are you feeling
going into this game tomorrow night?  
ALEXIS JONES: We're excited. We're back at the Elite 8 again. It's our last
year for me, Nina, Prince and Kay-Kay. I'm excited. I'm ready to go.  
  
I think everybody on the team is ready to go, excited to take on for the Elite
8 tomorrow.  
  
Q. Nina, how would you describe your role on this team?  
NINA DAVIS: Whatever the team needs me to be. Whether that's to get the
rebounds, to score, to play defense, to push the ball in transition. Really
just being the overall team player, just helping them in any way they need at
that time.  
  
Q. Kristy, you guys showed signs of this team last year, having so many
weapons. It's really gelled this year. Can you talk about from a guard's
perspective what it's like, how many different weapons you have, the different
ways that you guys can play depending who is out on the court for you guys.  
KRISTY WALLACE: It's great because we can score from any position. We can
share the ball. As Nina said, we work it from the inside-out. We have people
that can hit the three, bigs that can, you know, battle inside and score the
ball.  
  
So it's great having a team that's really gelled. It's the right kind of time
to be doing it, too. It's good to play with.  
  
Q. For all the players. What would a win tomorrow night and a trip to
the Final Four mean to you?  
ALEXIS JONES: It would mean we made it to the Final Four (laughter).  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, it would be a huge deal. It's a goal that me and the
team have had for a while now. We've made that Elite 8. I've made it twice. I
know Nina has made it three times, Prince has made it three times.  
  
NINA DAVIS: It's no secret what our goal has been all four years I've been in
college. We've been granted another opportunity. Of course, we'll be thrilled
and excited to finally get over the hump and get to the Final Four.  
  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It would mean a lot to finally get over that hump, see how we
play once we get there.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I know how much it means to Coach and our seniors. It means it's
that much important to me that we get our seniors to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Alexis Jones, how important is it for you to start out quickly?  
ALEXIS JONES: I think it's important for us to start out maybe not necessarily
quickly, but it's important for us to start out strong. It's important for us
to start out with energy. It's important to start out and let them know that
we came to play, to let them know we're going to come to play defense, we're
going to rebound, we're going to do all the dirty work; that we ready to play
this game.  
  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, I think it's important for us to set the tone early, not
only for the other team, but for us, to give us confidence. Starting out on
our defense to help get our offense going.  
  
Q. Alexis Prince, can you talk about how your game has evolved from last
season to become as big of a contributor as you have been this season.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, I feel like I'm being more aggressive, just more healthy,
able to move more, play defense better, just contribute any way I can.  
  
Q. Kristy, I saw it looked like your little sisters were here holding up
a sign last night. You're here from Australia. What is it like to have them
make this big trip? How long will they be here?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, it's very exciting. I'm so thankful and blessed to have
the support I have, a family that made the effort to come see me play, which
is really exciting.  
  
They're going to be here till it's like April 6th, I think it was. They'll be
here for a little while, yeah.  
  
Q. Kalani, you have gone against McCowan, you're familiar with her. What
are the challenges when you're facing somebody who is as big as you as opposed
to maybe somebody who is trying to guard you a different way? What is that
like? Probably doesn't happen that often.  
KALANI BROWN: It doesn't. Worry about a double-team. You may not have to worry
about it. But definitely getting my shot over her length is probably going to
be the biggest challenge.  
  
Q. Kristy, going back to the guy from Seton Hall, a long time ago, Patty
Mills, how did basketball become so big in Australia?  
KRISTY WALLACE: I don't think it's as big for women's basketball back home in
Australia. It's kind of grown over the last few years a little bit.  
  
But, yeah, it's such a big difference from playing in Australia to playing
college basketball. The fans, the media, the gear you get is incredible.  
  
I'm so thankful and blessed to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Nina, one of the things Mississippi State does, they're sort of
comparing you to South Carolina in terms of personnel, a team that they've
played three times. Is there anybody you have played that reminds you of
Mississippi State?  
NINA DAVIS: I can't say that we have. I'm probably wrong, but off the top of
my head, I really can't remember.  
  
Mississippi State is a great team. They have great guards. You have Vivians
that is a great player. She puts up a lot of shots. She can shoot it from
deep.  
  
You have Dillingham that can come off, a great offensive player with midrange.  
  
They also have a post presence.  
  
It's definitely going to be a good game, a good challenge, we're going to have
to come out ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go back to the locker room. We'll take
questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how the kids have bought in, if there's
necessarily been a buy-in, to sharing the basketball as much as you have this
season, if you think that's a good way to describe what you do offensively?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I've never had a problem with kids sharing the ball. My
biggest challenge as a coach this year was this much talent, this much depth,
to make sure I have the right people on the floor at the right time,
combinations on the floor.  
  
Look, I can only start five. I've got more than that that can start. You know,
that's been my challenge as a coach.  
  
I just think we're hitting on all cylinders right now. We knew we had the
depth, but the depth sometimes wasn't producing on a consistent basis. You'd
have one kid that would have a great night, and the next game you wouldn't
hear from them.  
  
I think right now, if you've seen our three games in the playoffs, they're all
hitting on all cylinders. You hope you can extend that.  
  
Q. Coach, they've done something different in the tournament than during
the regular season in terms of the starters, how Vivians and the other three
that started for most of the season haven't started. Does that change anything
in terms of preparing for them?  
COACH MULKEY: Why are they making those changes, you'd have to ask them. Is
that a chemistry problem? Is that a who's playing better problem? I don't
know.  
  
It doesn't change anything for us. We've got to guard 10 players because even
when the other guys were in the starting lineup, he was playing those same
players.  
  
It's just a group is starting now that wasn't starting. In fact, I think he's
starting kids now that didn't start an SEC game at all. So he's very confident
in his team.  
  
Q. A lot of times when you're talking about a team that's big and has
depth at the inside positions, you're not necessarily talking about a team
that pushes the ball, is averaging 90 points a game. How are you able to
balance those things, have that size, but push the tempo the way you do?  
COACH MULKEY: We run. From day one, in recruiting, you know, this is a game of
entertainment. We're going to run.  
  
Now, that doesn't mean games aren't won and lost in the halfcourt when you get
down to crunch time. But our posts are going to run foul line to foul line.
They know that.  
  
I think Kalani Brown is a great example. Her freshman year she was bigger and
slower, softer. Now you look at her, and she's just a different player.
Beatrice runs well anyway. Cox runs well anyway.  
  
We like to push it and run. We've got enough depth that when you get tired,
we'll give you a break.  
  
Q. With this being one of the best senior classes in program history,
how much of a responsibility do you feel as a coach to get these players past
the Elite 8, into the Final Four, and a hopeful national championship?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I don't feel responsible at all. I'm not going to make the
first pass, shoot the first bucket or dribble. All I can do is help them
develop as players, show them the film, show them what I think will work. It's
their job to go do it.  
  
I think when they came to Baylor, they wanted to get to a Final Four. I think
anybody that comes to Baylor wants to get to a Final Four. We've set the bar
that high.  
  
But if they don't make it, I think there are a lot of kids, a lot of programs,
that would love to change places with four Elite 8s.  
  
Q. With Jones being out for the time she was, how would you assess the
way she has gotten herself back into a groove coming off the bench as opposed
to starting?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she's in there quickly. Like I said, I can't start but
five. I could start her the next game.  
  
She has an extremely high tolerance of pain. The injury was a bone bruise.
They tell me that's just a matter of time, what your tolerance of pain is. I
don't see her as being a liability out there at all.  
  
Certainly going to need her for ball handling tomorrow, with the pressure that
Mississippi State brings. Kristy is good, but Kristy is going to need a
breather every now and then.  
  
It helps us against a team like Mississippi State to have her back.  
  
Q. Mississippi State's first trip to the Elite 8. In your mind, what
does it take to build a successful program? What have you seen from Vic
Schaefer, what he's done, to build them up?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you have to have a commitment from your administration
first, then you have to have a great staff that's not out looking for a job
every day, that wants to stay and help you build it. Then you have to go get
players.  
  
When we built it at Baylor, we weren't necessarily able to get in the doors of
the blue-chip recruits. We had to go build it with kids that were I don't want
to say second tier, but they weren't the tops on the big-time programs list.
We built with those kids. That's how we built it at Baylor.  
  
I think Vic does have better players than I had within my five years because
he's got a McDonald's All-American in the paint in McCowan, Vivians. He's got
a heck of a lot more talent than I had in my first five years.  
  
Q. You went against his defenses when he was an assistant at Texas A &M.
What are the things most specifically that are difficult to go against with
Vic Schaefer defensive teams?  
COACH MULKEY: You're going to see pressure everywhere. Just handle the
pressure, realize there's not going to be an easy pass. You're going to have
to work to get open. You're going to have to work for everything you get.
They're going to guard you.  
  
You know, just prepare for that. I think we're going to guard them, too.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer is coaching his daughter Blair right now. You had
experience coaching your daughter. What was that like for you? How has your
relationship with her grown now that she's on your staff?  
COACH MULKEY: He's probably a lot smarter than I was. He's playing his
daughter earlier than I played mine. I kind of made her suffer a little bit
more because you tend to be a little bit harder on your own kids.  
  
It's good to see. I wish there were more, you know, fathers, mothers coaching
their kids. Tricia at Quinnipiac -- is that how you say it? -- I'll never
forget a communication I got from her when I was coaching my daughter, because
her daughter was getting ready to go into her program. The words she said to
me, to see the success her team is having, it just touches my heart.  
  
I just have a special place in my heart for coaches who can coach their own
kids, do it fairly, and win. He's doing that with his child.  
  
Q. Does this team remind you of anyone that you have faced this season,
similarities?  
COACH MULKEY: No. Just their defense is different than anything we've seen.
Now, we've seen size. I mean, Oklahoma has Mulkey at 6'9". We've seen the
height, I should say. She's not built like Teaira.  
  
Beatrice played against Big T. Kalani has, Cox. They've all played against
each other during the summer.  
  
On the perimeter, I can't think of anybody that just really stresses defensive
pressure like that. Other teams I've had, obviously when we played A&M, but
I'm not sure any of these kids, you know, have played against A&M.  
  
Q. Dealing with the combinations, trying to figure out the right combos
to throw at certain times, is it a gut instinct? How do you go about with so
many talented players to figure out the right moment for the right
combination?  
COACH MULKEY: There is no perfect answer. It's just the flow of the game, the
feel of the game, what's working, what's not working. Give that kid a chance,
foul trouble. It's all of that.  
  
There's no plan that I have going into a game where, Okay, at this minute,
when we get to this minute mark, we're going to put this one in. It's just a
feel for the game. Sometimes you make the right decisions, and sometimes you
don't.  
  
Q. We've seen some fire in the belly from Kristy. Does she remind you
personality-wise on the court of yourself? Has she carried that onto the
court?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Kristy does have that fire in her belly. I think that
may be close to what I used to play with. But Kristy needs to have more of a
confidence within; that it's okay to point your finger, it's okay to tell them
where to go.  
  
I think she's become better at that. It's difficult when you have four
seniors, you have All-Americans around you. I think she's had to grow into
that role. If you'll remember, last year, she was our off guard. She's really
kind of in a new position, but a comfortable position, because that's what she
plays back home.  
  
Q. Vivians has had some struggles in terms of shooting, but she's also
the kind of player that can take over a game shooting-wise. What are some of
the challenges when she's playing well?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, not that we have seen in our league, because we see a lot
of great perimeter shooters in our league. When they get on a roll, you just
have to figure out a way to stop it. Either deny them the ball or, you know,
take away their dominant hand.  
  
You can't let them just get comfortable. Change your defense maybe. But, yeah,
she's a tremendous player.  
  
Q. For the seniors that this is their last chance to get to a Final
Four, how do you make sure that pressure doesn't get too big?  
COACH MULKEY: We're not the kind of team that gets all nutted up. That's just
not who we are. We're all business. We go over detailed scouting reports. We
give them a game plan. We make sure they're prepared.  
  
I just never left the floor where I felt like we've lost a game because -
what's the word - we choked or nutted up.  
  
When we've gotten beat even in the worst upsets, we got beat by a team that
played darn good and played better. Whoever wins tomorrow, two good teams.
Whoever plays the best is going to win. Whoever makes plays is going to win.  
  
At this stage, got some good coaches and some good teams left. A little
wrinkle here or there, a little execution here and there, is usually the
difference between the ballgames.  
  
Q. Kim, earlier this month your comments were what kind of grabbed the
headlines after Senior Day. Do you feel like the attention has turned back to
your team, especially with the way they've been playing through the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll see you tomorrow night.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 97, Louisville - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Louisville. Coach, your thoughts about
tonight's game.  
  
COACH WALZ: Well, first off, I'd like to congratulate Baylor on a very well-
played game, and thank everyone with the support staff, everyone involved with
the NCAA. It's been a wonderful experience for not only myself but our entire
program, these young women sitting next to me here, our support staff,
everyone that's been involved with it from the University of Louisville. I
just definitely would like to thank the NCAA.  
  
Then on to the game. They played well. Unfortunately, we did not. We did not
put up a performance that even resembled anything that I had seen from our
ballclub the last month.  
  
You know, we knew coming into it that we were going to have to play very well
and really do a lot of things in the post to try to give some post help.
Unfortunately, we just did not respond very well.  
  
The first play of the game, we got them to take the shot that we wanted to
take. They miss it. Then we don't follow through with the box-out. It turns
into a layup.  
  
When you're playing a team with the talent of Baylor, the depth of Baylor, you
have to be able to finish out plays. Unfortunately for us, we did not.  
  
I thought we actually took care of the ball decent. But the problem is, you
know, every time we turned it over, it led to a point. It's a staggering stat,
when you look at it. They have 21 points off our turnovers, and we only turned
it over 12 times. Every turnover led to a point, a basket. It's unacceptable.  
  
We've been talking, if we're going to turn the ball over, we need dead-ball
turnovers, we need to throw it into the stands, hold onto it, but they can't
lead to baskets. They led to 21 points.  
  
Unfortunately it's definitely not the way we wanted to end this season, in
this fashion. I'm proud of the young women that I coach. They've worked their
tails off. They've had a great season.  
  
We're looking forward to getting back in the gym and start working for next
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes or Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, it seemed like in the beginning your shots weren't really
falling. You started to get into a rhythm as the game went on. The team
overall didn't really. What do you think it was that was keeping you from
getting started in the beginning? Was it the same thing that was hampering the
entire team throughout the game?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think, starting off in the first quarter, I mean, I started
off too hyped. As the game went on, I calmed down. We started to get a few
stops here and there, but we didn't shoot the ball too well.  
  
We just tried to make a few runs. They didn't get enough stops, so... That's
what really hurt us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, the second quarter was where you all made some adjustments to
what Baylor was doing. You made a run to close the gap just before halftime.
Talk about that.  
COACH WALZ: Well, we really didn't make any adjustments. We just actually
followed through with the game plan. We actually executed correctly and did
the right things, which we struggled with.  
  
We knew it coming into the game, that we had to be on point. Then, like Asia
said, we came up with some stops. We had some great rotations. Our effort was
really good.  
  
Went into halftime feeling good. I really felt good about things. I'm like,
Hey, it's a 12-point game, people. They had it at 18. We cut it down to 12. We
got to get a stop, score, stop. It led to a score, turnover, and-one, a 5-0
run.  
  
It was like, Golly, you went from 12 to 17 in a hurry.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you compare this Lady Bears team to the team you saw
in 2013? Do you think this team could potentially be better than that squad?  
COACH WALZ: I think they're deeper is what it is. I don't see anybody on the
team that's the caliber of Brittney Griner. I'm not sure there's going to be.
I think she's a once-in-a-lifetime player to come through. Odyssey Sims was
pretty darn good, too.  
  
I think once you get into five, six, seven and eight, I think five, six, seven
and eight on this year's ballclub, you have to guard 'em all. There's only one
or two kids that I thought on the roster, when they got into the game, we were
going to try to make 'em shoot and score.  
  
In '13, I thought they had four or five of them that we were going to
challenge. It makes it much more difficult when they can put five on the floor
that can score, four out of five most times can score.  
  
I think that's your difference, the fact that they're just deeper.  
  
Q. Myisha, did you feel like this game was at all comparable to any
other losses you had this season?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, because this is our last game. This is the last game
for the seniors. You're one-and-done if you lost this game.  
  
It hurts a lot because we knew we could have played a lot better, and we
didn't follow through with the game plan for the whole 40 minutes. We didn't
come up with stops when we needed to.  
  
You know, it just hurts a lot because we know we could have done a lot better
than what we did.  
  
Q. Jeff, you've had probably in your career a few of these undersized
kids, like Nina Davis. Seemed like today was the kind of game where her senior
leadership and the things she did made a big difference. Talk about how tough
a kid like that is.  
COACH WALZ: No, she played extremely well. She plays hard. She's crafty. She
knows how to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Then, you know, she fits what they're doing. She's a very important piece to
their puzzle. Kalani Brown -- I thought Beatrice played extremely well, Kalani
played well. They're able to throw so many big kids at you, they're big
bodies, but they're also talented.  
  
I tell people all the time, they always used to tell us, You got to go get a
big kid. I'm real excited about Kylee Shook and Ciera Johnson, what they're
going to be able to turn into. They're efficient right now.  
  
Kalani and Beatrice are very efficient. They score around the basket, which
then opens things up for Nina. I thought she does a great job of taking
advantage of that. She did it tonight.  
  
10-15 from the field...  
  
Q. Coach, I know you said yesterday that you wanted to force Baylor to
use players that they don't normally use to score. 34 bench points tonight.
Seemed like they kind of did do that. Is that what you envisioned?  
COACH WALZ: No. They really didn't do that at all. The ones that we knew could
score coming off the bench scored. We had a few of 'em that were shooting the
ball early that we wanted them to shoot, but we couldn't get the rebound. That
just eliminates everything you're trying to do.  
  
You know, the ones that we were going to want to shoot really shot it. But,
unfortunately, did not shoot it enough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season.  
  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 75, Washington - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Mississippi State. Coach, congratulations
on the win, and your thoughts about tonight's game.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you. I'm awfully proud of my kids tonight. They just
really played extremely well. I was so proud of what they were able to take in
three days from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Wasn't rocket science, but there were some little things in there we needed to
do a little differently and be concerned about I think more than anything.  
  
That's a heck of a basketball team. Mike, as I told y'all the day before
yesterday, he's a tremendous coach, one of the best. He's got an unbelievable
mind for the game. What he's done with Kelsey Plum is really incredible. I
mean, she's the best offensive player in the history of the game.  
  
I said it before. It was like playing against James Harden of the Rockets. You
got to really be careful about floor spacing. You got to really be careful
about allowing lanes to exist. Then you can't come off of those kids that can
stand out there and play HORSE and shoot it.  
  
Our kids were special today. No question about it. Dom came in and was
Dominique. She's one of the best in the country. It's a reason why she's been
on the all-defenses team in the Southeastern Conference two straight years.
Did really a tremendous job on Plum.  
  
I don't know when the last time she's been held to 10-25, or 40%, whatever it
was. We made her work for everything.  
  
I thought our press wore them down a little bit. Then Teaira, I jumped on her
back when we got in the locker room, because I felt like she was carrying us
most of the night. Offensively she was really special down the stretch. Had
that look in her eye, wanted the ball, got to her spots where she needs to get
to.  
  
Osahor was special tonight for them, as well. She's a problem. T had her hands
full with her on that end, as well.  
  
You know, you hold that team to 64 points, you're playing your guts out. It
ain't like we're standing around playing hope you miss your defense.  
  
I couldn't be prouder of our kids for their energy, their effort. We talk
about being connected, having chemistry on that end. That's the piece that
doesn't come early in a season. Your defensive cohesiveness and your
chemistry, it's not the first thing, it's the last thing.  
  
This group is really doing a good job right now. Again, I'm so, so proud of
'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach or the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Dominique, I think we were 7-11, then y'all held 'em to 3-15, went on
a run from there. What was the battle like between you and Plum? How did you
feel like the defense did once y'all were able to settle in?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Plum is just an amazing player. It was a great battle
all night long. My teammates helped me out a lot. We were able to switch a lot
of things, which helped me personally. My team just did a good job of sealing
up the line. We had umbrella defense. Everybody was there to help. It was just
a team effort, I think.  
  
Q. Teaira, what changed for you in the fourth quarter?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, during media, they told me, they said, T, you got to
dominate. Just taking that in, listening to my teammates, knowing I had to
step up, take my team, like, further, that's when I had the look in my eye
like, Nobody can stop you. You have to do what your teammates are asking you
to do.  
  
Q. Teaira, can you give me a one, two, three, 11 straight points, block
party where you have back-to-back, then taking high fives up in the stands?
Rank those things one, two, three.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I think the blocks would come first, then the points, then the
high fives. No, the high fives would come first, knowing my teammates are
proud of me, then the blocks, then the points.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you put in perspective what you saw? Teaira, you
watched her all season. She took over that third quarter. Can you talk about
what that did for the confidence of the rest of the team.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think she just put us on her back, honestly. Once she
got going, it's hard to stop her, honestly. She was running from transition,
so she was getting a lot of rebounds since nobody was there to block her out.  
  
Once she gets rebounding, no one is going to block her shot. It was an easy
bucket for her. She was getting the out and ones. She loves that turnaround
jump shot. When she gets those tips, she's money from that spot. When she's
scoring for us, I think that gives us all the confidence in the world because
we can go inside-out. It makes it that much easier for us guards.  
  
Q. Dominique, talk about the second quarter. It seemed to be where you
all as a team gathered yourselves. Coach talked about defense.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think we just finally decided we're going to lock down
on defense. I think it was all about playing together. It's not about one
person locking down one person, it's about the team locking down them.  
  
I think when we decided that we were going to guard together, not let them
have any easy looks, I think that's when it really started to click.  
  
I think their first four looks were threes, made threes. For the rest of the
game, I think they only made four.  
  
Just after we got them off the line, stopped them from making threes, we were
fine.  
  
Q. Coach, your take on that.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I wasn't real pleased with how we started the ballgame. I was
disappointed in our energy defensively. We had a major lapse on an out of
bounds play. We let the best player in the history of the game have a wide-
open three. Like she said, I mean, their first four made baskets are all
three-pointers. They're uncontested.  
  
It was really frustrating because that's a focal -- that's being focused. We
kind of were playing catch-up.  
  
The second and fourth quarters were special offensively. We obviously got some
things going on offense. You score 25 and 27 points in a quarter, you're doing
some good things offensively.  
  
I thought those quarters obviously were the big turning points in both the
first half and the second half.  
  
Q. Last year, couldn't get over the hump of the Sweet 16. You get to do
it this year. This is the first Elite 8 in school history. What does that
mean? A lot of records over the last few years. What does it mean to see your
team get over another hump, get another record?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, as you know, it's only been five short years that we've
been here. The last three obviously we've been in the NCAA tournament.  
  
To be in the Sweet 16 in your second go in the NCAAs is pretty special. This
is our third now in five years, and we're in the Elite 8.  
  
I've got a good team. I'm a little disappointed in the country right now that
we're not getting the respect that these kids deserve. It's disappointing.  
  
This is a heck of a team. We got a bunch of really good players. We've beaten
a bunch of really good people.  
  
You know, for me, I have so much pride in these girls 'cause I know how hard
they work. You stick your head in one of our practices, we ain't standing
around out there having water every 10 minutes, you know, getting a towel, all
that. I mean, they work their tails off. They pay the price.  
  
They're not getting a lot of credit right now. That's fine. You know what,
we'll fly under the radar the whole way if we have to. These kids work awfully
hard. We beat a heck of a team today.  
  
I'll say it again, Mike is a heck of a coach. Washington is obviously a
tremendous basketball team.  
  
We believed it. We never doubted that we couldn't do it. These kids went out
there and competed today and got it done.  
  
Elite 8, third trip to NCAAs in five years, it's pretty gratifying.  
  
Q. For the players. What does it mean for you to be part of the first
Elite 8 team? What was it like in the locker room after this game?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: In the locker room after the game, we were all just really
happy for each other. I feel like every game this year we've had different
people step up. It's really hard to guard a team who you just don't know who
to guard, honestly. That's what I feel like we have with our team. You don't
know who is going to go off, you don't know what they're going to do.  
  
I feel like we're really proud of each other. We're really proud we're working
so well together. We're happy to keep this journey going.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Like she said, we were really happy in the locker room.
Just happy because we know how hard we worked to get to this point. It's a
special moment for our team.  
  
But we're not done yet. Tomorrow, it's time to get to work and focus on the
next team we're playing.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: We're just earning the respect that we should get.  
  
Q. If I figured this right, Teaira had 16 consecutive points at the
start of that fourth quarter. Have you ever had one player in your coaching
career do something like that, score 16 points for you? Also, we talked in the
SEC tournament about her growth, how much she's grown even in this short
amount of time between then and now.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Right. I think maybe Tori has done it. I've emptied the
playbook on Tori before, when she's making everything she's looking at.  
  
Tonight we kind of emptied the playbook for T. We ran a lot of different
things to get her down there. But we wanted to get her to her spots, where
she's really comfortable. We flipped the sides of the floor midway through
that run, just to give them a different look.  
  
But, you know, T continues to grow. She's come so far, yet she's got so far to
go. Her upside is out of sight. I mean, the kid can be an All-American before
it's all said and done. She can dominate the game. As y'all saw tonight, she
dominated the game on both ends of the floor. She was interested in dominating
the game on both ends of the floor.  
  
When I can get that out of her, it changes the dynamic of our team. That's the
impact that the kid can have.  
  
Now, if we were all going to sit out here and air out our laundry, she would
tell you timeouts were not a lot of fun tonight, just because I was demanding.
That's because I know what the kid can do. We needed her to step up, but we
needed her to step up on both the defensive and offensive end. She'll tell you
that. Our conferences in the huddle were more about defense than offense. The
last thing I said coming out is what we were going to run, that would click,
okay, that's for me.  
  
The conversation in our huddle all night with Teaira was mostly about defense.
You saw the impact the kid can have in a ballgame on both ends. Not many kids
can do that. Not many players can have that kind of an impact like T can.  
  
She knows. I'm not backing off. I'm going to keep coaching her, loving her,
and demanding it of her.  
  
Q. Teaira, the battle against Chantel, she came in as the nation's
leading rebounder, does such a good job of putting herself between the basket
and the offensive player. What did you try to do to either get around her or
get position on her, especially in that stretch where you scored those 16
points?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: In practice, we work on boxing out. Long shots have long
rebounds. Just putting myself in the position to either box her out and not
let her get the ball, or neither one of us get it, and somebody else cleans it
up.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can, at which point in the season, either at home or on
the road, did the team show, in your eyes, as you talk about day after day
defensively, they looked like they were headed in the right direction?  
COACH SCHAEFER: They'll tell you I've never -- I've not seen it yet (smiling).
They'll tell you that I've told them at times they're one of the worst
defensive teams I've coached.  
  
It's just a level of expectation that I have. I know what's in 'em. You know,
she gets six blocks tonight. There's one little person right here going, Yes,
she could have been doing that all year. Why haven't you gotten that out of
her all year? It's just growth for her.  
  
I've told them at times, We just don't have it. We're just not that good
defensively. Yet I know, looking at the stats, what the points-per-game number
is, it's pretty good; what the turnovers caused is, it's pretty good; field
goal-percentage defense, it's pretty good.  
  
I just know what a good one looks like. I think they got it. We ain't got it
yet, but the good thing is the season isn't over.  
  
I'm still waiting. I'm going to coach them tomorrow, trying to get them to be
the best defensive team I can get them to be. I'm not giving up. We're not
status quo. We know that. We've worked all week on getting better. Every
minute we want to get one play better.  
  
It's a good question, though (smiling).  
  
Q. Teaira, we were talking about the fourth quarter. When was the last
time you felt like you were that dominant in a basketball game?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: A&M, when we played them at their place. About the same time
in the fourth quarter, I took over, too (laughter).  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: She had the game winner there. We took the lead. They got it
back. She made the game winner there down the stretch. We went to her quite a
bit down the stretch there. She was the difference.  
  
That would probably be the last time where she was that way. Then Florida at
home. She had 25 against Florida. Think she missed one shot all night. She was
11-12, or 12-13. Pretty dominant that night.  
  
The kid has it in her. No doubt about it. Tonight she was really, really
special. The challenge now is can I get that out of her back-to-back. I think
that will be the challenge tomorrow, then we'll come back Sunday, you know
what, we'll lay it on the line, see how it all turns out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the win. Get some rest. We'll see you
tomorrow.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord, go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 75, Washington - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Washington. Coach, your thoughts about
tonight's game.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Congratulations to Mississippi State. Been a tremendous team
all year long. Have really started to peak, even more so in the NCAA
tournament.  
  
We got their best effort tonight. I think it took that because our kids fought
and fought and fought, and never went away. Congratulations to those guys.  
  
Really proud of our team, not only what they've done this year, but what this
group has done for our program over the last four years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our coach or student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, when Dominique Dillingham came in the game in the second
quarter, what was she doing defensively? Also Victoria Vivians, what allowed
them to catch back up and take the lead?  
KELSEY PLUM: They're a very good defensive team. I thought Dillingham did a
great job on me. She just stayed down and just contested late on shots. She
blocked a couple of 'em, tipped a couple of 'em. Just made it difficult for
me.  
  
Credit to her for playing a great game. Their team, it was just congested in
the paint. They're very big, very athletic. Difficult to get my shot off.  
  
Q. Chantel, can you describe what it was like to go against 6'5 ", 6'7",
especially McCowan, what you tried to do to try to keep them away from the
basket?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I didn't do a very good job today. Something I take pride in,
she was the difference maker, McCowan was. She had 26-12. She had some big
baskets at the end. That was my fault.  
  
I just didn't box her out hard enough. But credit to her, she had a good game.  
  
Q. Coach, is Chantel being a little bit hard on herself?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Chantel is absolutely being hard on herself. But that's who
she is. I got her back. She played incredibly hard. McCowan is a tough
matchup, really tough matchup. She was very motivated. She got going, got
really confident, starting hitting some turnaround shots. We simply can't do
anything about that. She can't. None of us can.  
  
But that's who Chantel is. She has always been the consummate teammate, the
consummate dream player that you hope for as a coach.  
  
It's hard when it's the end of it. It's a matchup, again, that's just really,
really hard. Hard tonight.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just talk about your matchup tonight. Seems like in
conference play, every time you stepped out, had your hand on the ball, there
was somebody always in your face.  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, they did a great job. They shadowed me with the big player.
They switched plays, hedged screens. Credit to them. They had a great
defensive game plan. You know, I didn't make shots, just throughout the game,
which I usually do.  
  
They made it difficult on me. I mean, there's not much else to say. They just
played great defense.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I'm not sure if you're in the reflecting mood right now, but
the end of your college career. You put Washington basketball on the map, done
some incredible things here. Can you put into words at all what it's been like
for you, what your experience has been.  
KELSEY PLUM: (Tearing up.) I'm so grateful to have been able to go to the
University of Washington. You know, when I first came on campus, I had big
dreams, dreams for our program, dreams as an individual. A lot of 'em came
true.  
  
So for that, I'm very grateful. The university has been classy, just
supporting me throughout this entire thing. There's no way that I would have
been able to accomplish the things that I have academically, athletically,
build the relationships with my teammates. It's been one of the best decisions
of my life, not one of the easiest, but definitely one of the best.  
  
I'm really going to miss my teammates, just the people that I see every day.
You know, my coaches, some of the staff, I've really built a family there. So
it's going to be difficult saying good-bye.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Yeah, this team is my family. I wouldn't be here without them.
You know, it's hard now 'cause we lost.  
  
I've made sisters for life, you know. This girl right here will be in my life
forever. That's the most important thing, is the relationships.  
  
If that's what I leave with, I'm happy about that.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned about Mississippi State peaking at this time.
Did you gather that from film, especially for McCowan? She showed flashes of
it all season, but tonight it seemed like she raised her level.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: When you can do what Vic Schaefer did going into the NCAA
tournament, put four starters down, you got your team. They have responded.
The starters have played great. The subs have come in and did not do anything
but what they were doing when they were starters.  
  
Now you've got a team that's really, really deep. Look at the quarters. It's
20-9, 25-9. Those lineups...  
  
I think he knows his team as well as any coach right now in the country, to be
able to push that button, take that type of a risk.  
  
The way they played in their home pod, yeah, absolutely you saw it coming. We
were wondering all week whether or not the week off would have been, did they
change. When I saw the other lineup, the normal lineup they'd been using, I
thought they've just been getting better all week.  
  
I thought they played outstanding.  
  
Q. Mike, you watched these two come up. You did some special things. Can
you reflect at all, say what it's meant to you, what this ride has been
like.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I wouldn't be a basketball coach without these two kids,
period. I'd be probably back working at Blockbuster Video, if they still have
them, Netflix, something.  
  
You know, they believed in what we had started talking about when I was an
assistant coach. They believed all the way through and built. Taught me way
more about coaching than I've taught them about basketball. There's a lot of
nights I won't sleep because I feel like I've let them down.  
  
I'm going to be coaching a lot longer. You know, I've been coaching for 20
years, I'll still be talking about these guys. Haven't coached a game without
them. I don't know how you do.  
  
But they've made me so much better. They've said things to me I don't think
most players would feel comfortable saying to some coaches, but I listened.
I'll owe them any longevity that I have in this game, to these two guys, Katie
and Heather.  
  
Q. Coach, this particular season, was it a home game, a road game that
you saw in their eyes, not just in the staff's, or practice, that the team was
headed in the right direction? If it all came together, something special
might happen?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I think it was on the road at Notre Dame. We got punched in
the mouth in the first quarter. They stuck together. It was relatively early
in the year. It was in the pre-season NIT. We had a lot of returning pieces.
We had a lot of new pieces, too.  
  
To see our returning pieces get our new pieces set, that's when I knew we had
something special. I think we've got six losses, and they're to teams that are
all in this tournament. Unless Ohio State beat Notre Dame? Notre Dame won.
Every team we've lost to is still in this tournament. That's pretty good.  
  
We had 29 winners. We're not a result's-driven team. But to hear these guys
say the words, to talk about their teammates. These guys have -- Kelsey has
had a microphone and camera pointed in her face all year long. Chantel has,
too.  
  
They've missed some jump shots, turned the ball over some. But they have not
missed a question posed to them. They haven't put anything negative on social
media. All they've done is continued to help build the University of
Washington and their teammates up.  
  
I think that's their greatest accomplishment. The 98 wins, we'll all remember.
We'll probably have reunions for a long time with a group. Again, I challenged
them not to look at this on a timeline, like we all do now that we all have
Twitter and social media. We look at our timelines.  
  
If you look at a collective group of first-round NCAA tournament, a Sweet 16,
a Final Four. You don't put what years those are, it's a hell of a career.  
  
When you go to a place that hasn't been doing any of that when they called you
and offered you a scholarship, none of that, it wasn't even a consideration.
And to leave with those expectations, the standards in that locker room that
are so high, it should be written about for years and years and years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 97, Louisville - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. Coach, opening statement tonight?  
  
COACH MULKEY: No.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I tried. We'll go for questions for coach and student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, this looked like your kind of game, up and down, able to get
out in the open floor. How much fun was this for you tonight?  
NINA DAVIS: I mean, it was a lot of fun. We came out and got off to a quick
start, which is something we needed to do, something we've been focusing on.
We were getting out running, everybody was getting out on the fast breaks.
They were feeding me the ball. We like to push the ball and play up-tempo.  
  
Q. Nina, Jeff was in here talking about how efficient your game was
tonight, in particular the way you were able to play off of the two big
players in there. Talk about, was it a case of you were able to sort of pick
your spots in there tonight?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure. Coming into the game, we know they focus a lot on our
bigger-sized players. They try to double them. I try to release the pressure,
get into the open spots, cut to the basket when they're doubling them, just
try to make it as easy as possible.  
  
Q. Beatrice, earlier in the week it was said that in the game of
basketball you don't really know what to expect. Did you expect that kind of
game for you today?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: No. I just expected a tough game, going out there,
rebounding, helping my team, doing whatever I could do to help my team.  
  
Q. Kalani, y'all outscored them in the paint. What did you like about
your interior defense today?  
KALANI BROWN: We just took what the defense gave us. I was able to get some
passes to Nina. Nina was wide open. If they're collapsing on us, we just go to
the next option. I think that's what we did. Guarded shots, opened up the
paint a little bit so we could score.  
  
We offensive rebounded, got put-backs. Just did the dirty work today. It was
split between all posts. We all did well.  
  
Q. Kalani, in the first game, Teaira McCowan had 26 points. She's about
6'7 ". Talk about on Sunday you'll be facing another player your size, what
you will need to do to combat Mississippi State's inside game?  
KALANI BROWN: I've actually played her before, on the AAU circuit. She's a
big, strong post. If you let her bury you or get you deep, she'll punish you
in there.  
  
I've got to be smart on defense, keep my hands high, meet her, run the floor.
Just do what we've been doing, play our game. Also stay out of foul trouble,
as well.  
  
Q. Kim, it looked like you guys did a good job against Asia during the
first half. She got going a little bit in the second half. What did you do
during the first half to hold her down?  
COACH MULKEY: We hedged somewhat on the screens. I didn't think that they did
a lot of handoffs that we expected, that we've seen them on film do. Maybe
that's because we played good defense.  
  
I thought that every shot she took early was a contested shot. We didn't foul
her on any perimeter shots. I thought that every shot she took, I just wanted
a Baylor player to make it difficult.  
  
I think she got five points there at the end on some kids that don't get
significant minutes for us. Guys were on a roll. Just playing good basketball.  
  
As I said before the game, yeah, you should talk about our post players, but
you better not forget about those perimeter players. Those kids get
overlooked. They're hitting big-time shots. They're shooting unbelievable from
the three. It's because of the big guys that they're able to get those open
looks.  
  
Q. Kim, Nina has had to take a lot of different roles for you in the
four years. She's done that pretty selflessly. Not necessarily all players
would be able to do that. Talk about the attitude and everything that she's
brought.  
COACH MULKEY: Sure.  
  
Unfortunately, All-American teams are picked by people who never see kids
play. They might see them occasionally on TV.  
  
Nina Davis didn't have help around her for two years that she made all these
All-American teams. She had to do it every night. She had to take all the
shots. She had to get all the rebounds, play all the minutes.  
  
She just kept stopping at an Elite 8. Like all good programs, we wanted to get
help around her, to relieve some of that pressure.  
  
She's handled it like a trooper. She wants to get to a Final Four before her
career is over. You're right, selfish, huh? Parents that you see on TV today,
selfish players that you see on TV today. They want everything today.  
  
Yeah, well, this kid, all she wants today is a Final Four and a chance at a
national championship. Send me those kind of kids and I'll coach 'em anytime.  
  
Q. Kim, sort of a first impression of going against Mississippi State
with what you've seen of them.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Teaira McCowan, guys, lives in our backyard. Watched her
grow up. She's in the same class as these two kids.  
  
Unfortunately, you have to make decisions in recruiting. I'm proud and happy
for her because I've watched a young lady grow up really right before my eyes,
from the time she was a seventh grader.  
  
I'm familiar with Vic and his style of defense, because he was at A&M for so
many years with Gary Blair, and that's kind of what they did. They play in a
conference where they've seen the bigs before in South Carolina. They're big
themselves.  
  
It's going to make for a great Elite 8 game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations to you and the young ladies.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Get a little rest, and we'll see you tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Jeff Walz from Louisville. Welcome
and congratulations on a great season. Your thoughts on the tournament?  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you very much. First off, just want to thank everyone
involved here in the Oklahoma City region. We've had wonderful hospitality.
Everything has been first class, and very, very much appreciate that, and I
know our players are enjoying it so far.  
  
We're looking forward to a great basketball game tomorrow night. I think the
game before us is going to be fantastic, also. I think everyone that comes out
to watch this renal on is going to enjoy some very good basketball and have
the opportunity to see some great players. So we're just excited to be here
and looking forward to the opportunity to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. This has been set up as a battle as you guys having really strong
perimeter players and Baylor having a really good post game. Is that the case
or are there more nuances?  
JEFF WALZ: I think when you look at them on tape, they are very deep in post
play but they also have some very talented guards. So I think it's going to be
a basketball game where, you know, we're going to have to do a good job on
scouting report defense. We're going to have to try to make some players that
possibly don't score a bunch for them, score, and limit the ones that have
been their leading scorers.  
  
But the teams that, you know, allow them to just throw it down and low block
and score often have problems. So, you know, we're going to try to not allow
that to happen. But that's not an easy task.  
  
Q. You coached Lauren Cox and Beatrice Mompremier with USA Basketball.
How have you seen their games grow this season?  
JEFF WALZ: Both of them were a joy to work with. Just two great kids. They
worked extremely hard.  
  
You know, Bea has done a really nice job of developing her eight- to ten-foot
jumpshot. Very active around the glass. She's done a very, very good job for
them.  
  
Lauren, she's done great things all throughout her high school career, USA
Basketball. So it really has not surprise me to see her playing as well as she
is.  
  
Q. When you had the back-to-back losses against N.C. State, which was a
tough loss, real close loss, and then the one to Notre Dame, that could have
been a time when the kids lost their confidence but seemed like that didn't
happen. Can you talk about how you came back from that?  
JEFF WALZ: For us, we go into that N.C. State game and find out the day
before, Myisha is not going to play because she injured her knee at our talent
show that we have for our athletic department. She didn't show much talent at
the talent show in order to get injured. So she missed that ballgame.  
  
And then we turn right back around and go up and play on Big Monday at Notre
Dame, and she played a minute in that game, and then Briahanna Jackson goes
for about three and a half, four minutes and has to come out with back spasms.
We weren't really concerned about it, knowing we were playing without our
leading scorer. Briahanna brings so much to our team defensively. It's one of
those, you take it with a grain of salt and you move forward and I thought our
players did a very good job of that.  
  
Q. The 2013 game here against Baylor, what do you remember from the game
and what do you take away from it?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we scored one more point. You know, it's what it all comes
down to. And I said it, you know, four years ago: You have to be able to score
against Baylor. You know, everybody talked about, what this great job we did
defensively and all this. I think we gave up 81 points in that game, and they
averaged 81 points.  
  
So the way I look at it, and I said it four years ago: Our defense was
average, but we scored the most points anybody has ever scored against them
during the Brittany Griner era. So you have to figure out a way to put points
on the board and that's the same way with this ballclub right now. They have
so much size inside. Their guards are very good. Kristy Wallace does a
fantastic job of leading that team; that we are going to have to figure out a
way to score.  
  
I don't expect it to be a 61-58 basketball game.  
  
Q. I know the personnel is different and four years is almost a
lifetime, but does it make it sort of similar in that fact, them having the
dominant center, and you guys needing to score, does it make it similar in
terms of game plan and just the fact that your kids have been shooting the
ball pretty well in the first two rounds, kind of give you a lot of optimism
about that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we are not going to come out with the same approach that we
had four years ago. Our goal four years ago was to take 40 threes. We are not
going to look to do that right now. We have a very strong inside game, mid-
range game. Myisha Hines-Allen, Kylee Shook, Ciera Johnson; we have some kids
that can score on the low block, where four years ago, that really wasn't our
strength.  
  
You know, when you've got Antonita Slaughter, Shoni Schimmel, Jude Schimmel,
we had kids that could shoot the ball from the outside; Sara Hammond, that
could do it very well. So we went with what our strength was at that point in
time.  
  
Now, would we look to shoot it? Of course. But I wouldn't anticipate us to
take 30 to 35 threes; but we might.  
  
Q. You talked about Briahanna being out and what she brings. How much
growth have you seen in Mariya and Asia with BJ being out and their added
ball-handling responsibilities a lot while she couldn't play?  
JEFF WALZ: Asia has done a great job. She's really grown throughout this
entire year. You know, going back to her freshman year, she was really just
trying to deal with her off-season surgery that she had. She wasn't 100
percent. She was fine physically.  
  
Mentally, was her challenge. It was the first injury that she had really had
throughout her career, and it took her awhile. And now, she's finally back
playing like the kid that we had recruited out of high school. She's
confident; she's playing loose; she's playing free; she's making her teammates
better.  
  
When BJ went out, we just had to slide her over to the point guard spot and
she's handled those responsibilities well. I think the most impressive thing
to me has been how she's defending this entire season. That's one thing I told
her all last year: We didn't recruit her to guard people. And actually, she's
turned into one of our better perimeter defenders because she worked at it.  
  
And then Mariya, you know, she's shot the ball very well the past -- the first
two rounds, which is something we have to have. She's got to be able to knock
down open shots when she's open. I was excited for her; that she had been
struggling there for awhile come before the tournament started. But now she's
playing with some confidence. She passes the.  
  
Ball as well as any player that I've coached in my 22 years. Her court
awareness, her court vision, is the best of any player that I've coached. If
she will continue to work on her ball handling, where she gets more confident
with her ability to see the floor, and then her ability to shoot it, it makes
her an all-around player.  
  
Q. Last weekend, you said the past NCAA Tournament games you had, they
were bad. Why do you characterize them like that, and do you have more
confidence in this year's team to avoid playing those bad games?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I don't think said that the team had played bad -- Mariya, we
had talked about, she had struggled in her past NCAA Tournament games coming
up to this year. But she's really been playing well right now. She's shooting
the ball with confidence. And it's not just the shooting. She had nine
rebounds on Monday night. She passed the ball extremely well. She's back to
playing like we had seen her play for three regular seasons. So I'm really
excited for her.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that. Do you see this year's team as having any
similarities to any of the past teams who have gone on to the championship?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we have a group of kids right now that believe in what we're
doing, which is something that we've talked to them about, you know, this past
month, this past two months. The teams that we've had here that have had great
success, would buy into whatever we told them as a coaching staff.  
  
You know that, team in '13, we truly believed that we could beat Baylor, and
the kids came into that game with the belief and confidence. Now, no one else
out there thought we could.  
  
Then in 2009, everybody was like, who's this? And it's a group of kids that I
remember, we get sent down to LSU to play, and Western Kentucky had an open
spot, and they were hosting the first and second rounds; and we get shipped
all the way to LSU to play. I told the kids, I'm like, hey, if you get us past
the first two rounds, we'll get to the Final Four.  
  
And they all were like, okay. And they just believed in what we did. I'll
never forget Des Byrd, our starting point guard in 2009 after we beat LSU in
the second round, we are in the locker room celebrating, and she's like, "I
guess we're going to the Final Four, right?"  
  
I said, "Yeah. We sure are." And it's not what we do as coaches, because we
can't play. I've never made a shot. I've made one in my college career myself.
So it's not like I made a bunch of them.  
  
But the players having to out and execute, but it's our job to get them to
believe in what we're doing. And that's something that the teams that we've
had here in the past that have had great success, they believed in it and then
went out and did everything they could to execute it. That's one thing right
now, I think we are in a good place. They are excited.  
  
You know, we beat a Tennessee team on Monday night that very possibly could
have two of the Top-10 draft picks if the kids come out early on it; a team
that beat two No. 1 seeds, two No. 2 seeds. I mean, a really good basketball
team. We know that. And now we know we have a ballclub that we have to play
tomorrow night that has unbelievable talent, unbelievable depth.  
  
They are well coached and we are going to have to figure out a way to come out
here for 40 minutes and execute it and believe in what we're doing, and also
be able to withstand some runs. There's no doubt. I mean, this is a team that
can put up some points in a hurry. You can't be sloppy with the basketball.
We've talked to our players about that. I've told them, I said, if you're
going to turn the ball over, throw it up into the eighth row.  
  
So at least we can get set back up on defense and then make them score over us
instead of going by us.  
  
Q. Asia, Coach Walz was in here and talking about your commitment and
improvement on defense this year. How do you see yourself having developed in
that this season?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it starts from when I went home in May. Me and my
trainer spent so much time in that. Every single day, we worked on that. Just
to see it paying off now, I mean, it means a lot, because Coach Walz, he never
doubted me, as well, and neither did my teammates, as well. It's just trusting
the process.  
  
Q. You came in a little before Asia obviously. There's a lot of history
with this team in this city against Baylor. Cortnee Walton, the only
connection on the team left from that team that made the national title game
run in 2013. Have you looked to her, given that she's been in this situation
before against the same team in the same city?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, we always look to Cortnee for advice. It doesn't
matter who we are playing, we always look to her for advice because she's a
leader on this team. She's been through a lot, not -- like on the court and
off the court. So we always look to her for advice, whether it's basketball-
related or not. We've also talked to her about the Baylor game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you had to ask your own question, what would you ask?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Asia Durr, this one's for you. What would you do if
Russell Westbrook came to our game?  
  
ASIA DURR: Honestly, I know his favorite songs, and we would turn up to it.
Like 'Now I Do What I Want,' that is our song, and I think we could jam that.
But I would lose my mind if he came because he's a beast and I bet he's a
great person, as well. I hope he comes tomorrow. Hopefully they don't have a
game.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I don't think they do.  
  
ASIA DURR: That would be awesome.  
  
I think it's fair to ask the same question. Since you were talking about it on
the bus yesterday, how would you feel?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I would be really happy. You know, Kevin Durant came to
the game when Louisville beat Baylor last time, so why not get Russell
Westbrook there and help us repeat history.  
  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think that's fair to say. (Laughter) you never know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow night.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season, and your thoughts about the
tournament.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you very much. I'm awfully proud of my team and excited
about the opportunity to be here in Oklahoma City at the Sweet 16, and
certainly we have a big test in front of us, but this time of year,
everybody's really good.  
  
You know, I'm excited about my group. I think we're playing well. We had a
great weekend in Starkville, tremendous atmosphere for our two ballgames.
Played two really good opponents, and so we know that coming in, we've really
got to deal with a well-coached Washington team. I've known Mike a long time.
We go way back to our Arkansas days when we coached back there in '97 to 2003.
He does a tremendous job. He's one of the great coaches in our country. I have
to throw in, he's one of the great young coaches, as well, because he's ten
years younger than me.  
  
But doing a great job and obviously they have got Kelsey Plum who is the all-
time leading scorer in the history of our great game. She's got pieces around
her that I think really makes them unique and special. He does a lot of things
with them. I compare it to playing like against James Harden in the NBA. They
run a lot of stuff that the Rockets run. They spread the floor. They play off
of her. She's smart enough to find who is open, and those kids can make shots.  
  
And so you watch the other night against a really good Oklahoma team, another
well-coached team, and I mean, they just really played well, scored over a
hundred points and everything ran off of Kelsey. But it was a lot like
watching the Houston Rockets play, in my mind. And I'm a Rocket fan, so it's
easy for me to compare, being a Houston boy.  
  
So it's easier for me to compare them, and that's a tall task, as everybody in
the big league has found out. But really just excited again about the
opportunity. So proud of our program, where we are today and where we were
five years ago. Proud of my fan base. I expect a big crowd from Mississippi
State coming here to watch us play.  
  
And again, I've got great kids, hard-working, determined, and obviously our
league has prepared us for this moment. So I know I'm on a ramble. But you
know, when you come from my league and you play the rival; we play 16 rival
games every month, for two months straight, and when you do that, it prepares
you for this moment.  
  
Q. Your guards, NCAA Tournaments you need great guard play, and it seems
like they really have come together especially of late. So what's been your
impression of them? And secondly, I know you hired Dionnah a couple years ago
to coach that position. How has she impacted what they do?  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, our guards have been really special all year. I
think in our level, our league, you win with great guard play and certainly we
are blessed with a couple of aircraft carriers down low that don't hurt you.
Guard play has always been kind of our bread and butter, our base of
everything we do, especially from a pressure, defensive standpoint. And so
we've got tremendous depth at guard, too, at every position, and three at one.  
  
So that's probably where it starts for us. And those kids are playing well
right now, especially offensively. I think that's what everybody is seeing
right now is that we've got some kids making shots, and that's what's been fun
from an offensive standpoint with our group.  
  
As far as Dionnah goes, as is my entire staff, I feel like I have the best
staff in the country. I mean, Johnnie Harris has been with me since day one
when we came to Mississippi State five years ago. And she's been so
instrumental. She's got to be one of the top five assistance in the country.  
  
Just going off of what's happened in the past five years, where we were, where
we are today, and how important she is to our program and how many things she
does for our program. And again she's in charge of our post players and
everybody wants to talk about how improved our post game is. Dionnah was a
home run, as well.  
  
What she's done with our point guards with Jazz and Morgan, that's her
position that she handles, and she's done a tremendous job with those two,
bringing them along. I think everybody knew, Morgan's pretty special. I think
she's had a break out season and really taken her game to another level, as
far as the points she's averaged.  
  
But I think Jazz has come on late, and that's been a project throughout the
course of the year. She's just a sophomore, but Dionnah spent some tireless
days with her just talking to her about the mental piece as well as the
physical piece. That's what a good coach will do. These post players, for
instance, you drag people up and down the floor, you do the dirty work, you
get the rebounds and you sprint the floor and Europe and the guard doesn't
give you the ball. Well, that's mentally hard on some people. Same thing with
point guards. They get the blame for everything.  
  
I think she's done a tremendous job with Morgan and Jazz from a coaching
standpoint of bringing those kids along. She's a tireless worker. Works hard
in recruiting. I mean, she's a great coach. It was a home run, as my entire
staff has been.  
  
Q. Your memories of Dionnah in the early days; she was kind of quiet as
a player and didn't say a whole lot. Curious how she's matured and progressed
as a coach now?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I'll answer the second one first. She's very real, and I
love that about her. She speaks her mind and she has so many good things to
say. I've walked out of team meetings with her before, patting her on the back
going, "Hey, that was a great comment; our kids needed to hear that."  
  
And so I'm going to guess, from that standpoint, I didn't know her from that
side as a player, but you know, maybe that's why she's so good with my point
guards because really both my point guards are quiet and that's a bad position
to be quiet at.  
  
Maybe she's seen and heard from her own experiences, maybe from Coach Coale
for four years, you have to speak up and you have to have a presence about you
and run the team and maybe that's an evolution for her where she is today in
her coaching career. She's not quiet any more, and that's a good thing.  
  
The first question? She reminds me all the time how she dominated us for three
years. And I told her, the first two years didn't count because we weren't
very good at A&M and a lot of people dominated us. I think we got her one time
her senior year, if I'm not mistaken, and I tend to want to talk about that
game more than the other six she probably beat us.  
  
She was a heck of a player, competitor. Big, strong, physical point guard,
hard to deal with, hard to handle. Whenever I get my head down a little bit,
she reminds me of how miserable she was as a point guard at Oklahoma when we
played her with our defense. She remembers those days and again, I think as a
competitor, she brings that to the table as a coach. And that's what I like
about her. I call it that bulldog mentality which happens to fit well with
Mississippi State.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's experience?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I believe the good Lord helps you go through some things to help
prepare you for the next opportunity. Certainly last year at this time, wasn't
the best. But at the same time, I think our kids not only learned from that
experience for this game, but I think they learned from it the entire season.
I think it's obviously prepared us.  
  
Again, you live in my league, you live with live with dealing with the players
we deal with, night-in, night-out, the coaches, so many Hall of Fame coaches.
But certainly this time last year what we had to deal with, going to
Connecticut to play, I don't think anything can help get you ready for this
opportunity.  
  
Q. In your experience of coaching, have you ever seen any kind of
comparison, the comparison game is overplayed, but comparisons to Kelsey, how
she plays --  
VIC SCHAEFER: Actually, I had to go against Jackie Stiles three times at
Arkansas. So I've got experience dealing with both of the latest two all-time
leading scorers. We had a couple bad experiences with her and one good one.
I'm hoping tomorrow in my only opportunity with her, we have a good one.  
  
Again, I think I deal with some pretty good ones throughout the course of our
season and throughout my career in 32 years. Obviously Jackie Stiles, Kelsey
Plum, those are two of the best to ever play the game, and from an offensive
standpoint, they are just so multi-dimensional. Their coaches use them in such
a good way, smart, and so it's a tall task. There's no question about it. But
to answer your question, I have some experience with that, yes, sir.  
  
Q. A lot's been made of the starting lineup, but how much do you feel
like the two-week break helped reset the game and get them focused and
starting a new season with the tournament?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I think the two weeks certainly gave us an opportunity.
One, I gave the kids two days off, which we desperately needed, and even the
third day, all we did was shoot. We didn't do anything else. I think that kind
of rejuvenated us a little bit.  
  
Then it also gave me a chance to work on some different things and some
different combinations. Again, Robby, a lot's been made of it. But the bottom
line is, those kids that made an impact starting have been making an impact
coming off the bench all year. They have made big shots all year long. They
just did it earlier in the game instead of later in the game, and that's
really how we look at it.  
  
Who is out there when we are jumping center, I don't think bothers any of our
kids. I think they just want to win. And I give them a lot of credit for being
that way, being unselfish, and just wanting what's best for our team. So the
two-week period, while I'm not a fan of it, I don't like it; but in this
situation, in this circumstance, it probably worked out best for Mississippi
State, no doubt about it.  
  
Q. A couple of Washington's players jump off the page with their
statistics. How good is the supporting cast?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, the whole team is good. Tremendous -- I think they are a
tremendous basketball team obviously. They play in a great league also out in
the Pac-12, but their supporting cast, they know their roles and they execute
it very well. Mike puts them in a position where they can do what they do
best. And that's all we as coaches -- that's our job, to put our kids in the
best spot possible and the best place possible where they can be successful.  
  
And I think that's what Mike's done with this team. So those guys can all
shoot it. Romeo, they can all shoot it. They have got kids that can do a
number of different things and hurt you in different ways, and he puts them in
the right spot to do it.  
  
So the challenge for us is in a three-day period, try to figure it out and be
prepared to deal with it. You know, again, I think my staff's done a
tremendous job of getting us ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We appreciate your comments and good luck.
See you tomorrow.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: First question for our student athletes.  
  
Q. I don't know if Dominique, Blair, both or either of you want to
answer this, but Dionnah's role in coaching you guards, but what have you seen
as the biggest impact on that position and what you guys do?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: She keeps us disciplined, and she expects a lot out of us, and
she doesn't accept anything short of perfection. We work on a lot of ball
handling and just getting shots off of plays and she's really good about
footwork and making sure we rub shoulders with screens and just the smallest
things.  
  
So I feel like her coming in and just focusing on little things makes a
difference in the long run.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I agree with Blair. She doesn't let us cut corners and
she expects a lot for us and I don't think she let's us make excuses for
anything. She holds us accountable, and I think she's a great leader for our
program. She's a lot -- she brings a lot to the table and it's awesome
learning from her.  
  
Q. This question is really for all of you. This is your second Sweet 16.
What are some things you took away from last year that have prepared you for
this time around?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Last year, you know, we lost in the Sweet 16. We were very
excited just to get there because it was like our first time.  
  
But this year, I feel like we expect more. We're coming into the Sweet 16 and
I feel like we can go further than the Sweet 16. We are happy that we're here,
but we want to go further.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Just like she said, we're happy to be here but we expect
to go further. So it's just another game for us, and we are just ready to play
and we are focused in practice and we just want to get better and keep
competing.  
  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: This year, I think marks a milestone for our team and what a
veteran team is supposed to do and I feel like every year, you're supposed to
build on what you've done the previous years.  
  
I just feel like with the players we have on our team, we're getting the job
done and focusing on one game at a time and we need to continue to do that to
reach our goal which is to get to the Final Four this year.  
  
Q. Dominique, a lot of people are talking about Kelsey Plum and what
she's able to do offensively. Obviously much more than just a scorer. What
makes her so good, I guess? What makes her so difficult to defend in your
eyes?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: She is really versatile. She can spot up two (ph), she
can shoot off the dribble, she can get all the way to the rim. And I think one
of the things that sets her apart is she loves to get the ball to her
teammates.  
  
A lot of times she beats her defender and she gets to pass it to one of her
teammates and they knock down a three. So I think that's what really makes her
dangerous is she can set up her teammates for shots, and she also rebounds.  
  
Q. For one of your teammates, this is a bit of a homecoming with Ros
Johnson starting her career at Oklahoma State. How do you see her progressing
as she becomes a senior?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Ro has brought a lot of offense to our team. She's a
great player overall: She can shoot, she can get to the rim; she can do
everything. As I see her career progressing, I see her becoming an even better
defensive player. She's a pretty good defensive player right now, so I think
move on to next year, I see her becoming the lock down defender for our team
and her role just expanding.  
  
Q. Blair, I know Washington, kind of Plum-centric, I think your dad
compared him to James Harden and the Houston Rockets, but you guys, it can be
anyone on any given night and depth is what does it for you. How do the teams
contrast the differences of style and how does it affect the game when they
run into each other?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I just think that it makes both teams focus more. It's all
about your mindset going into the game. I feel like you have to adapt,
depending on what each team brings, and Washington brings Plum, who obviously
can do everything, and Osahor, who is a great three-point shooter but she is
also a post and leading rebounder in the country. So I feel like we have to do
our job on trying to stop those two or limiting their touches.  
  
But with them, I feel like it's a difficulty for them because they don't know
who is going to go off on our team because we're so deep. They don't know who
is going to have the game that's just setting other people up. They don't know
-- they just don't know what their role is going to be. They don't know who on
our team is going to shoot. They don't know who is going to drive. Because I
feel like we have such a versatile team who can do a bunch of things, and it's
hard to get teams who are really prepared for us, because I feel like we're
just so versatile, I guess.  
  
Q. More so than the lineup changes, do you feel like the two-week break
was a big deal for you guys to get a chance to kind of reset and kind of
refocus on the tournament?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I do. I feel like we had a lot of things we need to work on.
Sometimes when you play so many games, you lose some of your habits that
you've worked on all year, so we had to reestablish those habits, defensively
and offensively, but we also had to focus on scoring.  
  
I feel like we kind of got into this period where we weren't scoring as much,
or it was just because of the small things not rubbing off on screens, not
setting your team up -- teammates up right, or not communicating. Just small
things that we had to fix in practice, and it's showing that when you pay
attention to the small things, the big picture on offense and defense comes
together better.  
  
So I do feel like the two-week period really helped us look ourselves in the
mirror and figure out what wasn't going right and what was going right and I
feel like we have adapted really well.  
  
Q. How many cowbells can we expect to hear tomorrow night?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I don't think out here, cowbells, they are not allowed in
the arena. If they were allowed, I'm pretty sure we would hear a lot. You'll
probably hear a lot of our fans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow night and we'll see you after the game.

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season and your thoughts on a great
tournament.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Our kids are fired up to be here. I hope our diehard Seattle
Sonics fans will forgive us for going to the Thunder game last night, but we
had a great time getting here. Kid are settled in and we're ready for
practice.  
  
Q. What did Kelsey have naturally when you first got a hold of her, and
what did she have to work on to enhance her game over the years?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She had and has an ability to stay singularly focused better
than any human being I've ever been around: Not kid, not player, not
Millennial; anybody I've ever met, any businessman, anybody. She has a
singular focus to strive for excellence.  
  
She is not the kid that walked out of the airport and walked out in the
Thunder became last night and was immediately recognized as a basketball
player. She could be a lot of different things. So that focus is what makes
her special.  
  
I don't know that there's anything that I've tried to get her to work on other
than just enjoy the moments a little bit along the way. That's my constant
strife with her because she is so dedicated to the process that sometimes she
for gets to stop and look around and enjoy things like this, and that's all
I've tried to help her with. Put her in great situations, challenge her.  
  
From the recruiting process all the way up, she wanted to do something that
was hard. She didn't want to take the easy way out; thus, choosing a program
that had not been to the NCAA Tournament for a number of years and did not
have a built-in guarantee of success. She wanted to do something that was
hard.  
  
Tried to make it challenging for her, from naming her captain as a freshman,
to counting on her to be a focal point of our offense, redesigning a lot of
our offense around her and the rest of the players that are on our roster. And
she's handled it like no other person I've ever been around.  
  
Q. UCONN's dominance in recent years, people say it's been good for the
women's game, a lot of spotlight for women's basketball. Is it starting to be
a negative? Everybody's playing for second. Do we need more parity in the
game? Do we need somebody to win the national title besides Connecticut?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I don't think so. I think what they have done is the reason
that you're starting to see some parity -- maybe not winning it. We had three
unique teams last year in the Final Four, us being one of them, Oregon State
and Syracuse. Those were three new teams, and I know for a fact that we use
what UCONN does as a model: The way they approach the game; the way they
prepare.  
  
He's got great players, but they also out-work a lot of people. He gets great
talent to work hard, and that's why the combination is so unbeatable right
now, is they have both of them going. I think a lot of us are getting there. I
think now kids see that it can't just be talent and it can't just be hard
work. It's got to be a combination of those two teams.  
  
And I think you have seen, you've got more teams talked about this year. I
think it's great. I think we should all embrace it, and if we spend one second
worry about it being negative, then we are just adding to that argument that
it is, and I don't believe that it is a negative.  
  
I think it's great for our sport. I think it's brought a lot of attention, and
anybody that wants to dismiss it, I just don't think's paying enough
attention.  
  
Q. Sorry to take you back to Kelsey. A know a lot's been written about
her success story the last few years. Is there an underrated part of her story
that people are missing along the way, do you think?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Just that she is a great teammate. I think -- I've been there
every step of the way with her. She has not missed one interview question. She
has not put one negative thing on social media. She has not provided bulletin
board locker room material for an opponent. She's humble.  
  
And the records, she only wanted the records to occur if we were winning and
our program was winning and our team was winning. And that's genuine. There's
not one ounce of fakeness in her. She is very genuine. And I think a lot of
times when you are chasing records and you are under the spotlight, that can
get undervalued, but she is a tremendous teammate. And has been, you know, a
star in her role since the second she stepped on our campus.  
  
Q. In that sense, has her personality changed much?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: A little. I think initially, she's always been a chip-on-her-
shoulder-type kid. Didn't make some teams she wanted to make. She wasn't as
highly regarded maybe coming out of high school. She's always found something
to have a chip on her shoulder about, and I think that's driven her.  
  
I think over time that chip has gone away to just now be: Strive for
excellence. Don't worry about outcomes. Focus still on that process, and the
results are going to take care of themselves. I have seen that change. She's a
happy kid.  
  
She's really, really become a role model off the court, as well, very giving
of her time. She stays well after our normal autograph sessions at home. She
stays on the road to sign autographs. And I haven't seen her one time step out
of character when you've had plenty of opportunities to do it. She's missed
some free throws, she's missed some jumpshots, she's missed some layups, but
she has not missed one chance to take a selfie with a 10-year-old or an
80-year-old. She's really been given plenty of opportunities to do it, and she
has not.  
  
Q. A few minutes ago, Vic was comparing your offense and the way you use
your personnel to the Rockets, and James Harden, spreading the floor, kicking
out to shooters. Is that something that -- have you adopted your style from
other coaches, or is this a natural progression of what you have with your
personnel?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I obviously watch a lot of sports, any level, FIBA, college,
high school, and I'm constantly doodling plays. We picked stuff up from
Harden. There was social media, people that did a side-by-side comparison of
Harden and Kelsey. Obviously you start looking at some of those things.  
  
I used a lot of Stockton and Malone. Those were my two guys growing up. I
loved watching Stockton and Malone. Chantel is very Malone-ish and I think
Kelsey at times could be Stockton-ish.  
  
So we've got a few of our sets, actions, the way we space, from the Rockets
specifically. Also a lot from the Clippers. The best play we run I got from
the Portugal team in the FIBAs a few years ago, and you just kind of tinker
around with it in practice. Anybody that's been in our practice knows we like
to tinker a little bit and find things, and those do come from that area.  
  
He knows. Obviously Vic and I are very, very close friends and I spent three
days in Starkville last summer talking about offense, and so there's no
secrets. He knows exactly what we're going to do and not even what but how
we're going to do it.  
  
Q. How have you seen Collier and her game perhaps evolve and get to this
point at this season?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It started last summer, before last season even. She really
spent that summer, for the first time since she was diagnosed with leukemia,
and overcoming leukemia, had a full summer where she could work on her skill.
She was constantly working on conditioning and it really paid off for her this
last year, and this summer she just kept it going.  
  
And when we talk about people starring in their role, you know, she's done as
good a job at starring in her role as Chantel and Kelsey and Natalie and the
people that sometimes get a little bit more of the spotlight.  
  
But that's who she is. If you were there the day she was diagnosed with
leukemia, she was on an official visit to our school: She never cried. She was
just making a plan on how to beat it. How are we going to guard, ball screen
with her? It's not that big a deal when you've beaten cancer. I think she's
drawn from that. She inspires us every single day that she steps on the court
from coaches to players, everybody in our program.  
  
And I think, you know, this year, what you've seen is you have to guard her,
as well, because she's going to make 15-foot jumpshots. She's going to make
every lay-in that Chantel throws her, so she can score on top of the things
that she's been in in the past in screening and defense. She's continued to
add to her game just as much as the other players have.  
  
I've got great pictures of Vic if anybody needs them. He may have some of me,
too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Joined by Chantel Osahor and Kelsey Plum.  
  
Q. If you guys can just say, how has Katie maybe grown and matured over
the years, and especially this year? And I would ask Kelsey first and then
Chantel.  
KELSEY PLUM: Katie's just one of the big glue pieces to our team, and a lot of
the things she does doesn't necessarily come up necessarily in the box score
and stat sheet. She's a tough competitor. Her energy: The way she runs the
floor; the way she gets people open, setting screens, and then just in there
with Chantel battling on the board. Sometimes defensively she's got to guard a
guard, or she's got a different type of mismatch.  
  
But Katie, can't say enough about her resilience, her strength, and just her
positive attitude. She's always the first person to say, "Hey, I love you," or
"keep your head up," or stuff like that. She's been great.  
  
Katie and I are roommates, so that's somebody that I spend a lot of time with
outside of basketball, as well.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Katie is like the prime example of being a superstar in your
role. I know Neighbs is all into numbers, so if you ask him, I know like you
don't see them in the stat sheets, but her numbers for us are ridiculous. And
on the defensive side and on the offensive side, our efficiencies are great
because of her. So yeah, Katie is just, I'm glad I play beside her because
she's a rock for our team.  
  
Q. What came naturally for you? What have you had to work for versus
what came naturally in terms of your basketball skill? What would you tell
me?  
KELSEY PLUM: What came naturally is my competitiveness and what came
skillfully because I worked on it, everything else. I don't know, I guess I
just, I've grown up around sports. I've grown up playing in an atmosphere
where I've always been super competitive and stuff like that. But basketball,
I don't think it came supernatural to me. I was actually a volleyball player,
and my family, I grew up playing volleyball.  
  
When I made the transition to basketball, I had to work a lot at it. I think
maybe just being fearless. Being able to shoot the ball any place on the
floor, maybe that's natural, I don't know. But probably just my
competitiveness, I guess.  
  
Q. How old were you when you made that transition and why did you do so,
from volleyball to basketball?  
KELSEY PLUM: I stopped playing volleyball when I was a freshman in high school
and that was because the high school coach made me pick between the two. I
loved volleyball more -- sorry, basketball.  
  
I loved basketball a lot more and I decided to go for it. If it wasn't for
that, I don't know if I would be here because volleyball was something I was
really good at and I liked it, as well. So I don't know, everything happens
for a reason.  
  
Q. What do you see from Mississippi State's defense? They are one of the
top defensive units in the SEC. What have you seen from them in preparation?  
KELSEY PLUM: Coach Vic Schaefer is a defensive guru. Just watching on film,
their intensity and pressure they put on opponents, the way they play is very
apparent right from the start. They try to turn you over and try to make you
take bad shots. They force a lot of charges, and then just the rotations on
defense; they play together as a team and they are very deep.  
  
You know, subs come in and they play with that same type of high energy, and
they are physical, very athletic. It's going to be a very tough matchup.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer compared you to James Harden and said your style of
offense is like the Houston Rockets. What do you think about being compared to
someone like James Harden?  
KELSEY PLUM: It's very cool. I think that that's happened a couple times this
year. Just can't say anything. I mean, he's playing like the MVP right now. So
to be compared to somebody like that is just an honor.  
  
Q. Your coach also mentioned that even when you guys will go on the
road, there will be people asking for your autographs, kids being there. When
did that first start happening, when the opponents, you would have the fans
come out and what has that experience been like as you've traveled to these
different sites?  
KELSEY PLUM: I think it started to get a little bit overwhelming the beginning
of this year. Just some of the exposure and the attention. But it's a good
problem to have I think.  
  
I think that I take it as, not necessarily a challenge, but if I can be
somebody that could be a role model and grow the game and have people watch
our games and stuff like that, I'm definitely willing to be an ambassador for
it and I take on that responsibility wholeheartedly.  
  
Q. All the scoring marks that you've reached this year, when the year
began, did you have any idea that you would be in contention for some of those
records? Did you have people telling you about it? And kind of talk, as you
got closer, sort of the pressure that comes with reaching those marks.  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, I knew that it was possible, but it wasn't something that I
was striving for. I was just trying to go out, be the best player I could for
my team and play basketball, because I love it and because it's fun.  
  
I think that towards those days and those games that I could possibly have
broken it or whatever the case may be; yeah, I would lie if I said that it
wasn't extremely stressful and kind of disheartening, because people expect
miracles.  
  
You know, it's tough, because it kind of took a love away from the game.
That's not why I play. I was just grateful for the support I've had from my
teammates. It's been unreal. There's no way any of this stuff happens if they
are not there and they don't have my back. I'm just glad that the weight is
off my chest and I can just play now, because we just want to win the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. If others compare you to James Harden, is there an NBA player that
you compare yourself to?  
KELSEY PLUM: My favorite player in the NBA right now is Steph, but I don't
compare myself to him. I don't think -- he's like a unicorn. I don't think you
compare yourself to that.  
  
Probably James. Just the similarities. We are both left-handed, the way we
create our own shot is very similar. I didn't realize it until some of the
tape I've been showed on just his game and the way he moves with the ball.
It's been interesting to see the comparisons. But I mean, I have to say James
I guess.  
  
Q. Did I read where you played against, was it Nate Robinson at some
point? Were there other guys that have NBA connection that is you've run with
at the gym and whatnot over the years?  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, UW has a great alumni, and this summer, I play a lot of
pick-up games with people: Nate, Jamal Crawford, Spencer Hawes, Markelle
Fultz, Tony Wroten, Isaiah Thomas. It's just been great, and they are so cool
and they are really down-to-earth. You would expect these superstars not to
give you the time of day, but they are certainly very gracious.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, would you like to make an opening statement?  
  
Okay. We'll go straight to questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. You've won a national title; it's been a few years. Connecticut has
been hogging them the last few years. How badly does the sport need somebody
else to win a national title, whether it's you, or somebody else?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't look at it UCONN's dominance and a win streak as a bad
thing, and the reason I don't is because I was a part of that when I played. I
didn't think it was a bad thing then.  
  
They are good; until somebody beats them, they are going to continue. I just
have such respect for what they have been able to do, because I do know how
difficult it is. And I do know some people don't agree with that, but I don't
think it's a bad thing for the sport. It's challenging for me as a coach and
for us as a program to win another National Championship, and that's been
Storrs, Connecticut for a long time.  
  
Q. It seems like both these teams, Louisville and you guys, are coming
into this matchup really hot. Both teams played really well in the first two
rounds. Can you give us your assessment of what you think of Louisville at
this point?  
KIM MULKEY: I think of Louisville as a team that -- they are good. They are
talented. They play in a great conference that has prepared them for
postseason play. I think Coach Walz has been in this stage many times and
he'll continue to build his team through the course of the year, which he did.  
  
If you're in the Sweet 16, obviously you must be playing well. And I just
think that they are really, really good, and I think it starts with Asia Durr.  
  
Q. How do you feel Alexis Jones has played since her return?  
KIM MULKEY: I think she's done well. She gave us 22 minutes the other night,
and she looked good to me. She missed some shots, but I think, you know, I
don't know if that had anything to do with her being off for a month, but she
just gives us a sense of security.  
  
Q. I know that you and Louisville have both been on this exact same page
a couple years back in 2013 and obviously the rosters have changed since then,
so it's not really going to be a rematch of sorts. But what do you think about
the history that both of you guys have playing in this round?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we've only played once in this round -- I'm sorry, twice,
when they had McCoughtry, and I think it was at N.C. State. So we've only
played twice. So we really don't have a lot of history.  
  
History to me is when you've played many, many, many, many years. We've been
unfortunate to be on the losing end of those two, but I don't know that we
have a history of playing each other.  
  
Q. With all the minutes that your freshmen played last weekend, how have
you seen their confidence grow over this last week?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think Lauren Cox and Natalie Chou are good, and they are
really surfacing now and showing their talents, and it's because they are
confident now. They have been through a whole season, and I really think those
two kids, they are playing well and they are going to see the floor, and
hopefully because they are playing well now, it makes us a better team.  
  
Q. I know the past is something coaches don't like to talk much about
but people are going to look at this matchup because it was such a monumental
upset in 2013. Do you just try to block that out?  
KIM MULKEY: It brings back memories to me just because I was involved in it.
I'm not sure -- well, Alexis Prince may be the only kid on our roster that was
here because she's a fifth-year senior. But the rest of the kids, heck, I
don't even know if they watch current basketball games.  
  
I'd have to go ask them what they were doing when we played that game. Some of
them may have watched it on television. Along with -- who was on my staff
then? Maybe two current staff members were a part of that. But we don't even
have the same media relations. I don't even have the same athletic director.
Don't even have the same president. I mean, there's probably three of us in
that locker room that member that.  
  
Q. Was there anything after, you always talk about getting something out
of losses and I know that was an incredibly painful loss. Was there anything
you got out of that, or that you carried with you after that, that loss?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I remember things about the game. I think any loss, it eats
on you and you think of things maybe you could have done better as a coach.
But the longer you're in the business, you're going to be upset. You're going
to upset people.  
  
You know, our first national -- actually, I would say the semifinals of our
first National Championship, we beat LSU. They were the best team in the
country. Had the best post player, the best player, the best point guard. So
the longer you're in the business, those things happen to you. You win some
you shouldn't and you lose some that you probably shouldn't.  
  
But you can't let them just kill your spirit. You can't let them run you out
of the business. You just motivate yourself, pick yourself back up and keep
coaching.  
  
Q. You mentioned Asia Durr. What stands out to you about her as a
player?  
KIM MULKEY: That I recruited her and didn't get her (laughs). She's a
phenomenal player. She can score from the perimeter. She can take you off the
dribble. She was not healthy last year. Now she's healthy, and you're seeing
the real Asia Durr, and she's just a handful to guard. They do a lot of things
with her and through her. She is the catalyst that makes them go.  
  
Q. Just can you maybe talk about where -- with this guard matchup, what
do you think are going to be the big keys, because there's so much talent at
guard for both of these teams.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'm not so sure, I'm not going to go inside. I think my
strength is my post. They have got to guard my bigs. I think that obviously
we've got our hands full with the three perimeter players for Louisville, and
yet on the other side, I think they may have their hands full guarding our
post.  
  
So it should be a great defensive ballgame. It should be a ballgame that fans
should enjoy seeing, because I think that you're going to see a lot of great
players at different positions on the floor for both teams.  
  
Q. Do you think that Louisville's perimeter game is going to be kind of
the decisive thing in this matchup, or is there something else that you think
you need to worry about when you're looking at them?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I hope my post game is the decisive thing. You're talking
about their strengths. I want to talk about our strengths.  
  
I think that I'm going to make you guard 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, but I don't want to
make you think that our guards aren't good. Our guards are good. I think
Alexis Prince is having a great senior year. I think that Alexis Jones is a
premiere guard in the country. I think Kristy Wallace is an international kid
that's played a lot of international basketball and has had two years prior
experience of losing in an Elite 8.  
  
You know, I think that if you look at stats, we lead the country in three-
point field goal percentage. We're not going to shoot as much as others across
the country, but we can shoot it if we need to shoot it.  
  
So I think we'll hold on out there, and I'm sure they think they are going to
hold their own inside. We'll all try to figure out ways to stop each other and
try to win a basketball game.  
  
Q. You've lost the Big 12 Championship game here, which I'm sure is a
disappointment. But was it a motivating factor in some ways for your kids? You
guys kind of plowed through those first two rounds. Do you think they were
energized or maybe refocused at all?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, what are we, I don't know, something-and-three. You
don't overplay it. I've always said the regular season of conferences are much
more important than conference tournaments. Unfortunately conference
tournament championships, you see on TV and you see the confetti fall but we
don't ever celebrate that when somebody wins a 16- or an 18-game season.  
  
So you don't overemphasize it, and sometimes you just acknowledge that the
opponent, gosh, they were just good. West Virginia came in here, and none of
us could beat them. You just withstand the Storm, you know. You don't let it
devastate you. I didn't feel like that we were any more motivated, more did I
feel like we were devastated. Just get back to work.  
  
The MODERATOR: Coach, good luck. We'll see you tomorrow evening.  
  
We have Alexis Jones, Kalani Brown and Nina Davis.  
  
Q. Looking at how well both teams have been playing coming into this
game, what do you think is really going to be the deciding factor?  
NINA DAVIS: Probably the team that turns over the ball less. Both teams are
great and both teams, we're kind of different in different ways. They have
three great perimeter players that we are going to have to try to slow down
and us, more so, we're going to take an inside, outside take, try to get the
inside going and try to get it to the outside. Both teams are coached by great
players and it's just going to come down to who wants it the most.  
  
Q. Kalani, what did you see from Lauren and Beatrice this last
weekend?  
KALANI BROWN: They stepped up big time. But it's nothing I didn't expect from
them. They are both great players and both do great things well: Beatrice
rebounding and doing great post moves; Lauren hitting outside shots. It's
nothing that I don't see every day and don't expect from them. They were just
given a chance and they executed.  
  
Q. Your past games in the tournament have been such huge margins of
victory. Do you think you are ready to have a closer game or do you think
you're on such a roll, it will be another blowout?  
ALEXIS JONES: I don't know if it will be a blowout, but I think we're ready
for this game. We've been preparing for this game, so I feel like we're going
to come out focused and ready to play.  
  
Q. Asia Durr is obviously going to be a really big perimeter threat for
Louisville. Have you talked about how to defend her?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely. We know she has deep range from the three, so we are
going to have to close out pretty far out. If you're left with a switch, just
move your feet, I guess. She's a very good player, strong left-handed guard,
so we are going to try to take that away from her. But she's a good all-around
guard.  
  
Q. This can be for Alexis. How did you see your help-side defense really
improve last weekend?  
ALEXIS JONES: I think it has improved. We lost against Texas and when we lost
against Texas, I think our help side improved a lot. I think our energy has
improved. I think a lot of players has grown since then and I think we are
just -- we became a better team and I think we are getting better and better
each and every game.  
  
Q. You have been pretty unmatched in the post all season in terms of
rebounding. Do you think that that has been the greatest strength that's
allowed you guys to win games so far, or has it been something else?  
KALANI BROWN: I think that has, and our defensive ability to stop people from
scoring, and it's very important to get offensive rebounds. I wouldn't say
out-matched, because Louisville, they may be not as big as us, but they are
just as aggressive.  
  
So I'm just going to have to bring that same aggressiveness when it comes to
rebounding. Nobody is just going to let you have it. So I'm just taking that
approach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Good luck tomorrow. We'll see you after the game.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 27, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Tyasha Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33304)

### [Kaela Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26929)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 71, Florida State 64  
  
DAWN STALEY: Just really thankful. God has been good to our program. He's been
good to me personally. And this wouldn't be possible without Him. And at the
same time, I'd like to thank the Florida State Seminoles, who are coached
well.  
  
And although we see the victory side of it, the defeat side of it is, some
seniors won't get to experience going to a Final Four and I do feel for them.
But at the same time, I'm happy for our players. I'm happy that they put
themselves in the position to go on and realize their dreams, as well.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your performance here in Stockton, your
confidence, just in terms of what you wanted to accomplish in terms of
bringing offense it the team, and do you think you succeeded doing that?  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. I think the biggest thing tonight was our defense, though.
We found ways to get stops. You know, I think we started the game off really
well.  
  
But you know, obviously it's just being aggressive. I think my main point was
just to come in and be aggressive and then our goal was obviously to get to
the Final Four, and managed to accomplish that.  
  
Q. When A'Ja got in foul trouble, did you feel like that you needed to
step up at that point? It seemed like that's when you really started scoring a
lot of points.  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. Obviously with A'Ja, she draws a lot of attention. So you
know, with her being out, we had to start scoring and get buckets. We were
getting stops, but they kind of went on runs here and there. We had to find a
way to counter that and balance out a little bit.  
  
Q. At one point, Florida State got it to within three points. Did you
say anything? Did you, personally, say anything to the team to get South
Carolina to settle down? In the end, Florida State ended up missing seven of
its last eight shots. Was that part of the on-the court leadership?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I think in that situation, I feel like it's a time-and-
score situation. It was one of those things where we didn't necessarily need
to get a shot unless we had a good one, and we just had to find ways to get
stopped. They really started pushing the ball at us late in the second half.  
  
We had to find a way to slow them down. But at the same time, like I said, we
were trying to find a way just to work the clock and take good shots.  
  
Q. You transferred here to get a shot at this. Does that make this
incredibly satisfying for you?  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. Absolutely. It makes it ten times better to be able to say
that you want to do something and accomplish it. You know, it's been a long
year, a lot of ups and downs, but I think we're finding a way to end on a high
note and to, you know, just put everything together.  
  
We've had our fair share of adversity but this team has found ways to time and
time again, just fight through it and find a way to be better because of it.  
  
Q. Late in the game, I think they had cut the lead down to three, with
about a minute and 40 seconds left when you made that drive to the basket to
score. That essentially sealed it, in addition to the free throws. What did
you see there, and what was working? You seemed like you were having your way
as far as driving to the basket.  
KAELA DAVIS: I think just attacking them. We weren't settling for jumpshots,
which I think is the best thing we could have done. I think towards the fourth
quarter, we were just kind of passing it and waiting for a good shot to come.
But I think it was one of those things, we kind of had to create a good shot
for ourselves.  
  
They were doing a good job of keeping us outside the paint, and really making
us, like I said, pass the ball around the three-point line. So I think it was
one of those things where I kind of saw everybody was a little raised up and
found a gap somehow.  
  
Q. Florida State had some big three-point shooters but you didn't give
them a lot of good looks. Can you talk about the message Coach gave to you,
and also the last steal late in the game to seal things.  
TYASHA HARRIS: We kind of just stuck with the game plan. We just focused on
defense and trying to stop our man. And the last steal, I just saw it coming
and just grabbed it, and, I don't know, that's what happened.  
  
Q. Tell us a little bit about that dance that was spontaneous there, and
did A'Ja start that?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I think A'Ja started it. I don't know, it's just one of
those in-the-moment things, having fun. We love our band. They are funny --
funny, funny people. They are just really good people to be around. So I think
it was just a way to kind of show that we appreciate them.  
  
Q. Sue looked at the stats and said if she just looked at those cold,
she might have thought they were going to win that game, given the rebounding
totals and some stuff going on. Do you feel like -- do you feel like you guys
won, despite maybe some things you didn't go as well as you needed to do
tonight?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we won despite turning the ball over. We won despite their
runs. I thought them going to a zone and slowing us down and taking away some
driving lanes really stalled our offense a little bit. But it also took
possessions away.  
  
We didn't want to take quick shots, so it almost played into our hands, minus
the turnovers. So we ran the clock a little bit, and if that game is maybe
five minutes longer, we could have a different result.  
  
But I just thought we were timely with getting stops. We were timely with
getting key rebounds. I thought Doniyah Cliney came in and gave us some great
minutes, and got some rebounds when I didn't think we were in the play. We
just made plays and we were very efficient on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Kaela stepped up tonight? Seemed like she
dictated the offense when you needed it the most.  
DAWN STALEY: Since we've gone to a smaller lineup, it's created more scoring
opportunities for Kaela, more driving lanes for her to get to the basket and
more opportunity for her to pull up, as well. She's seeing it and she's
hitting those holes like a running back. You know, for her to perform the way
she does, she did this past weekend, it just goes to show the type of player
she is.  
  
You know, obviously we wanted this all year long. But it takes some adjusting
to not having the ball in your hands. But not having Alaina Coates, puts the
ball in her hands a lot more; had we had Alaina. So Alaina, you don't want
anyone's career to end, but it's been a blessing in disguise for us. We got a
little bit more balanced, and you know, Kaela has benefitted from it.  
  
Q. Two offensive rebounds, only eight assists and obviously a lack of
second-chance opportunities. How did you guys find a way to adjust despite not
having that many second-chance opportunities?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we exploited -- we exploited putting the ball on the floor
and challenging them to stop us one-on-one. That was the game plan, to attack
their feet, put them back on their heels. When it's like that, you're not
going to -- if you get all the way to the basket, you get all the way to the
basket; and if you couldn't, then you kick it out.  
  
So there weren't very many opportunities to assist the basket, because we
found a way to get to the basket. And when it's working, you continue it.  
  
Q. After watching what Florida State managed to do against Oregon State,
did you get a sense even when your team was up by 15, this team is still going
to make a run; they are still going to come back; there's no settling down?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, they are a team that they never find themselves out
of the game because they play so fast, they take quick shots, they get the
ball up-and-down the floor and they turn you over, as well.  
  
We wanted to make sure we got shots at the basket and unfortunately for us, we
had 18 turnovers and that allowed them to get back in the game. So they had a
lot to do with getting back in the game by turning us over. Obviously we have
to clean that up before we take on a Stanford team.  
  
Q. Now that the Final Four is set and you're going to have the
opportunity to coach possibly against two of your USA Basketball mentors,
starting first with Tara VanDerveer, what are your thoughts about being able
to matchup against great basketball minds at that level?  
DAWN STALEY: I think it's great. As a coach, you want to coach against the
best. That's why I left Temple to come to South Carolina to coach in the SEC
with what I think is some of the greatest coaches in the game. And then you
get to this stage at the Final Four, and then it's another tier of coaches who
have won national championships, have won Gold Medals, have won a thousand
games.  
  
I think it's just great. I think I'm going to be amongst greatness and
hopefully with that, you know, it will be a great experience with South
Carolina.  
  
Q. How is this different? How is this feeling different than two years
ago when it was the first time when you guys earned a trip to the Final
Four?  
DAWN STALEY: Probably 7,000 less Gamecock fans. It felt different because it
there was no confetti, there was no screaming. There wasn't any passion behind
it. And obviously we're 3,000 miles away from home, but when you're a little
bit closer, your fans are right on top of you. It just seemed like everybody
was kind of far away, and it almost, it took you back, because you're like,
did this really happen? Are we going to the Final Four?  
  
But it sank in. It sank in when we were standing out there and enjoying each
other's company.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on both your team and the men's team making it, and
what that means to the university?  
DAWN STALEY: It's incredible. I mean, it's something that Frank and I have
both worked hard for. When we came to South Carolina, I'm quite sure he felt
the same way, and I don't want to speak for him -- but Frank is a great coach.
He's a great coach. He does some great things.  
  
And as a coach, you feel like there are things that you can control; that you
can get people to execute; you can get people to believe in your vision, even
the talent, this group of players that you assemble. But you can't do it
without talent, you can't do it without belief. You can't do it without a
togetherness. You can't do it without the support of your administrators, your
president on down, without it working; and we felt this for -- you know, I've
been at South Carolina for nine years. This is Frank's fifth year.  
  
For us to be able to experience three Final Fours in the short time that we've
been here, there's a lot of love on our campus from everyone, and our fans.
Our fans are so deserving of this because, you know, they have been there. You
know, when we won two SEC games, they have been there. When we have been left
out of the NCAA Tournament, they have been there. And now they get to share in
the joys of us playing, being one of the last four teams to participate in
this long basketball season. They deserve it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 27, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Chatrice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33310)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 71, Florida State 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good evening.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: It was a heck of a game and I just a.m. so proud of the young
ladies and the team that has developed here. Obviously we're disappointed. We
didn't shoot the ball well. They shot the ball great. In every other category,
we win. But unfortunately you have to put the ball in the basket, and 71 shots
to 45 shots; 18 offensive rebounds to two; 12 assists, 11 turnovers to their
eight assists, 18 turnovers. You look at that: We beat them in points in the
paint, points off turnovers, second-chance points, fast-break points, bench
points, and it goes on and on, and that's just this game.  
  
It's tough. I wouldn't trade our scorers for anybody. I thought they made a
valiant effort, and give ourselves some chances, but congratulations to South
Carolina. They are a tremendous basketball team.  
  
Q. They kind of held you at arm's length for awhile, and you made that
furious run at the end. What changed for you guys? Was it just the urgency
that time was running out?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it was, and we kept talking the whole time to each
other. I think we were realizing that this could be our last game, and we
didn't want it to end like that. You know, we were down by, you know, ten, 12
points, and we wanted to try. We became more aggressive. I think everybody
believed a little more, and that gave us -- that keep us going.  
  
Q. You guys have been a part of some pretty big comebacks throughout
this entire tournament. In the fourth quarter, did you guys really think, hey,
we've got this; we can make this comeback; we can complete this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Yeah, I think we believed the whole time and that made a huge
impact on how we played. I think we, you know, again, the communication that
we had to each other during the whole game, and especially at the end of the
quarter, somebody will steal the ball, Brittany's layup in the end when we
were in zone. Ivey getting charges; I think that gave us a lot of energy to
come back and try to win the game. But I mean -- yeah.  
  
Q. To have the rebounding advantage and for to you have a pretty
efficient game, seven of nine from the field, but to not get the win and to
see the shots not fall, what was it out there? Was it disappointing when the
shots weren't falling but you were still getting those good looks?  
CHATRICE WHITE: Yeah, I think the whole game, we got all the looks we wanted
to. The shots just weren't falling. It was frustrating on the court, but we
tried our best not to let one mistake lead to the next and just continued to
fight. But you know, we wanted it to go in the basket and didn't tonight.  
  
Q. Senior year, I know it's kind of raw, but can you sum up your year
and time with Florida State and coming here from Kansas State and making
something special out of this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I would say this has been really positive, and honestly what I
take from all of this is how much we've grown and how much we've come together
after all the things that we've been through, and even, you know, having a
start -- I remember when I came from Kansas State, that I wasn't playing at
the beginning. I loved how this team played and I wanted to play so bad. And
then being able to play and what a season we had; it was amazing.  
  
The next year, we struggled a little bit, but we never let all that split us
apart. We always try to come up with new things, new ways to come together,
and I think this season has, you know, has been that change, that growth, that
we really seek last year. So I'm really proud of everybody, the coaches and my
teammates.  
  
Q. Kind of a similar question I already asked. When the team was
starting to make that comeback, you've watched this team Storm back from 17
down; did you believe, too, this is the Seminoles I've seen all year?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, one thing goes your way, at that point, it was a five-point
game and we missed shots and really we had held them for a long time without
scoring.  
  
Again, I don't know why we rushed so much, but it felt like we rushed. We took
a lot of quick shots. I mean, obviously 71 shots, that's a lot of quick shots.  
  
Again, it's kind of the tale of so many coaches: When the ball doesn't go in
the basket, it affects your confidence and your mentality. And started going
in; I thought we could maybe pull it out.  
  
Q. Offensive rebounds were very hard for them to come by but they got
one late that was a big one.  
SUE SEMRAU: That was huge.  
  
Q. This box score, are you going to look at this box score for a while
and figure out how you didn't win this game?  
SUE SEMRAU: No, we just didn't hit shots. That was the big bottom line. And
why didn't we hit shots? I thought we rushed. I thought they played some good
defense, but I thought that we felt the pressure of them scoring, and rather
than being more deliberate and getting the looks that we wanted, I thought we
took the first open look. And it hasn't been -- that's not what we've been
throughout the season, so credit South Carolina for that.  
  
Q. They got out to a 5-0 start like they did the previous game, and you
guys only tied it for 11 seconds. So how frustrating was it to not be able to
get over the hump, even though you were close?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, we talked about it in the last time-out; the last time we
played them in 2015 in the Elite 8, we led for 37 minutes, and it was kind of
the tables were turned; and they had led for 37 minutes, basically, and let's
go do this thing.  
  
But rebounding is critical, and that rebound that gave them that extra
possession was really big.  
  
Q. Kaela Davis, can you just talk about -- I was very impressed with her
this weekend. I had not seen her in person a lot. How difficult is she a guard
for people?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think she's been better for them since Alaina Coates has been
out. She knows -- she wants to be a scorer and she's an excellent scorer. So
she knows that it's her and A'Ja, and so she loves that fence. I remember when
she was at Georgia Tech, she was the only one, so she would go take 31 shots.
Now she gets an opportunity to get great shots. She's just become much more
disciplined. Just she's a great kid and a great basketball player.  
  
Q. What was it like seeing Leti miss shot after shot and open look after
open look?  
SUE SEMRAU: I was just really proud of her for continuing to shoot it, because
she is, you know, a 50-50-90 kind of kid. And again, I thought they were maybe
more rushed. I don't know why; I guess the sense of urgency and the
opportunity. I know she's disappointed in herself, but I couldn't be more
proud to have coached her.  
  
Q. You guys win the rebounding battle, especially on the offensive
rebounds, but you offset that with the amount of fouls. Do you think that had
a big difference in the total outlook of the game?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yes. I wish I could say more. I just -- I don't know. I thought
that it was a physical game. Yeah.  
  
Q. Thomas being on the bench for the entire second quarter, how much did
that really mess with the flow of the game for you guys and your offense?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, it's not our favorite situation to be in. So that, really, I
thought Chatrice stepped up and she did a great job. I thought Ama Degbeon did
a tremendous job defending A'Ja Wilson. And just Ama and Ivey haven't been the
go-to scorers that Shakayla has. I thought Chatrice stepped up and did some
good things, but we would have liked to have her on the floor.  
  
Thanks so much.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome the South Carolina Gamecocks head coach, Dawn
Staley and student athletes A'Ja Wilson, Bianca Cuevas-Moore, Kaela Davis,
Allisha Gray and Tyasha Harris.  
  
South Carolina defeated Quinnipiac to advance to the Elite 8 for the third
time in program history. The Gamecocks will face Florida State tomorrow at
6:00 PM Pacific. First we will have an opening statement from Coach Staley.  
  
DAWN STALEY: We are excited to be in this position. This is a position in
which we've worked so hard. We control our own destiny, and hopefully we'll
come out and perform like we've performed all season long, and we're just
excited to play a very competitive Florida State basketball team.  
  
Q. A'Ja, Florida State, two years ago in the Elite 8 in Greensboro: What
do you remember about that game, really competitive one that went right down
to the wire. What do you remember about that first game?  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, like you said, they are a very competitive team. They
compete for 40 minutes. They are very physical, and that was something that we
really kind of -- helped bring us to the win is that we became physical and we
became even more competitive.  
  
So that's most that I remember from that game. Of course remember going to the
Elite 8 and just the feeling -- I mean, going to the Final Four and just that
feeling. That's something that I really want these girls to experience and,
that's what we're going to go out there and try to do.  
  
Q. Kaela, what had you giggling just now? And secondly -- I just have to
know. I'm so confused over here. And how excited are you for the opportunity
to get that chance to punch a ticket to the Final Four?  
KAELA DAVIS: There's just a lot of jokes on this team. Yesterday we shot a
nice video for our men's team and Coach couldn't --  
  
DAWN STALEY: That's T. Don't give the T out.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I'm just excited, though. Obviously this is -- I came here to be
in these games, to be in this situation. You know, wouldn't want to be on
another team and you know, trying to get to the Final Four with another group
of girls. So I'm just excited.  
  
Q. Kaela, could you talk about growing up the daughter of an NBA player,
and I understand your brother is in the NIT. Can you tell about growing up
with Antonio and your brother, was there any sibling rivalry between you?  
KAELA DAVIS: Oh, all the time. My twin brother. Yeah, one-on-one games, got
shut down a lot. So that stopped at a early age.  
  
But it was just fun. Obviously getting to -- just to see my dad's work ethic
and what it takes to kind of play at the highest level, you know, that was
always fun. I was just always excited; Excited to see him play and I've got to
live a lot of different places and experience a lot of different things. It's
been a blessing. It's been a really cool opportunity.  
  
And obviously like I said, my brother, they are flying out to New York today
to play in the final for the NIT. A lot of basketball going on in my family
right now, but it's an exciting time for us.  
  
Q. Bianca, what was that 2015 game like for you, kind of being a
freshman who had to step up?  
BIANCA CUEVAS-MOORE: It was good I guess. I don't know.  
  
Q. Allisha, how does this team always seem to look so relaxed and loose?
The stakes are rising but I can't tell by looking on the podium right now that
you guys are ready to play the biggest game of the season tomorrow?  
ALLISHA GRAY: We are just a funny team, goofy. We know there's a time and
place for everything, so once we're on the court, we're serious and ready to
play but right now it's a time where you get your all -- your giggles out and
stuff and you can be lackadaisical and stuff. But once you get out on the
court, we know it's game time and we'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Allisha, your time in the ACC, does that give you extra familiarity
with Florida State and does that help in your preparation?  
ALLISHA GRAY: I wouldn't say an advantage because they are definitely a
different team than they were two years ago, so I just have to come in and
prepare for them like I haven't met them before and like they are a brand new
team.  
  
Q. What do you remember from a couple years ago playing them? Romero
said last night her body just hurt after that game; it was so physical. Sue
was mentioning last night how special it is to scrimmage with this team the
last couple of years in the preseason.  
A'JA WILSON: Wait, could you repeat, that first part of the question? Oh --  
  
Q. Romero said her body, it was such a physical game. You won by six and
her body was sore afterwards. It was one of those battles; a fight, she called
it.  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, just kind of going off what I said, last time it was a very
physical game. I mean, when something is on the line, you're going to come and
fight for it and you really want it. I think it just comes down to want. I
think we all know that the talent is in the room. I mean, we all know we're
talented, but at the same time, when you're playing something such as the
Final Four, it comes down to heart and want.  
  
And I think after that game, I think we really wanted it and we went out and
fought for it, and the results kind of showed. But I haven't really got a
chance to scrimmage them, but it's always good to scrimmage a great team like
Florida State. So it's good, a good little rivalry.  
  
Q. You're obviously up for the top Player of the Year Award in college
basketball. Do you feel like in this tournament right now, you've made a
significant statement that, hey, I am the best player in basketball right
now?  
A'JA WILSON: I honestly don't even really know how to answer that question
honestly. I think I'm just kind of doing the same thing I've been doing. My
biggest thing is just being efficient and just going out there and helping my
team get a win. I credit all my teammates for giving me the ball and just
looking for me and just keeping up with me and staying with me.  
  
I'm probably a hard person to deal with but they really do a great job of just
handling me. So I really just give it all to them, and I wouldn't be in the
position that I am to even receive those awards and even be a finalist for
awards such as the National Player of the Year without them. So I really
credit them for just being and keeping up with me.  
  
Q. A'Ja said she didn't really remember or didn't really scrimmage
against South Carolina -- you're South Carolina. Didn't really scrimmage
against Florida State. Does anybody remember scrimmaging against Florida State
and when you learned from that?  
DAWN STALEY: We actually aren't supposed to talk about the scrimmage. So let's
leave those questions alone, because it was a closed-door thing and not
supposed to be publicized.  
  
Q. For A'Ja, and forgive me for not knowing, watching you play last
night, we don't ever see players wear shin guards, and you were talking about
the physicality -- you guys were talking about the physicality. Is there
anything, you want to tell us why you do that and how it helps?  
A'JA WILSON: Last year I was battling with shin issues and I always had kind
of a bad habit of a person kind of kicking me in the shins, and it would
really, really hurt. So they have these things that are molded to my shin,
kind of shin guards.  
  
They really help me because then I know I'm protected, because kind of getting
hit by a bunch of people in that shin area, it doesn't really affect me any
more now that I have my shin guards. That's why I wear them.  
  
Q. Not asking specifically about the scrimmage, but is there a slight
rivalry growing now because you have met in the Elite 8 before and you guys
are getting a little bit more familiarity with each other? For any of the
players, particularly for A'Ja.  
A'JA WILSON: I guess. I feel like we've seen them. We've seen them a lot. I
don't really know exactly. I don't know how they feel about it. But hey, it's
just a game. It's just a game we play.  
  
Q. In watching your opponent last night, they gave up a lot of easy
baskets early in the game and seemed to really make some changes defensively.
I think Oregon State only scored 17 points in the second half. Just for any of
the players, did you see any changes in the way they approached the second
half, and does it make you think you're going to face a team that plays
defense like that tomorrow then, too?  
KAELA DAVIS: We only saw -- we only really got to sit down and watch the
second half. Obviously I feel like that's when Florida State looked the best.  
  
I mean, yeah, obviously like we said, it's a game to go to the Final Four, so
you know, we imagine it's going to be as competitive as possible.  
  
Yeah, I mean, they really turned the defense up, and I think they just --
their whole energy. I think they had a completely different energy, a
completely different focus in the second half. I don't think we need to be
prepared for for a half; I think that's something we need to prepare for for
40 minutes.  
  
Q. For Ty, this might be an awkward question because Coach is sitting so
close to you. How has that relationship grown throughout the year? You've
played the position that Coach obviously demands some of the most of being the
point guard. How has she helped you grow into that role to handle the
responsibilities that you have to be able to run the floor like you do?  
TYASHA HARRIS: She's always in my ear in practice and even in the game. Like
when they are about to shoot free throws, the other team about to shoot free
throws, she'll pull me over and tell me what needs to be done. So just, her
just being in my ear and telling me what's right and what's wrong.  
  
Q. The questions about the scrimmage came up because Sue last night just
talked so much about the respect that she has for your program; that once they
get to know a team like they know you a little bit, she finds herself cheering
for you all year. What does that mean to you to hear that?  
DAWN STALEY: I think it's part of the game. I think when you watch as much
film as we watch, there are certain teams and certain styles that you like.
And certainly, I hope that our team plays a style of play that, you know,
could make any coach proud.  
  
We play hard on both sides of the ball. We try to do the right things. We play
a disciplined type of basketball on both sides of the ball, and when you watch
it so much, you learn to appreciate that. She does have a team in which plays
extremely hard. A lot of us, the players that she has on her team, she won a
recruiting battle.  
  
So I mean, she has the type of players that we like to have in our program and
it's a mutual respect.  
  
Q. You were able to rest a number of your starters in the fourth
quarter; they were not. How much do you think/hope that will make a difference
tomorrow?  
DAWN STALEY: That won't make a difference tomorrow. I can assure you that at
this stage of the game, you just -- just play. You find the energy. You
persevere and you find what it takes to win the game and get to the next stage
of this NCAA Tournament.  
  
So we're not -- they have got a day of rest. They will have a practice today.
They will have the rest of the day to enjoy and rest and watch the NCAA men's
games and the women's games. So I don't think that will play a part in
tomorrow's results.  
  
Q. I know you recruited Shakayla pretty hard way back when. Do you
maintain any relationship with her and what's it like meeting her again two
years later?  
DAWN STALEY: Recruited Shakayla and Nicole Ekhomu both pretty hard. Shakayla
played on the USA team two summers ago, the U-19 in Russia. I kept up with her
because she played for another team. I don't really try to talk to them
afterwards, because I don't like to, you know -- I don't want to meddle in
other people's teams. But got to know her family well, and she's progressed
nicely. She's always one that got away, that you think about what could have
been.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kaela's performance yesterday, maybe break it down
a bit, and how -- the matchup, the backcourt she will have tomorrow against
Florida State, how that matchup looks?  
DAWN STALEY: Kaela is playing some of her best basketball. She saved it up for
this time of the season. She is a player in which -- it's a hard guard for
anybody. She's big. She's 6-2, a perimeter player that can do a lot of things
with the basketball.  
  
I'm impressed with what she does from a defensive standpoint. Obviously it's
well known what she can do from an offensive standpoint. And she's living up
to -- she's living up to her reputation as being a tremendous scorer, and she
does it in so many ways but defensively she is a big presence out there on the
floor.  
  
What we're hoping to utilize, everything that she's doing on both sides of the
ball against a Florida State team which will be very physical, fast, play
fast. So hopefully we'll be able to use some of our length on the perimeter
against their speed.  
  
Q. Last night, I saw you sitting down watching the Oregon State/Florida
State game. What surprised you about the way Florida State managed to come
back after being down 17?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I wasn't surprised. I just think that over the course of
a 40-minute game, wills are going to be imposed on different teams.  
  
I just thought that Florida State imposed their will after the start of the
game. The next 35 minutes, or 32 minutes of the game, they just would not --
they were relentless and would not allow Oregon State to run their sets and be
comfortable in what they were trying to do, and they disrupted them. So it was
really impressive to see them disrupt for as long as they did.  
  
Q. We talked to you the other day about just the challenges of playing
across the country. You have such a good following, and Oregon State is gone,
and they brought a big crowd. Do you think tomorrow night, being that it's a
night game, do you feel like the crowd will be -- there's a good chance of a
better crowd, and what are your thoughts on the attendance?  
DAWN STALEY: I think there were like 4,500 people. And we do lose probably one
of the closest teams to the venue.  
  
I think people are excited to be here. I think you're going to see two of the
top teams in the country vying for a Final Four spot. I think the people here
in Stockton have done a great job of trying to promote it.  
  
I don't know what the turnout will be, but surely, surely, to have, you know,
us and Florida State playing tomorrow night, it's at a decent time, too. 6:00
PM is a great time in which you can come and still get dinner afterwards. We
should have some people coming in, as well. Hopefully our fans, some more of
our fans, can make the trip west after watching our guys play in New York.  
  
Q. You've won I think 151 games in the last five years. You lead the
nation in attendance by a wide margin. What are some of the things that South
Carolina as a program that you're most proud of with how things have developed
to this point?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I'm probably most proud of, you know, how it's all come
together. I think the biggest common denominator in all of it is the type of
people that we've recruited and the type of people that come out to support
our games. It is truly a lifestyle to support our program and the families
that come into our program.  
  
You know, they get a chance to have an experience like no other. The way the
fans support us, both on the road and at home, and just every day life, to go
to the grocery store, to go to the malls. It is somewhat of a hardship because
some of our players are just going out to pick up some things at the mall and
it turns out to be a selfie session, which is, you know, it comes with the
territory.  
  
The way they support us, we make them feel very much a part of our family, and
that's probably the biggest -- the biggest mutual respect that we have for
each other, our fans and our program.  
  
Q. Just seeing your players up here on the podium just laughing, joking
with each other, what's that like for you as a coach? Is it refreshing to see
your players just being so relaxed before such a major game?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, you don't want them uptight. I think tomorrow will bring
a lot of pressure and it won't be a laughing matter at this point. But they
are pretty calm. They are cool. They get along with one another. You know,
they are kids. I want them to enjoy the moment.  
  
There is a time and a place for it all, and I want them to be comfortable. I
want them to be loose. Because the team that gets to play at its normal
composure is the team that is going to probably win the basketball game;
that's closest to what they have played like all season long; approaching it
when the adrenaline settle the down, is the team that will probably get out to
a good start.  
  
Q. Because we like to tell balanced stories, your players talk about a
Lifesaver habit. Do you really eat 20 a game and when your mouth is full, does
it keep you from yelling at them quite so loudly? We have to give you a chance
to respond to these thoughts from your gals.  
DAWN STALEY: Probably more than 20. I would say more than 20. They probably
only see 20 because half of them are in the game.  
  
I don't know, I used to joke around that I wanted fresh breath when I'm
talking to the officials (laughter). No, it's just become a habit. I like
mints. I like mints outside of -- outside of actually coaching. I do,
sometimes, pop one in before a time-out and I'm talking to them, and they have
made a running joke of, things flying out during the time-out. I have yet to
see that yet, though.  
  
Q. Does this go back to even during your playing days in college when
you would snap the rubber band? Are these, maybe not superstitions, but ways
you deal with pressure or coaching or playing?  
DAWN STALEY: Coping mechanisms, huh? I guess it's become a habit. I don't eat
-- I eat probably more fruity stuff outside of the games. But you know, the
way -- I don't know who lines them up, but they line them up so perfectly,
it's enticing. So I have to go out and grab a few of them.  
  
Q. What a great year for South Carolina basketball. The men's game is
about to tip off, if it hasn't already, and the success you are all having
this season. How might this bode for of your programs, the rising tide lifting
both ships?  
DAWN STALEY: It just goes to show, when you are supported like we are
supported from the president to the administrators to our fans, to other
coaches that are at the University of South Carolina; when that type of
support is there, you can succeed abundantly and that's what's happened to
both of our programs from a basketball standpoint.  
  
But our women's soccer team is great. Our football team went to a bowl game.
Our equestrian team, they have been No. 1. They won the National Championship.
Our track team's won national championships.  
  
So when you're supported the way that we have been supported, I think it
becomes part of what can happen, and I'm super proud of Frank. In the five
years that he's been at South Carolina, I know the pain that he's been
through. I used to tell him, "This will be a distant memory." Although he's
probably fueled by what happened maybe five years ago when he first got
started, but I'm sure it makes up. Today, moving forward, it makes up for some
of those hardship years that he had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, again, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon and please welcome Florida State head coach, Sue
Semrau and student athletes Shakalya Thomas, Ivey Slaughter, Leticia Romero,
Brittany Brown and Imani Wright.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're excited to be here and it's a nice ACC/SEC matchup here out
west and have a lot of respect for South Carolina and the job that they do and
looking forward to the matchup.  
  
Q. What do you remember about that South Carolina matchup, your freshman
year, the team playing in its Elite 8, just how tough was that game, and how
much are you looking forward to the rematch tomorrow?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: It was a great match-up. I remember them coming out and it
was a great game. We started off a little slow but as we picked up, it became
like a really intense game. This matchup, to me, it's going to help us redeem
ourselves, like this is what I've personally been looking forward to for the
longest, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit with everybody last night about defense, but
South Carolina hit ten of 16 threes yesterday, and your defense was able to
take that away from Oregon State. How much is that going to factor in tomorrow
in terms of doing what you did yesterday to take players out of the perimeter
game?  
BRITTANY BROWN: It's a big factor, but it's just something, that's what we do.
That's been our bread and butter all year, our biggest difference-maker and
why we're here today is because of our defending and rebounding ability.  
  
So that's just what we're going to hone into again. That's with every opponent
that we play, but as we talked, even with Oregon State, it's a team effort.
It's a collective effort from everyone on the team from our guards to our
post. And a lot of people think that just because you're guarding on the
perimeter, that it's just the guard's responsibility, but it comes a lot from
our posts and hedging and things like that.  
  
So it will be a team effort but we'll just continue to do what we've been
doing all season.  
  
Q. Leticia, and Coach, correct me if this is incorrect. I came across a
note that said in the first 42 years of this program, Florida State had never
had a team hold opponents to 60 points or less over the course of a season,
but in the last two or three years, you all have been able to do that. Does
that sound close to the --  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that sounds like a Steve Stone stat if I ever heard one.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the commitment to defense that this team in
particular with this program in general has made in the last couple three
years?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it's part of us. It's part of our game. It's something
we've been working on since preseason. There are a lot of teams that can
score. So if you want to make it to the top, I think you have to have a really
good defense. I think we have great defenders here, starting with Brittany and
Ivey. I think they are our team leaders in defense, and that gives us a lot of
energy just seeing them, how they fight, they defend, they help each other.
It's just a team effort, like she said. But I'm really confident about our
defense and that's what's going to take us to the next level.  
  
Q. Early in the game, they not only scored baskets but got a lot of
really easy shots, but in the second half, you held them to 18 points. Was
there anything specific you tried to change around defensively from the
struggles early in the game to the absolute shutdown late in the game? And if
you could talk about getting nine steals in one game. It seems like quite a
few.  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think we just picked up our defensive intensity in the
second half. I think in the first half, we kind of played a little timid, and
we had like a lot of jitters, I believe, in the first half.  
  
I think just coming out in the second half, we knew that we had to fight and
we knew we had to get defensive stops, because once we play great defense, it
dictates our offense. And for the steals, I think I just tried to play my best
defense and I think the ball just kind of fell in my hands.  
  
Q. Brittany, we've talked before, and you've told me about how you've
wanted to change this program when you got here and how to build on that. But
you're one gym away from a Final Four. What would it mean for you, for I guess
Ivey and for that senior class to be the program that broke through?  
BRITTANY BROWN: That's just the culture here at Florida State. We're big on
honor and legacy and honoring those that came before us. They set this path
for us and we basically just kind of carried it on.  
  
I think it will be really special for our seniors, but it's just this group,
period. All these girls, if we make it to the final -- we win, we win and make
it to the Final Four, that will be something that Florida State has never done
in program history. So it will be something that we always remember as a
group, so I'm excited for it.  
  
Q. In the first quarter of each NCAA Tournament game, you guys have only
scored 12 points in each first quarter. What is going on with the slow starts,
and what is Sue saying to you guys to snap you out of it and get you back to
where you can play strong offense?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I don't know what's going on. I think if I knew, it wouldn't
happen. Honestly I think we just start really slow, I don't know if it's
confidence or we don't know how the game is going to be or we need something
at the beginning to start playing our game.  
  
What Coach was telling us was to come grab the game. Just attack them, be
aggressive and not wait or hold back or wait for them to make mistakes. We
have to wait for them to make mistakes. That's going to be our biggest focus,
too, starting the game well against these teams.  
  
Q. Going off the slow starts, but coming back off of slow starts, you've
outscored opponents, I think it's 192 to 118 over the final three quarters.
What does it say about this team that you are still managing to dominate
opponents, even after slow starts?  
SUE SEMRAU: You know, it's interesting, I don't think that players always hear
you in the huddles. And so what Leti is saying, and you're asking, what are we
saying, it's to remember who we are defensively. We can't -- we got great
looks. We didn't knock them down it.  
  
Now we have to not allow that offensive -- it's efficiency, but we haven't
gotten productivity, effect our defensive end of the floor. I don't know what
that's been because we were exactly opposite the beginning of the year. You
know, we would come out really strong.  
  
So I don't think it's necessarily a habit. I don't think it has anything to do
-- I think it's a big stage and we hadn't played in a week, so that's part of
it, as well.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on what's being said in huddles, I looked over and
it looked like Leti is leading the huddle. How good is it to see players
taking responsibility for what's happening on the floor?  
SUE SEMRAU: That's something we've worked really hard to develop, and as
coaches, we stay away. I mean, we've got a 2:45 timeout. So if your players
are sitting there waiting for and you walk in with two minutes or 2:30 to
talk, they are only going to hear the last bit, anyway.  
  
So that communication that they have developed and the confidence to hold one
another accountable to give instruction and to receive instruction and to
respond to each other, we've worked really hard at that and that's a big
difference in our huddles right now.  
  
Q. There's a lot of communities around the country that have held Sweet
16s for either men or women, but Stockton is obviously something new for this
community. Could you reflect on the days you've been here and how things have
gone?  
SUE SEMRAU: Stockton has done a tremendous job. I didn't know what the crowd
would look like yesterday. We had three teams from the East Coast that were
here. It was a tremendous crowd. There were people that came down from
Sacramento, up from San Francisco, here in the local area. It was really
impressive that we had that kind of atmosphere for an NCAA women's game.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played in 2015, looking back, I think you guys
either, they didn't lead -- they barely led for I think the first 38 minutes
and then took it right at the end but it seems like you guys don't really talk
about it as one that got away. Did you feel that way in the moment, or what
were the emotions coming -- thinking back on how that kind of went?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, we did feel like that. I remember it was; it was three
possessions, and Tiffany Mitchell hitting that one in the corner that was a
dagger for us. It was disappointing.  
  
At the same time, there was a lot of growth in those young ladies and in our
program as a result. You know, I don't -- I think it's two really good
programs, two elite programs, that get a chance to matchup here tomorrow
night. A lot is on the line, but more importantly, these two programs and how
solid they have become and the young women that are being produced from these
programs, I think that's what's so important. A possession or two here or
there, there's a lot bigger things in life.  
  
Q. A'Ja Wilson is one of those kind of impressive physical specimens
when you look at her and then you watch her play. What's kind of your thought
on that matchup tomorrow, your front court?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, A'Ja is outstanding. Not only in her ability and her
stature, but her work ethic. Her skill, her determination; she's one of the
most elite players to ever play college basketball.  
  
And it doesn't stop there. They have tremendous players and two of them have
played in the ACC, with Kayla Davis and Allisha Gray, we have seen them for
another of years and they are tremendous player. We recruited Tyasha Harris,
tremendous guard.  
  
I think you just go down the line and they have a tremendous lineup. And I
like the matchups. It's interesting that they are having to play a little bit
differently now without Alaina Coates, but they are doing a great job with
that. If you look at their postseason numbers, they are doing some great
things.

_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 100, Quinnipiac 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley,
and student athletes Kaela Davis and Allisha Gray.  
  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it was great to get out, to get out there and play another
game. It seemed like we were off for a long time. I thought our players came
out ready to play on both sides of the ball and it was a really exciting game
for us, and we were really up for the challenge of playing Quinnipiac, and I'm
glad we get a chance to move on.  
  
Q. What were you guys doing early in the game defensively to shut them
down? You started with a 16-0 run, and seemed like they couldn't do anything
on offense.  
KAELA DAVIS: I think our biggest thing was obviously pressuring outside the
three-point line. I've honestly never seen a team that could shoot the ball as
well as them. So our biggest thing was just making them put the ball on the
floor, you know, and if we had to give up a two, we'd much rather give up a
two rather than a three.  
  
ALLISHA GRAY: And like Coach said, just staying engaged. Like Kaela said, they
are a great three-point shooting team. So we tried our best to run them off
the three-point line, also.  
  
Q. For the players. Even though Quinnipiac had a great run so far in the
tournament, a lot of people didn't really know much about them coming into the
tournament, and obviously you guys didn't take them for granted. How did you
-- what was your mindset of not taking a mid-major like that for granted and
coming out so fast?  
ALLISHA GRAY: When we come out, we play every team the same. Doesn't matter
what name is on the jersey. We come out to play. Obviously they had a good
run, but we still got a mission to complete and that's to make it to the Final
Four National Championship.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I second that.  
  
Q. Kaela, you had a nice offensive game today. Was the basket really big
for you out there?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I guess so. It doesn't matter, get my feet set, just making
sure, kind of staying in rhythm. Like Coach said, it feels like we've been on
for a long time with the gap between games. I think it's just like I said,
just finding rhythm and staying in a rhythm.  
  
Q. How much of an emphasis was there just to be able to get off to a
fast start, especially after the way the first two NCAA Tournament games kind
of went?  
ALLISHA GRAY: The main thing for us is to come out strong the first five
minutes and then take the game from there. We definitely want to stay
aggressive and continue playing South Carolina basketball.  
  
Q. Kaela, the Elite 8 game, players through the years have said this is
almost one of the hardest games because you're just one step away from the
Final Four, which is where everybody wants to get. What are the priorities for
an Elite 8 game mentally and also from an X's and O's perspective?  
KAELA DAVIS: Honestly I have no idea. It's my first time being here.  
  
But no, I think it's, like I said, we're going to play basketball. We're going
to play the way that we know how to play. No matter who is in front of us, we
have to play hard. We have to come ready to play no matter who it is, as it
was today.  
  
But for us, we're going to sit here, watch both these teams. It's two really
good teams. Two really experienced teams. Like I said, we are going to come
out and play our game and play hard.  
  
ALLISHA GRAY: I second that.  
  
Q. Is there something specifically challenging about the Elite 8 round,
because you're so close to the Final Four at that point?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, I think for teams that have a goal of going to the
Final Four and winning the National Championship, it is that step that, you
know, can prevent you. Either you can overlook it -- not overlook it, but you
can try to get ahead of yourself. I think for us, we just need to stay in
character.  
  
We need to approach it much like we approached every game of the season.
Although the stakes are a little bit higher. Just keep it as normal as
possible, and the teams that are able to stay the course and keep it normal
are the ones that can open up a game.  
  
Q. You guys started off 9-0 run, they called a time-out and you go up
16-0 before they finally score. Almost a shutout. Being the type of player you
were, how proud of the team were you for the way they played defense?  
DAWN STALEY: I was incredibly proud of our team to be able to lock in to the
game plan, and execute it. I thought we did have a few lulls in the second
quarter where we got careless with the basketball, and we also let some
shooters loose. They had a really good second quarter.  
  
So we have to continue to not have those lapses and put 40-minute games
together at this stage of the game, because we'll play another great team on
Monday night, and if you, you know, allow teams to play to their strengths,
they can really make you pay for it.  
  
Q. Just defensively, what did you feel like was working and executing in
that first quarter?  
DAWN STALEY: The biggest thing for us in this particular game is our speed. We
wanted to speed them up. We didn't want them to be comfortable in their sets
and allowing them to read what our defense is. And then staying in front of
them. Just staying in between them and the basket and not allowing them to get
ahead of the possession, because once they are ahead of the possession, it's
hard to fight your way back, and they will get open threes when it's like
that.  
  
Q. You had a lot of concerns about this team yesterday, but you were
also very complimentary of them in getting this far. Where do you see the
program going? Do you see them as a team that could be here regularly?  
DAWN STALEY: I do. Because the style of play at this time of the year, if
you're not used to playing this. And we're not -- we weren't. We had four days
to prepare for this style of play, and usually you get, you know, if you
advance, if they advance past the first round, you have one chemistry and they
believe in each other. This type of thing can happen on a regular basis.  
  
Q. You've had a handful of games now without Alaina in the starting
lineup. What are you liking about the team and your starters, in particular,
at this point, and what can they do that maybe they didn't quite have with
Alaina there?  
DAWN STALEY: With Alaina out, I think it just leaves a big void. Like driving
lanes were there for us. It gives A'Ja Wilson an opportunity to work the paint
a little bit more and maybe feel like it's not so clogged up. And I thought
tonight, or today, they played, almost double teamed her.  
  
But for the guards, like a Kaela Davis, she's getting to the basket a little
bit more. Allisha Gray can play more downhill. Bianca Cuevas thrives off of
the space that's left with the void of not having Alaina Coates in there. But
we do, we feel from a rebounding and defensive standpoint, we feel her
presence missed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach Staley. We'll see you Monday.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Ivey Slaughter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28385)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
FLORIDA STATE 66,  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're thrilled obviously with the win over a great Oregon State
team. You know, to win 31 games, you have to be a very, very good basketball
team, and they do a tremendous job with the program. And having lost some
players last year and having some new kids step into roles, just really want
to compliment the job that Scott has done with his team.  
  
As far as our team goes, it all starts on the defensive ends. Ivey Slaughter
and Brittany Brown have really been the two catalysts in that area. We started
slowly. Again, that big gap of time, I think maybe is what's kind of tough for
us, but started slowly.  
  
But for Ivey to open up the second half with that big steal, I think gave us a
ton of energy, and that's what she can do. Nine steals in a postseason game, I
understand is a record, that couldn't go to a more deserving young lady. For
Shakayla Thomas to have another double-double; for Leticia to work as hard as
she did to get the ball, they made it really, really hard.  
  
You know, I thought Brittany did a tremendous job on Sydney, and when we said
it was going to be a team effort to stop somebody that is as talented as
Sydney Wiese, and to keep her in single-digit scoring is a tremendous fear for
our basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start of the game and maybe what you guys
were thinking and saying in huddles when you were looking at the scoreboard?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I honestly don't know what we were thinking, because we start
really slow. I think -- I don't know, I think we hold back, we weren't being
aggressive. I mean, they start really good. They knew we could shoot the three
point line, the three pointer, and they just didn't let us shoot. They denied
us. We didn't know how to play, and I think the biggest thing for us today was
that we were able to come back and to overcome that.  
  
Q. Ivey, 11 points, nine steals, against a very tall Oregon State team.
What was it like out there for you, and was this the most physical game that
you've played in as a Seminole?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I would say it was one of the most physical games that I've
played in. Yeah, they were very big. They had really good posts. They can
rebound really well, and I think that I just tried to use my athleticism as
much as I could, and I think it really helped us.  
  
Q. Your coach touched on this, coming out in the second half with
defense, but for both of you, what were the things that stuck out in your mind
as what you needed to do to come out that fast and just take over?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think getting stops on defense. We know how good our defense
can be, and honestly, like for me, seeing what Ivey was doing in defense,
getting steals, just being everywhere, gave us a lot of security, and that
confidence transferred to the offensive end of the floor, too. I think she
really changed a lot of things in this game.  
  
Q. For Ivey, when you see Leti come out the way she does, just how much
confidence does that give your basketball team, and how much does that open up
your offense?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: It gives us confidence. I believe like Leti said, we came out
a little slow. We had a lot of jitters and I think that we all just tried to
fight as much as we can. We have nothing to lose. You know, it's win or go
home, and we knew that, and especially when Leti start going, when she starts
going, everybody else gets going, especially on the offensive end. I think it
was amazing that she got going.  
  
Q. How much pride do you take in doing all these plays that are
considered the dirty work. You take the charges; you get the steals; you are
always up in someone's face. Talk about the level of pride you take in that
type of play.  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think the whole world knows that I'm not the best scorer or
I'm not the best defender on the team, but I just know that --  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Yes, you are.  
  
LETICIA ROMERO: She definitely is.  
  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I just know that with my rebounding and me taking charges and
helping the team, that's what they need for us to win the game and I do it to
my best ability.  
  
Q. When did you realize you had good hands and quick hands, and were
able to make those kind of plays, and have you ever had a game like that?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: Well, funny story, I started doing gymnastics when I was
younger, and I guess that helped me with flexibility, quick agilities. But
then my mom made me decide I had to play basketball or do gymnastics, and
gymnastics was very costly and I chose basketball. And I think that really
helped me a lot with just my hands, my hand-eye coordination.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're happy you did.  
  
Q. What age did you decide this?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: It was fifth grade. Around 12 years old.  
  
Q. When you're down 21-4 in that second half, that third quarter, was
that kind of the moment when you first took the lead that you felt like all
the momentum shifted?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it was the steal from Ivey honestly. Because I was
confident that, you know, after -- in the second half, we were going to have a
different kind of game.  
  
I saw everybody was locked in. So everybody, you know, ready to go to fight,
and just seeing that the first possession you get a steal and get it going.
That gave me so much energy to just play my game and help the team.  
  
Q. This is going to be a familiar opponent in terms of this round, and
you guys a couple years ago played an Elite 8 game against South Carolina.
What do you remember about that game and what do you bring into this game
now?  
LETICIA ROMERO: What I remember, is that it was a fight. Like we -- I remember
finishing the game and my whole body was hurting. We fought and they did, too.
It was a really good game. We ended up losing by, I think it was four points
-- six, actually.  
  
I cannot even tell you like the little details, but it was just a battle, and
whoever want it more and made plays and all of these things, I think it's
what's going to come down to.  
  
Q. What kind of experience do you gain playing for Spain? How does that
help in moments like this, in pressure-filled games like this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think leadership you see in other players. I think I learned
a lot from professional players. You see the national team, and they are all
professional players playing overseas. They had really good careers, and they
know how to change things. They know how to act whenever we're down. They know
how to motivate teammates.  
  
I think I try to bring that to our team this year, and especially the
mentality of, you know, we have to make the most of it, every single day. You
cannot just go throw the motions for the whole week and expect to come to the
game and be good. I think our team this year has been really good this year in
terms of coming prepared to every practice.  
  
Q. You nearly had a triple-double on Russell Westbrook. How do you
attest to the versatility you have? Most of your rebounds are offensive. So
how do you attest to your versatility all across the board?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think because I'm quicker than a lot of posts that I'm able
to get around them and use my feet to be able to get rebounds, and our coaches
told us from the start of the week that when we knew we were playing Oregon
State, that they were an amazing rebounding team, and we couldn't just have
one shot. We had to go get second- and third-chance points, and I think I just
took that to heart, and knowing that I can rebound really well, that that's
what I tried to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the start of the game, and what you were thinking
when you looked up at the scoreboard, and was it a change that you needed to
make to get things to shift, or do you think it was doing what you guys
usually do?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that's a great question. I was stunned. I was stunned that
we were missing the shots we were missing. I felt like the defensive end was
affected by our offensive in-production; unproduction.  
  
But we knew that if we could convince them how good they were defensively, how
good we are defensively, that things could change. Yeah, I think Brittany
Brown really started to become an aggressor, and a lot of people followed
suit.  
  
Q. How do you convince a team in the Sweet 16: You're really good on
defense. How do you say it? How do you motivate them to actually do?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that's a great question. This team, I wanted to spend
another week with this team, because I want them so badly to believe in
themselves even more than they do. I don't know if you've seen the Dove ads
where they sketch a woman who is describing herself, and then they sketch a
woman who has just met this other woman, and they ask that woman to sketch the
same woman.  
  
And we describe ourselves often as not as beautiful as we are, whereas another
man or woman, will describe us as more warm and open and the smile. So we're
our worst critic.  
  
They also did a guys's commercial with that, too, and it was pretty
interesting that the guys thought they were a lot better looking than they
really are.  
  
But we talked about that, and I thought it was interesting that Dove sponsored
some things in our locker room, and we were able to go back to that, because
we had showed them that, that clip, and really to help them believe that they
are better than they are.  
  
Q. It seemed like the last media time-out of the game, you guys were
only up maybe a basket or two. That time-out, it seemed like your seniors were
doing most of the talking in the huddle. What were they saying, and then just
how proud are you of them for finishing the game the way they did?  
SUE SEMRAU: They were locked in. And we were talking about the adjustments
that we were going to be making, and they did a phenomenal job of
communicating those things to each other in the huddle, and then on the court.
And you can have one person mess up, and bam, game changes. And they locked
each other in: Nikki Ekhomu came in and did a great job as a young freshman on
Sydney Wiese; they locked her in as well; Ama Degbeon coming in the game for a
defensive adjustment. All the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Just what memories stand out from the 2015 game against South
Carolina, and what does it mean to meet them again at this juncture?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, you know, it's really not even that game. We scrimmaged them
the last two years, and we love that opportunity, because we have so much
respect for South Carolina and the job that Dawn's done and the program and
team that they have put together.  
  
Really you look back to those scrimmage situations, and as a scrimmage
partner, you follow them throughout the year because you're a fan. Just have a
ton of respect for who they are and how far they have come.  
  
Q. What is it about the Elite 8 game? I've talked to coaches and players
through the years who say this is the toughest of all of them, because you're
sitting at the foot of the Final Four; if you can talk about that a little
bit. And Ivey, you talked about not seeing yourself. She's sitting up there,
saying I'm not the best at this; I'm not the best at that. She had a game-
changing performance for you guys tonight.  
SUE SEMRAU: I'll address that first, because there's so many young women that
just -- and you love it, because they are not cocky, and at the same time,
it's a confidence that we're trying to instill.  
  
We talk in our program about becoming strong, beautiful, powerful women.
That's more important to me than whether or not we go to the Final Four is
that that character is developed in these young women, and I have an amazing
staff that helps us with that.  
  
This game, you know, it's so interesting, because I remember when I was a
young coach hearing people say, why is your goal the Final Four? Because then
you're going to get to the Final Four and you've achieved your goal.  
  
And so I think, but that's what, again, what people hear. That's the pinnacle.
And for so many programs, that seems to be the pinnacle, and so there's a lot
of pressure that is put on to get to that game. So I think that's probably a
big reason for it, and you know, we've experienced it before, so I think that
is a benefit for us that we didn't have maybe a few years back.  
  
Q. What are some of the quirks or the intensity that you see in Dawn
Staley and wanting to scrimmage with her program every year?  
SUE SEMRAU: Quirks?  
  
Q. Her team was talking about her Lifesaver chomping habit, and Tara
VanDerveer was talking about snapping rubber bands when she was playing at
Virginia. She's intense, and you've seen her over the years and want to
scrimmage her each season.  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, absolutely. I have so much respect for her as a member of
the ACC. We're really proud of the level of play that she brought to the ACC.  
  
As a competitor, I don't look at the quirks. I look at her team and what her
team is able to do. I think that really speaks -- her team speaks volumes for
who she is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations, and we'll see you Monday.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Gabriella Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30898)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
FLORIDA STATE 66, Oregon State 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State Beavers head coach, Scott Rueck and
our student athletes Sydney Wiese and Gabriella Hanson.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I don't know at this point if there's anything real
profound to say, other than the obvious. I love this team. I just absolutely
love them. This is -- I just told them, you know you're doing something right
and you're part of something special when you never want it to end. And this
was a group that was just an absolute blast to go to work with every day. They
gave everything they had, every day. Every day. And it was demanded out of
this group by these two sitting next to me.  
  
Today, you know, obviously started the way we wanted. We were playing against
a great team, and Florida State played an awesome game today. Their
athleticism hurt us. They hurt us on the boards, even though we won the
boards. You know, this game had so many stretches in it that were big runs for
us, for them, and then finally for them. And the hot team wins in March, and
they were that today.  
  
And so, so it ends for us. But I could not be more broad of what this group
has done. It's hard to look at the big picture at the moment, but the big
picture is crazy, all the firsts that these two have experienced, over their
four years, along with our other seniors, gives me a huge sense of pride to be
a part of it. It's a blessing to be their coach.  
  
It was also a blessing to look up and see so much orange today. We knew Beaver
Nation would travel and they didn't disappoint. We hoped for a longer weekend,
but credit Florida State for a great game today and a great win.  
  
Q. What changed when they started chipping away at the lead?  
SYDNEY WIESE: They were starting to sag in the paint a little bit more, and so
in the first quarter, we were able to get a few layups, and we were really
aggressive drawing fouls, getting to the rim.  
  
But I think in the second quarter they adjusted, and they have always played
aggressive on on-balls, and so that threw us off a bit. We weren't able to see
or make reads as quick as we should have, and I think we called plays to try
and get down low, but they were doing a really good job taking that away.  
  
Q. Sydney, at halftime, what was this team's mentality like?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, everyone was speaking during halftime. We were saying, to
go back to being that aggressive team offensively, and they got a roll going
on their offensive side of the floor. And so we were talking a lot of
strategy, getting through on-balls, trying to slow down Romero from getting
any clean looks and getting our hands up. We were just trying to come together
and focus on things that we can control and fix going into the second half.  
  
Q. Coach was saying it's the type of run that you don't want to end.
What's going through your mind now that the career is over and that there's
not a next game coming up?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: Well, I'm proud. I'm very proud of what we've been able to
accomplish over our four years. I don't think anyone expected us to do what
we've done, and for that, I'm extremely grateful and proud. I'll never be
ashamed to say that I was a player at Oregon State. But it is hard, because
you put so much time and effort into four years, and no one sees what goes on
behind the scenes. No one sees all the -- just everything that goes on.  
  
So it's tough, but at the end of the day, I'm so grateful to have played with
Sydney Wiese. What she's been able to do is uncanny. It's unlike anything I've
ever seen, and I'm just extremely proud to call her my friend, my sister
[tearing] sorry. Just proud.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: I agree with what Gabby said. It has exceeded expectations
[tearing] and we're a family forever. And so as painful as it is, we've done
some incredible things that we will be able to cherish for the rest of our
lives. And incredibly thankful for Coach Rueck especially. He started all of
it, and so he's the one that brought us all here. He had faith in us from the
beginning. The senior class is so special. I think once we set foot on campus,
we were sisters right from the jump, and we have maintained that throughout
the four years and it's going to continue on. More than just basketball, I
think the season might be over, but these friendships and these relationships
are going to go on forever.  
  
Q. What was the most surprising about the way today went?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: I can't say if it's really a surprise. I think, you know,
you just -- you expect everyone's best effort this time of the year, for sure,
and they certainly -- like we started well but they started coming back and
hitting really, really tough shots. And it's kind of hard to do something
about that. But you just try and make it as uncomfortable for them.  
  
I think we could have done things to adapt a little bit better but it's tough.
They played a great game. Just give them credit. They hit tough shots and you
know, we tried to get back. It's definitely hard, once you've kind of dug a
hole to get back against a team like this. Their athleticism is very
impressive.  
  
So you know, it's nothing really surprising, but I think we just, you know,
thought we had a great chance.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Florida State's guard, Leticia Romero,
she ended up scoring 18 points and one of the first really big games she's had
in a little while. What was it like out there against a Spanish Olympian?  
SYDNEY WIESE: She's good. I mean, bottom line, she's a great player. She was
hitting tough pull-up jumpers. I know our game plan going in was to take away
the three-point line because she's one of the best three-point shooters in the
country. So we were doing what we could against her, and it felt like we were
right there, but it's never close enough with her. And so she did a great job
running the show, hitting shots, and whenever they needed a big play, she came
through for them.  
  
So I mean, Gabby did amazing stuff against her in the second half, and really
made it tough for her to get any good looks. And so we adjusted and we did the
best that we could against her, but I think that she got going early in the
first half and carried that through for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that stretch to open the second half, because
obviously coming in at halftime, there are things you want to do and they come
right back out at you again and take the lead.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, starting it off with the turnover, you know, didn't help.
That hurt. That created momentum for them.  
  
You know, we talked about being the team that did what they did coming out,
and you never know exactly how it's going to go. But you give them credit.
Offensive rebound put-back, transition bucket, and then the turnover number
jumped obviously in the second half a lot for us as we were pressing a little
bit.  
  
And so, what can you say? I mean, you give them credit. They came out and hit
shots.  
  
Q. After the first quarter, how confident were you in your team's
ability to put this away after being up as much as 17 in the first?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I don't know if you're ever confident against a team as
good as this. You know you're playing well but you know they are capable of
it, as well, so you want to sustain.  
  
I thought our defense, I thought we had a little stretch early in the second
quarter where we did not have the same intensity and that gave them momentum,
for whatever reason that is, I'm not sure why. But we're not challenging quite
the same, and shots go down. When you're not within arm's length, you don't
have a chance. Those shots are going to go down for them. I thought we did a
phenomenal job for the most part, making them take tough shots. They hit tough
shots. Transition hurt us, turnovers hurt us, and offensive rebounds hurt us,
even though we won the boards, they had 11, and they only had 5-0 boards in
the second half but they converted every single one of them or drew a foul.
Those hustle plays and their athleticism I thought was the difference.  
  
Q. Both teams had a tough time behind the arc. Was that the defense by
both teams or just off shooting?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great question. I think that we both made each other
really work. We chased them hard all day, and when this team scores below 60,
typically they are susceptible to losing. Same is true for us. And that's
usually one of our advantages, is knocking threes down and having the
discipline to eliminate other teams in that regard. If you would have told me
before the game, they don't hit a three, I would have said, we probably won
the game.  
  
So for us, you know, obviously it wasn't a great shooting game for us,
especially from out there. Why, I'm not sure. The shots that Syd got,
definitely a few of them were forced, but she also got shots that she hits.
The ball just didn't go down. I thought we got some good looks and it just
didn't drop. And when you look at this game, you look at every statistical
category, the one that really stands out is turnovers. But other than that,
it's shooting the ball, and we just did not shoot well enough to beat this
team today.  
  
Q. Florida State, 0-5 from three point range, Thomas -- what does it say
about Florida State being able to survive and advance against you guys, even
though their bread and butter was kind of taken away from them?  
SCOTT RUECK: Great teams have ways of winning, any which way and that's what
we've done all year. That's how you get to near 30 wins; 31, 28, you get there
by being adaptable, playing fast, playing slow, playing through adversity,
playing through foul trouble, whatever it may be.  
  
Today we took that away and they hurt us inside. I think it just put more
emphasis on offensive rebounds, on transition. If you look at their transition
points or points off turnovers, those were created by their defense, and so
they rode their defense today and their defense created points for them. Our
defense did not.  
  
Q. What do you tell them after something like this?  
SCOTT RUECK: There's a lot to tell them. There's a lot to tell them. I had
three minutes and maybe not even that long in there with them, and I just told
them I loved them. What they have done is incredible. And last year's group
was very similar, and this group carried it forward, and they have established
a culture that is going to remain after them, and they have been everything a
coach could hope for; and how hard it was. For what this team accomplished
this year, to be picked fifth, and some people thought fifth in the Pac-12 was
generous, to be honest, before the season; to barely be ranked before the
season and to win this conference for the third straight year, which is the
best in the country this year, you know, that speaks directly to their
leadership and how hard we had to push, and that's what Gabby was alluding to.
Nobody sees all that stuff behind the scenes that got this team with so much
transition going into this year to play at a level capable of being a Sweet 16
team or beyond.  
  
And so I'm just so super proud of them. I don't think that their careers are
going to be defined by today. That would be a mistake in my opinion. Certainly
we would like to continue to play. We wanted to win today. But what they have
accomplished and all the firsts; nobody would argue if you hung all four of
them up in Gill Coliseum. I mean, that's what they have done.  
  
Thank you, everyone.

_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 100, Quinnipiac 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, and please welcome Quinnipiac Bobcats head
coach, Tricia Fabbri and our student athletes, Jen Fay and Adily Martucci.  
  
First we will have an opening statement from Coach Fabbri, and then we will
open up to questions for our student athletes.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: I'd just like to congratulate South Carolina moving on into the
Elite 8. I thought they were very good all day long. We knew we would have our
hands full.  
  
And I said yesterday, I think the lone remark I did say, I knew they were
really good defensively and it was very -- they disrupted us offensively in
terms of really feeling comfortable. That said, I thought we were really
playing very quickly with our shots to start the game, and just looking at our
numbers, we ended up shooting 43 percent overall, which isn't terrible.  
  
But South Carolina lived up to their No. 1 seed all game long, and they were
tough. They were really tough today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start and you know, not only from the
scoreboard from the hole that you guys were in, but what it did mentally to
sort of get off to that start?  
JEN FAY: The first two games we played in the tournament I thought we got off
to really good starts. It wasn't obviously the same this time around. But I
mean, they came out shooting the lights out and we just tried to stay in it
and play hard.  
  
Q. What did Coach Fabbri tell you in that last moment as you walked off
the court?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Just congratulated me. I wasn't too worried about like what
was being said. More of just embracing her for the last time, at least on the
court. Just having a moment with her, that's all. I don't know if like I
remember any of the specific words said, but just hugging my coach.  
  
Q. Either one of you, but Coach talked about how defensively, she knew
coming in they were a problem, but offensively, they were an issue, too. Can
you talk about the problems they caused for you there, too?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Yeah, they shot lights out. Our game plan was to really try to
help off of our players to help our bigs with Wilson. And something's got to
give when that happens. Those threes really were daggers. I felt like they
shot 100 percent from the three-point line; it felt like that. They shot very
well.  
  
Q. Defensively, did they do anything that surprised you, or was it
basically what you knew was coming but done exceptionally well?  
JEN FAY: We ran the same offense that we've been running all year that's been
working really well. I think the difference was that they were just a little
bit faster, a little bit stronger and a little bit bigger and I think it took
its toll as the game went on.  
  
Q. What have these past five years meant to you?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Going to make me -- waterworks over here. Indescribable. Life
changing. The best years of my life. I'm just so proud to be a Bobcat and to
be a part of this family. It's really hard to describe my five years year
because it's been so amazing and just the growth that I've witnessed with our
program and within myself. It's life changing.  
  
Q. I'd like both players to answer. Could you guys just talk, what
changed for this program in the last two weeks?  
JEN FAY: We put our school on the map. Not only do people know how to
pronounce our cool now but they also know who we are and what we stand for and
what we're all about. I think that's the biggest thing is that we left our
mark.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I'm also, I think we inspired a lot of people back home, and
just different teams on campus. And yeah, it's just inspiring to be an
inspiration.  
  
JEN FAY: Also the mid-major teams that can be in our position now; I think
we've given them a pathway to follow. I think that's pretty cool, too.  
  
Q. What changed? Maybe the bar is different for your program than it
was.  
TRICIA FABBRI: Yeah, it's a great question. We clearly had stated prior to the
start of the season, that getting into the tournament was not the end game
anymore for this program; that winning games was the goal.  
  
And accomplishing that, this day today for us, having the experience while
this loss stings; and obviously South Carolina was so good, and the margin of
victory is not easy to swallow.  
  
But it now, for us, we obviously measured up against one of the top programs
in the country. We clearly know where we stand. We clearly now have our next
steps in the program and where we go now, another route and strategy, is being
hatched.  
  
So how we got here, there was a good foundation set. Not many people outside
our region knew about it, and now we're going to use how everyone knows how to
say Quinnipiac; a week ago, no one knew much about us.  
  
Now everyone in women's basketball has paid attention to our story, and we
plan to use that. Now getting a taste of the Sweet 16, being here the second
weekend will now be a part of what we want to continue to build upon for this
program going forward.  
  
Q. Individual coaches and players and individual accounts in the MAC
have been Tweeting and rooting you guys on, and it seemed like they were along
on this ride with you. What does it mean to play in a conference that has so
much respect between all the programs?  
TRICIA FABBRI: The MAC has such great coaching camaraderie that it doesn't
surprise me at all. We have a school and we have a coach in Bryan Georges;
that this has been accomplished before, so we knew it could be done again.  
  
We talk as coaches about the conference getting multi-bid schools in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a goal of ours. We have Joe Frager, who has won a national
II Division Championship. We have Patty Coyle, who has coached in the WNBA. We
have recent hires in Heather Vulin, and if you look at her resumé, coming from
the BCS schools; and you have Ali Jacques, who has done a good job of turning
a program around at Siena U; Jada Pierce, you look at the resumé. In recent
hires, it is a league full of great coaches in the MAC, and the league is --
we bond together because we know that together we can do even more for this
mid-major.  
  
So this is a big deal on our success across the board in the conference. We're
excited about the direction that the conference is going, about getting more
teams into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. In that first quarter what do you feel like they were doing
defensively and what was it preventing you guys from being able to do?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Well, certainly, I felt like we were playing offensive
basketball. Fast forward, we were not as calm as we had been. And then when a
couple of our shots, where the right shot didn't go in, we were trying to play
too quickly instead of calmly.  
  
And I think that was obviously due because of South Carolina, Jen said it:
Their size, speed and length was disruptive to us. And then, we did, we kind
of -- have to credit South Carolina. But I thought (power interruption) and my
staff certainly enjoyed the most, and ultimately that's the greatest joy in
coaching is watching the maturity and knowing that you in some way, hope that
you helped, and that's the beauty in coaching. Adily is no exception.  
  
Q. At the end of the first quarter, obviously the first quarter wasn't
what you wanted to be. What did you say to the team to get back into it?  
TRICIA FABBRI: They were saying it to themselves: One possession, let's
defend, let's get after it. We took good care of the basketball. Let's just
settle down and set screens.  
  
I thought, you know, we just didn't play as well together as we did over the
weekend and I again, certainly South Carolina had everything to do with that,
but we had made so many good plays, good basketball plays playing against
Miami and Marquette, credit South Carolina.  
  
But I thought we could have done, you know, hopefully just made more plays. I
thought we were not as moving and cutting and reading and playing as well as a
unit today. But again, I can't say it enough. I'm being repetitive, sorry,
South Carolina had a lot to do with that.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning. I'm pleased to welcome South Carolina Gamecocks
coach, Dawn Staley.  
  
DAWN STALEY: We're excited to be in Stockton. We got here yesterday and we got
a couple of -- we got a practice in yesterday, and we're pretty excited about
the challenges that we're faced within this region. We play a tough Quinnipiac
basketball team that we've been preparing for for the past couple of days, and
hopefully that will pay off tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Do you feel like with how successful this team has been, sometimes
it's been a little overlooked, kind of how young it is, and how few seniors
there are, especially with Alaina now out.  
DAWN STALEY: We just approach things the same way. We just try to prep our
players to play each game, and obviously there are a lot of moving parts from
the previous years to this year. Just having new faces, and actually our
perimeter play is totally new in the starting lineup. I just thought they
embraced their roles, and when you embrace your role, the team, you, your
individual self shines and the team shines; and we've been able to combine the
two.  
  
Q. You mentioned the word "tough" in talking about Quinnipiac. What else
do you know about them and how much have you seen them?  
DAWN STALEY: Very skilled team. Very unselfish team. You know, when you look
at their stats, the thing that jumps off the page is the amount of assists to
field goals, is quite an incredible stat that jumps off the page. And that's a
team in which loves to share the basketball. Makes it very difficult for the
opponent.  
  
They love to get ahead of the possession. They get you rocking and rolling
from a defensive standpoint. They are very poised and patient, and they wait
until you make the mistake defensively and make you pay.  
  
So very tough, skilled, unselfish, and watching them play, not surprised that
they are where they are.  
  
Q. How is Allisha, and how much -- how effective do you expect her to
be?  
DAWN STALEY: Allisha practiced. Full practice yesterday. So she's ready to go.  
  
Q. What was it?  
DAWN STALEY: Hamstring. Bad Charley horse.  
  
Q. It seems like your team has been out here a lot in recent years, out
West and in northern California. I recall several years ago when you had Tara
come over and talk to that group. Your program has come a long way since then.
Could you sort of take us through what you've done to bring the program to
this level?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, we've experienced quite a lot of success over the past
years. You know, I attribute that to a lot of things. I attribute that to some
of the former players who believed in our vision when there was no vision for
them to believe in. They believed in the people that made up our program, our
coaching staff.  
  
And then when you have that, along with playing in -- I know some of the
Pac-12 teams will beg to differ, but I think we play in the best conference in
the country. When you have that kind of platform that pushes you every day,
every game, you know, if you can get lucky and get some talented players, you
can experience success in a fair amount of time.  
  
And that's kind of what happened to us where the people and the platform
matched up, and we got lucky and got some great recruits and we just stuck
with it.  
  
I think the main thing is, you have to stay the course, no matter what
happens. You'll lose some games that you're not supposed to lose. You'll win
some games that you're not supposed to and -- you'll win some games you're not
supposed to win, and if you just stay the course, success is bound to happen.  
  
Q. Part of the success of your program has been your fan attendance.
You've built such an incredible fan base at South Carolina. Is it tough now
flying across the country and playing so far away from that group of people
that has been so supportive?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it's hard on our fans because they have been there. They
have supported at home. They do travel. We'll have some fans that will be
here, but it wouldn't be anything like if it was a little bit closer to where
we are. And you know, for them, I feel for them because it's a hardship.
Monetarily, it's hard for them to get out here and support us in the way that
they would like to support us.  
  
But at the same time, they will have watch parties and they will send their
support and they will be here in spirit. But second to none; what our fans
have created for us in our program, they make our team and our program a
lifestyle. I've never seen anything unfold like this in all of my years of
being around basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously Ty being a freshman, this has to be a big step for her. How
has she been handling all this?  
DAWN STALEY: Ty's been calm, cool and collected all season long. She's a point
guard that's probably far beyond her years. She's got a great approach to the
game. She's just composed. When you've played as many games and you've started
as many games as she has in our league; she's battle tested. This stage, I
don't think this stage will phase her. She will approach it the same way.
Hopefully she'll continue to have the success that she's had.  
  
Q. You have a roster right now that basically, everyone has only --
getting No. 1 seeds. And getting to the second weekend of the tournament, and
I wanted to ask, does that change things at all culture-wise, and approach to
players who have really only known this kind of success?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, it's kind of weird that A'ja Wilson, Alaina Coates, they
have only lost, I don't know, less than ten games over their careers. Maybe
not Alaina. A'Ja, definitely. It's what they have made it. We just coach and
they bring us along for the ride.  
  
They are committed to winning, and when you have that kind of winning culture,
obviously the winning is part of it, but the culture is the other part of it.
It is our leaders leaving a legacy of leadership of how to do things, of
having a culture of excellence expectations, and living up to those things,
and accountability.  
  
So does it help in recruiting? Absolutely it helps in recruiting to say what
we have accomplished over the years and come be a part of this. But it's a lot
of work. It's not easy. I think sometimes people think it's easy because we've
done it over the last few years, but it gets harder having a target on your
back and being the hunted, instead of hunting.  
  
But you get used to it, and you have to -- I'd rather have it this way than
the other way.  
  
Q. You mentioned Quinnipiac does a great job with their assist-to-field-
goal ratio. How do you try to disrupt that?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, speed has to be involved in playing them. They can't
comfortably look you over and come off their screens. Just play comfortable;
shoot practice shots. When they are able to do that, they can beat anybody in
the country.  
  
So we have to try to disrupt the pace in which they want to play and execute.
And you know, you have to be committed to it for 40 minutes, because if you
don't, they can very well win the game.  
  
Q. Allisha and Kaela were transfers, and it seems like they have
obviously played big roles on the team. Why were they able to come in and fit
in with the team so quickly?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we're talking about the culture. Obviously they transferred
for a reason, one reason for another, and they chose us. They didn't go out
and start their process over again. They made the calls to us, because they
looked at our program as being right there.  
  
So they were looking for something a little bit different. And when you're
looking for something a little bit different, you're more apt to embrace
whatever role that you're given.  
  
And they have done it, you know, with incredible pride. And you know, I don't
think it always has been as smooth and seamless as we may think it is, because
you know, Kaela is used to having a ball in her hands. At Georgia Tech, she
probably had the ball in her hands 90 percent of the time.  
  
Here at South Carolina, when Alaina Coates was available, she had it maybe,
you know, maybe 30 percent of the time. Now that we don't have it, maybe she's
got it 50 percent of the time. And that's hard. That's a big adjustment.  
  
Allisha Gray is probably a little bit different in that. She just takes what
the defense gives her, and she embraces her role and she doesn't have very
much to say. She's just one that wants to go out and compete and win no matter
what. The way that they have transitioned into our program is they embrace
their roles. They embrace playing with other great players.  
  
And we almost -- you know, you've got to communicate. You've got to talk to
them a lot, and we equate it to that next level. They are all going to go and
play in the WNBA and they are all going to go play with other great players.
You're going to have to learn how to play with other great players, and if
you're pretty good at it, you know, you're going to have some success at the
next level.  
  
Q. How much do your own experiences in the game as a player come up this
time of year, or even reflections to playing for Olympic Gold or any of those
things.  
DAWN STALEY: They really don't come up. Our players, you know, they relate to
the here and now. I played 25, 20 years ago. They probably think the footage
is in black and white of me playing.  
  
We just kind of, you know, as a coaching staff, we just talk about the things
that they relate to now. You make analogies to social, what's happening on
social media, what's happened in the men's tournament, things like that they
can relate to. They can't really relate to when I played.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Staley. Good luck.  
  
Please welcome South Carolina student athletes, A'Ja Wilson and Kaela Davis.  
  
Q. This could be for either of you, both of you. Coach just got done
saying that she feels like her players focus on the here and now and haven't
really asked her -- she doesn't really talk about her playing experience. How
aware are the both of you about her playing experience and is that true, or is
she kind of just dismissing what she has shared with you about how to prepare
for games like this and what her experience was?  
A'JA WILSON: Kind of what she said. She really doesn't really talk about it,
and I don't think I was born when she was playing. So I really didn't know
(laughs).  
  
Q. Have you seen any video?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I've seen some videos. Seen she's really good. Has some
nice handles. I've heard her hair was crazy. But I mean, from her game,
honestly, she hasn't talked about it. Honestly I haven't paid enough attention
I guess to know how she kind of rolled.  
  
But I know she's a competitor and I know she wanted to win every game. She's
won a lot of games and I think that's pretty much all I know about it, and
Coach Staley is the type of person that doesn't really talk about her game
like that. She really kind of just leaves it kind of to us and let us kind of
figure out our own ways of winning and how to, I guess, see the game.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: Same thing. I think she just takes those experiences and puts
them through coaching. I don't think she talks about her personal experience,
but she puts those experience into our every day practice situations. And
every game, I think she takes her experience and just puts that into her
coaching style.  
  
Q. (What do you know about Quinnipiac and their ranking)?  
KAELA DAVIS: Obviously the team that we're playing, you can't take them
lightly, at all. Obviously they are here for a reason and they have earned
every single bit of that. The number next to their name, it means nothing,
honestly. They are just another team that's, like I said, on their way here,
and we have to come out and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Almost seven years ago, I was there when Dawn came to talk to the
South Carolina locker room after a really hard loss at Stanford, and she's
built something since then, and you two are a big part of that. She spoke to
how it's a matter of building that and keep, you know, getting good players
and getting lucky. What can you say about the growth and what you two have
been a part of?  
KAELA DAVIS: You know, obviously I think, you know, I obviously didn't start
my college career here. But to sit back and just kind of watch, you know, I
think just being within D1 basketball, you watch other games obviously. You
watch other teams. You see kind of this whole story kind of unfolding a little
bit.  
  
You know, obviously with A'Ja coming to South Carolina and Alaina and all the
players that she managed to get into South Carolina, for me personally, it
wasn't hard to make the decision to come to South Carolina and be a part of
that, because I think Coach and the staff here, they are on to something
really special.  
  
So for me personally, it's a blessing just to be able to be a part of it and
hopefully be able to just kind of write our own small little part in history
of South Carolina women's basketball.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Just really going off of Kaela, same thing. It's something
special here. I don't think people would have ever thought -- growing up, you
know the UCONN's, Tennessees, Stanford, but now growing up and seeing that
South Carolina is a part of that, it's special. And just knowing that I am a
part of it and just having a great team and teammates; just building a legacy,
and especially with it being in my backyard, it makes it ten times better for
me.  
  
I give it all to the coaching staff and just like Kaela said, they have really
formed something special, and it's the sky's the limit from here.  
  
Q. Had you guys heard of Quinnipiac before the past couple of weeks, and
have you learned how to say it yet?  
A'JA WILSON: No, not really. But looking at film, they are a really decent,
decent team. You really can't sleep on them at all. I don't want to pronounce
it. I don't want to mess it up. I just know that they are the Bobcats and
Connecticut.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: So what is the official way to say it?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Quinnipiac.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I just say QP -- all those other letters got to go.  
  
Q. I asked Coach a similar question about the fans base that you guys
have built in South Carolina. For you, having your backyard come to see you
every home game, is it tough now to have to fly across the country and play so
far away from that fan base?  
A'JA WILSON: It is, and I know we have some loyal fans, I know my pastor would
cut church short just so he can come to my games. Our fans are really loyal
and it is tough being out west and them -- not all of them not being there,
but we know that they are here.  
  
We just have to just go out here and just pretend that they are there. I think
that we have enough heart and enough talent that we can take care of business.
But it is tough kind of not having your fans out here. But I feel like they
are here in spirit. We get the text messages; we get the Tweets; we get the
Instagram posts. So we know they are there, just maybe not physically.  
  
Q. What went through, really for both of your mind, when you saw Allisha
being carried off the court in that last game? How worried were you?  
A'JA WILSON: I was very worried, but at the same time, I know Allisha and I
know she's going to get over it. Allisha is like my best friend; she's my
sister. So it was kind of tough seeing her get through it, and looking over at
the bench and her eyes are all red and she's crying. And I'm like, "Girl, you
got to get it together." But I knew she's going to be okay. Allisha, she's
tough. She's a soldier. It's good to see her back on the court and doing
something that she loves.  
  
Q. Do you want to give shout out -- will you give us the name of your
pastor and the name of the church?  
A'JA WILSON: Reverend Dr. Jamey O. Graham, Senior. St. John Baptist Church.  
  
Q. Quinnipiac, this is their first time, how much do you think your
experience in this tournament and at this level can help you where the Bobcats
don't have that experience?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it's going to help us, but at the same time, it is March
and crazy stuff happens in March. It can help us, but at the same time, we
really can't overlook them. We really can't overlook the fact that they are a
great team. They are very fundamentally sound and well coached. We are going
to go out and stick with our game plan and understand that we can't take any
slack off. We just have to continue to do us.  
  
Q. Kaela, can you talk about Coach Staley's style and how she motivates
your team and what attracted you maybe to come to South Carolina?  
KAELA DAVIS: Like I said before, her big thing is, I feel like a lot of it's
based off experience. You know, we always laugh at it but she's always talking
about the way things sound, the way it looks, the way it feels.  
  
You don't say that unless you've felt that yourself. Like I said, I think the
biggest thing that drew me there was just her experience. She's been in these
situations before, whether it be in college basketball, professionally. I
think at one point she was playing and coaching at the same time.  
  
You know, just to have somebody that's been in so many different situations.
She's been with USA Basketball and now she's getting to coach USA Basketball.
She's been there, done that, and I think as somebody that aspires to do those
same things and to take their basketball career further, you know, I
definitely think she's somebody that can help with that.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up. You and Allisha have played big roles on the
team after transferring. How easy or difficult was it to transition and become
-- to kind your niche in a big role with this team after transferring?  
KAELA DAVIS: I think last year helped a little bit. You're not so much just
thrown into the fire. You kind of get to sit back and watch a little bit. And
at the same time, just being in practice, you know, obviously we didn't get to
play but we definitely practiced. Just kind of got a feel for everybody a
little bit. It was a process.  
  
I think even up until today, it's still kind of a process. Every game is
different. Some days, it's Allisha goes off; some days I go. You roll with
whatever happens. I don't know, it's like I said, it's been a bit of a
process, but it's been an exciting one. Just because we've gotten to learn so
much about ourselves and each other, and I definitely think Allisha and I will
be a lot better off because of this experience.  
  
Q. Years ago, Tara VanDerveer would snap a rubber band on her wrist as a
player at Virginia; whenever she would make a mistake of any kind and snap
herself with that rubber band. Does that surprise you ladies at all, and are
there any little quirky things she does now, all these years later as a coach
that crack you up?  
A'JA WILSON: I think the snapping of the rubber band -- stuffing her mouth
with Lifesavers. I think that's a switch. I think every time I look at her,
her mouth is all, like just like filled with Lifesavers and she's yelling at
us. I think that's just the flip of the rubber band. And she spits it out
sometimes and it's nasty (laughter). Don't tell her I said that.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, she does, she has a ton of candy. I think she just eats
candy if something happens.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Keeps her from yelling at us so loud.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: She'll just eat a Lifesaver and think about what she wants to say
before she says it, which we can be very thankful for.  
  
Seriously, if you look at, right next to the bench next and the little like
scorer's table, it's a line of candy. It's Lifesavers --  
  
A'JA WILSON: I've really only seen the white ones.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: She really only eats the white ones, but there's a ton of candy.
I think candy is a supplement.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yes, just kind of a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Well, thank you, ladies, and best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Brittany Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28842)

### [Shakayla Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28353)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Seminoles won their first round over Western Illinois 87-66
and defeated Missouri in the second round 77-55. This is Florida State's 16th
NCAA Tournament appearance and the fifth time the Seminoles have reached the
round of 16.  
  
We'll start off with an opening statement from Coach Semrau and then we'll
open up for questions.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, thank you very much. Just thank you so the City of Stockton
for hosting this event. I know it's a lot of work and certainly a lot of
energy has gone into building the interest and the infrastructure for such an
event. So we're extremely excited to be here.  
  
Excited about the opportunity to step into a great match-up against Oregon
State, a tremendous basketball team. Extremely well coached. Very disciplined.
Hard-nosed, work hard. Scott is a friend of nine and does a fantastic job.  
  
Q. You focused a lot on the now with this team. How have they handled
this week and then especially now that you guys have arrived here in
Stockton?  
SUE SEMRAU: That's been really key for us. We are fortunate enough that we
have been able to advance to three back-to-back to back Sweet 16s. So we can
learn, but we certainly can't think back on to that, or think about what could
be or what should be. We've got to focus on a very good Oregon State team.  
  
Q. You mentioned you knew Scott Rueck, Oregon State's coach, and you're
also from Seattle. I'm just kind curious on your thought, not just on Oregon
State's rise over the last few years, but with what Washington has done, the
rest of the Pac 12; as somebody who has been outside of it, but somebody who
is also familiar with this part of the country.  
SUE SEMRAU: Absolutely. I knew Scott when he was coaching at George Fox, and
what a great job he did there and what an excellent hire that they made at
Oregon State.  
  
I grew up a Pac 8 kid and then went to the Pac-10 and now it's Pac-12.
Certainly it's been so much fun to watch the growth of that conference. I
never knew there was much east, because I was always in school when things
were going on out east, and now I don't get to keep up with the West as much
because I'm in bed when things are happening in the West.  
  
But you can't argue with what the Pac-12 has done in women's basketball and
certainly the way they are represented in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. What sticks out most to you when you look at their lineup across the
board?  
SUE SEMRAU: You know, the thing I always think about when I see Scott's teams,
they are just solid. You know, they all play their role. You know that they
are going to come to compete and to work.  
  
And fortunately, we are in a conference in the ACC where we have quite a
number of teams, as well, that were in the NCAA Tournament, still are in the
NCAA Tournament, and we come up against that night-in and night-out, as well.
Both teams are battle tested. We look forward to playing that Pac-12/ACC
matchup.  
  
Q. Brittany has been with you for four years. How have you seen her
evolve as a leader in those four years? And how is she able to turn on being
goofy and turn on being a serious competitor on the court?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, you know, I've known Brittany since she was like a sixth
grader. She came to camp and was a kid that you knew was always going to
compete. I didn't know she would have such a vibrant personality, and that is
something that really makes us go. She's a fierce competitor. Her parents were
her high school coaches, so that's all she's ever known.  
  
But she's also, just loves people, and if you ask anyone in Tallahassee, as
you very well know, Brittany Brown could probably run for mayor. She's
somebody that is always reaching out and giving to so many people. I would
love to watch; and her expanded scope in that. It was just smaller, and now,
it's -- I just received a letter from someone; their 12-year-old girl wrote a
speech on the fact that Brittany Brown was her hero. And one of the reasons
why is because of the way that she gives and the way she fights and continues
to fight.  
  
You know, to get those types of things, you're just so proud as a coach of the
player that she's become and the way that she impacts so many lives.  
  
Q. Why is Shakayla Thomas ACC Player of the Year in your opinion?  
SUE SEMRAU: My opinion is a little biased, but I do think that when you get a
chance to be with her every single day in practice, there's just no question
that she's deserving. She's humble. She works extremely hard. She's extremely
selfless.  
  
And you a lot of times think of Player of the Year as somebody that maybe has
to have the attention, and that's not Shakayla. That's why I'm so proud that
the ACC is represented by a Player of the Year with that type of character.
She's athletic; take that for granted; but there's a lot of great athletes out
there, and she works. She's in the gym before practice. She's in the gym at
midnight. We're fortunate to have 24-hour access to our gym, and she uses it,
and that's why she's the ACC Player of the Year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Florida State's student athletes, Brittany Brown
and Shakayla Thomas.  
  
Q. For Brittany, you've been here at Florida State now for four years.
You've had your fair share of success. Just what's different about your senior
year and playing in one last Sweet 16, Elite 8 and maybe even Final Four?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I think the difference is the group of girls on the team. I
was just telling a couple people earlier that the difference in this team is
just our chemistry, and I don't know, this team's just so selfless. It doesn't
matter who gets the credit. We're fighting for one another this year. That's
been our motto all year.  
  
And I've just seen this team, when adversities hit, that we used to splinter
apart in the previous years, and I think that was a big difference-maker the
further you go in the tournament.  
  
As we hit adversity throughout this season, I've just seen us come together
and it's just made us stronger. So I'd just say the group of girls and how we
fight for one another every day.  
  
Q. We were talking yesterday about your hometown in Alabama and you
being a small-town girl from a small state. Can you give me more of a sense of
your popularity in your hometown, and just kind of the reaction that your
hometown fans have toward what you've done in your career at Florida State,
and what kind of love they might be sending your way this weekend?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Considering, like you said, I'm from a small city, so I have
people come to me every day or every other day and be like, "You're the mayor
of Sylacauga," and I'll just be like, that's not true, yet. (Laughter).  
  
But I feel like the love they show is unbelievable. They send out prayers and
messages to me, literally every day. It could be just like a regular day, and
I feel like that's much needed, considering where we are right now.  
  
Q. Brittany you're known as being kind of a fun person off the court,
but what's kind of the key to being a good leader, being fun off the court,
and then zoning in when it's time to play?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I think that my teammates, they make it easier. Yes, I'm the
clown all the time. But I feel like that's when my team needs to give them
energy. We have a couple of introverts -- well, quite a bit of introverts, but
a little bit of extroverts and I'm one of those. That's just a way that I get
my team going. I do it on the court and off the court.  
  
But this group of girls, they just make it so much easier. If I'm fussing at
them, they respond. If I'm trying to get them hyped, they respond. And that
makes it so much easier to be a good leader, even in times when things aren't
going your way.  
  
Q. Shakayla, I was going through the stats and see that you've not
attempted a three-point shot yet this season. Where and how do you get your
offense?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I get my offense off jumpshots and layups. I never really
needed the whole three-point shooting thing. It's just never been part of my
game.  
  
I'm more of the attacker person. That's the only thing I look for honestly. So
I feel like that's the only thing I'll live and die by. Like that's my bread
and butter right there.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Brittany and her leadership ability, and just
how she rubs off on the rest of the team?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I've had better (laughter). No, I'm just kidding.  
  
Brittany's just like, like she said before, she's this all-around fun person.
So it's like sometimes when she'll be talking to me, getting on me, I'll be
laughing. But it's like, I know she's serious, but it's like, I know you
personally. So it's like -- okay.  
  
I feel like she's actually made me better. Like the way she gets -- like the
way she carries herself on and off the court, I feel that's the greatest.
People need that in their lives and I feel like me playing with her this year
and for the past three years, that's made me a great player, because I feel
like I piggyback off whatever she does.  
  
So like whatever Brittany's doing, I'm doing the same thing, or trying to do
the same thing. So I feel like she's a great leader and that's what we need.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. You can take turns maybe. Can you talk about
the game tomorrow and what you're concentrating on? I'm hearing maybe get out
and run is maybe a goal.  
BRITTANY BROWN: Well, I definitely agree with that just because our
conference, ACC conference, is fast, and that's something that we're really
good at in transition, but in order for us to do that, we have to be really
good on the defensive end. Oregon State, they are known for their size. They
are known for out-rebounding opponents by ten-plus. In a way, that's what we
do well, as well. That's what we're focusing on. Of course, defending and
rebounding, but also a lot has to do with us focusing on what we do best as a
team and just putting that into play tomorrow.  
  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I feel like our main focus is Florida State basketball. We're
not, you know, too shabby with it. We're just going to focus on ourselves.  
  
Now Oregon State is a great team, and we've been practicing countless (ph) for
them and I feel like they are going to come out there and play their game and
we're going to play our game, and it's just going to be a great game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Gabriella Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30898)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State Beavers head coach, Scott Rueck.  
  
The Beavers won their first round game against Long Beach State with a score
of 56-55 and defeated Creighton in the second round, 64-52. This is Oregon
State's ninth tournament appearance overall and the third time they have
reached the round of 16.  
  
First we'll start with an opening statement from Coach Rueck.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: What an awesome opportunity this team has created once again for
them self. As you think back to this point of the year, you reflect a bit.
This was a team picked fifth before the season in their own conference, and
they have found a way to earn a 2-seed, and then the awesome opportunity to
play within our own region to where our fans can travel, and we're in our same
time zone. And how special is that; that we got to have a meal at one of our
player's houses last night.  
  
You know, just a dream scenario for our program, and an incredible opportunity
with three other incredible teams. To still be playing at this time of the
year means a lot of special things has happened, and that's true of all three
of us.  
  
Three outstanding coaches, three outstanding teams, and an awesome opportunity
against an incredible Florida State team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit more on just how cool it is to play
in your own time zone when the other three teams are all from the East Coast
and had to fly across the country to get here?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, the opposite has been true for us: This is the first time
for us, other than the first two rounds, of course, where we have been in our
own time zone all three years, the last three, anyway. To us it's a bit unique
to be honest.  
  
I don't really see a difference, completely. I mean, for us it's another game,
and it's another scenario; it feels a bit like conference. You are guaranteed
40 and you hope for 80 minutes, of course, of basketball this weekend.  
  
Other than that, it's get on a plane and go to a hotel and go play. This time
of the year, no matter where you're at, that's the case. But the normalcy,
maybe that's the advantage for us. You know, it feels normal.  
  
These teams, though, at this time of year, I think, you know, a year ago we
had to travel to Dallas and we played very well that weekend. So I would
anticipate the same for these three teams. To be playing at this point, you
have a maturity to your program, you have great leadership and you handle any
kind of adversity well. You've been doing it all year to get here.  
  
So I think those things may not be as significant as maybe people think.  
  
Q. I've read how Sydney has wanted to play Florida State. Is that a
program you guys catch or have studied, or just watch from afar with some
admiration over the years?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, you have to have admiration. You know, what Sue's done is
unbelievable. They are always a great team to watch. For some reason, we've
avoided them just by chance.  
  
We've been in a couple of the same places; one, Dallas last year. So we
watched them play Baylor in the round of 16, and certainly thought that was a
team that if we got out of our DePaul game, we could see them; that they had
that much talent that beating Baylor was not out of the question, as good as
Baylor was.  
  
You know, they have been fun to watch. You follow Romero; that was a big story
and you get Shak Thomas, and so it's a program that has demanded attention and
so they are easy to watch, easy to get to know, and therefore, easy to follow.  
  
For Syd, I'm not really sure. You'll have to ask her that when she gets in.
But for me, I've gotten to know Sue over the years and she has northwest ties,
and I know that. So it's a team we haven't played yet. They provide a lot of
challenges, and so it should be a great game.  
  
Q. What goes into stopping a player like Shakayla Thomas, so much
athleticism and she can dunk at 5-11. How do you stop such a strong inside
threat?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great question, and I don't know if you do, completely
stop her. Because of that athleticism, because of her drive and her ability,
her skill set where she can hurt you at the rim, you know, literally, and from
the perimeter; she provides a lot of challenges.  
  
I think what everybody has seen right now, across the country, is the
strengths of our conference. You know, we've got five of the 16 out of the
Pac-12 and could have easily had six, you know, if things had gone right in
the last minute at South Carolina for Arizona State.  
  
I think all of us are really prepared. We've got outstanding athletes within
this conference. You look at Monique Billings, that's one that stands out. You
look at forces like Kristina Anigwe; certainly Plum; certainly, you know, you
just go down the list of all the great players throughout our conference.  
  
And you know, Shak Thomas is another incredible player, and so this team is
prepared to adapt game plans, adapt to prepare to stick with game plan as long
as it takes and to be as gritty as necessary to get the job done.  
  
And with a player that's as formidable as that, that's what you have to do. I
don't know if you stop her, but hopefully, hopefully, we can make her really
work for whatever she gets.  
  
Q. What appealed about Kat Tudor as a recruit and how has that
translated to her first season playing college ball?  
SCOTT RUECK: Kat's a dream. The first thing that stands out is her ability to
shoot the ball. I mean, that's the first thing.  
  
When you get in a gym and watch a team play and you see somebody hit seven
threes in the first half of a game, I don't care what kind of a game it is,
that stands out. And then you start doing your research, and you find out who
she is as a person and where she comes from in regards to her family and
parents, all you see is first class, incredible competitor and high character.
A.  
  
Then you keep looking and find out she played at St. Marys Stockton, of course
I knew that before. And then we have the parallels with Ali Gibson, who was
one of the pillars of our program and our first true four-year recruit at
Oregon State in my time there; same program in high school, same AAU program
and plays the same way. And Ali had an incredible career and started every
game she played for Oregon State. And so, you look at all those things.  
  
And you know, in recruiting, you're basically trying to limit gambles and
you're trying to make great guesses, really, on your research, and everything
aligned for Kat to be a great fit at Oregon State, and that's what she's been
and will be.  
  
So she's an awesome addition. Stretches the floor, is picking up our system,
and joined a team that has turned out to be a Top-10 team and adapting very
well. That was a big-time recruit for us, and she's going to have an
incredible career.  
  
Q. What does it say about Geno's love for women's basketball in general
when he opens up his sweatshirt today and shows a Quinnipiac t-shirt
underneath?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think he can relate and I know I can. There's a lot of coaches
that have been very successful for a long period of time that started at the
bottom. And you look back at where Connecticut was, where he took over, and
where Tricia, you know, what she's accomplished in her career.  
  
I was not familiar with them until, really, this year, because we played them
in December. And researched her and had her Wikipedia up (laughs). And who is
she and why is this team so good? It was kind of funny, because we went down
to shake hands with her, and she said, "Oh, it's great to meet you."  
  
I'm like, "Me? How about you?" I'm like, "I'm excited to meet you," and all
the things that she's accomplished.  
  
So I think Geno just respects that grind. There's a reason he's where he is,
and it's due to hard work and grit. You think with a team that has as much
talent as Connecticut has now and has for 25,30 years, but his job is easy.
Quite the opposite.  
  
It's evident this year, as every year: He know what he's doing and they work
hard and they are as gritty as any team there is. So he respects that story,
no matter where it comes from.  
  
And so I don't know what their relationship is. I don't have the insight into
that. But it doesn't surprise me. And so for me, yeah, I think every coach,
that's a great idea that he had.  
  
But if every coach could do the same thing, I think we'd all do it, because
what an awesome story that is. For a team to go into Miami like they did and
play the way they did and take every punch and just answer it time and again;
it's very similar to what Long Beach State did the other day at our place,
very similar. You've got a team that's pretty much overmatched but just plays
with so much heart and they give themselves a chance and they are fighting
like crazy, and they have veterans and so much grit.  
  
When you think of UCONN, you think of grit and toughness and sustained
excellence. I think that's him tipping his cap to a program that's doing it
right in every which way, every way that he respects.  
  
Q. What does it say and mean that this senior class is the first in
school history to have made the NCAA Tournament all four years?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, you've got a group that believed in a vision and had the
courage and toughness to see it through; the competitive will and the fight to
not only get there but to do every little thing right.  
  
You know, what they have done within our conference is unprecedented by
anybody other than Stanford. To win this conference three straight years and
to go 16-2 three straight years in a conference is absolutely remarkable, when
the conference, as everybody is saying, is the best it's ever been.  
  
You know, for those of us who have been around and have been able to
experience Gill coliseum, I know Dawn's got something very special going at
South Carolina with their fans, and that happens a few places in the country.
But Gill coliseum has some magic to it that I think would be hard to match
anywhere, and that's because of these seniors, and the seniors from last year,
as well.  
  
I don't know if you know the whole story; if there's a better story in our
game, than what they have done. I get to talk about them with so much pride
and I'm so proud of them the way they conduct themselves, because they have
made this whole thing bigger than them the entire time, and they truly have
become an inspiration to anybody they have come in contact with.  
  
For me, it's just been an absolute dream, you know, to be able to be in the
gym with them for four straight years and watch them grow, not only as
players, but especially as people and leaders, and take on, this year, the
expectations in their minds, were to get right back here. No one else, though,
had that expectation.  
  
And so when those expectations on the outside dropped, they said no. No, we
are going to get back to where we were a year ago. And for me, to basically to
get out of the way and watch it happen has been a joy and a dream.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State's student athletes, Gabriella
Hanson and Sydney Wiese.  
  
Q. Florida State is a team with guards that like to rebound. Brittany
Brown is 5-6 and will go up and get a rebound with the best of them. As a
guard, what do you do to stop that, and how do you limit their impact inside
the paint?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think the biggest thing is to make sure that we stay in
position.  
  
For Florida State, no play is ever over for them, and so the biggest thing for
us as guards is to make sure that we find them and use the fundamentals that
we have been learning throughout the season about boxing out. Put a body on
them early, and at least keep them away from getting the ball. If we don't
necessarily get the rebound either, that's fine. But just as long as they
don't, either, we did our job.  
  
Q. This could be for either player. I asked your coach the same player.
Shakayla Thomas, ACC Player of the Year, on a bit of a scoring tear. What goes
into stopping someone who is so athletic and can really hurt a team from mid-
range?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: Well, I think she's kind of an unconventional player because
she's playing in a forward spot but she's basically a guard.  
  
So I mean, her athleticism is incredible, and so our post players are going to
have to be extremely disciplined in how they play her positioning-wise and
limiting her to one shot, and boxing her out is going to be extremely
important. Then just helping them out as much as we can. It's all about
positioning in this type of game, and especially with athletic -- or as
athletic as she is.  
  
Q. As seniors, you guys know that when it's over, all the seniors are in
the same boat. Is that something that drives you do you guys talk about it? Or
is it just, hey, we're going to lock down and do what we do?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think there's an added sense of urgency this part of the year.
Even in the Pac-12 Tournament, we didn't want to lose, because there's -- each
game could be your last. So you play with that urgency, but you also stick to
what has gotten to us this point. And you stick to the game plan; you focus on
what you can control, and you can't really -- you can't predict whether you're
going to win or lose. You just make sure you do whatever you can while you're
out there and you have the opportunity and you make the most of your time.  
  
GABRIELLA HANSON: I would 100 percent agree. I think it's just a different
feeling knowing that you never again get to have this opportunity. Never again
will I be able to play in an Oregon State jersey on March 27 of 2000, whatever
the case may be.  
  
So it's just a different level, like Syd said of urgency, of will, that for
sure, any game can be your last and you never get a chance to do it again. So
you put your heart and soul into it, bottom line.  
  
Q. Is it helpful that you guys are playing on the West Coast, when all
the other guys are flying across the country?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: It's certainly nice, for sure, traveling-wise, yeah, not
having to travel as far. But we know our fans travel great anywhere we go. We
love Beaver Nation, and they are going to bring their spirit. Wherever we are,
they will come.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think even if the other three teams have had to travel
across the country, it's postseason. It doesn't matter where you're playing,
what time you're playing at. Everyone is going after the same goal, the
National Championship.  
  
Is it an advantage? I don't think we look at it like that. I think we are more
fortunate enough to have our fans so close by, and we're going to do what we
can. And I know our fans are going to show up for us, but the focus is the
same, whether we're on the West or the East Coast.  
  
Q. Sydney, I read that you liked watching Florida State from afar, as
much as you get that opportunity. But haven't played them. Is that kind of fun
to see a team that you know a little bit about but actually get to face?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, Gabby and I were actually talking about that when we saw
the bracket in our ream on come out that we would potentially have the
opportunity to play Florida State, and Romero is -- did you ever play against
her? She played against Romero on the international circuit, and I've had the
opportunity this year and even last year, to watch them play.  
  
They are very well coached, very talented. They have always been fun to watch.
So to have an opportunity to play against them and see what we can do against
them, very fortunate and blessed for this opportunity to see what we can do
with it.  
  
So we are looking forward to it. We are looking forward to getting out there
on the court today in the arena, getting a vibe for it, and then come game
time tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck tomorrow.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Quinnipiac Bobcats head coach, Tricia Fabbri.  
  
The Bobcats defeated Marquette 68-65 in the opening round becoming one of 21
No. 12 seeds of all time to win their first game. In the second round they
beat Miami 85-78 to become the fourth-ever 12-seed to defeat a 5-seed.
Quinnipiac is also the first team since 2014 to reach the round of 16 as a
12-seed.  
  
First we'll have an opening statement from Coach Fabbri.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: Thank you. Well, I can say, you know, on the bus ride over,
thinking to myself, and I would imagine my players, as well, that at some
point, you watch the Sweet 16 on TV, and you dream that one day, you're
playing in that game in this tournament.  
  
I know that certainly was my dream a long time ago, and for that dream to
become a reality, and to make this possible, this opportunity possible, to be
playing in the Sweet 16, we're really excited to be here. We're really excited
with the opportunity to play against South Carolina in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Geno is wearing a shirt -- did you see that? Did you hear about this
today?  
TRICIA FABBRI: I did.  
  
Q. What does that mean to you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Well, first of all, Geno has been such a mentor for me going
way back. He helped me in this process, get a job at Quinnipiac a long, long
time ago, 22 years ago. But really just a gold standard, a great guy, and then
he was so excited. He reached out as soon as we won, and so complimentary of
what we were able to accomplish over the weekend.  
  
The fact that he is wearing our shirt in support of our team in this
tournament at this time, just so thankful, and very grateful for his support
and UCONN women's basketball's support of Quinnipiac's women's basketball, and
the two teams in Connecticut here representing women's basketball in the Sweet
16.  
  
Q. You've been here for 22 years now, and to work all that way to
getting a Sweet 16 and to do it with your daughter on the roster, what
experience has that been for the two of you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: The year and the team and the players and the coaches that we
have shared it with, the administration, the university, has been special and
historic. And to share that with your daughter, who is, you know, obviously
helped us so much this year.  
  
You know, when you recruit players, you hope that, you know, you get what you
think you're going to get out of them. But knowing Carly, and knowing my
daughter, I had the advantage of knowing what I was getting when she said yes
to Quinnipiac.  
  
Q. What's it like for you to coach against Coach Staley, and what
concerns you most about her team?  
TRICIA FABBRI: My goodness. I don't think there's enough time in this press
conference to run through the challenges that we're going to see tomorrow from
Coach Staley and her team.  
  
They are so talented. They are an elite program. You just start with the fact
that the experience that they have here in this game and in this round, is
first and foremost. The talent that they possess: From Wilson all the way
down, right down the roster; how they score points. And really what's most
impressive to the staff, as we have prepared, as we continue to prepare our
team, is really how they defend. I think they are a really outstanding
defensive ballclub.  
  
So we have our hands full all day tomorrow.  
  
Q. With Morgan and Adily there, their name cards up here, Adily fifth-
year red-shirt and Morgan a senior, how great is it to see all their hard work
and contributions pay off with this right here?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Ultimately, this answer, it sounds like we're not done -- we
still have another game. But when you already know that you have helped your
team and program make history, it has to feel so satisfying when you Wake up
that you have left and made and helped this program be better than when you
came in. It's an incredible feeling for them, as it is for us.  
  
Q. For people that don't know that much about your team, can you explain
what makes Quinnipiac go the way it does, and how did you guys get here?  
TRICIA FABBRI: My goodness. This year, we have been a really good defensive
team. We have definitely identified ourselves, getting back and playing really
hard-nosed, sound rules, shutting down other teams, their strengths, what they
want to do.  
  
But ultimately our mentality has been one about grit and finding ways and
being unselfish and being a balanced team, and on any given night, we have had
a player find a way to make plays and put the ball in the basket. We have had
balance. We have had unselfishness, but we have talent. We play together, and
our strength is in team.  
  
Q. Last year when this team lost in the MAC Tournament, Maria Napolitano
was the only student that graduated and moved on. How much do you think that
loss has been fueling extra motivation to get to this point?  
TRICIA FABBRI: I think that whenever you come up just a little bit short that,
is always a fire in the belly that never goes away, and it definitely
motivated us all throughout the summer into the spring, into the season, and
into everything that is still going on in this tournament for sure.  
  
Q. With the amount of hoopla going around campus about this team and the
excitement of being the underdog throughout this tournament, how do you keep
this team focused and let them know you still have another game to play?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Because they do that themselves. Again, this is a very
motivated group. They are excited with everything that has transpired in one
week but they are extremely grounded because of Morgan, Adily, the experience
that we have, the expectation that we have to be here; the expectation to have
success in the NCAA; to attain that, that's an expectation that they wanted.  
  
So to be here and still have business on hand, it's very grounding, and they
are task oriented and a goal-oriented group in doing it together. They are
enjoying the moment, but they are very much about taking care of business and
the business trip at hand and being able to stay focused at the task at hand.
They have been extremely grounded through getting on the plane yesterday to
being out -- to being here for 24 hours.  
  
Q. You guys might be known to some as the smaller town community team
from Connecticut, but you have players from four different countries. People
might not know that. What kind of dynamic does that add to the team in terms
of the culture and how they interact with one another?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Again, because I think we have such a close-knit -- we have the
literal piece of family, and that has been all encompassing of, again, tells a
little bit of something of who we are; that that's what makes us who we are.  
  
And even though we have come from all areas from the globe, that we are able
to really become one unique family, from the international parts of the world,
from Latvia, Ireland, Canada, to while we're in Connecticut and out in Arizona
and Wisconsin, our basketball family, when they were going through this entire
process, they found the attraction in each other and what we were trying to
achieve and go forward with with this program.  
  
Getting to the Sweet 16, has been stated with these young ladies on this
roster, and that drew them to being a part of and making history. That's the
dynamic; that's us being very progressive and that's something that they were
excited to achieve here. That's something that had not been done before, but
the attraction to helping us achieve more, was the real, you know -- I guess,
you know, tradition kind of -- the university in and of itself is a very
progressive and dynamic culture. And I think the basketball emulates what the
university is in that we are always progressive in moving forward in
education.  
  
That's how the basketball, how they were; we weren't set. We're young in this
Division I world of athletics and we wanted to go forward and be dynamic and
unique in our own approach and I think that was really attractive to
everybody, regardless of where they were from; that they found a thread that
was going to bind them together through basketball.  
  
Q. Wilson is such a dominant player down low. What are you going to do
to slow her down?  
TRICIA FABBRI: We play tomorrow. I think Coach may have someone watching this
press conference. So I can't let the -- you know, there's a plan in place.
We're going to work extremely hard to make it difficult to have them throw in
with ease and do our best to limit touches as best we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach Fabbri, and best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, one of the things that South Carolina has is a lot of length.
I think they have five players at 6-2 or above. How do you try to counter
that, knowing that can be difficult to place?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Definitely a lot of help defense with that. Also boxing out,
since they are so much taller than us, we've really got to concentrate on
getting boards and just pushing them out of the paint.  
  
Q. For all of three of you, can you talk about the opportunity that you
have in front of you, the confidence that you have leading up to this point
and how confident are you going into tomorrow's game?  
JEN FAY: I mean, I think coming off of obviously two huge wins, is going to
make us more confident than ever, and we know this game is probably going to
be even harder than the first two. But there's no doubt in our mind that we
can pull off another upset.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Just agreeing with Jen. Every game you build more and more
confidence after every win. This opportunity, it's amazing. I really can't put
it into words because it's just unreal, the opportunity in front of us.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: I think we are really excited to be here, and just the
opportunity at hand, you know, we're really grateful for it and we're going to
leave it all out on the floor. However long it takes, we'll hopefully get
another upset.  
  
Q. In every situation, except the round of 32, you've been able to go to
Tricia because she's been in every situation, and she hasn't been in this
situation as a coach. How have you handled that? You guys are really the ones
that have as much experience in this situation as she does.  
JEN FAY: We're all in this together, so I mean, just because she -- none of us
have ever been in this experience before. So I think we're all going to go
through it together, the ups and the downs, and just work our way through.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: The biggest thing is trust; trust that they will give us a
game plan, and them trusting in us to execute that game plan.  
  
Q. Did you see this photo of Geno in your shirt today?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Yeah, I did.  
  
Q. And maybe if any of you can reflect on how much that means to you.  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's awesome. Just the support we've had in general, and then
especially from him and his team. Just being Connecticut teams in general, the
support is amazing. I mean, he's a great coach, and the spotlight is always on
him; a lot of people saw that. And it's just amazing, the support. We really
appreciate it.  
  
Q. Coach Fabbri has complimented you a lot throughout this year, and
your leadership to this team. What can you say about her as a coach and how
she's helped you throughout your five years here with the program?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: You know, our success starts from the top and trickles its way
down, and she is the head of this team. And I look up to her as a role model
for a leader. And it all starts with her to be honest, and, you know, she's
one of my biggest models.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, and good luck tomorrow.
