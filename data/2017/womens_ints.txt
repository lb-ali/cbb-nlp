# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Duke - 61  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: 2 for 3 at halftime, didn't look inside nearly enough. We went
in to her and that opened up things on the outside for us to make some shots.
Really, really proud of Erin Boley coming off the bench and hitting some big
threes. I thought Arike and Marina both -- Arike hit some huge threes and when
they cut it to two, she was the one that I thought put us back on top.  
  
Q. You called time-out and you guys scored the next 14 on a 20-2 run.
Did you say anything special there like get inside?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, get the ball to Bree, probably said it a couple of times.
And we were able to do that. I thought Kathryn coming back in at the high post
I thought was good, but Erin was in in that stretch, too. So I thought a
little more discipline on offense, and then really kind of just tightened up
on defense.  
  
Q. Lindsay, four titles in four years, you guys are only the second
school in ACC's history to win regular season and conference championships in
the same four straight years. What does it mean for this program to win
another ACC title?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: It means a lot, especially for Coach McGraw to be able to do
that in her career. But also to be able to experience it as a player means so
much. You know, to be experiencing it with these great teammates that I've had
over the past four years. But just the way the coaches challenge us every
single day, whether we're up by 10 or down by 10 the coaches are coaching us
the exact same way, trying to get us to extend the lead. So I think just the
way they challenge us and the way they encourage us on the court.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Kyra Lambert and Lexie Brown have had great success on
defense shutting down Alexis Peterson earlier in the tournament. How were you
able to have such a great game against them?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think we did a good job of kind of exploiting the holes in
their defense, and so I think we hit the high post and then just attacking the
ACC area and it opened up so much for us. It was either me or Kat attacking
the ACC and finding Bree, and so just being able to kind of play smart and
play together as a team has been really successful for us.  
  
Q. Arike, talk about Lindsay for a second. It's rare that point guards
get the accolades for doing what they do and she was the MVP, 13 assists
tonight, career high, 33 in the tournament. What's she brought to you guys in
the last three games to help you win this tournament?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, just what she's been bringing the whole season, that
goes to show that you don't really need to score all the points to be the MVP.
She's the MVP even without as many points, the assists and finding other
people, which is -- she gets us points. She's just an amazing point guard, and
I love playing with her.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I love coaching her. She makes my job so easy. I think we have
mental telepathy at times. We look over and Lindsay calls it before the
message even gets delivered. She's been amazing. It's been just a great four
years with her.  
  
Q. Muffet, what does it mean, four titles in four years here in this
conference, and especially since you lost the first game at NC State in the
regular season, to rebound from that and get another title with this group,
how special is that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it really is. We really wanted to play NC State again. I
think after that game, that was kind of our goal to meet them again in the
tournament. You know, it was unfortunate that didn't work out for us. But we
were -- I think it's the kind of thing where you don't really appreciate it so
much in the moment, and then you look back and you go, dang, four straight
years, we've done pretty well. And I think you've really got to credit Lindsay
for that. What she's done in her four years, I don't know if anybody is going
to replicate that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Lexie Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26967)

### [Rebecca Greenwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28343)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 74, Duke - 61  
  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Obviously not a game that we wanted. Certainly not the
outcome that we wanted. You have to credit Notre Dame. They shot the ball
well. They shot 52 percent. That's an excellent percentage, and too high
relative to what we like to do defensively.  
  
I think there will be some good lessons here for us to learn from, and I think
that they're a pretty seasoned team, and you have to have a complete, complete
connectedness, complete focus to take out a team that's been successful over
the years, has returning players that have had that success, and you really
have to -- it's a tough thing.  
  
And I thought we were at one point in the second half going to press, going to
press on and do that, and of course they answered the bell, and the game
obviously is what it is. So we'll learn from it. Congratulations to them for
their dominance, and we definitely will take this to heart and grow with it
and get ready for next.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about after you guys went on that 10-0 run
in the third quarter and you had to call a time-out after Becca grabbed the
offensive rebound and then they went on a 22 run, can you talk about the
momentum shift that occurred during that time-out or afterwards?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: What do you want me to say about it? I mean, our defense
broke down, and they scored points. I mean, it just -- the game is about runs.
I was really proud of our run, but you can't expect to just go at a team one
time and assume they're just going to back up and allow you to -- you have to
be very, very aggressive, and we backed up. They hit a couple nice shots, I
think a three and then something else happened there. But that's basketball,
and you've got to be ready to compete at that level. Obviously we did not. We
took a step back, and they took a step forward.  
  
Q. Both players, just talk about the run you guys had to get to The
Finals and how this will help you going forward in the NCAA Tournament.  
LEXIE BROWN: It was definitely a lot of fun. I would not want to go on this
run with any other group of girls. I know how much work we put into this
season in the summer and the preseason. Like I've stated so many times, nobody
thought we were going to get to this level, to this game. So it's just been a
good experience. I wish we wouldn't have to learn with a loss, but we're going
to learn a lot and get better for the NCAA.  
  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Yeah, like Lexie said, it was a lot of fun. We're really
proud of what we got. Obviously not satisfied with today's outcome. But we're
just going to learn and grow from it and carry it on into the tournament this
year.  
  
Q. Lexie, how good is Lindsay Allen?  
LEXIE BROWN: She's amazing. Her court vision is something I've never seen
before. I've known Lindsay for a long time, and to see her grow as a point
guard has been really nice to see. She's definitely one of the best to ever do
it, and congratulations to her for these four ACC championships.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say about the play of Kendall Cooper in this
tournament?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, Kendall, I think she grew as a player tremendously,
and I just feel like she had the right -- she has so much spirit, passion,
emotion about her game, and she's a competitor. You know, she's really a
fighter, and I felt that came out in a variety of different ways throughout
the games that we had through the tournament.  
  
And today, as well, she was very pivotal at certain times.  
  
It's fun to see a senior growing like that. And I know she's upset. She's not
very happy about this outcome, and I think she'll use it wisely and be ready
for next.  
  
Q. Becca, Marina Mabrey played some really solid defense, then it seemed
like they were switching between man-to-man and a triangle and two on you and
Lexie. What were they doing really well that kept you guys in check rather
than your defense being the one that controlled the game?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Yeah, they were doing a great job denying both of us on the
wings. They just had really good pressure. We just needed to adjust better,
maybe slow down a little bit and be more patient. But they did a great job
defensively for sure.  
  
Q. You guys have been playing such good defense in this tournament, and
the first I think eight possessions they scored on. Did that sort of set the
tone that they were able to sort of get going offensively early on?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Well, I mean, obviously give them credit for that start.
It was a very strong start. Yes and no. When you look at these stats and you
look at these points off turnovers, that's what really sticks out to me is
poise. I mean, they had 26 points off turnovers. I believe they won by 23. And
so we have got to take a hard look at where we're being careless with the
basketball.  
  
I guess I'm not really answering your question because I'm coming back around
to if you're going to turn the ball over that much and someone is going to
score that much, it's going to be very hard to play defense. If you're going
to create three on twos and two on ones for the other team, it's going to be
very hard to get a percentage down, and I think that's the thing that the team
is going to look at on film and really be unhappy about.  
  
I also look at the points in the paint, but that's a separate question. But
you're asking me about defense. You have to get your defense back and set.
Well, if you're turning the ball over and they're in fast-break mode, that's a
lot harder to do. And so that's a bothersome stat because that stat has popped
up before, and we're going to really address that. We're going to really
address decisions, slowing down, being able to read the game a little bit,
because you can help people's offense. You can fortify their offense. And I
felt we did that early, fortified their offense early.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Louisville - 73.  
  
JEFF WALZ: First, again, I'd just like to thank the ACC, thank Coastal
Carolina for just a fantastic tournament. Everything has been first-class.
Their hospitality has been fantastic. I thought the atmosphere was great
today, and I think it's been great the entire tournament.  
  
Just really like to thank everyone involved with putting this together.  
  
Today I'd just like to congratulate Notre Dame. I thought they played well.
They made some big shots when they had to, and unfortunately we did not. I
thought both teams played extremely hard, and I thought they played extremely
well. I thought the 10 players on the floor were fantastic, there were just
some others that have to improve their game.  
  
Q. Turnovers, points off turnovers, two big factors today.  
JEFF WALZ: We talked about it before the game started, and we talked about it
at halftime. We talked about it at the end of the first quarter, second
quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. We talked about it in the locker room.
It's a broken record right now, and until we figure that out, that you just
can't pick your dribble up, you can't dribble into a double-team and pick it
up, you've got a retreat drill, things that we work on. And unfortunately it
cost us tonight, this afternoon. There's no question about it.  
  
You look at 19 points off our 18 turnovers, and then 10 points in transition.
Some of them came off our turnovers. Some of those 10. But areas that we can
easily fix. I thought we rebounded the ball well. I thought we did a good job.
We couldn't figure out a way to get to the free-throw line, which that's bad
coaching, I guess, so I've got to work on that.  
  
But besides that, I thought the effort, I thought the energy from both teams,
I thought it was a very, very good basketball game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just having Myisha on the court this time? She was
a huge factor for you guys in the first half, and since she missed the last
game against Notre Dame?  
JEFF WALZ: I told her on the way in, I'm just really proud of where she's
taken her game over these three years. When she first got with us, she was
around the basket, drive it, make some post moves, and now she's worked on it.
She's extended her range to 15 to 18 feet. She does a great job of facing up.
She's relentless on the glass, and really, really proud of her. You know, it's
just one of those where we need everybody to keep buying in. Everybody get in
the gym, get a little bit better, little bit better. We've got two weeks, a
week and a half, before we'll figure out who we're going to play and all that
good stuff in the NCAA Tournament, and then our goal is to win six games.
That's something that you just can't wait for next Monday on the draw. You've
got to continue to start doing it now, and that's what we're striving for.
Notre Dame is going to be a 1 seed, and well-deserving of that. I think we're
right there. We just -- when you throw it to the other team, it makes it tough
to win, and we did that pretty well.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously you're going to the NCAA Tournament, and assuming you
don't have anything else scheduled for your arena, you're going to get a
couple of home games. What's your regimen going to be over these next couple
of weeks as you prepare?  
JEFF WALZ: We'll take tomorrow off and we'll practice on Monday. We're not
going to change up what we do. We won't go as hard probably the next few days,
but we'll work on execution. We'll work on ourselves, things that we need to
get better with, half court execution, defensively, and put them through some
game situations. Like at the end there, we had one team foul with 47 seconds,
so I wanted to get the next four without the ball getting in and throwing
inbounds. So just get up there and grab them. Sit there and play defense, hold
them when they cut, it's a foul. I mean, I just love the intentional foul. So
I thought, again, that's fantastic.  
  
Q. I have a two-part question for you since you opened the door on it.
Can you explain to me how that was called intentional versus a common foul?  
JEFF WALZ: I think that's your alternative facts. I think that's you coming up
with different ways to spin things. I've said that all along. It's just
mindboggling to me. Some people like the attention, like to be out there in
the limelight, and unfortunately it's a simple foul. She fouled her. Yeah, she
shoved her, a little flop involved, too. Just take the ball out of bounds,
that's the third team foul, and go on. And that's not what changed the game.
It's just mindboggling to me, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. The second part of the question is just this conference, you have
seven teams in the top 25, you'll probably have four or five teams potentially
hosting the first two rounds. Talk about how the ACC conference is a bear to
play in.  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's been great, and we're honored to be a part of it and in
it. I go back to my first two years when we were in the old Big East, and to
me that's what I can compare it to because that's where I started, and it's
what it reminds me of, and if not a little bit better, that every single night
you've got to show up. You've got to play.  
  
You know, there's no doubt in my mind eight teams from our league are going to
make the tournament. Virginia without a doubt should make it, with their win
over Florida State the other day. They've been playing some great basketball.
And then you've got the seven that are ranked. I'm not just saying eight are
going to make it, I'm expecting eight to win. I'm expecting this league to win
some ballgames in the NCAA Tournament. We have some great players, very well-
coached, and it's been fun. It makes it fun as a coach, and I think it makes
it fun as a player. That's why they come here, to play against the best.  
  
Q. Myisha, you had a double-double today; you also got a really good
performance out of Kylee Shook. Just talk about the game that she had and how
this may help her down the road?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Towards the end of the game she started hitting threes so
I feel like she'll start getting more confident in her three-point shot. She's
one of our best three-point shooters. As far as the post, she's our best post
player out shooting threes. So she's gotten a lot better since the beginning
of the season. She's getting a lot stronger. But I feel like from today, she
should be more confident with her shot.  
  
Q. I don't like to play what-ifs, but with Briahanna Jackson maybe a
different game for you?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm not -- B.J., I texted with her, she said she's feeling better,
which is a good thing for us. But it is what it is. And we've been playing a
month without her, so it's not like we just found out a day ago she wasn't
going to play. I mean, I'm really pleased with where we are. You know, we shot
48 percent from the field. It's like I tell our kids, when we get shots, we
actually shoot it pretty well. But when you turn the damned things over 18
times, it's kind of tough. It's hard to score when the other team has got the
ball.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 57, Miami - 52  
  
KATIE MEIER: I just thought that was an awesome basketball game. If you really
are into strategy and personnel, and when you want to see young ladies have to
be at such a high intellect and play their guts out. If you really study the
game, there was so much going on in that game. There were so many adjustments,
and how hard it was to get people open.  
  
But to see these players just completely spill their guts out, on both teams,
and yet being exhausted and everything else and being so smart, so high level.
So that is a credit to the entire season of work in the ACC and how difficult
this conference is.  
  
You know, you've got two teams that really want to score more than in the 50s,
but when it comes March, you make sure that you're locking down on the
defensive end, so I think both teams were really, really committed to the
defensive end. And both teams hit really special shots.  
  
We don't have a lot of regrets in this game. We really don't. Took the lead in
the fourth, right where we wanted it, feeling great about everything, Rebecca
Greenwell picked a real fun time to get hot. That was rough. That was rough.
We had done such a great job on her, and then she's special that way, and
she's just that kid that just stays mentally in it, and you just can't knock
her down. Heck of a couple shots by her. I think that was the difference in
the game.  
  
But these two, we ran -- we made up about two or three play calls in the
middle of the game just because of the looks we were getting, and they
executed them. And Jessica made some high-level reads and Key had some amazing
finishes.  
  
I like my team. I love my team. We really had a great time in this tournament,
and I think that there's no question we played our best, best basketball in
March, which is a coach's dream. Hopefully March has still got a lot of
adventure ahead of us.  
  
Q. What does it say, you guys seemed like you had a really good game
plan for Lexie Brown, sort of giving her trouble, and then of course she just
comes down late, hits two free throws and then hits that end one. What does
that say about her as a player?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, you know, I think we did a really nice job on her, and she
got eight points at the line. She's a great free-throw shooter. She earned
them. But those eight points at the line, you've got a scenarios in your head,
but she got almost half her points at the free-throw line because she shoots
such a high percentage, and some of them were not on a shot. I mean, the two
free throws she got when she was just dribbling, we just said this is our
fourth foul, we don't want another foul, and she got two very important free
throws there just running an offense, and that's the kind of stuff you can't
give Lexie because she's so dangerous in other areas. But her on the free-
throw line -- if she missed one tonight, I was shocked, honest.  
  
Q. Talk for a second, that last possession I think you guys were down
one and then they got the shot-clock violation off that, what were you trying
to do?  
KATIE MEIER: It's the same play we had run earlier and I don't want to give
away so much of our strategy, but we had a lot of looks and we just -- I don't
think we ran it as crisply. It might be one of those times where you just got
a little -- you get a little bit of a cloud. You know, a lot of minutes,
people have played maybe 100 minutes in this tournament. And so you think
you're playing crisp or whatever, but maybe that got us a little bit. It
wasn't exactly how we wanted it to go.  
  
Q. Keyona, you seemed to be able to expose the Duke zone and get some
awfully good looks inside. How were you able to do that?  
KEYONA HAYES: We had a game plan, and they have holes in their zone, and we
just found the holes. I found the holes, and I just played from there.  
  
Q. Another game for you guys with 30 points in the paint. For a team
that's so heavy on the guards, why do you think you've had such success in
this tournament getting into the paint?  
KATIE MEIER: That's a great question, but that's what I'm saying. You think
you're going to come into the ACC Tournament after you've played teams two and
three times and think you're going to get what you want, you're not going to.
So if you're immature about it and you just cry in your soup, but you've got
to expect it.  
  
We didn't get what we've been getting all year, but that's why I love this
team because we can stay patient and stay within ourselves and stay very much
in the moment and take what people were giving us.  
  
I do think that our high-low game this entire tournament was phenomenal, but I
think it was also our guards were checking down a little bit off of the ball
screens and making some really great -- we call them Gillman passes down the
lanes, and our posts were holding their pins a little bit longer. The guards
get a lot of attention, and they draw people away, then we can kind of get
them on the inside.  
  
Q. You guys have about two weeks off now before you play again in the
NCAA Tournament. What's your plan going forward? You said you were having a
great March so far. How do you keep that going?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, if you'd like to come to Miami and be on our practice
squad, we'll put you to work.  
  
Yeah, it's weird, we're usually on spring break right now, so I expected to
play tomorrow, so I haven't had a meeting about that yet. But we will -- this
team, this team, you've got to kick them out of the gym. We literally, at this
point -- my trainer tells me how long we can practice, and they fight me want
to practice longer. And I have 25 minutes of intensity days and 45 minutes of
intensity days and the trainer has to tell me to get these guys out of the
gym. And then I'll ask why they're tired, and they'll say, well, I was up at
6:00 getting my shots in. Oh, my God. So this team I'm not worried about.
We'll stay sharp.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up to what you just said, great game last night,
yesterday, that you won against Florida State, and then to get your kids to
come back and play at such a high level back-to-back days speaks volumes about
your kids.  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, and we had another game before that that wasn't easy,
either. It was the all-physical bracket. I mean, it was unbelievable.  
  
We talked real quick, we're very authentic and we're very frank, and I said,
right now if I didn't think we were a Sweet 16 team and beyond, I would tell
you how much I love you, how great you are and ignore the mistakes, but that's
not us. That's not us. And if you want to be high level, we're going to hear
it right now.  
  
There's a couple things we did wrong in the last minute there, and then I went
and patted them on the back. But they want it. As tired as they are, I'm so
proud of our effort, I really am. But you're going to be tired. You're going
to have stress. You're going to have pressure. And we're fine with it. But
we're not going to come away from this tournament without making some
adjustments, too. We're not going to up in the clouds saying "nice try," we
just won't. In fact, they'd hate them if I did that to them. They expect the
truth.  
  
Q. For both players, talk about that last minute, the highs and lows
that you got the lead after fighting back but then to give it up to Duke in
that last minute, talk about the emotions of it.  
JESSICA THOMAS: I mean, it was up and down. It hurts, you know, as seniors, as
a veteran squad it hurts because we let it slip away. Like Coach said, it's
just a matter of execution, and when it came down to it, we had a big
possession, didn't execute the way we wanted to, and could have easily took
the lead and took the game. I mean, emotionally, it sucks. But I mean, but it
is what it is. We've got to get better, and we know that.  
  
KATIE MEIER: But I disagree with her. We did not give it to Duke. We did not
give this game away. We did not. We fought hard to take the lead, and they
took it back.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Marina Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30383)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Louisville - 73  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought Durr was unbelievable. I mean, she made so many huge
shots with somebody almost right on her. I thought she was fabulous today. She
just hit so many big threes. We'd get up and think we could just get a stop,
we'd be okay, but we really had trouble stopping her, and I thought Hines-
Allen played well.  
  
But I think Shook probably made the difference. She was somebody that we were
halfway going to guard, and then she hit four out of five threes, so she
definitely was one of their better players today.  
  
I thought Marina did a really great job in a lot of ways. I thought first when
Lindsay got her second foul she could play an entire quarter at the point,
which she really hasn't done all year long, and kept us even. That was really
big for us.  
  
In the second half we were able to go to Bree a little bit more. I didn't
think we did a good job of getting her the ball in first half, but we were
able to get it to her in the second half, and then making free throws down the
stretch. I thought maybe the biggest shot of the game was Jackie Young's
three. I thought she, for a freshman, really stepped up.  
  
Q. Talk about just the poise of your team; you had Allen, Turner and
Young all with four fouls and playing most of the fourth quarter, just the
poise down the stretch to not foul out.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that was critical. Our game plan was kind of who's going
to go in if they foul out. We really had a short bench today, and we really
didn't have a good answer, so I was glad we were able to play smarter. We
wanted to play zone, but the way they were shooting the ball I didn't think
that was a good option. We tried to triangle and two quite a bit to try to
save at least Bree and Lindsay, and I thought that was pretty successful.  
  
Q. Turnovers and points off turnovers seemed to be the two key factors.
You had a big edge in both. You were guarding the ball real well.  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we played them at Notre Dame and set a record. We
only had four turnovers in the game, so we had five today. I don't think we
can play better than that. I thought we played a really smart game, got the
ball to the right people, took good care of it, and forced them into 18, which
was huge. We got a couple of breakaway lay-ups in the second half that really,
really were key.  
  
Q. Coach, game was a real grinder; how did you bring it home in the
end?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, they had to be tired after two big games back to
back. I thought that we would pull away in the fourth quarter, but it took us
a really long time to do that, and I felt like we looked tired at times, too.
I think that had to be a little bit of the difference.  
  
Q. Marina, coach said you had to run the point for the second quarter
when Lindsay got in foul trouble. What was it like for you to have to run the
show as opposed to being the one scoring?  
MARINA MABREY: I really don't like when Lindsay does that, but I really don't
have do it very often. I really just wanted to keep it even and make sure that
we didn't lose our lead or anything, and I thought it was pretty successful.  
  
Q. You were out there, Marina, when Young hit that three that I think
was the game kind of clincher there. They had crawled back within six. What
were you feeling when you saw that shot go down?  
MARINA MABREY: Well, I was getting ready to sub in actually. But I was really
excited. I think I jumped on the court. I was really happy for her because
she's a freshman, and to hit a huge shot like that in the ACC Tournament I
know probably feels great.  
  
Q. As a freshman just to continue with that, just talk about the kind of
career you think she's going to have at Notre Dame.  
MARINA MABREY: Jackie has limitless potential. She's so athletic and so gifted
and I think she's going to be one of the best players Notre Dame ever had.  
  
Q. We talked about Lindsay's assist record yesterday, but she also tied
Skylar for the most games played in her career, which shows longevity for a
freshman to step up and play that many games. Talk about what that means
having her as a steady four.  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I thought even as a freshman she had such poise and
she was surrounded by veterans who really helped her kind of ease her way into
the college game. She just didn't make any mistakes. She did what she was
capable of doing. And each year she's done a little bit more. And then this
year, I mean, we just -- she's such a leader for us. We're a little bit out of
sync usually when she's not in the game, just because she directs us. She
directs what we're doing defensively, what we're going to get in offensively.
We try to keep it really simple when she's not in the game, and she does
everything for us. She is our MVP.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Lexie Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26967)

### [Rebecca Greenwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28343)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 57, Miami - 52.  
  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Well, obviously it was a great basketball game, and I'm
very proud of our team for our defensive effort. That's a very strong
defensive effort, holding them to 37 percent from the floor. That's obviously
very important.  
  
I thought we played our very best when we needed to. Fourth quarter was very
strong for us. Leaonna Odom, a/k/a Ducky, had a big, big game. Those 13 points
were very significant and it was great to see her break out. I think she's one
of the best freshmen in the country. I think she's under the radar, but kind
of used to that, I guess.  
  
With Becca, I thought she was poised in a tough situation for her. They guard
well. They're very quick. And obviously they're switching on to Becca and
Lexie, so there's a lot of things that have to be worked through. And Becca
saved her best for the fourth quarter, as well. And then of course Lexie, same
thing, being a competitor, creating a great shot for herself to create for the
team, and all of that.  
  
I loved the time and score. I actually loved the defensive stops we got. We
kept talking about that. At this time of year you can't get worried about
anything else but the moment, and I felt we were very, very good in the moment
down the stretch, and that's a takeaway that we'll have to take for the rest
of the season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about being in the ACC championship after being picked
sixth? Did you see yourself being in this position?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Apparently we're the only ones that did. (Shaking head.)
That's all I can say. I don't know what to say about that. I'm not trying to
make light of it. I don't know what to tell you. These kids know what they can
do, and they've known it all year, and they've been extraordinarily consistent
all year. So it's not something you like project and say you don't promise it
to happen, you just keep focusing on getting better.  
  
And I think one thing I can say about this team is they stay in the process
very well. They stay in the process of getting better very well, and so --
when you have a team like that and the talent that we have and the way they're
willing to play together, then anything can happen. Anything.  
  
REBECCA GREENWELL: I don't think we're surprised at all as a team. We knew we
had the potential from the very beginning of the season, so we might be
surprising others out there, but from the inside we're not surprised at all,
and we're just excited for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Becca, how big a burden was lifted when those two three-pointers went
in?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: I was a little relieved. But I'm just really proud of our
team. I tried to do what was needed for time and score, but I think everyone
had really contributed. Lexie was huge for us today and also Ducky came up
with some big shots throughout the game.  
  
Q. Lexie, they were giving you guys a tough time defensively for most of
the afternoon, but just how were you feeling when you came down, had two free
throws, and then the huge and-one? I saw you smile and stomp. What were you
feeling in that moment knowing you were going to have a chance to go play for
a title tomorrow?  
LEXIE BROWN: Obviously it was just a lot of excitement. That was a tough game.
It was a battle. We were expecting a battle. Miami is a great team. They're a
super physical team. I think it was the perfect tune-up for us for tomorrow.
But when you win a game like that, when you make a big play like that, you
watch your teammates make big plays throughout the game, in such a tough
battle, you can't do anything but be relieved when it's over.  
  
Q. Can you talk about meeting up with Notre Dame? It was really close
the last time you guys played. What do you see for tomorrow?  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: You know, at this point, obviously they're a terrific
opponent. Obviously they've done extremely well. It's really about us. I mean,
it's really about what we want to do. We're looking at tying Miami in
rebounds. We're looking at shooting 25 percent in the first -- I don't know
what's going on in that first -- I don't know what's happening there. I don't
know what to tell you. Maybe it's the bus ride. But just the consistency that
we're going for. Obviously they're a terrific team and a great program, so I
can't take anything away. But I don't think who it matters who we're playing.
What I'm saying to that is it doesn't matter because we've got to work on what
we've got to work on, as I'm sure they do, too. So again, they're a terrific
program, but now it's really turning with us and how we can get better.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense a little bit with how they shot today, and
also yesterday you shut down Syracuse. Talk about the defensive effort you
guys have had the last 20 hours.  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Yeah, it's been amazing, and it needs to continue,
obviously. When you look at Peterson and how she struggled, and I'm looking
here, I didn't realize how well we did, to be honest with you, with Thomas and
Motley, just holding them to single digits. That's huge. Hayes got away from
us a little bit, but I think the defensive intensity, the immediacy of our
defense, it starts with the guards and how they dictate, and then of course
everybody else has to sort of follow. But that's a terrific effort, and that's
the reason why we get another game. I mean, that's just simply the reason why
we get another game. Hopefully we can -- a third game we can find a way to do
the same thing, maybe in a different way, against another team.  
  
Q. For the players, turnovers it looks like maybe that is sort of one
issue with the Duke team. Are they triggered more by being anxious, or were
they triggered more by a good defense from Miami and then yesterday
Syracuse?  
LEXIE BROWN: I think it's a little mix of both. I notice that we do have a lot
of like travel calls, which personally, we don't really mind those types of
turnovers because they're not live ball turnovers, so they don't lead into
transition lay-ups. But it is nerves. For a lot of them and a lot of us, this
is our first ACC semifinal game, so we had to get a little bit of the nerves
out of the way, a little bit of being tired from yesterday. But also we've got
to credit Miami's defense because they were all in our face, they were
speeding us up a lot, but we've got to cut down those turnovers if we want a
chance against Notre Dame tomorrow.  
  
Q. You talked about Leaonna and the great job she had defensively. At
the end you had Erin in there. Talk about Erin's defense.  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: Erin is just one of the most improved players in the
league. She really works very hard. She's very hard on herself. We try to get
her to lighten up a little bit. But she has great defensive poise. She can
play different spots in our match-ups, and she's pretty confident.  
  
I thought it was pretty significant that we had a freshman and a junior in
there trying to handle things down the stretch. Our seniors did some nice
things, too, but they were just playing well together, and the stops -- the
consecutive stops that occurred at the end were obviously very big, and they
were a big part of that. So Erin is just a great person and just getting
better and better, and we're going to get her to have some more fun, too.  
  
Q. Talk us through the defense there on that shot-clock violation for
Miami at the end.  
JOANNE P. McCALLIE: The players might better do that. All I saw was a great
defensive effort by everybody. Do you guys remember that?  
  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, I think it was just our communication. I think we were just
really buckling down for that possession, and I think Kyra had a huge contest,
and it was an awesome contest for someone her size, especially since she was
undersized compared to the person that was shooting the ball. But I think in
those time and score situations and crunch time, it's all about communication,
and we've really improved on that over the year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 59, NC State - 58  
  
JEFF WALZ: When we find out who's going where in the NCAA Tournament, I think
NC State is going to be a very tough draw for whoever might get that draw. And
I think there's no doubt in my mind that they should be a top four seed and
have the opportunity to host. When you look at what they've done and their
wins, I think they've done what they need to do to be able to host.  
  
And then for our kids, we struggled the first quarter defensively. We were
actually bad. So I should take struggle away.  
  
But then we figured it out. We started to play a lot more as a team. We
stopped the ball in transition, and then we rebounded the ball. We got killed
there in the first half on second-chance points and just easy baskets. We
figured out a way to get that stopped. I was really excited for Asia with the
way she played out there.  
  
And then I thought Myisha came along in the second half and gave us a big
spark, also.  
  
It's a team win, but we definitely are going to need to get more from our
bench, and it might not just be scoring, but it's going to have to be some
solid minutes at the defensive end of the floor, as well.  
  
Q. Just a couple of questions and a clarification: The call with 36
seconds left when Asia appeared to lose the ball out of bounds and they gave
the ball back to you, what was the call?  
JEFF WALZ: They said it was a kicked ball. Yeah, I didn't know, either.  
  
Q. And the second question is what were you going for on your last
possession? Did you get what you wanted as far as Myisha getting the foul?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, that's exactly what we were trying to get. We were trying to
get a slip on the backside. We knew that they would go hard with Asia going
out there. Mariya is our best passer by far. So by putting her, taking the
ball out, it takes away a shooter, but Taylor did a good job of selling it as
we were trying to get it in ball side wing, and Myisha did a really nice job
of being patient, allowing her to come on, and then as her defender took a
step out she slipped it and ended up with a great pass by Mariya. And she
stepped up and made two big free throws.  
  
Q. Myisha, what's going through your mind? You had a chance to put the
cards ahead late in this one. What are you thinking or not thinking?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I'm thinking I've got to put these in. Trying to end the
game, seal it. They would have the ball back, so it was basically put these
two in and then get a stop on defense so we could win the game.  
  
Q. You guys had a tough one at your place against this team in overtime
when you lost on a last-second shot. Were there flashbacks and did that help
you in this game knowing what they were going to do on the last possession?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I thought we did a pretty good job defending. Taylor did a
really nice job on the ball. Spencer a good shot. It's a shot she can make,
and she made them throughout the game.  
  
What we didn't do a very good job was rebounding it there. You know, they came
up with a big board, and I think it was Maize that got that rebound for them
and had a great look. We were very fortunate it did not go in.  
  
So it's one of those things that you get caught up where Spencer shoots it and
you watch to see if it goes in thinking that's going to be the last shot, and
you can't do that. You've got to finish out the play. You've got to get that
rebound, or if the clock expires, that's fine, but you have to figure out a
way to get that board.  
  
Q. You all had one of your best free-throw shooting nights of the
season. Talk about the progression of the kids out there under such pressure
situations.  
JEFF WALZ: Again, I think you can look at that two ways. I think that's where
you get into your alternative facts, okay. Yes, we did extremely well shooting
free throws, but then we didn't have opportunities to get offensive rebounds
off those free throws because we made them. So we could have padded possibly
some more offensive rebounds if we had missed. So it depends how you want to
turn that.  
  
Q. Would Myisha like to take her final two back then for maybe that
chance?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No.  
  
Q. Jeff, looking at the first quarter, 28 points, 30 the rest of the
way. As a follow-up to what you said, was there anything specifically you did
differently over those last three quarters?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, I hope Mathurin - I hope I'm pronouncing it right.
My pronunciation of names is not very good at times - I hope she's okay
because that was a big blow to them and I'm not foolish enough to sit here and
think that it wasn't because she spreads the floor for them, she can post-up,
she shoots the three. So I think when she went down, it allowed us to clog
some things up more in the paint to help stop their penetration. So that was a
big part of it.  
  
But then we did a better job of leveling the ball, also, and trying to contain
Spencer because that first quarter she was getting to the rim whenever she
wanted, and it might not be her scoring, but then she was getting somebody
else a shot. So those two things I think really were a big part of us being
able to defend.  
  
Q. With two games in the books already, you have another one tomorrow,
you were saying the bench is important for you, not just to get points but
maybe some minutes for your starters. How tough is it to have to play three
and three or potentially four and four?  
JEFF WALZ: They're 18 to 22 years old. They used to play five and six in AAU
ball. So I'm not -- I don't think they're concerned about that. Are you all?  
  
ASIA DURR: No, we just want to win.  
  
JEFF WALZ: You just want to keep playing. That's what it's all about. We've
got to find a way to dig in. I'm going to have to do a better job tomorrow of
trying to use that media time-out to get a sub in at maybe the 5:20 if there's
a dead ball knowing there's going to be a media coming up in 20 seconds to see
if we can't manufacture instead of a two and a half-minute break, which I
think our media time-outs are, they feel like they're forever, you get another
minute or two during that 20 seconds if there's a dead ball and now all of a
sudden you're looking at a four-minute game. It's what they came here to do
was break.  
  
Q. This is the third game in the last two years that's been decided by
two points or less. What is it about NC State that makes them such a tough
opponent to play?  
ASIA DURR: Well, they're a well-coached team. You know, coming into this game,
we knew that it was going to be a big game, and we knew that our defense was
going to have to be on point, and I think, you know, like what Coach said, in
the first we started off rough. It was terrible. And then we bounced back. So
that's what's most important, bouncing back, and you know, just fighting
through it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Miami - 56, Florida State - 54  
  
SUE SEMRAU: The way the pace was going, we changed that in the second half,
and they still hit some big shots. I still didn't think our defense was what
it needed to be.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you're going to the NCAA Tournament, probably going
to get a couple of home games. What's going to be your regimen over the next
couple of week as you prepare for that?  
SUE SEMRAU: It's a little bit different for us this year than it's been in
years past. We usually are going into spring break right now and now we're
going to go back to class next week. So we'll practice next week, give them a
couple days off now, practice next week and then give them some time right
before spring break, then we'll get back and get ready for another opponent.  
  
Q. It was a strange game. The second half you guys traded baskets or
points for the entire third quarter and no one could get any run going, then
you finally made a run in the fourth quarter. What was the flow on the court
that you couldn't get over the hump?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, like Coach said, I don't see this team having the same
confidence that we had earlier in the season.  
  
I think it's about defense. I mean, I don't think we felt comfortable on the
offensive end of the floor, and I think it came from our defense and not being
able to be as solid as we think -- I mean, I think we are as a team. It's
going to come down to we have one more opportunity, one more shot at another
tournament, and we have to regroup and work on that.  
  
Q. Katie said in the press conference last night that there were no
secrets. Both teams knew everything about the other team. How difficult is it
to beat a good team three times?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think it's more difficult to not beat -- to be the team that
loses that game. I think it's more difficult. I think you look at -- I don't
think that has anything to do with it. I think it comes down to who comes into
play each game, and fortunately we had a couple of really good games against
Miami in the regular season. We didn't have a good game against them tonight,
and that's on us. It's not about whether we knew enough or they knew enough.
It's on the way we played.  
  
Q. Your conference is a bear; there are seven ranked teams and obviously
some very, very good ones. How tough is it to have to play through that
schedule to prepare you for this tournament, and obviously for the next
tournament having seen every style and almost every level of talent?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, it's a great conference. You look at top to bottom this
year, it has been a bear, and then to step out of conference like we did and
play Texas, who was leading their league, I think was really, really tough for
us. It wasn't like, okay, we've got a bye week and we can just get some rest
and that type of thing. But I think that's what the top teams in the
conference have to do. You have to step out. You have to do what the fans
need, what's good for us, and I think it will bode well for us coming down the
stretch.  
  
We'll regroup, like Leti said, and we'll be ready.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 59, NC State - 58.  
  
WES MOORE: They battled. They competed. You know, obviously Durr was
phenomenal in the first half, tried switching up D's a little bit in the
second half, and that helped some, but seemed like we gave up some offensive
rebounds at some key times, and the phantom kicked ball down there late in the
game was tough, too.  
  
But you know, I'm proud of our kids, and we know we'll be playing again. So
just got to try to rest up a little bit and recover from it and get ready to
go again.  
  
Q. What is the situation going forward with Jennifer?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, we think she'll be all right. She essentially had a sprained
knee, had some pain with it, and felt like it would be better to hold her out
today. But she should be good to go for the postseason.  
  
Q. What was the plan for the last possession? Where did you want the
ball to go?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, we were trying to get Dom off a stagger, and I think they
were kind of cheating to that side of the floor, and so ended up Ashley
Williams came off of it. When that broke down, we were trying to spread them
out, let Maya attack the rim a little bit, maybe should have set a pick on the
ball for her but we tried to really spread them out. Thought she got a pretty
good look. DD did a great job getting to the offensive boards, also got a
decent look, just wouldn't go in.  
  
You know, again, one or two plays here or there, seems like every time we've
played them it's come down to the very end, and it just shows you how critical
every possession is throughout a game.  
  
Q. The kicked ball, did the referees video review that?  
WES MOORE: They, I guess, decided that was a kicked ball. But a pretty
critical play. I think we were up one at the time, and we would have had the
ball there with about 30 seconds left, would have forced them to have to foul.
So it was a pretty critical play. Very critical.  
  
Q. Jeff was very positive of you guys deserving one of the top four
seeds in the NCAA Tournament. He said your body of work deserves it. Your own
thoughts on potentially getting a top 16?  
WES MOORE: Well, you know, I appreciate him saying that. I think we have,
what, four wins over top-15 teams. You know, I don't know. Sometimes I can't
figure some of those things out. Even right now a couple of polls, two polls
have somebody in our league that finished three spots behind us still ahead of
us in the rankings. You know, I don't know. Maybe -- who knows. But you know,
again, I think our kids, their résumé is pretty impressive, and I think they
definitely do deserve consideration for that, but I also realize today was a
big game, and that's why that game was so important to both teams.  
  
Q. Wes, 28 points in the first quarter, 30 the rest of the way. Jeff
seemed to think that Jennifer's loss was huge. Tell me what your thoughts
is.  
WES MOORE: Well, I mean, definitely that makes a difference because Jen is
capable of getting hot and hitting some threes, so it definitely hurt us some.
Foul trouble, also. You know, Dom had a couple of fouls, and so we had her out
a good bit of the second quarter. But I've got to do a better job. We scored
six points in the second quarter. That really hurt us. It did become a very
physical game, and I think that kept the score down a little bit. Both teams
did a pretty good job defensively.  
  
But again, second quarter really hurt us, and I'll take some of the blame for
that. I've got to help them more. But when Dom is off the floor, when Jen
Mathurin is off the floor, that's two pretty good scorers, and it did make it
difficult.  
  
Q. Dom, did they do anything differently defensively this game? It
looked like they weren't giving you as many three chances as they were in
Louisville. What did they do to take the three of you away from you?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: They face guarded me a lot. I know trying to get off of
screens or hand balls they were in front of me forcing me to go back door, but
there was also somebody back there waiting just in case they passed it to me
back door. I think they did a pretty good job at that. Yeah, and coming off of
threes, off of the screen, they showed Little a little bit, but they also had
a hand up, and then they did a good job of helping, too, so they made it
difficult to shoot it a little bit.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Laura Cornelius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32696)

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Miami - 56, Florida State - 54  
  
KATIE MEIER: We're really excited. I told the team in the locker room that
we've done this before. We've been in the semis and we've beaten Florida State
to get there. We've done that before. This is the team that's supposed to go
somewhere Miami hasn't gone before. So as excited as we are, we're going to
get right back to the hotel, we're going to watch this game and we're going to
prepare for our game tomorrow. I'm very proud of the grit. I don't know that
that was the fourth quarter for the ages. It was not. Eight points in the
fourth quarter and winning is good, but boy, did we get some great defensive
stops.  
  
Florida State is so very good. This is ridiculous to hold them to 54 points,
and I'm not -- I'm telling you that that's how hard these young ladies had to
work to hold that team to 54 points. We've beaten Florida State before, but
we've not kept them at 54, and I really don't know that it was anything except
just herculean efforts and a no-quit attitude by my team. My bench was as in
tune and talking and calling plays and Tia Jackson did the scout and she had
their plays just down.  
  
It was a matter of we deserved it, we knew we deserved it. We sort of
Chernobyled there in the fourth quarter in the last two minutes and tried to
give it away, and that will be a nice lesson for a postseason game because
when you learn lessons and win against your rival and you learn lessons in
wins, we take them and we'll take them seriously. We did celebrate in the
locker room. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to be too cool up here. We
really did celebrate in the locker number. This team has been amazing. They've
been tested, and we're like chameleons. You don't know if you take away the
three from Miami, can they still beat you? Yeah. We went 1 for 11, but we can
still beat you.  
  
We used to be -- we had to hit the three. We got a pretty nice inside game
now, too. We got a nice pull-up jumper and I thought Laura Cornelius, I told
her -- she had missed a couple shots, she was going hit a big one. But more
when she woke up, and she just changed her game and got downhill and started
being -- instead of thinking too much about the strategy and just played to
her world-class instinct, it changed the game for us.  
  
Q. That last 30 seconds they had four shots if not more, and then the
free throws. Is that kind of a microcosm that you played the defense you had
as opposed to falling apart when they had the last chance to win or tie?  
KATIE MEIER: That's where I meant Chernobyl. That was awful that we gave them
so many chances to rebound the ball. I thought we hustled, but I mean, we got
to close the door, and we had them. They ran the same baseline out of bounds
play three times, which we knew, and Romero got the three out of that. We knew
Shakayla that they wanted to go to her so Laura was helping the double, but we
should have known that flex screen was coming and then Laura can clear up at
the, so we made one adjustment in the huddle for that.  
  
I think the biggest deal is Jessica Thomas was not having -- she wasn't
hitting so well, wasn't hitting her three, but at halftime I told her -- we're
a really honest team, very authentic. I said, hey, you're not hitting tonight,
but you already have five rebounds. Who came up with the huge rebound?
Smallest kid on the court. So that's where this team has in grown because we
couldn't have done that in November. We would have been a little bit in
ourselves.  
  
Q. If my memory serves me correctly, and it doesn't always, you lost by
15 and 9. What specifically did you do different in this game?  
KATIE MEIER: Not a heck of a lot to be honest. We had a quick turnaround. We
couldn't assume that we were going to win that game last night so our eyes
weren't on Florida State yet, so it was the quick turnaround. We taped up some
lines in the hotel and did a walk-through. But I'll tell you, the team was
begging me -- I was like, okay, we're done. They were like, no, we're not, we
want to go through this play and this play and this play. They begged me to
stay and I kind of needed a nap. But they wouldn't let me leave. So there we
were in the hotel with a taped-up key and a three-point line and they're like
what about this play, they called that three. They were on it. So what we did
differently this time I think is we were just more grown. We were grown women.  
  
Q. Adrian, were you surprised how easily y'all jumped out to the lead on
them at the start of this game?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: No, starting yesterday at Georgia Tech I told the team if we
start how we started last game -- this game like last game at Georgia Tech we
could beat a lot of people, and I think we really took that to heart, and I
know what we can do. I play with these guys every day, and I know what
everybody is capable of. So when we started off hot, I knew right away we were
going to win this game, and it was just boosting my confidence, so no, I
wasn't surprised.  
  
Q. Laura, can you discuss sometime in the middle of the third quarter
you just got hot and something changed. What changed for you because you
scored the last six points of the third quarter and you just seemed to be in
tune for the rest of the game?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: You know, a little before that, I think I missed a couple
open shots, and the whole bench, the coaches, my teammates, they just told me,
you know, you're taking great shots, and I was like, yeah, yeah, I know.
Listen, they gave me a lot of confidence, and that's what's so great about
this team. We talk to each other. We believe in each other, and I was just
able to get to the rim, get a couple shots. But it's really a team effort
overall. This is everybody's, not just Mot, not just the people who are on the
stat sheet. It's literally everybody on this team who got this win for us.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, can you take us through from a
defensive standpoint Florida State's last offensive possession?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Like what was going through our heads?  
  
Q. Yeah, what were you doing and how did you bring it off without their
scoring?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: We knew they were going to go in to Shakayla, so like coach
said, everybody on that team can score, but we knew they were probably going
to go to Shakayla so we focused in on there.  
  
Honestly what was in my head, I knew they were going to miss; it was just
getting the rebound. Jit fouled, and I kind of thought like, hey, that's a bad
foul, but then Ivey Slaughter missed two free throws, and it was just -- it
turned out to be a great stop for us. You know, I think everybody was locked
in on that defensive possession. We do possession awareness in practice, and
it's for games like this. I think we just locked in and said, you know, we're
not going to lose this game. We're going to get the stop, and I think that's
what we did.  
  
Q. Points in the paint seem to be one of the big keys for y'all's
victory tonight. Talk about the effort in the paint.  
KATIE MEIER: I will because I think that has been the story of the tournament
for us. Really talk about growing up, we're going to have that one magical
night where that combination of points in the paint and the threes are
falling. This team has been on a journey, and it's not even close to over, and
we know it. That's one thing we wanted to establish coming into this
tournament is like big-time teams, we've got to rely on defense and points in
the paint, and the extra, the lagniappe, as they call it in Louisiana, little
something extra, that can be our three-point shooting, but we're not going to
start and end. That's not going to be the story of Miami, but it will be why
we win a big game because we're gonna get hot from outside and then people
better watch out.  
  
Q. This conference season has been a bear and you had to beat a No. 8
team in the country tonight, you have to play another one tomorrow who's in
the top 25. Talk about how tough this conference is and if you do advance and
go to The Finals how tough it's going?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, I guess my best example for how tough this conference is is
that I think that UVA could go into the NCAA and win two and go into the Sweet
16. That's how good I think this conference is. And I'm not just saying that
because Joanne is a friend of mine. I watch UVA and I'm like, oh, my God. I'm
surprised how many wins we got because I have so much respect and just, we go
through the scouting report, and there's been years, you talk about two or
three players, our scouting reports, you start going, well, this kid can do
this, this, this and this, and then you've got the greatest coaches, too. So
it's a heck of a conference. It got us ready to win this kind of game, because
this was kind of a little bit like that Louisville game where we were just
real physical and it was in the 50s and whatever and we were on the road and
whatever. And we'd kind of been there before.  
  
You know, the response and the effort and the great at this -- you've got to
win in every different way to win in this conference. However many ACC wins we
have, I'm telling you they're like little trophies on your mantle. You're just
so happy to get them.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Virginia - 59  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Made some mistakes, but I thought we were able to get it
together in the second half.  
  
Q. I know basketball is a team game, but to see Lindsay break the all-
time assist record, that's a record that means she's helping other people
score. What does that mean to you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah. You know, I don't even want to think about next year
without her. She does so many things, like the play at the end of the half.
Just to see how fast with the ball, how she can go through people. She has
incredible vision. She's an amazing teammate. She guards people. She directs
people. She does everything you could ask for in a point guard. I think she is
the consummate point guard, just a great team player. She's accounted for, I
don't know how many points it is, about 2,500 overall, with all the assists
she's had in her career. Just amazing.  
  
Q. Lindsay, it's a team game, but that's a record that actually you're
helping other people score, so what does it mean to you to have the all-time
Notre Dame record and ACC record in assists?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think it means a lot, but it especially speaks to the kind of
players Coach McGraw recruits. She recruits shooters, people who are smart,
people who know their shot and what they are good at, so I think we have a
very smart team. Every game we're looking to take the best shot we can get, so
it's really an unselfish game for us. It means a lot for me to be able to
share it with my teammates and be able to appreciate it with them.  
  
Q. Coach, you face Louisville tomorrow. What are you expecting out of
that one with the Cardinals playing you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they've got so many good players, it's hard to know where
to start. Asia Durr is just having a terrific year. I think Hines-Allen is a
player that's really difficult to guard, shes a tough match-up because she can
face up, put it on the floor. She's really strong. She plays hard. They've got
three-point shooters with more on the perimeter. They're just a great team.
They've had some injuries this year, but they look like they're playing great
basketball right now.  
  
Q. In the previous game with Louisville, maybe it was a 19-point win,
what did you do well in that game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, Hines-Allen only played a minute. I think that was a big
difference in the game, and Durr had 31 and Moore hit 18, so defensively we
didn't do much. Offensively I think we were able to score, and we've been able
to score, but our lacuna has been defense all year long, so we'd like to fix
that.  
  
Q. For both the players, you guys have been on such a roll these last
two months. What has changed in the team from the beginning of the year when
you guys struggled a little bit to now when you're playing probably your best
basketball of the season?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think we're playing with more of a sense of urgency,
obviously towards the end of the season you're getting to the ACC Tournament,
NCAA Tournament, so I think now we're playing with more urgency because you
realize that we're going to get each team's best shot and I think we're
playing smarter and playing looser, and I think we're just realizing who our
best scorers are and what our strengths are.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we're just playing with confidence. We know now that
it's one-and-done and we know we're a good team and we don't want to go home,
so I think we're just playing how we should play and how we've been practicing
the whole year.  
  
Q. You did force them into 17 turnovers. Talk a little bit about that
defensive pressure to maybe help you turn this around.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, second half I think we probably played a little better
defensively, but I don't know how many of those were forced and how many they
just turned it over. I think we still have a ways to go defensively.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Lexie Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26967)

### [Oderah Chidom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30366)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 68, Syracuse - 46.  
  
JOANNE McCALLIE: Really proud of our team, particularly the second half. I
thought we really came out very strong and aggressive. The rebounds were
important to us. A lot of different people rebounding. I get a real kick out
of the fact that Kyra Lambert led us in rebounding. I think that speaks
volumes for what rebounding is in terms of hustle play and everything else, so
that's great.  
  
You know, good game for us. Slow start. Not really the first half that we
wanted. But the team really connected in the second half and really executed.  
  
I thought Lexie's game was just, as Lexie does, very poised and directing and
leading, and showing the player that she is in this league, a pretty special,
special player. And then, of course, Oderah is a senior, just so many good
things, blocks and rebounds and attacking and all that type of thing. We're
hoping to learn from this one and get after it tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned how Lexie is a special player. This is a tournament you
want to try to win, but any added specialness to this in the fact that she
didn't win Player of the Year and Peterson did and you shut her down?  
JOANNE McCALLIE: Well, we can't put any energy there. I mean, our energy is to
try to get two more games. What I can say is Lexie's actions speak for
themselves, defensively, offensively on both sides of the ball. She's an elite
player, one of the best in the country, and she's just working on her game.
Always trying to get better, great work ethic, pushes her teammates, and just
has a great intensity about her. That's where we've got to put the energy, and
I think things come.  
  
Individual things come, and maybe there's bigger for this team, bigger, better
things for this team, and individual things will come.  
  
Q. Obviously 18 is not a good number in terms of turnovers and offensive
rebounds for them, but what does it say about your team that you guys were
able to have sort of a sluggish game and still win by 22?  
JOANNE McCALLIE: It says that we need to learn how to play two halves. That's
what it says. 18 turnovers -- we had 11 in the first half. I think we had 10
in the first quarter. Something about not playing for a long time, coming off
a Sunday game, and we just had to get things going.  
  
I really wasn't worried about it, but it was disappointing because we don't
like to turn the ball over. And they are a very good offensive-rebounding
team. They're very good, and we didn't win that battle. We wanted to win
battle but it's terrific that we held them to 23 percent. There's a lot of
offensive rebounds when a team is shooting 23 percent. So the reality is the
defense was really fabulous, and that stat really sticks out because they're
an excellent team.  
  
Q. Similar game, you held them to 25 percent at Cameron, 23 tonight.
Does your zone defense -- I've watched you all season long. Does this zone
defense play any better than it does tonight?  
JOANNE McCALLIE: Well, it's the people, it's not the schemes. I prefer to use
the word "match-up" because it's a lot more complicated than a zone. But what
I would say is that it's the people, the people doing it, Lexie and Kyra are
tearing at it, and they're really sending intensity and cutting down gaps.
Becca is really working her quickness in there as well. You saw Oderah and
Kendall not foul, move their feet, block shots, and so what I see is they're
just all playing off each other.  
  
So many times you talk about offensive poise, but you've really got to have
defensive poise, and we let 11 get away from us tonight. We weren't very happy
about that. She really did, she shot the ball well, but it's the defensive
poise and it's the leadership from Lexie and Kyra, Becca. Crystal was very
good tonight. When we can put Crystal in and get even more intensity thrown
out there, that really helps the entire team.  
  
So we're a work in progress, but there's no doubt that it's the players. It's
about the players and how they play together on the defensive side of the
ball.  
  
Q. Oderah, you get Miami tomorrow, very strong inside, physical team.
Talk a little bit about that matchup, what you expect.  
ODERAH CHIDOM: We recently played them. They have a lot of great guard play, a
lot of strong post play, very physical team. I think we're going to focus on
defense and rebounding, doing the same things, shutting down the gaps, they're
really good at penetrating, and just watch film tonight and then get ready for
them tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lexie, on that, you guys played this Syracuse team not long ago and
you were able to sort of replicate what you did against them then. How do you
do that on a short turnaround against a Miami team?  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, I think we just have to be open to learning, see what we
made mistakes with, see what we did well. Honestly, we just have to come out,
play hard. It's postseason, they're not the same team they were a week ago.
We're not the same team we were a week ago. We've just really got to focus on
ourselves and coming out, playing hard, like Oderah said, play defense and
focus on rebounding.  
  
Q. Lexie, talk about your first ACC Tournament and what does it mean to
play a game in it and be a part of this and obviously have a successful first
game?  
LEXIE BROWN: Oh, yeah. I played in one my freshman year, as well, but we lost
early, so that wasn't fun.  
  
No, it's been a really nice experience to be back in the ACC, and I think it's
just really fitting that the entire tournament is like in a different
location. I'm on a completely different team, so it's going to be a completely
new experience for me.  
  
This season has been the most fun I've ever had, and to be here with them has
been so amazing, and for us to come out and play the way that we did, I can't
be prouder of my teammates.  
  
Q. Oderah, you and Kendall were the only members of the team to make a
late run in the ACC Tournament. How important is it to you to get back to that
stage?  
ODERAH CHIDOM: I think it's just feeding off our teammates. Everyone doing
their part, playing their role. Everyone giving energy. It's a lot of fun when
everything is going well, and then also when we do have slip-ups, everyone is
super supportive. I think it's just a really strong team concept.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Gabby Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32706)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 68, Syracuse - 46  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, obviously not the result you want, but Duke is a good
team.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played against Duke, what do you think you
were not able to do in terms of making adjustments from that last game? That
was obviously a very similar style, you took a lot of threes and weren't able
to hit them.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: That's it. We got open shots, and again, 3-2 zone is going
to give you open shots in the corner. You've got to knock them down. So they
were going back and forth between 2-3 and 3-2 zones. We know their signals and
we know their calls. So when they called a defense, we called an offense. And
we got looks; we've got to make shots. We're attacking the rim and playing at
the basket. We played downhill, and our players got to play through contact
finish it. You expect to get foul calls and really just go up and power up.  
  
It's a physical game. They hit us in the paint. We fouled them, too. So it's
one of those things where you can't blame it on anything but us not making
shots, and we got the looks that we wanted. We've got to knock them down.  
  
Q. Along that same line, did having to play the extra game last night,
did that contribute to the fatigue?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I don't think so. I don't think so. I'd rather kind of play
a little bit and get yourself playing and moving. Last year obviously having
the double bye we came out on the top and everything, and got to the
championship game, which obviously is the goal. The goal is to win it.  
  
But we're not going to make that excuse of saying that we played last night
and now tonight we come out and not play up to our potential. I don't think
that had a whole lot to do with it. We've got to compete at a high level. This
is how we play, so we need to be built for this style. I don't think that
contributed a ton to it. No, I don't.  
  
Q. I know it's frustrating, but the excitement of playing in the NCAA
Tournament, your thoughts on playing again?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: You've got us in?  
  
Q. Safely I'd say.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Thank you.  
  
GABBY COOPER: Yeah, we're not happy with the outcome, of course, but looking
forward to the future. The Tournament is coming up, so we've just got to
prepare, and it's very exciting because of course it's my first one, so we're
just looking forward to coming out, playing hard, and doing what we do best.  
  
Q. Gabby, talk about the experiences of your first ACC Tournament; what
did you think about this thing?  
GABBY COOPER: It was fun. It was tough. It was challenging, but it was fun.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys made a great run last year in the NCAAs. Can you
use that to fuel the team like, hey, we can do this again and get back to
where we were last year, if not a step further?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, it's no question. I think that if you haven't been
there, you don't know what it's like to do it, and we understand what we've
got to do. You've got to get hot. You get hot for four or five games and you
never know what happens. That's what happened to us last year. We struggled
shooting the ball up until we got to this tournament, and we started making
shots, and we got on a run.  
  
Anything can happen, and we know that, and we're just ready to go out and
compete. That's why we do it. We're in the best conference in the country, and
it really prepares you for anything you're going to see in the NCAA
Tournament. We have every style of play in this conference, so it really does
prepare you for the NCAA Tournament, and we just want to go home and get some
rest and get off our feet and start prepping, and we'll find out who's going
to play and go and compete at a high level.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Breyana Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32688)

### [J'Kyra Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32689)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Virginia - 59  
  
JOANNE BOYLE: I was proud of my team for competing. We've got to learn some
lessons, obviously, in play like this and what's -- what really can kind of
have you misstep within the tournament. I thought we did some really good
things, but they're an unbelievable transition offensive team, and I thought
they gained a lot of momentum in that category.  
  
Q. This was a four-point game at halftime. What did you say in the
second half, and what happened?  
JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, this whole year we've had at times some missteps in that
third quarter where we get a little bit of a lull, and there was a time it was
tied 30-30 and they went on a six-point run and that's what they do. When we
played them at their place they went on an eight-point run, we cut it,
11-point run we cut it, and we were battling there, but once we get some
separation, they're at their best.  
  
Q. You guys obviously have had a wonderful season. Talk about playing in
the NCAA Tournament when it's announced a week and a half from now?  
JOANNE BOYLE: I think the ACC is one of the top conferences in the country,
and I feel like we have played everybody really tough. The only team we really
did not compete well against was Duke. Other than that, I feel like we've been
in every game, overtime with Louisville, Syracuse, beat Florida State late. We
start three freshmen. We're a young team. They're just getting their wheels
underneath them. I feel like we're playing some of our best basketball. We've
been in every game, including Notre Dame today for three quarters at their
place. I feel we're playing some really good basketball, and our freshmen are
just starting to find the lay of the land a little bit. I feel like we are a
contender, and I hope the committee will look at that.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to what you were just talking about, the youth of this
team, how did they throughout the season develop as well as you had hoped they
would?  
JOANNE BOYLE: I mean, I don't think -- all four of them came in with a mindset
of contributing, to whatever degree that they could. I don't think there were
any expectations. But I think the unique thing about this class is that they
love the game. They all are very different from each other, so they all had an
ability to contribute in different ways, and they all have contributed in
different ways. I think they had a group of upperclassmen that have allowed
them to grow within the season, and there is no animosity, there is no class
system here. You wouldn't know who the seniors and who the freshmen are, and
that's a credit to the upperclassmen to embrace them and say, it's not about
waiting your turn, it's about we want to win, put our team first, whoever can
contribute can, and I think the freshmen were very relaxed in being accepted
and not having to wait to bide their time, and they felt very needed in that
way.  
  
I think they've been going through their growing pains with me, and I think Fi
is playing some of her better basketball now. Lisa is just an all-out rebound
-- she brings something different to the table and you have two scorers and
two defenders, then you throw in all the other pieces we have in the
upperclassmen, I think it makes for -- we're a good team. We're a solid, good
team that I think has good basketball in front of us.  
  
Q. Breyana, you were able to get 13 points on them. Just talk about some
of the difficulties about playing guards that good.  
BREYANA MASON: I mean, they're kind of like a three-headed snake. Lindsay runs
the show. She has great court vision, great IQ, she really just runs their
team. With Arike and Mabrey, they can shoot the ball, they can drive it, as
well. It's kind of at times difficult to defend them because you want to guard
them for their shot, but they can also drive by you. Just we had some troubles
today kind of staying in front of them, sinking in on them a little bit too
much.  
  
Q. What's your regimen going to be over the next couple of weeks while
you wait?  
JOANNE BOYLE: It's spring break for Virginia next week, so we'll give some
time off, they'll be doing some things at home, bring them back, really work
on us for a couple of days, and just clean up some things and just get some
energy back in the gym, and then we'll sit down on Monday and watch the show,
and hopefully we're there. If anyone wants to make a call, go right ahead.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the third quarter missteps; what did you guys
see on the court?  
J'KYRA BROWN: I think for us, it was just staying in the game and the
intensity and the effort. We always stress like effort and getting defensive
stops and transition defense, where we kind of lacked tonight. But what kept
us in the game was just the mentality of not giving up. I mean, we played this
team already in the season. We've played the top seven teams in the country.
So just moving forward, we just know that we've already played those, so we
have to continue with our effort and our defensive capabilities.  
  
BREYANA MASON: I mean, yeah, we kind of either made a turnover or they were
able to get a rebound, get out in transition, and the thing about that is
because they were scoring so quickly, that was kind of what hurt us, and it
was a combination of 2s and 3s, and obviously when you have a lot of those
over a span of time, the lead can really spread out. But we'll clean that up
in these next couple of days that we have to practice, get focused. That's
something that we've struggled with all year, so we really have to make this a
priority going into this next phase of our season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 68, Clemson - 46  
  
JEFF WALZ: I'd first like to start off and thank Nora Lynn and the entire ACC
for what a wonderful job they've done in scrambling to get us at a fantastic
place, Coastal Carolina. It's a beautiful facility. I mean, it's been great.
The setup is fantastic. Our kids have enjoyed it. We've enjoyed it as coaches,
and to get it in to place and running like they did with such short notice
just speaks volumes for them, and I'd like to thank, as I said, the ACC, Nora
Lynn and Brad and everyone here at Coastal Carolina.  
  
To the game, you know, it was a game where we had talked about the urgency of
coming out quick, trying to really hit 'em hard right off the bat, and I
thought we did that. We were very aggressive on the defensive end of the
floor, the offensive end of the floor. We got the ball going in transition,
things that we have to do. If we want to be really effective, we've got to be
able to get the pace going at the speed that we want and I thought we did
there in the first quarter.  
  
And then I tried to -- with a 20-point lead there at the quarter, I tried to
put some subs out there to try to get some kids a break, because I didn't want
to have to play everybody, our five 38 minutes. I wasn't really pleased with
the way the first half ended, but I thought we came out in the second half,
the third quarter, and really played well. So I was real pleased with that.  
  
Q. It looked like y'all were just effortless out there.  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we played hard. But what we did was we passed the ball. I
thought might Myisha ran the floor extremely well. Kylee ran the floor. We
rebounded the ball, which was a point of emphasis because we really got hurt
bad at their place on the glass, and we came out, held them to one shot there
in the first quarter, then we were able to run. And that's something that
we've really been talking about, and we have to continue to do if we want to
advance in this tournament.  
  
Q. What was part of the strategy there because they had a game last
night, you wanted to get out quick on them to get them hustling?  
JEFF WALZ: No, that's something that we had talked about. We try to do this
with a lot of teams we play. We're going to try to get the tempo, see if we
can turn somebody over, get some easy baskets. You know, they're 18 to 22
years old, 23 years old. We play tomorrow at 11:00, I believe. I mean, if
we're tired, then I don't know what to tell you. I mean, God forbid.  
  
So I don't think they were tired. Your adrenaline kicks in. We're not going to
have that as an excuse tomorrow. I know they wouldn't use that as an excuse.
It has nothing to do with playing a game. Now when it comes to Sunday, I still
don't think it's a big deal.  
  
Q. Their three-point defense for you all was really good. The three-
point shooting may be something to improve on?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I don't know why you think that. I mean, that's kind of like
alternative facts, is it not? Three for 17, that's not bad, is it? It gave us
14 opportunities to get offensive rebounds. See, again, you take some things
and you churn them to however they fit you.  
  
Q. I'm going to take it to a player instead (laughter). You made those
three three-pointers. Was there any pressure on you to shoot off or
anything?  
ASIA DURR: There's no pressure. I would go off of what Coach just said. When I
didn't make those shots, we had our post players to clean up the glass.  
  
Q. Myisha, you were one of those post players that were doing a good
job. You've got this little move where you do a circle, it's like a Three
Stooges type of routine, and that's very effective for you. How did you come
up that?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: From everyone else boxing out. I just come and clean it
up. As you say, I just go all the way around. They don't really see me, I
guess, and then I just clean it up, but it starts with just boxing out.  
  
Q. Takeaways out of this one as you face a very strong North Carolina
State team tomorrow?  
JEFF WALZ: Very good NC State team. Wes does a fantastic job with that
ballclub. They've got some seniors that are playing with a lot of urgency.
It's going to be a very good basketball game. There's no doubt in my mind. You
know, our game at our place was a great game, and I expect the same thing
tomorrow. We're going to have to come prepared to play.  
  
Q. Jazmine Jones came in and gave you another great effort. Talk about
her and what kind of spark she gives you all.  
ASIA DURR: J. Jones, man. She's a great player. Coach stays on her a whole lot
because he knows what she can do. So she's just got to keep on building off of
this, as well, and just keep playing hard, keep playing strong, because she's
a great player.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Just go off of what Asia said. She gives a spark off the
bench. She's very athletic so she can get in there and get rebounds, and she's
so explosive, she can get a shot off or pass it over the top of a press.  
  
Q. Myisha, maybe brag a little bit on Asia. I know she had a fantastic
game today. She does a lot of things well, doesn't she?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: She does a lot of things well. No, but Asia, she's not
only a great basketball player, but she's a great person in general. She looks
out for her teammates on the court and off the court, as well. But it's hard
to find another Asia Durr. All the credit to Asia. She's keeping this team
together, and we need her to continue to play strong through the rest of this
tournament so we can hopefully win it.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a really strong game against North Carolina State last
time, really back and forth kind of contest. Things you need to do tomorrow to
beat them?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we're going to have to score more points. Okay, I didn't know
if you had that one down. That's our number one thing. We're going to have to
do a good job defensively of keeping them in front of us. Their guards are
excellent at attacking the rim, and then as soon as you have to help, they
kick for shooters. So we've got to be able to defend one-on-one and not let
them get by us so now all of a sudden help has to come.  
  
So that's going to be something that we'll talk about and hopefully get
improved.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

### [Nelly Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30373)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 68, Clemson - 46  
  
AUDRA SMITH: They have so many offensive weapons, and I see them going very
far not only in this tournament, in the ACC Tournament, but also deep into the
NCAA Tournament. But I'd also like to commend my team and how hard they played
on yesterday with not a lot of rest in terms of recovery time but coming out
and playing hard tonight. The issue was, of course, as you all know, we got
ourselves in a very, very deep hole in the first period there, but they still
continued to compete and continued to battle.  
  
Coming from last season and winning only four games and not winning a game in
the conference to finishing the season 15-16 and 3-13 in the ACC is tremendous
for this group. So this is the start of our road or our climb to success. You
know, we are still a very young team. We don't have a senior class. We'll have
a senior class next year, and I'm excited about that. I'm excited about the
fact that they weren't satisfied with today. It wasn't like, okay, the season
is over or whatever. No, they were upset. They wanted to be able to stay
another day and continue to play.  
  
So we have some work to do, and with the success that we were able to
accomplish this season, next season I plan on, and I know the team plans on
being in this conference room talking to you guys about a win versus a loss.  
  
Q. Coach, this was anybody's game for three quarters, just the quirk
where they kind of pulled away from you. What were they doing to be so success
will?  
AUDRA SMITH: They came out on fire. Asia Durr and Myisha Hines-Allen, we
already know, they are already on WNBA draft boards already. Those kids,
they're phenomenal players. So they came out, and they were on all cylinders,
and I think fresh legs was a big part of it, too. You know, I think for us we
had to kind of catch our breath and kind of catch up, and you know, they were
just -- they were scoring. I mean, they were doing a good job of executing
their offense and getting scores and we had some turnovers there where they
turned into transition points. A couple times we took a couple of quick shots
that we talked about not taking, and that led to transition buckets for them.  
  
So before we knew it, pop, pop, pop, we're in the hole by 20 points, just that
quick.  
  
But then we came out in that second period, and then we stepped it up
defensively. We held them to 10 points in the second period and won that one
-- we scored 14, and then came out at half, tied it up. But when you dig
yourself a hole like that, it's really, really hard to come back out of that
type of a deficit against a team such as Louisville.  
  
Q. Defensively you did a really good job stopping the three on them.
Unfortunately y'all's threes weren't quite there. Just talk a little bit about
the three-point game and how it affected you today.  
AUDRA SMITH: In terms of -- in terms of us and their three-point -- on both
ends? I think for us, it was pretty much legs. I think it was legs. Some of
our shots didn't fall because of fatigued legs. That's a lot. I mean, from
playing yesterday and how hard we had to play and we had kids that played a
lot of minutes, so I think it was legs. I think for them, what we did was we
made sure that we knew where Durr was at all times. She got some off that our
hands were right in her face. Our hand was right in her face on the ones that
she hit, and she was the only one that hit threes for them. She was 3 of 9. So
we made sure that we knew where she was. We made sure that Shook didn't get
anything open. We were very aware of Moore, didn't want her to get any open
looks.  
  
So we did a little junk, a little 1-3-1, but we mostly stayed in that 2-3 zone
to try to make sure that we took care of those three-point shots.  
  
Q. You were the leader scorer out there. Looks like you played your
heart out there for the whole game. Talk a little bit about the defense that
Louisville was throwing at you.  
NELLY PERRY: They're a good defensive team, very long and active. I was
getting shots that I wanted pretty much, they just wouldn't fall.  
  
Q. As you finish this season, some of the takeaways of this tournament
this season that gets you ready for next year, things you're going to work
on?  
AUDRA SMITH: We talked a little bit about that in the locker room, in terms of
-- just the things that we have to do in postseason and in the summer, and
coming into the start of next season. Just areas of our game individually that
each player has to work on, and then collectively as a team.  
  
You know, the process is hard. It's hard being a student-athlete. I mean, it's
tough. It is a long season. We've been working since -- these kids, Nelly has
been working since May. She stayed for the May semester and was working on her
own and then when we were able to start workouts with the kids, the two hours
of on-court instruction that we were allowed in the summer, we were working in
the summer, and then we start preseason practice with conditioning and things
of that nature, and then another two hours on the court. We are talking
September, October, and then October we start official practice. You know,
it's March. It's a long, long season, and we play a ton of games in November.  
  
So you know, we talked about that and the fact that our conditioning has to be
to the point where -- I can't substitute -- I shouldn't be substituting you if
you're tired. There's no such thing as fatigue. We have to get our bodies
conditioned. We have to get stronger. There's some things that our guards have
to work on in terms of ball handling. We've got to do a better job of taking
care of the basketball. Post play, we talk about post play and being better
defensively in the post and being able to hold our own and not allow the
opposition to get the position they want in the post and we've got to be more
effective around the basket ourselves. So we talked about a lot of specifics,
and there are things that we're going to get back in the lab and work on.
Obviously I've got to give these kids a break because they need a break and
they've got to get caught up on schoolwork because that's very important, but
there are some things that we have to work on but all very correctable.  
  
Q. If an NIT bid did come, would you all accept and would you go?  
AUDRA SMITH: Oh, my God, yes, is one coming?  
  
Q. I don't know, I figured with the record and everything, you might be
on the borderline for one?  
AUDRA SMITH: Can you put in a word for us?  
  
Q. I'd be more than happy to do what I can to get Nelly a couple more
games.  
NELLY PERRY: Thank you.  
  
AUDRA SMITH: We appreciate that.

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Miami - 87, Georgia Tech - 71  
  
KATIE MEIER: We're just shocked up here. We just saw our shooting percentage.
For real, the fourth quarter, I think it was these two.  
  
But heck of a battle. Something we were very prepared for. We played them at
home, obviously, and it's tough. It's tough to beat a team like that twice in
a row. We had a couple of really tough days where I went at my team really
hard because we didn't play with the toughness that we needed to play with the
first time we played them, and they bring it out in you. They bring that out
and we'll need it and we'll need it for the postseason. So the response, to
keep your composure and to hit shots when you're battling so hard and playing
so hard and then to just come and have that calm mind and then hit a big time
shot, that was huge for us. I think we looked pretty good.  
  
Obviously that third quarter, there's a little bit of management going on
there, but it was also Georgia Tech changed their philosophy and started going
downhill and really got to the free-throw line and made the game a lot longer
and a lot scarier than it needed to be.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to what you just said, going back to Sunday, similar
quick start. Actually they had the lead at the end of the third quarter. What
were you able to do specifically today that stemmed the tide and not allow
them to get back into the game?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, you have a choice as a coach, and I just chose to trust my
team. Sometimes a quick time-out sort of reminds your team that you don't
trust them, and we're going to need to be able to play through some runs when
we play great teams. And this is probably as veteran as a team as I've had,
and they're smart, they're very smart. I don't know that I could have told
them a lot different. But we got really, really quiet, and that was our
problem. We stopped communicating and stopped talking and when they talk --
Neydja  
  
at halftime stayed in the locker room with me and went through another play
and a match-up because she's so smart and she said, well, this happened after
that and that and that. She's three plays ahead of me. So they're really good
at adjusting. So we just need to talk because we talk, because if we talk it
kind of relieves our stress and gets us through our adjustments.  
  
Q. Do you know if you've ever shot 64 percent in a game?  
KATIE MEIER: I know I personally never did. Oh, you mean my teams? Okay. I'm
not sure. If we did, it was probably a situation where we were like winning by
a lot and pressing a team and getting lay-ups. I don't think we've shot 64
percent with a shot chart that was presented tonight.  
  
We're tough to solve. If we're going to do the inside out combination and we
got Motley riding Motley in the first half and you go second half and you ride
these two. We just had to go a little bit deeper, but it's fun. I mean, and
I'll tell you, I've said this 100 times, so Key heard it before, but when Key
Hayes plays like that, I have a blast as a coach because she's such a great
match-up. She's so easy to call for. She can do so many different things, and
so it gives you a lot of freedom, plus she's so trustworthy with the ball. I'm
talking like you're not sitting right here. Key, when you play like that,
we're going to win a lot of games.  
  
I also wanted to open up, and I just got a little excited, congrats to the ACC
and the town of Conway and Myrtle Beach. This has been phenomenal. I'm just
really, really impressed and I'm happy for the conference and happy for this
community, thanks for wanting us. We love it here. And I'm really impressed,
so I just wanted to make sure I said that. Thanks.  
  
Q. Did you know you had eight players that scored seven or more points?
Has that ever happened do you think?  
KATIE MEIER: No, I'm pretty sure that hasn't happened, and somebody like Sarah
Mortensen is probably looking at me like, well, coach you saw me in the first
half, right? But you know, she did a great job in the first -- she was our
second leading scorer going into halftime. I liked the versatility of our
team, but when we're dialed in, and that's what I said, we were dialed in and
then we dialed it back a little bit on the FM radio station there and we had
to get them back where we were on the same reservation. We got off the
reservation a little bit and we came back and we really, really focused.  
  
Q. So a third straight matchup this season with Florida State, had three
with them last year. What do you have to do to beat them here in the ACC
Tournament?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, I'll tell you what, they're phenomenal and we know it. It's
a very, very healthy rivalry. There's a ton of respect. We really love their
talent. I know they really love our talent. Coaching staffs are really close.
We sit next to each other all summer long because we recruit the same kids. We
know what we've got. We don't have to go blow the dust off some scouting
report because we didn't play them. We know them and they know us. I like the
way we're playing right now, and I'm sure Sue loves the way her team is
playing, but I'm sure this will be one of the better matchups tomorrow for
sure.  
  
Q. Key, you guys forced nine turnovers, I think, in the first 14
minutes. Were you pressing more to slow them down and they were just turning
it over, or were you trying to turn them over with the press? And when you get
those turnovers do you feel more in a rhythm offensively because you shot 8
for 11 today?  
KEYONA HAYES: Us pressing is to turn people over and to slow them down, so it
just depends. It's always a plus for them to turn it over, but we press to
slow them down.  
  
Q. How long does Coach Meier allow you to enjoy this before it's back to
work?  
EMESE HOF: I think we all know it's back to work pretty soon. We had to win
this game. You have to keep winning in March. So it's a quick turnaround, and
it's good that we already know who we're playing and what they've got in store
for us. We'll be ready.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: To piggy back off what she said, yeah, we're going to enjoy it
for tonight, and we also have to focus on Florida State tonight, as well. Like
Coach said, we do know their scout, they know us, so it's going to be a
ballgame tomorrow. Whoever plays better.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Katarina Vuckovic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32654)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Miami - 87, Georgia Tech - 71  
  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: I thought we played in spurts. I think one of the things with
a young team is the inconsistency, and tonight was no different. Their seniors
and their upperclassmen obviously stepped up and had tremendous games, and
that's been something that has been Achilles heel for us all year is having
consistency with such a young team. But I give Miami a lot of credit. Again,
I've never seen somebody shoot 90 percent in a quarter. That's a first for me.
And shooting 65 percent from the field is -- that's huge for them. I think
they're going to be a tough team to beat in this tournament.  
  
Q. What were you able to do offensively in the second half that you
weren't able to do in the first?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I felt like we just slowed down and we were able to
execute. We changed our press offense. We were able to get easier looks at the
basket, and I thought Kaylan Pugh started being really aggressive attacking
the rim, and that made a big difference for us.  
  
Q. What's the future of the NIT, NCAA, what are you looking at right
now?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think right now that we're going to be in the NIT. I
think we had to win today and play really well in this tournament to get in
the NCAA Tournament. We have a high strength of schedule, high RPI, but we
just didn't come up with the wins. We had four overtime wins. We lost seven
games, less than nine points, I think, combined. So we had some tough, tough
games throughout the course of the season.  
  
But the thing I'm excited about is we return 11 of our 13 players, so we have
tremendous depth coming back, and those players got a lot of quality minutes.
Francesca Pan being named the ACC freshman of the year, obviously we're going
to rely on her heavily. She struggled today, but her and Kaylan Pugh coming
back are going to be two of the better guards in the ACC. Zaire O'Neil is one
of the dominant post players in the league. Elo Edeferioka continues to get
better and Imani Tilford will be our starting point guard for four years
coming back.  
  
Obviously Chanin Scott shows a lot of bright spots for us. She did some things
this tournament that were really -- gave us something to look forward to.
Obviously the future is very bright.  
  
Q. What is going to be your regimen then for the next couple of weeks as
you prepare for postseason?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, first of all, we'll take some time off just to recover,
get focused on our academics. We've got some things we need to take care of in
the classroom first and foremost and take care of some nagging injuries we've
been dealing with all season. We didn't have a bye week this year. Our bye
week in ACC play was the very first week before the season started. That's
been really tough at an academic school to go through this kind of ACC
schedule with no bye week. So the schedule really wasn't in our favor to start
the season. We had really tough games. We played three of the top four teams
in the last the first four games, and we never got a bye week, so we're going
to take some time off, regroup, and we'll come back and we'll practice and
continue to work on the things that we've been working on and get ready for
the NIT.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

### [Elisa Penna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32646)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 61, Wake Forest - 44.  
  
JEN HOOVER: We're excited about the ACC Tournament. It's something we all look
forward to all year, and a few things didn't go our way early and I thought
Virginia really capitalized on that. Give credit to them, they're really
playing well, and I think they have a lot of confidence in their defense, and
I think that affected us early. We didn't get some easy shots, didn't have
some easy shots fall that we needed to.  
  
Q. Coach, y'all basically played them even for three quarters, it was
just the first quarter where their defense got to you a little bit. What were
they doing to you?  
JEN HOOVER: Well, I just think that was an emphasis coming in. I know it was
for our staff and I know it was for their staff, as well, that the rebounding
could be the difference in the game. When your shots aren't falling, you have
to find ways to get extra possessions, and the easiest way is O-board put-
backs, and it's something that we've kind of made a living on. When you only
score six points on 18 offensive rebounds, that's a tough night for you on the
boards.  
  
Q. Obviously very poor shooting night; was it their defense? Was it one
of those nights? Was it the arena?  
JEN HOOVER: Well, we love Greensboro, so -- you know, I don't know. You have
to give credit to their defense. According to numbers, it's one of the top in
the country, and it's like No. 1 in the country on three-point field goal
percentage. I think if you've got open looks, you've got to knock those open
looks down. They switched things up defensively. Give them a lot of credit for
that. They try to keep you off balance so you don't really know what they're
running. But I thought we got some easy shots that you've got to be able to
make. We did a great job penetrating and getting lay-ups and we didn't finish
them at first. They've got some length so I think that's one of the things
that make their defense so strong, but we're a better shooting team than what
we showed today and what we've showed in our last few games, so we've got to
figure that out as a team and as individuals, and just get back to shooting
the basketball with confidence.  
  
Q. Elisa, you ended up scoring 12 points to lead the team in scoring.
Second half was a little bit better for you. What were you seeing in the
second half that was helping you get in there and score a little more?  
ELISA PENNA: What I think is thanks to my teammates because they found me when
I was open, and so that's why I had the possibility to score tough points.  
  
Q. Is this a team that has a chance to go and actually play in the NIT
do you think?  
JEN HOOVER: You know, we hope so. I had to walk in the locker room and tell
them that that could have been our last game. I would think Virginia is in the
NCAA Tournament. They should be at this point. We would get the automatic
qualifier my understanding is the ninth seed and ninth finisher in the
conference. This team wants to play more. We don't ever -- you don't ever want
to be a team that ends your season on kind of a sour note. These kids have put
way too much heart and soul and work into it, and I know they deserve that
chance, so we sure hope we get that chance. We'll start practicing again on
Wednesday and probably do two-a-days just to get us back from a little bit of
a break. It's our spring break this coming week, so let them get a little bit
of a break away and then get refocused and come back together and hope for the
best and try to play as long as we can. We're not ready to say goodbye to our
seniors. They've meant way too much to us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Alexis Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28304)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 83, UNC - 64  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, obviously here in the tournament, survive and advance,
and that's what we wanted to do. We went in and played well and survive and
advance and win the game. I thought the kids really played tough. This was a
game that we knew we had to be tough to win the game, and we had to rebound
the ball. I thought offensive rebounding was so huge for us tonight. We really
did a good job of crashing the boards and getting opportunities, second-chance
opportunities, and we were just really aggressive. We wanted to attack them
downhill, play in the paint, and keep our pressure up, and I thought we did a
great job tonight.  
  
Q. This was just a fantastic first 10 minutes in, but the fourth quarter
kind of a slow down. Was that just by design or you all had a lead and were
just trying to protect it?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: That's it, yeah. We were just trying to run sets. We played
a session game. We looked at the clock and know there's not enough possessions
for us to lose unless we give up threes and turn the ball over and start
fouling them. So yeah, that's exactly what we did. We just shortened the game
because we knew the game was over.  
  
Q. Comment if you would about Jamie Cherry, just an excellent ball
player for North Carolina.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: She's amazing. She's a very good, good point guard, and
obviously I know what having a great point guard is like, because I have one.
Any time you have a good point guard you have a chance to win, and she's a
dynamic player. I think once they get healthy and get their guards back
they're a very good basketball team.  
  
and she's tough. Like I said, I have the luxury of having a great point guard
because I have the best one right here.  
  
Q. Alexis, are there some nights -- you were electric particularly in
the first half. Are there some nights when you get out there that you can just
feel it and you know that you're on?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think the way we came out, my teammates making shots, we
were getting turnovers, we were getting easy baskets, I was able to feed off
their energy and just the way they came out to play, it really sparked me and
made me want to contribute and do my part.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about the tournament experience for you now and also
with that Player of the Year award.  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, the tournament experience, this is obviously my last
one, so I just want to enjoy it. I want to stay in the moment. We have a great
team, and I'm extremely blessed to be this year's Player of the Year. It means
a lot to me, to my team, coaches, everyone that's helped me get to this point
in my career.  
  
Q. Is there any way you could be maybe less demonstrative on the
sidelines?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Probably not. I don't know. You know, it's funny because we
talk about bringing energy and playing hard, and I just want our kids to
compete and be successful, and I just know that I've got to be there with
them. Like I said, some games I feel like I played. But it is what it is.
We're successful and our kids are playing hard, and that's all I want.  
  
Q. You've got Duke coming up. When you played them at Cameron, you shot
25 percent in that particular game. Anything without giving away the store
that you might do differently, or are you just going to go out and play your
game?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: No, we've got to play our game. We just missed shots in that
game. We got some good looks and we missed shots. But Duke played a really
good game. They came out, they attacked us in transition, and when you don't
score, you can't press, and that was big for us because we didn't make enough
shots. We couldn't get into our pressure.  
  
Hopefully we can get some shots to go in early and be able to press them.  
  
Q. Alexis, this is maybe one of the games where you're going to have
four of the top guards in the ACC going up against one another. There's been a
lot of talk between you and Duke about who has the best two guards. Your
thoughts on that?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: We just try not to feed into that. We just want to come out
and play hard like we've been doing all season. Brit and I, we're competitors
so we're going to compete and we're going to raise up to the challenge. Our
team is going to back us up, and we're just going to play Syracuse basketball.  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, I don't -- I mean, it's the same. We're just going to
go out and play. They have two dynamic guards. I think it's going to be a very
good game to have, like you said, four of the best guards in the country
playing in the game. You know, so we've just got to go out and do the things
that we do well, and it's going to be a great game. We look forward to the
challenge. That's why we're here, and that's why we come out and play is to
play the best, and tomorrow night we're going to play one of the best in the
country.

_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 83, UNC - 64.  
  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I was really proud of these kids, our whole team for battling
and fighting hard through a lot of adversity with injured players and being
very, very young out there. You know, of course with one junior, one sophomore
and the rest of them are all freshmen, but the biggest difference was in the
game was the second-chance points. Actually our field goal percentage was
actually better than theirs, but it was just the rebounding and second-chance
points that was the difference in the game.  
  
But I'm proud of our kids, and we're going to work hard in the off-season. We
lose no one, and we get some of these hurt and injured players back, and we've
got a really good group coming in, class coming in next year, and so we're
looking forward to working hard and getting back to being a great team next
year.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the contributions that the freshmen have
made to your team, not just to night but over the entirety of the season?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I'm sure the roles they've had to play is very
different than what they expected. It's different than what I expected, too.
But they've been thrown in the fire, especially like Taylor and I'm sure that
Olivia never expected the situation that she was in. And then with Li-Li and
Emily, all of them, they've had to play a lot of minutes, and they've been in
the heat of the battle against some of the top-ranked teams in the country.
But this can do nothing but help them. In the off-season they'll get stronger,
get more physical, and they're young. I mean, and you look at the top teams in
our league, they're very heavy with seniors, and we have none, and one junior.  
  
So you know, the future is really great, especially as we get some players
back healthy.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that question, with the injuries and the extreme
youth, have you had to change very much your coaching style during the course
of the season?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Mm-hmm. If you noticed, we basically have had the philosophy
lay-up or setup where we've always been a real up-tempo, fast-breaking team.
So we've really tried to either -- if we had something off transition, but if
not, we've tried to make the other team, we've tried to make their defense
work and move the ball around a lot, and then also run some things --
especially those last several weeks for these two to get shots. They've taken
most of our shots. Taylor has taken some. But we've really tried to, again --
I don't really want to say use the clock, but more, like I said, make the
other team's defense, we're looking for them to have some mismatches or
mistakes, and then we had things set, like I said, for mostly for these two to
get most of the shots.  
  
Basically it's worked pretty good, especially in the half court, because
again, our shooting percentage was good. It's just I thought we got a little
tired. But the rebounding was the biggest thing there. You know, so -- but
considering our situation, I thought we've done a pretty good job really.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got two great players next to you, but I couldn't help
but be impressed by Olivia Smith playing really the entire game and guarding
the Player of the Year. I think Peterson had 20 or more points in the first
half, and I think she was fairly neutralized, so to speak, in the second half.
My question is what was your thought process in doing that?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, we didn't have anybody else to put on her (laughter).  
  
No, Olivia is a great kid, and at halftime, I think Peterson had 20, and I
challenged her to come out there and play good defense on her in the second
half, which -- she's going to give you all she's got. She's going to stay on
her. She was on her a lot.  
  
And then Taylor was on 20, Sykes. She was on 20. And so those were the two
players that we were trying to focus on the most.  
  
But Olivia, she gets down and she's going to guard you and hustle. She's
always going to hustle 100 percent the whole time.  
  
But she did a great job, and that's what we ask her to do.  
  
Q. Jamie, you had two huge nights here in the tournament, but you did go
down and were on the floor for a little while. Are you okay? What happened
there?  
JAMIE CHERRY: I got undercut. I mean, I went back to the back and my trainer
told me I had seven minutes so I basically just sucked it up even though I was
in pain. My team needs me. It's kind of been that type of season. We're just
trying to get back out there and fight to the end. It was very important to
me.  
  
Q. Jamie, could you talk about how this freshman class compares to other
ones that you've seen at your time at UNC?  
JAMIE CHERRY: I mean, I've seen two freshmen classes do some stuff, which they
kind of play similar roles, both freshmen classes, because Steph and Des, they
didn't know they were coming into the roles they had their freshman year
having to play a lot of minutes and having to grow quickly, and I think that's
kind of been the season for the freshmen this year having to grow quickly. And
I think they took on the challenge and they've done fairly well over the
course of the season stepping in and playing minutes and doing what they had
to do in order for us to win.  
  
Q. Paris, talk a little bit about what it's like to play with Jamie
Cherry on your team.  
PARIS KEA: Oh, it's amazing, great distributor, and definitely when I drive
and kick to her, she helps me stack up on the assists. It's great. Takes a lot
of pressure off of me.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were in the Elite 8 not that long ago, and now where
you guys are at now, but looking forward to next year and what you will
become, how do you contextualize this moment for UNC basketball, where you've
been, where you are now and where you could be?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I think the future is exciting, especially because
Jamie will be our only senior next year, and then our juniors, of course, will
be Paris, and then we will have Stephanie and Destinee back, which they were
both McDonald's All-Americans. As the year has gone by, first of all, when
Hillary Fuller went out, we had to adjust to her being out, and all we had was
the freshmen. And then just as soon as we started adjusting to that a little
bit, then Destinee goes out. Well, then we had to adjust to that. And then
another week or 10 days later, then Stephanie goes out.  
  
So it's been hard for us to get some kind of consistency with who's going to
be -- who can do what out there, and like I said, the young ones, we were
starting three freshmen in most -- and they were playing like 40 minutes.  
  
But again, with all these kids back and then with who we've got coming in,
we've got a McDonald's All-American 6'4" center coming in that's really going
to help us a lot. And then we've got a 6'2" kid that was South Carolina Player
of the Year that's coming in. And then the kid on YouTube, the three-point
shooter, Leah Church, which she was here tonight. So we've got some really
good kids coming in, and then with the other ones that will hopefully -- and
Jocelyn, Jocelyn Jones, I forgot about J.J. So that's another one. So we'll
have -- you know, with the ones that were hurt and the new ones coming in,
we're going to have six or seven really good players to add to all the rest of
them that are back. So that's exciting.  
  
But again, we've got to get some -- they've got to heal up. We've got some
procedures, one is having one Saturday and another one in a couple of weeks,
so they've got to have some procedures to help them get well in all that time.  
  
But again, yes, last year was a little bit down year because of those kids
that left, you know, because two years ago we -- I guess, what, Sweet 16 and
finished top ten in the country there two years in a row, and then the kids
that left because they thought the NCAA thing, which, again, I mean, I really
can't make any statement about that. But it is what it is.  
  
But yet I think our future is really, really bright because of who all we got
coming back and the leadership that we'll have, especially from these two.  
  
Q. How hard is it when you know that this could be the last game of your
season and you're down late? How hard is it for the players to make sure that
you're still giving it all you can and trying to those last few minutes give
everything that you have?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I didn't have any question that they would do that. In fact,
that Jamie was able to come back, and I'm sure she's going to -- her back,
because she got undercut pretty hard there. But the fact that Jamie came back
out there, I mean, she's just so physically tough. Both of them are. They're
just physically tough, and they love to compete and love to play.  
  
I was really surprised that she was able to do that.  
  
But knowing Jamie, I'm not surprised.  
  
JAMIE CHERRY: I don't know. Coach said it great. But of course we're going to
come out and compete hard. Honestly we weren't even thinking that this was our
last game. Every minute that we play we think we're going to come back, and we
compete hard every play. That's been the motive for especially me and Paris
and the rest of the team the whole season. So yeah.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Jocelyn Willoughby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32640)

### [Felicia Aiyeotan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32641)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 61, Wake Forest - 44  
  
JOANNE BOYLE: Just excited. You know, it's March basketball tournament time.
Some of the best basketball is being played right now, and just happy that our
team has just been preparing for this moment, and it was just a great game.
Jen has done an unbelievable job coaching her team. They've had some real good
success this year. It was a battle, but really, really pleased with how we
played tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you all got off to a great start on this one. What were you
seeing in them that allowed you all to get the points on them that you did?  
JOANNE BOYLE: Really the focus was not on our offense. It was really on our
defense. We said in tournament times, teams that are playing great defense and
rebounding the basketball and taking care of it are having opportunities. And
a lot of the offense we got was created because of our really good defense and
our rebounding tonight. So that's been the focus really all season, in
particular over the last week.  
  
Q. Jocelyn, you were one of four in double figures. You were shooting
the ball really, really good, especially in the second half. What kind of
looks were you seeing that were allowing you to do that?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: I just knew that we had to be aggressive. I think it says
a lot about our team for the fact that four different players were in double
figures, but just trying to take what the defense gave me. If there was a
mismatch that I felt that I could take my defender, then trying to do that, or
kick it out for another shot. I thought we passed the ball really well, and
that's what allowed a lot of us to get our shots.  
  
Q. Joanne, question for you: What were the biggest positives that you
took out of this game today?  
JOANNE BOYLE: The resiliency. We talked about being bold today, being the
grittier team. A lot of times in tournament time, it's not pretty basketball.
It doesn't look that way. So being gritty and just -- the girls just really
buying into our message.  
  
But we've been a pretty good defensive team all year, and it's going to carry
us forward. So just really proud of how they really dialed into the message
that was delivered this week, and all credit goes to them because they
executed it.  
  
Q. Felicia, you had 10 points tonight and 21 minutes there. You were
getting the ball, some pretty nice looks to your teammates. Was this one of
your better games of the season, do you think?  
FELICIA AIYEOTAN: Yeah, but there are many more to come, but I felt like today
was a much better game.  
  
Q. Going forward, when you all go to the next round, what are some of
the things that you're going to need to pick up on and improve on in order to
advance again?  
JOANNE BOYLE: You know, Notre Dame is a great team. They've been here, you
know, so I'm preaching to my team, the pressure is on them. We went up there
to South Bend earlier in the year. We played them tough. But again, it's just
-- you get a game underneath your belt, which we did, so hopefully we're a
little bit looser, but the message doesn't change. What we did today and the
effort that we did today on the defensive end, the rebounding, we took care of
the ball, that is going to be the message going forward. We're going to keep
it very simple.

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

### [Nelly Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30373)

### [Danielle Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32619)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 67, Virginia Tech - 66  
  
AUDRA SMITH: Well, first I'd like to open by saying -- giving a lot of credit
to Virginia Tech. They're an outstanding basketball team. They're a very
difficult team to defend because they shoot the three ball so very, very well.
But I'm very, very proud of my team today and how hard they played and how
they fought through on the scouting report, and how they did a really good job
of limiting their three-point shot opportunities. They did a much better job
in the second quarter and then throughout the rest of the game.  
  
Our goal was to force them off the three-point line and make them become
penetrators, and we knew that we could stay with them if we made them shoot
twos rather than threes. So I'm really proud of how hard they played and how
they never gave up. We got down 10 early. They got a little tense, got little
tight, told them to relax. And then we came out after halftime and then we got
up by as many as eight, and of course as I tell them all the time the game is
in runs, and Virginia Tech is a great team, and they weren't going to fold.  
  
And so they came back, battled back. Before we knew it, the game was tied. We
went back and forth for a while. But just extremely proud of these young
ladies and how hard they fought, they how they played and how well they played
together and how they really had each other's back tonight.  
  
Q. Danielle, what's going through your mind, 3.4 seconds left on the
clock, you're at the line with a chance to win?  
DANIELLE EDWARDS: Oh, gosh. I wasn't really trying to think. I was just trying
to relax. My teammates were telling me to relax. I shot the first one kind of
quick and that one kind of went in and out. I turned and I looked at Nelly and
they were telling me just relax, like she's smiling and telling me to relax
and knock this one down. My teammates were really just telling me you've got
this, we just need one and then we'll get a stop and then the game will be
over. Really I was trying not to think, but they were keeping me really calm.  
  
Q. Danielle, your drive to the basket before getting fouled there, what
was kind of going through your mind at that point? Were you thinking, let me
make contact or what was the plan there to hopefully make the winning shot
there?  
DANIELLE EDWARDS: Previously I was able to get to the basket pretty easily, so
I was thinking, why settle for a jump shot when I was able to get to the
basket. I kind of just went in and -- I mean, whether they called a foul or
not, the worst that could happen was we go into overtime. I tried to get the
contact, and luckily I got it, and then I went to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a tremendous advantage in rebounding. Just talk about
some of the things that had you get that success in rebounding over them.  
AUDRA SMITH: Well, when you have players like Kobi Thornton and Aliyah Collier
who just go to the boards with reckless abandon and just get after it. They
want it so they go get it. So they did a tremendous job in terms of attacking
the offensive glass. And then also Jaia Alexander is another big guard that
came up with two crucial offensive rebounds, Nelly had two, and then Danny was
sneaky there on that free-throw line and was able to come up with a couple
herself. They did a really good job.  
  
It's all about -- rebounding is all about want-to. Defense, it's all about
want-to, and that's what I talk to them about on a daily basis. It's about
want-to, and it's about just going and getting the ball because you want it.  
  
So I'm really proud of the way they went after it, attacked the glass. Kobi
Thornton was phenomenal in terms of catching, getting those offensive
rebounds, sticking them back and getting us some three-point plays.  
  
Q. Danielle and Nelly, you'll have a few minutes to celebrate this, then
it's Louisville tomorrow. What are your thoughts about playing the
Cardinals?  
NELLY PERRY: Well, we're just excited to be in this position. We take every
game the same. Play hard, you can control your effort. That's the only thing.
We'll play hard, have good effort, and good results. Hopefully it'll show.  
  
Q. You fell behind 10 points early in the game. What helped you guys
climb back in the second quarter? And then when you were up 8 in the fourth
quarter, what helped them climb back in the game late?  
AUDRA SMITH: They relaxed. They came out -- from the beginning I could tell
they were a little tight, and then when we started to relax and when we
started to attack the basket, that allowed us to get back into the game.
Cardaci's big three at the end of the half really catapulted us and gave us a
huge confidence boost, so we came out in the second half. We didn't score on
that first possession, but we gained control by attacking the basket. We have
a little play that we run, and it's our little staple play, we call it
continuous, and we run it and we run it until we get what we want out of it,
and they did a great job of that, and that was what enabled us to get that
eight-point lead in terms of executing our offense, and then getting stops on
the opposite end. And then, of course, like I said about Virginia Tech being a
really good team, they weren't going to fold and they came back. We had a
couple of turnovers here and there and they kind of picked their spots and
they kind of made a run, and then I told the team, relax, this is what the
game is about, guys, the game is in runs. We're fine. They came back, and then
we were able to survive today.  
  
Q. Danielle, you've probably played Notre Dame closer than anyone this
year. What do you take out of a game like this getting ready to play
Louisville?  
DANIELLE EDWARDS: You can take the things we did well out of that game, which
we defended. Louisville is a really good offensive team, and in order to stay
in that game, you're going to have to defend them. So we can take definitely
our defense from them, and our competitive spirit that we have that we didn't
give up. They were No. 1 at the time in the conference when we were playing
them, and we were able to hang in with them, and that kind of shows that as
long as we're giving effort and we're playing hard that we can play with
anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, you had 16 turnovers and they had 20 points off those
turnovers to your three, something to be looking at for tomorrow I'm
assuming?  
AUDRA SMITH: Definitely, and I think about where most of our turnovers came
from. I think Thornton may have had three because she shuffled her feet. I
think Danny had a couple because she shuffled her feet. That's where our
turnovers came from. So those were just correctable errors that we can
correct. And we know we're going to turn it over. And then, too, when we turn
it over, we have to do a better job on the defensive end of not allowing them
to capitalize on that. I tell them all the time, we can't afford to give the
opposition extra possessions, and we have to do a better job of taking care of
the basketball.  
  
So the turnovers that we had were unforced turnovers. They were turnovers that
we created ourselves. So those are correctable. So I'm not really concerned
about that. I think we'll be much more sharper tomorrow. People always ask,
hey, is it good to play on that first day or is it good to play on that second
day. I always think it's good to play on that first day. You don't want to be
that bottom seed, but it's good to play on that first day because you get all
the jitters out, you know, and I think that will be the key for us tomorrow.
We won't have any jitters. We know what the floor feels like. We know how the
rims are. We know if the nets will be loose, we know the officiating, how the
officiating is going to go. They'll be much better tomorrow, and I feel like
we will take much better care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Their starters have played a lot of minutes on Sunday at Boston
College. Did you go into the game thinking I'm going to have the fresher team
and let's do some things to take advantage of that maybe?  
AUDRA SMITH: Oh, definitely. That's why -- I think they were surprised we were
off the entire weekend. We played Georgia Tech that Thursday and then were off
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and then we came in and we practiced on Monday,
and then we practiced yesterday, and they were exhausted. We had a four-hour
drive from Clemson down here, and on the bus and off the bus to eat and on the
-- off the bus to practice and back on the bus to practice again. They were a
little tired from that. But I felt like we would have fresher legs because we
had that bye, and we didn't play on that Sunday. And of course I watched that
Boston College game, and that was a really, really good game, and they played
a lot of minutes. So I knew that it was going to come down to that he was only
playing a limited number of players. I knew that fatigue might be a little bit
of a factor, and I also knew that the most important thing was that we had to
attack. Like we had to be in attack mode on the offensive end every single
time and make them defend us.  
  
Q. What was your defensive approach, especially when they made all those
threes on Sunday at Boston College?  
AUDRA SMITH: To run them off the three-point line, and that's why I was a
little teed up with them because we allowed them to get a couple of wide-open
threes to start the game, and I'm like, guys, we watched them on film, we
watched the BC game, we watched ourselves against them the last time we played
them. We know what they're doing. They run a dribble drive offense, they're
looking to penetrate and kick out and find open shooters, they want to suck in
and kick it out to open shooters and you gotta get out and guard kids like Sam
Hill because she shoots it deep. You've got to guard a Regan Magarity because
she shoots it very, very well, you can't have your hands down. So our plan was
to make sure that if they got threes off they were contested. We did a much
better job after they got loose and got a couple of open threes. We did a much
better job of contesting those three-point shots.  
  
Q. Chanette Hicks is probably one of the most impressive young guards in
this league. She made a run at y'all at the end. What were you trying to do to
stop her if you could?  
AUDRA SMITH: We were just trying to keep her in front, and that was the key. I
thought about saying, okay, deny her the ball and let someone else bring it
up, but then I thought, no, don't do that because Sam Hill brings it up and
she pulls a three and I'm like, no, no, no. So if we can just keep Hicks in
front of us, just keep her in front of us, but she is phenomenal. She's fast.
She shot out of that thing like a cannon going, going, going, going, and we
did a phenomenal job of keeping her in front, not fouling, moving our feet,
making her have to turn and then time expired before she was able to get a
shot off.  
  
Q. Nelly didn't play last month, January when you last played them and
lost in the regular season. How much of a difference did that make having her
today?  
AUDRA SMITH: Oh, it was huge. Nelly is a huge part of our team. You know, not
having her -- I think the one thing about it is not so much as the offensive
part, but with Nelly being on the floor, the rest of the team is more relaxed.
It's like that big sister. You know, you've got that big sister out there and
you can look over at her, you know she's coming in the game and when she's in
the game everything is going to be okay. So I think she gives the rest of the
team a sense of calmness and a sense of we're going to be all right. So having
her tonight, and of course she played phenomenally in terms of her scoring and
her rebounding and only turned the ball over two times. So that was a huge
plus to have her offense. Because there were games in our non-conference and
even in conference where Nelly didn't score a lot of points but just her
presence on the floor, you've got to be aware of where she is, and what that
does is it opens up scoring opportunities for other people. And then there are
times where she's got to take over, and she knows, we tell her all the time, I
don't think she shoots enough. She had 19 shots tonight. That's good, but she
can take a couple more.  
  
But Nelly is a -- she's a very unselfish player. She wants her teammates
involved, and sometimes she defers more than I want her to. But having her on
the floor is a huge key for us, is a huge key.  
  
Q. Nelly, what helped you guys on the glass today?  
NELLY PERRY: Just boxing out and just going to it pretty much. That's all I
can think of. Just being aggressive.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Suzie McConnell-
Serio](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26441)

### [Brenna Wise](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30370)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina 72 - Pittsburgh - 60  
  
SUZIE McCONNELL-SERIO: It was an up-tempo game, but we went cold in the second
half. I mean, it was -- the difference in the game was Jamie Cherry. She took
over the game. We threw hedges coming off those on-ball screens. We sometimes
switched. We went zone, and she just found a way to pick us apart. She was a
player on a mission today, and really proved what a great point guard she has
been and really stepped up her game in the absence of Destini Walker and
Stephanie Watts and Fuller. When those three went down, she really stepped up
her game, and she carried this team today for sure.  
  
Disappointed that we didn't continue what we started in the first half. They
didn't do anything that we weren't expecting, we just didn't hit shots, and
it's just a disappointing end.  
  
Q. Coach, just a wide discrepancy in free throws here or is it just the
aggressive style that y'all were playing?  
SUZIE McCONNELL-SERIO: I'm gonna address that in the locker room. They only
played six players typically in the last couple games, and we knew they did
not want to get in foul trouble, and we talked about being aggressive
attacking. We did that early on in the first half. We continued to go inside.
We were aggressive, got away from it, and we started settling for jumpers.
It's just the way the game had gone. We would have liked to have gotten to the
free-throw line a little bit more, but unfortunately we weren't going inside
as much in the second half.  
  
Q. When you find a team like that that's got two players like that, is
there any urgency to make sure that you get them in foul trouble or try to
keep the ball from them or just foul them, maybe just to get yourself back in
the game?  
SUZIE McCONNELL-SERIO: Well, we knew coming in that they had changed their
primary offense, went to more on-ball screens with Jamie Cherry and Paris Kea,
just how we were defending them, and throughout the course of the game when
they would run offense, we knew if the ball got back in their hands that they
were going to them with under 10 seconds. We tried to deny them, stay home,
and we lost her a few times, helping and rotating. They made plays. When they
penetrated, we helped, they kicked out, we rotated, we didn't recover, and a
lot of times the ball ended up back in Jamie Cherry's hands. We tried to
disrupt what they were doing. I don't want to say fatigue became a factor at
this time of the year, but Kauai Bradley was playing a lot of minutes, and she
was working to guard Kea throughout the course of the game.  
  
But I don't have any excuses. We just didn't get the job done. We didn't fight
hard enough defensively and get stops when we needed to.  
  
Q. Brandi Harvey-Karr didn't see a whole lot of minutes tonight. Was it
something in the way she was playing that she didn't get as many minutes?  
SUZIE McCONNELL-SERIO: I thought Kalista Walters was effective inside on the
block. We were able to go inside, and then we had some turnovers and tried to
go back with Brandi, and it was kind of too little too late. But Brandi has
been great for us all year. She brought a lot of leadership and energy and was
a great personality on our team.  
  
Q. Brenna, just talk about your time at Pitt and playing for Coach
McConnell-Serio.  
BRENNA WISE: I certainly think we made progress from my freshman year to my
senior year, started off the season strong. Nice to see a lot of young players
continuing to develop. Coach talked about Kauai Bradley, Kalista Walters,
Aysia Bugg, Jasmine Whitney, and surely we will miss Destinie and Brandi, but
it's nice to see the development coming from my other teammates and seeing the
growth on our team and what the future comes.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Kaylan Pugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32626)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 71, Boston College - 67  
  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: First of all, I'm just really proud of our team. We have a
lot of young players. Four of our top eight players are first year to the ACC,
first year playing at this level, and it's been a very interesting year for
this team, and we've been in this situation that we were in today seven other
times this year, and so to come out with the win just says a lot about the
growth of this team over the course of the season. I was just really pleased
with the play of Kaylan Pugh. She struggled a little bit in the first half and
really came out in the second half and I thought got aggressive and attacked
the basket and made plays for us.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a game where turnovers that you all forced them into
and points off turnovers seemed to be maybe the two main factors in your
victory.  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I give Boston College a lot of credit because they
execute so well in the half court. You can tell with Fasoula, she's the best
post player in the ACC. She's hard to guard, she's hard to defend, she makes
tough shots. One of the things we knew going into the game is we could not get
into a half court game with them. We had to keep this game going up-and-down,
we had to try to control tempo, we had to get some deflections, some steals,
run-outs, things like that, to be able to come away with a win.  
  
Q. Also a decided rebound advantage for you all, especially in the first
half. What were you seeing there to get you on the boards so easily?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: It's one of our core values we talk about. We built this
program on defense and rebounding, and one of the things we want to do is out
work people and I thought today we got a lot of hustle points, we chased down
a lot of loose balls, and we finished the season leading the ACC in offensive
rebounds, and that just says a lot about our heart and our hustle. I thought
today that we've been able to control the boards several games and not come
away with a win, but I thought today we made plays when we needed to down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Kaylan, second half of the game you really took off, you had 14
points in that second half. What were you seeing differently in the second
half that allowed you to do that?  
KAYLAN PUGH: It was really my teammates giving me the ball and Coach Joe
telling us keep going, because in the second half, just like in the summer we
put in all the work, so that's when you really just need to just turn it up.  
  
Q. You get to advance to Miami in the next game, a team that you played
very, very close early in the season. Your thoughts about facing them again?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I know that the players as soon as the game ended in
Miami we found out that we were going to play Boston College first. It was
hard to keep their attention there not to overlook Boston College because we
were so -- we really want this rematch with Miami. It was a tough, hard fought
game down there. Obviously we played them on senior night. They have three or
four really good seniors, three starters in the lineup. But I thought out team
came out and they kind of punched us early and got us down 10 and we fought
back. And going into the fourth quarter we had the lead. Ball drops one
direction or another in that game, it was some critical calls right there with
five minutes to go, and the ball goes another way, we come away with a win.  
  
One of the things that we're excited about is we've been so close all year. We
feel like if we ever put all our pieces together on the same night we're going
to be a tough team to play. We've kind of been looking forward to this
tournament. We talk about it's our time. We paid our price throughout the
course of this season, losing some heartbreakers. So it's one of those things
where we're focused on what we want right now and that's kind of redeeming
ourselves. And we're a young team, we basically return everyone but two
players next year. We want to play deep in the postseason and get as much
experience as we can.  
  
Q. Kaylan, your thoughts on playing Miami again?  
KAYLAN PUGH: I know that I'm really excited as well as my teammates. We just
want to execute the game plan so we can have a great game again and we're
going to come out with a win, so we're really excited.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts about playing a game before your opponent has
had a chance to play; is that a positive for you? How do you look at that?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, it's just basically the hand we're dealt right now, and
there's nothing we can do about that. We played hard all season long to try to
get ourselves in position not to have to play today. That didn't happen. But
we can't focus on what didn't happen. We're going to focus on what we can
control, and today -- what we can control tomorrow is how we come out and
play. And we work hard all season long, all off-season, non-conference season.
We're in shape. We're ready to play. And we're going to focus on coming out
tomorrow and getting a stop and a score on every possession, and we're just
going to give it everything we have. We have nothing to save it for, so we're
going to leave it all here.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Erik Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24766)

### [Kelly Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32628)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 71, Boston College - 67  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: Really proud of them tonight. I thought they fought through the
entire game. That from the beginning was a physical battle. Georgia Tech is
athletic. They're physical. There was pushing, there was shoving, and I don't
mean that bad sportsmanship kind of way, but in the kind of basketball game
you love to play. It was a gritty, down-and-dirty basketball game, and I was
really, really proud of how we competed.  
  
When it came down to it, we came up two or three basketball plays short. The
turnovers when we had 3-on-2s and 2-on-1s and to come up empty and in fact
turn the ball over, that made the difference because they went and finished
some big shots. I've got to give them credit. I thought our kids played really
good defense. The game plan was excellent. They were tough. They stuck
together. They did all the things a coach could ask.  
  
The team just said in the locker room that they're just -- they're just sick
that they couldn't get these seniors a win in this arena on their last trip to
the ACC Tournament. The woman sitting to my right, Kelly Hughes, has given
sweat, blood and tears. She was our first recruiting class here. She has
rewritten so many of our record books and helped change the culture about BC
in so many ways. She represents us incredibly, and again, it's been an honor
to coach this team as well as Kelly.  
  
Q. Coach, you were able to come back from a six-point halftime deficit
and actually get this thing tied up in the third quarter. What did you decide
to plan at halftime to get you back in this thing?  
ERIK JOHNSON: Yeah, we finally actually made a couple shots. Really the
defensive game plan didn't change. I thought our kids did a really good job.
We adjusted a lot of things, and with a young team sometimes that's a scary
thing for a coach. I asked them to do some things that we haven't done before
in the ways that we were congesting the paint and taking away some of their
athletic post players and drivers and all that, and we just stuck with it.  
  
On the offensive side there really was just too much inconsistency, the 23
turnovers at key times. When we had opportunities to score and we did finish,
we were able to get back in that game and even lead, and they made a couple
plays that we didn't, and they deserved to win the game.  
  
Q. Kelly, you've had such a huge career at Boston College, I think,
what, third or fourth all-time in the three-point made list, way up there.
What were they doing today to kind of stop you from hitting those threes?  
KELLY HUGHES: I think it was more so me. My shots weren't really falling. I
was getting open looks. Obviously they were contesting a lot of my shots, but
I was getting open looks, and it's just my job to knock those down; I can't
wait until the fourth quarter to start hitting shots. The game could have been
a lot different if I'd hit one or two shots earlier in the game, so that's
definitely on me. It's my job as a shooter to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. When you take a loss like this to pretty much end your season, what
do you take out of this to get ready for next year to build the program to get
going?  
ERIK JOHNSON: Yeah, so today is all about Kailey Edwards, Emilee Daley and
Kelly Hughes. As a coach, obviously I look at so many of these young players
that Kelly and her classmates mentored, in teaching them, and what was fun for
me as a coach was looking in that locker room and seeing them start to
understand, oh, now I understand what Kelly meant when she said this. I
understand why -- Kelly had been through the wars and she had to build this
culture, and I understand how special this is. Again, the biggest thing I can
hope is that these young players take those gifts, those lessons from these
older players and make them proud alums, that they can come back, and again, I
love the young talent we have. They need to get more disciplined. We need to
get more consistent, there's no question. But again, hopefully they learned a
lot from these guys, and we can make them proud as they move forward in life.  
  
Q. Kelly, just talk about playing for Coach Johnson for four years in
your time at Boston College.  
KELLY HUGHES: Absolutely I wanted to play for Coach Johnson and his staff.
Some of the most caring and genuine people you'll ever meet in your life. You
don't really find people like Coach Johnson and his staff in the profession of
basketball who really care about you as people, as students and as athletes.
On behalf of the team, we owe a lot to Coach Johnson, especially as seniors
for bringing us in, giving us an opportunity to represent Boston College, both
on the court and off the court. So we're very, very thankful to have a chance
to play with "Eagles" across our chest.  
  
Q. Which one of you taught Mariella that scoop shot that seems to go in
about 80 percent of the time?  
KELLY HUGHES: Not me.  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: I'd like to take full credit for teaching Kelly to shoot threes
and teaching Mariella to score in the post -- no, that's called recruiting,
right? The only thing I'd like to add to Kelly's comments is just what a
special place Boston College is, and it was great when I got that job and I
still remember the first phone call I made to the Hughes family, and they knew
what Boston College represented, and for Kelly to come in, she's changed so
many things about just the way little kids flock to her and her teammates, the
way our team interacts with the community, the way they give back, just our
camps and the community support, the alumni, those kinds of things. It's
really been fun to watch them embrace Men and Women For Others and the Jesuit
ideals of Boston College. Again, it's the -- I'm proud to work there, and I'm
proud to have coached these guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Jamie Cherry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30375)

### [Taylor Koenen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32634)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 72, Pitt - 60  
  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I'm just really, really proud of these kids. We've been so
short-handed with some big-time injuries as we've gone through the season.
We've lost -- we started out with a major one at the beginning of the year and
then we lost Hillary Fuller and then Destini Walker and then Stephanie Watts,
so we've just had to keep adjusting and adjusting and adjusting, and we
started three freshmen, and they played -- well, let's see, 40 minutes. Jamie
played 40 minutes. Paris played 40 minutes. Olivia. And so anyway, Taylor
played 40.  
  
I mean, they played their hearts out. They really did. So Jamie just did a
tremendous job at point guard, and really getting to the foul line. Her
penetration and all was just really, really good.  
  
You know, the freshmen contributed when we needed them to. Taylor had a
double-double with rebounds and points and all, and even though Olivia didn't
score, we put her out there on 23, and she did a great job with that because
they were really hurting us in the first half, 23 and 5 was. So we tried to
give a little more attention to them in the second half.  
  
We played the freshmen, and they did a really nice job for us, and Emily
Sullivan went in there as did that for us, as well.  
  
And on Paris, Paris is just so versatile. I mean, Jamie is a great point
guard. She was scoring and driving. But Paris plays a lot of different
positions for us. You know, I was concerned that she is the fourth -- she was
No. 4 in scoring in the ACC, and I'm thinking how has this kid gotten
overlooked, because I was really disappointed when I looked at all the ACC
awards and she wasn't anywhere, and fourth in scoring in the ACC.  
  
I know, I told her before the game, you've got to make your presence known
because you've been overlooked. Same thing with Jamie. And so they were very
motivated, and the rest of the kids hung on to their coattails, and they just
played their hearts out, so I'm very proud of them. We've got a few hours to
regroup and everything and get ready for a very, very good Syracuse team.  
  
Q. Jamie, did you know when you were at the free-throw line at the end
that your career high was coming up? Did you know that?  
JAMIE CHERRY: No idea.  
  
Q. You looked really disappointed when you missed the first two. What
was going through your mind?  
JAMIE CHERRY: I don't miss free throws. I take pride in my free-throw
shooting. I really get upset with myself when I miss a free throw because I
really am in competition with my percentage that I saw last year and trying to
shoot better than that percentage, so when I miss free throws I really get on
myself. Just to see those last two free throws go in were big for me.  
  
Q. Coach, you're down by 4 at halftime coming out on a 10-0 run to start
the second half. What did you say to them to turn this thing around?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, let's see. We changed up what we were doing on defense.
We were actually running three different junk defenses out there in the second
half, and then also we were trying to use the clock a little bit more but also
trying to break down their defense some with the ball movement and everything,
and then get some ball screens for Jamie and for Paris and everything like
that, just because, again, we don't have subs to put in there, and so that was
our plan.  
  
I thought we got some really good shots, and then I thought our defensive plan
also worked.  
  
Q. Taylor, you had a double-double tonight out there. Great second half
out of you. What were you doing differently in the second half that wasn't
working in the first half?  
TAYLOR KOENEN: I just tried to get out of my own head and also just knowing
that this could have been our last game and going out there and giving
everything you have and being able to get rebounds and get my team to have
second chances at shots is a big thing. So really just going after the ball
was major.  
  
Q. I'll give you a chance to brag on Jamie. How great a ball player is
she?  
TAYLOR KOENEN: Jamie is great. Obviously she can do it all, drive, pass,
finish with contact, hit the three, and she showed that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, as you get ready to play Syracuse, who kind of had a good game
against you up there, what can you do differently to play them closely
tomorrow?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I can guarantee you we're going to be praying a lot.
But no, they're just an outstanding, excellent team. They had Player of the
Year. They've got a lot of experience, you know, and you look at the teams,
the top teams in the conference with Notre Dame and NC State, Syracuse and
all, you know, and Louisville, and they all are very heavy with seniors,
upperclassmen and everything, and of course we have no seniors, and Jamie is
our only junior. And we've got one sophomore. The rest of them are all
freshmen.  
  
I mean, we're very, very young.  
  
But again, we're going to go out there and try to handle their press was what
bothered us before, but we'll try some different things. I may have our
centers bringing the ball up the floor, you never know, throw something
different at them, something that they're not used to, and maybe give them
some different looks. But we're honored to be playing tomorrow and everything,
and again, it's the ACC Tournament, and we love it. These folks down here at
Coastal, they just do a great job, and it's so great to see so many good
people down here.  
  
Q. Your long coaching career, is this the youngest team you've ever
brought to the ACC Tournament?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Yeah, I don't even have to think about that. Yeah, because we
really have no seniors, one junior, one sophomore, and the rest of them are
freshmen. But hey, I love them. They're great kids. Just think how good we're
going to be when we get all those hurt kids back, and we've got some really
good kids coming in next year, too. So I'm excited about them. But they're
great. Our chemistry is tremendous, it really is. They're fun to coach, and
really, this is what it's all about. You know, but I'm just happy for Jamie,
and again -- and Taylor, you know, the freshmen, they were really successful
in high school, but this is a whole different level, and they've had to learn
that a lot of the things they did in high school they can't do on this level,
so a lot of it has been decision making and everything like that.  
  
At one time tonight out there, Taylor was trying to do a couple things and
everything, and then she settled back down, and she really does some things
that helps get other people open, and she can really get in there and get some
key rebounds when we need it, and she can make some key baskets when we need
it, too, and she's just going to continue to get better and better as she gets
more experienced. Same thing with Emily and Li-Li and all those young kids.  
  
Q. You mentioned Syracuse has the Player of the Year; what are your
thoughts on Alexis Peterson and the season she had this year?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, there's a lot of good players in the league. You know,
she is an outstanding guard, there's no doubt about that. I mean, she can do
everything. She can do it all. I've seen her, she's played really, really well
against us.  
  
But when it came time to voting this year, I changed my vote about four times
before I actually voted because I thought, well, this one did this in this
game and this one did this in this game because I really did, I could have
easily voted for four different players and everything.  
  
But there's no doubt that she is one of the I'd say top four or five in the
conference, but we've got some really, really good players this year in the
league. I'm just glad that the majority of them are seniors and they will not
be here next year.  
  
Q. Jamie, when you hit back to back threes, kind of felt like the tide
was turning, you turned around, threw three fingers up in the air and smiled
at the crowd. What was that moment like for you?  
JAMIE CHERRY: It was great. Just being able to put our team in the lead and
being able to put points on the board was great, and it was, of course,
getting everybody hyped. So we love the hype, and it's exciting, and for us to
be able to come home with the W is very exciting.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Kenny Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30712)

### [Samantha Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32616)

### [Regan Magarity](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32617)

  
_Conway, South Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 67, Virginia Tech - 66  
  
KENNY BROOKS: We're very disappointed, disappointed for these two young ladies
and the rest of the group because I felt like they played hard enough to win a
basketball game. They left everything out on the floor. Some things just
didn't go our way, and as a result, Clemson comes away with a one-point win.
But very proud of my group. I felt they fought through a lot of adversity,
especially in the last couple weeks. We've been very shorthanded, but no one
has made any excuses. They've gone out and they've played and they've played
extremely hard. I'm really excited about where they are, where they've come,
but obviously we're very disappointed today.  
  
Q. After playing so many minutes on Sunday and not having Sidney again
today, how much was fatigue a factor or not today?  
SAMANTHA HILL: I don't think it was necessarily a factor. It's obviously hard
going without Sidney two games in a row, but there's always five people on the
court, and we all need to step up and do our jobs.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a game that you all had control in the first quarter.
What were they doing differently to get back in this thing?  
KENNY BROOKS: I think a lot of things factor into it. They made some
adjustments, we made some adjustments. We got in the one stretch, I think we
got up by 14, and then we did some things that were uncharacteristic, and I
don't know if it's fatigue or whatever the situation. We got in foul trouble.
Sammy got three fouls late into the second quarter. We had some people out
there that are not accustomed to playing the minutes.  
  
But regardless, you have to give them credit. You know, we made our run. They
made their run. It came down to a one-possession game.  
  
Q. The last play of the game, did she wait too long or did you talk
about what happened at the end of the game there?  
KENNY BROOKS: She didn't get it off so she did wait too long. Obviously she's
pushing it. She knew how much time was left. I think she just took one too
many dribbles, and no, I have not talked to her yet, because the game is just
over and I want could began lat /THAEUT tear /THAOERZ ACC careers and what
they've done for Virginia Tech ^ check. It's a learning tool. We'll use it as
a learning cool. She has to understand, okay, hey, I've got to find someone or
I've got to get it up quick to get a shot off. But she's only a sophomore, and
she played hard tonight, and we'll adjust and we'll make some adjustments to
her, and she'll figure it out from that.  
  
Q. What did you think of you guys' defense today and did their defense
do some things to make it a tough shooting day for you?  
KENNY BROOKS: No, I'm not discrediting anything that Clemson did. Very proud
of our kids. We played shorthanded. Sammy Hill, I think she is a natural 2
guard, right, and she's down there and battling for 40 minutes in the post.
Again, you give credit to Clemson. They won the basketball game, but I don't
know if it's something without watching the film that they did to us. The kids
played their hearts out the last couple weeks. And when you take someone of
Sid's significance basically out of our lineup for the last three games, it's
going to take its toll on you in more ways than one. Yeah, you can look at it
and you can say, well, her 14 points and nine rebounds, but it also puts a lot
more pressure on the other kids like Kendyl. Kendyl is not accustomed to
playing this many minutes nor should she be playing this many minutes. Sammy
shouldn't be playing this many minutes. And Regan, what she's done in the last
few games, it's unbelievable because I don't know if she's gotten a sub, and
she's still putting up monster numbers in the last couple games.  
  
Sidney's absence has an effect on us in more than one way and I think it puts
a lot of pressure on these kids, and then it's going to affect our continuity,
it's going to affect the way we execute.  
  
Q. Just talk about Regan and Samantha and what they've meant to this
team and their career here.  
KENNY BROOKS: Well, what they've meant to this team is unbelievable. I talked
to them about the seniors, their contributions, and just how much it's meant
for Virginia Tech basketball. But you look at their contributions outside of
the actual court, and they are tremendous representatives of Virginia Tech.
And then you can add one element, one more element to it, what they mean to
me. This is me coming in, my transition year, and I remember when I first got
hired, I said it. They asked me what's a Hokie. I said, I am. I really didn't
know what a Hokie was until these young ladies taught me what it's like to be
a Hokie, and I'm really proud of their efforts. They didn't win as many games
as they would have won, Sammy and her crew, but the mark that they've left on
Virginia Tech and their character is going to live for a long time. And we're
just fortunate enough that we have Regan for two more years. I think she'll
continue to make even more strides, and she's done a tremendous job of
becoming a leader and being more vocal, and I think that's going to bode well
for us in the future.  
  
Q. Regan, what was helping you get your points today? What was your
strategy for getting your work done?  
REGAN MAGARITY: I think just playing hard. I knew that I had an advantage on
the perimeter, so just attacking, just playing hard and being aggressive.  
  
Q. When she drove on you at the end of the game there, did you think,
all right, I don't want to make her get an easy bucket here, or what was going
through your mind at that point?  
REGAN MAGARITY: Yeah, I think I just wanted to challenge her shot, and
obviously the call didn't go our way. But I just didn't want her to have like
an easy lay-up.  
  
Q. Kenny, without Sidney today, obviously they hurt you on the boards
and got a lot of second-chance points. How much of a factor was that today?  
KENNY BROOKS: It was tremendous. I thought we did a really good job in the
first quarter, but we kept challenging them, but there's only so much you can
do. And again, you have kids playing out of position. When you lose Sid and
she's your second leading rebounder, you put a lot of pressure on Regan. Regan
had 14 rebounds and Sammy came through, but she was in foul trouble. Everyone
stepped up, and you can only do so much. But I'm proud of the kids' effort. We
didn't always execute, and yes, we know that that was an issue, and we got
out-rebounded by 15. They had 20 offensive rebounds. But it's only so much you
can do when you basically have seven players out there.  
  
But all you can do is be proud of the kids' effort and what they did, and I'm
very proud of that, and I think that's going to help us set a foundation here
for years to come. I'm just proud. They could have hung their heads, they
could have given up. They didn't, they kept fighting, and as a result we had a
chance to win the game at the end.  
  
Q. Regan, you guys were down eight points in the fourth quarter and
fatigue could have been a factor at that point, but you climbed back in the
game and tied it up. What helped you in those final minutes get back in this
thing?  
REGAN MAGARITY: I think just getting defensive rebounds and limiting them to
one possession, and then pushing the ball on offense.  
  
Q. With the season, what are your takeaways for next year, what you need
to do to get stronger and better out there?  
KENNY BROOKS: Well, we're always thinking about next year, but right now we
really want to celebrate this year and these kids. I think we owe it to Sammy
and Vanessa and Sid and Tara to continue this ride before we start talking
about next year. I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot about this league, and
I think it's something that you have to go through it so that you can
understand what you have to do to be successful. Obviously it was a great year
for me. It's a lot of great basketball in this league, and I think we know now
what you have to do, the mentality, the type of team you have to put together
in order to compete in this league because there's a lot of great teams, a lot
of great players, a lot of great coaches, and it's been a really good ride for
me and this group as we try to form our identity on this league.

### [Alexis Prince](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28423)

### [Kristy Wallace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30415)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 77  
  
Baylor - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Baylor Lady Bears, Coach Kim Mulkey
and her two student-athletes from Baylor University, Kristy Wallace and Alexis
Prince. Coach, did you want to make an opening statement? She declines opening
statement. We will go straight to questions.  
  
Q. Kim, you were giving up 55 points a game and they had 65 at the end
of the third quarter. Could you ever have imagined that?  
KIM MULKEY: Very few times in 31 years of coaching, something like that, I can
ever think of one player took her team on her shoulders and won three games
and Tynice Martin did that. She did it in every game here. She just elevate
over people and make shots and kudos to that team because she really did. I've
seen it one other time where one player just took her team to a championship.  
  
I think back, I'm not a zone coach, but I may have waited a little too late to
go to a zone. I thought the zone disrupted their rhythm and her rhythm and
just look at the stat sheet, guys. We had four people in double figures, but
then after that nobody scores for you. So some people need to do some soul
searching on our bench when they go in a game. Is the moment too big for you,
or can you put on your big girl panties and play in a game like this?  
  
Let me quickly tell you, this is but three games and if I can be as happy
being an opponent as I can for a guy and a school and a team it would be Mike
Carey. He is a hard-nosed, man-to-man coach. I love how he coaches, and I'm
happy for him. As disappoint as I am that we didn't win another tournament
championship, I'm just happy for Mike and his team.  
  
Q. Kim, only 15 turnovers, but it seemed like they came at crucial times
and then maybe just also the inability to get the rebound when you needed it.
Did you feel like those things were big?  
KIM MULKEY: Bryce, this game honestly was probably lost in the first five
minutes. Part of our scouting report when you played these guys -- because
they're on a roll right now and they're playing really well and they're
scoring the ball. You can only give them one opportunity to miss. We didn't
get rebounds.  
  
If you look at the last quarter and a half for us, guys, we cut the game to 6
points being down -- what were we? 20-something? Why didn't we play with that
sense of urgency when the game started? If you play with that sense of urgency
when the game started and you get every loose ball and you're productive the
first five minutes of the game, you might not have lost.  
  
Q. Kristy, how frustrating was that getting down 21 against a team that
you had beat twice during the regular season?  
KRISTY WALLACE: We shot ourselves in the foot tonight, and as Coach said it
was lost in the first five minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about having a lot of admiration for Mike Carey.
He's been at it a long time. I think he came in 2001 at West Virginia about a
little after you did at Baylor. Can you talk about why you admire his coaching
style and what do you think this means to him, his first conference title?  
KIM MULKEY: Mike and I just talk the same language. He's not petty. He just
wants to coach. He's not into who his best friends are. He just wants to go
out and coach hard-nosed basketball, and I just enjoy visiting with him. I
think he teaches man-to-man defense as good as anybody that I've ever coached
against and I just love that. I just love how he challenges his girls, and he
coaches 'em just like he coached guys.  
  
You know, he's out there to help 'em win. He doesn't mind getting on 'em. He
doesn't mind challenging them, and they consequently play good for him.  
  
Q. Alexis, you were on Tynice from the start. How difficult of a match-
up is that particularly when a player is on a roll like that? What was the
scouting report as far as trying to defend her?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: I mean when a player hot, ain't really much you can do.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can, just talk about last four minutes when you all --
when the team made the run to cut it down to 6 and just couldn't find a way to
get over the hump.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you're fatigued at that point. You're leaving it all --
listen, I am excited and I expected them to -- well, I better use a better
word than "fight." I expected them to play hard. That's all we know.  
  
They didn't just sit back and feel sorry for themselves. They tried to make it
a ball game, but when you have to expend that much energy sometimes you just
can't make that one more shot or that one more free throw. But, again, if you
played that hard the first five minutes or even the first half you might not
have had to use that much energy late.  
  
Q. Coach, how important now is the next week and a half where you have
some time off before you guys have to play in terms of getting healthy and
getting over this and moving forward?  
KIM MULKEY: There's four parts to a season. The regular season is the most
important thing. That's 18 basketball games. We're the Big 12 Champs. We've
been fortunate for I don't know how many years now to win the tournament on
top of that. We didn't, though. That certainly doesn't outweigh what we did in
the regular season, so that's the second part of your season.  
  
The third part now will be the NCAA Tournament. Hopefully we'll get a good
seed and host at Baylor and go to a good regional where our fans can see us
play. You've gotta win four games now to get to the Final Four. The first part
of your -- nonconference is the first part of the four segments of your
season.  
  
Q. Coach, how positive was it to make two stops and then score the last
two buckets going into the halftime in the locker room?  
KIM MULKEY: I thought it was big. You cut it to single digits, and I talked
about that at halftime. That's a good thing. You cut it to single digits
there, and we did some good things through the course of the game when we were
in desperate mode to do some good things. But you should not always have to
wait for that. We've been blessed. Three losses we've not been in that
situation much. So hopefully when we get a few days off and come back and
prepare, we can look at this as a learning experience and challenge some kids
that just flat out didn't help us today.  
  
Q. Kim, when you're a heavy favorite and they come out launching threes
and it wasn't just all the threes and they start making enough of them, did
you feel like your team started to play uptight at all?  
KIM MULKEY: No, I wouldn't use "uptight." Probably just like if you're out
there, it's like, whew, when are they going to miss one? I think it's probably
more that than uptight. We never think we're going to lose a game, no matter
how far we're down.  
  
But it can wear on you a little bit when you think, gosh, I guarded her pretty
good and she elevated and made it in your takes and when you did get her to
miss we give up an offensive rebound. Those kinds of things. Didn't happen for
us today.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been eight years since you entered the NCAA Tournament
coming off a loss. How might that change your message and your motivating
tactics?  
KIM MULKEY: It won't. It won't at all.  
  
Q. Kristy, you guys did play with very much intensity in the fourth
quarter especially. What do you think it was that you guys didn't start off
the game like that when you the reflect on it. Coach said you weren't tight,
but what do you think it was that you didn't have that intensity from the
beginning?  
KRISTY WALLACE: I know toward the end we didn't give up and I'm proud of our
team for that definitely. Coming out, off with the bang they were ready,
played good, strong defense; and, you know, they hit shots. Yeah, it's a
credit to them. They played well.  
  
Q. Kim, you played Natalie a lot of minutes and I guess that was maybe
with the zone and the press, but she just like she has in some other games
seemed like she was reluctant to pull the trigger.  
KIM MULKEY: Natalie is a freshman and through the course of the year she has
become more aggressive. She has looked to shoot it. Dekeiya played 15 minutes
and just was turning down good shots. She would drive to the paint and
normally she makes those shots. She was, I thought, passive, and I knew we
were going to start pressing. And I just thought Natalie being fresh and we
were going to drop back to the zone and Mike could play the top of the zone
better than Dekeiya could because Natalie is a natural 2 player and Dekeiya is
a 3.  
  
Q. Coach, does it look like still with Alexis Jones it's still a day-by-
day, week-by-week?  
KIM MULKEY: She worked out today. She was on the floor with the ball and says
her knew is feeling better. I'm hoping that we have done the right thing by
her and let her rest until the most important part and that's the NCAA
Tournament. I hope she can, you know, give us some valuable time during the
tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Thank you very much. Congratulations on a good
season and good luck in the NCAA.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 77  
  
Baylor - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the West Virginia Mountaineers, Coach Mike
Carey, his student-athletes, Tynice Martin, Teana Muldrow and Lanay
Montgomery. Coach, congratulations. Your thoughts?  
  
MIKE CAREY: You know, first of all, Baylor is a great program. They do a great
job. Won the leg again and everything, so it's an honor for us. If we're going
to knock somebody off it was an honor for us to knock off Baylor because
they're such a great program. Give all the credit to our players.  
  
They knew coming down here that we had to win at least one, two games; and I
told 'em after the second game, hell, we might as well win the third one since
we're here. And they came out and played extremely hard and continued to play
defense the whole time. I look here where Baylor only had nine offensive
rebounds, which is pretty good for us, defensively keeping them off the
boards.  
  
We turned it over only 7 times, so I thought those were going to be the areas
that we had to do really well in and we was able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, what clicked for you guys here in Oklahoma City?  
MIKE CAREY: I tell you what, our players just -- we were having good practices
before we came here. We really were. They were focused, and you could just see
it in their body language that, you know -- I said in here after the Oklahoma
game I had to shut down our shootaround because they were so focused and going
so hard. We needed some energy for the game.  
  
I knew we were focused, and, you know, I thought the last 5 minutes of this
half we played not to lose instead of playing to win; but, you know, we were
able to hold on and get the victory.  
  
Q. Coach, last evening you mentioned about the pace of the game, it was
-- especially against Texas it was quicker than you wanted it to be, but
tonight for whatever reason that was the pace that you got and you stayed with
it until you as you just mentioned until late in the game. Was it just a gut
feeling or just what?  
MIKE CAREY: I just felt, especially when they were going big on us, the
opportunity we had on the fast breaks we wanted to pick that up when they went
big on us. Then I just thought the last 5 minutes I could tell -- I took a
couple of timeouts because I could tell we were about out of gas. Instead of
attacking their press and attacking their zone we were just, you know, getting
some bad shots and wasn't getting to the rim. But, you know, give our players
all the credit. We don't play a lot of people and to play three games in three
nights against the caliber of teams we played, they did just a fantastic job.  
  
Q. Tynice, you had a huge tournament. Kim Mulkey said that you really
willed your team to this championship through all three games. At one point
you hit a three, stuck your tongue out, looked like you were having a lot of
fun out there. What was it like for you and did you know going into this, did
you feel like you were going to be on in this tournament?  
TYNICE MARTIN: I mean, coming into the tournament, yeah, we had a lot of
confidence. Like Coach said, we had great practices and we had good energy. It
was just different from regular season. Everybody was just playing hard. I
could tell from the Oklahoma game that we came here to win and I mean, we had
to do it for Lanay. I wanted to send Lanay out with a championship, and that's
what we did.  
  
Q. You guys had to -- you know, losing Bria from last year you had to
find your new identity maybe a little bit this year and you went through some
tough times during Big 12 play with a couple of losing streaks. As recently as
nine days ago you lost at Oklahoma State. What was it that finally clicked you
guys together? Can you put that into perspective?  
LANAY MONTGOMERY: I think, like, coming into the tournament we didn't know if
we would like the NCAA Tournament and our coach told us that, you know, girls,
we have got to go down here and win at least two games to know for sure that
we can get to the NCAA, and I think we came down here and had our mindset and
the girls knew it was all or nothing. Our backs were against the wall and we
had to give it our all. I think we came out and played strong, tough and
physical for three games.  
  
TEANA MULDROW: I just think that we wanted to defend. Playing basketball I
learned that offense is great, but defense wins championships and we bought
into defense and we knew it was going to be the key. Scoring is not the
problem for us. It is just sticking with defense and having each other's
backs. I think we did that well this tournament.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you talk about fourth quarter. Baylor gets within 4, what
was the key for y'all to be able to hold back that surge they had and extend
the lead and go on to win?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Defense. They hit some good shots, and we stopped playing
defense for a while and we picked it back up and we had to hit free throws.
They started fouling us at the end, and we had to focus and not let their
press get into our heads and not turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Coach, can you put into perspective a sophomore scoring 32 in a
conference championship game?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Of course. It feels amazing, but when you have the team --  
  
MIKE CAREY: I think he asked me.  
  
TYNICE MARTIN: Okay, go ahead. Sorry! (Laughter.)  
  
MIKE CAREY: No, Tynice, you know, she has been a scorer the whole year. Well,
for two years. She was a scorer last year for us and a scorer this year. Our
biggest thing with Tynice during the year when she started scoring, people
started overplaying here and playing box and ones and sending their zone out
at her.  
  
Once she learned how to start moving without the basketball and attacking the
rim, good things happened for her. Our players, you got to give our players a
lot of credit, because, man, they looked for her in this tournament. They
really looked for her. When she broke open she had the ball and that's the
key. People got to free her up and make good passes to her, and we were able
to do that.  
  
TYNICE MARTIN: Like I said, it feels amazing, you know, to average what I
averaged this tournament. But when you have good practices and when you have,
you know, my teammates behind me saying nobody can guard you and my coach
saying attack them, you have no choice but to do what they say and to believe
in yourself. So I feel like that's why I play with the confidence I play with.  
  
Q. Tynice, you got a little bit emotional talking about your family
being able to be here and watch you play. What was it like to have them in the
crowd and how often do they get to see you play?  
TYNICE MARTIN: My dad, he gets to the big games. My mom, she has a heavy work
schedule. But it was good seeing them in the stands, you know, witnessing this
and us having this first Big 12 championship together. It meant everything,
you know, looking in the stands and seeing them, you know, cheering and happy
and them on TV. So it meant everything for them to be there.  
  
Q. Mike, I know with all the conference changes and stuff over the last
few years a lot of schools suddenly were playing teams way far way and you
guys are way far way from this whole conference. Can you talk about what some
of the difficulties of that have been to play a championship game so far away
from your home fans, but also what it means to win your first one?  
MIKE CAREY: You saw when we played Oklahoma here in Oklahoma it was like a
home game for them, and then Texas, a lot of fans and Baylor today. We're so
far from West Virginia, Morgantown. We don't get a lot of fans here, but you
know what? The fans we did have here we really appreciate it and I can hear
'em, and when the game was over they were singing "Country Roads" and that's
all that mattered, that we heard that song we end. And give Lanay Montgomery
credit. She does so much for us on the defensive side and the offensive side,
but she sacrifices a lot of games setting picks and helping the guards on
defense; and, you know, we're really going to miss her as a senior.  
  
Teana played half a game and almost had a double-double, so that tells you
what she brings to the game. And Chania had 8 assists and only two turnovers.
So it was a total team effort, and Tynice hit some great shots and some tough
shots. Tynice takes shots you say, "no, no, no. Great shot!" She has that
confidence, and we want her to have that confidence, you know, she has a green
light. You got a shot, shoot it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Best of luck in the NCAAs, guys.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 88  
  
K-State - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Baylor Lady Bears. We're glad to have
the Coach, student-athletes, Nina Davis and Kalani Brown. Coach,
congratulations on the win and I assume you're going to skip your opening
comments. We will go straight to questions.  
  
Q. Nina, you guys shot the ball again really well today, 54%. How much
credit does Kristy get in that, just feeding y'all?  
NINA DAVIS: She gets pretty much all the credit, 99.1%. The other is finishing
the shot, but we go as Kristy goes. All year long she has been our Energizer
bunny. She never gets tired. She is going to take that charge. Today she had
blood running down her knees. She is always going to give her heart. She is
going to give 100% in everything she does and she has been trying to handle
everything since Joan has been out.  
  
Q. Kim, I think it was 1.7 assists last year with Kristy. It's almost 6
this year. How does she make that jump? Have you ever seen anything like that
with your players?  
KIM MULKEY: Jones last year played the point with Kristy, so they were both
handling the ball probably equally and then early in the season I pretty much
told Kristy to handle the ball because I feel like Jones is such a great
scorer. If you could just let her not have to think, you know, and be the
coach out front, let her go shoot the ball and do things. So that's the big
difference is that Kristy's basically playing all point guard now.  
  
Q. Nina, there were a couple of no-look passes from Kristy. Is that the
deal? Is there any eye contact? Do you know it's coming to you?  
NINA DAVIS: I kinda know it's coming to me. I've been playing with Kristy for
thee years now, and I pretty much know who she is going to pass it to even
though she is not looking at me. So it's kinda like a chemistry-type thing.  
  
Q. Kalani, to have another shot at another Big 12 Championship. How
sweet is that?  
KALANI BROWN: It's just a blessing. We worked hard for it and I'm just
honored, really, and really excited. I'm sure the team is excited and just
going to go out there and give it our all.  
  
Q. Nina, as someone that doesn't satisfy all of your games I look at
your stats and wonder you've had such a lot of at this reputation, and your
numbers are a little bit down this year. Is there any particular reason for
that? Are you giving the ball more to Kalani or what's the deal in?  
NINA DAVIS: We just have a team with a lot of depth this year. Numbers aren't
really important to me. In the past years my numbers have been higher, but I
didn't have the talent that I have on the team now. As you can see each game
we have a different scorer -- had 17 points yesterday and then we had three
people today that had pretty good numbers. So it's just the balance of our
team and it doesn't are bother me. I just do whatever my team needs.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys will play West Virginia or Texas tomorrow. Can you
talk a little bit about both teams and what it's going to take for you to beat
either of them tomorrow?  
KIM MULKEY: They're both very good. I'll be in the stands watching, to see
what we can do better when we play either one of them.  
  
Is that good enough? I mean, right now I'm just relieved. I'll focus on the
winner after the game and then we'll get in the film room and scout and talk
to 'em. Right now I don't know what I would tell you any different than what
I've told you the last time we've played both of them. They're good.  
  
Q. Fifteen assists for Wallace today. Conference tournament record. Was
there anything special about what she did is or is this how it goes?  
KIM MULKEY: Just Kristy being Kristy. She got out in transition and we had a
lot of numbers a lot of times. She made some no-look passes. She delivered the
ball quickly to people up the floor. She is just a -- she is a great player.
She can play through fouls. She can play through blood. She can play through a
turnover, and she just is somebody you would sure like to be on the receiving
end of her passes because she put -- she just gives it to you where you can
finish.  
  
Q. Coach, it's easy to look at playing in another final the same-old,
same-old for your program, but what makes it not that for you?  
KIM MULKEY: I get a paycheck. That's what we're supposed to do. Baylor doesn't
think it's the same-old, same-old. Baylor appreciates it. Our fans spend their
money to come, and a lot of those fans are on fixed incomes, and they love the
Lady Bears. And I guess you just call it tradition, excellence, elite; and
these players that come to Baylor, they understand what came before they got
there and they want to maintain it.  
  
Q. Coach Nina said a few minutes ago that it's the depth of the team
that everybody spreads out. You've been there a long time now. Is this the
deepest team on paper that you've had?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes.  
  
Q. Kim, I know it always starts with defense for you guys, but the
offensive efficiency that you guys have had in two games here at the
tournament now. I mean, you know, like what you're seeing?  
KIM MULKEY: We're putting up a lot of points. I think it goes back to the
depth. We can sub and really not have much of a letdown, but we've had that
all year.  
  
I think we're playing very good basketball at the right time of the year. I
think we've played good basketball the entire year, but we're just spreading
the ball around. I think Jones when she went down, we became somewhat of a
different team. We became bigger. We became more physical. Dekeiya Cohen has
stepped in like you would expect juniors to step in and just not missed a
beat. Scoring a lot of points. I think we had 80-something there in the fourth
when I substituted with about 4 and a half minutes to go, and let's hope we
can save some -- still got a little bit left in the tank.  
  
Q. Kim, yesterday you said that you were going to go meet Alexis's dad
for the first time, you hadn't had a chance to meet him. What was that
interaction like and what did you guys talk about?  
KIM MULKEY: I just hugged him and -- just hugged him and told him how blessed
we were at Baylor that his daughter was ending her career on the highest of
highs and then when he smiled I realized, yep, you're her dad. Their smiles
are the same. He's a proud Papa.  
  
Q. Nina, Coach talked about it not being the same-old. You've been
around for four years. How do you keep it from being the same-old, same-old?
You have won now in your time 7 Big 12 championships.  
NINA DAVIS: Winning never gets old. If I'm ever in a position where winning
change-ups become the same-old, same it's time for me to stop playing
basketball. It's always a different team. You have different players. It is a
different experience for the freshmen. It will be their first time getting one
of these type of rings. So really the motivation is to win. No one likes to
lose and it's just different each and every time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 88  
  
K-State - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Kansas State Wildcats, Coach Jeff
Mittie and his student-athletes Karyla Middlebrook and Breanna Lewis. Coach,
your thoughts about today's game?  
  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, I thought it was -- I thought the pace of the game was a
little quick for us. We did want to get -- we did want to try to get --
disrupt them early in the game and I really thought Baylor handled it pretty
well. They obviously put up a lot of points. I thought they were playing at a
high level in the first half.  
  
Now, I did think we were playing at a high level as well offensively doing
some good things. We were getting to the rim and getting to spots on the floor
that we wanted to get to, but the pace was just a little quick for us.  
  
Second half, you know, we had our opportunities. We were doing a great job of
getting to the free throw line. We just weren't converting. We had numerous
trips of 0-2, 0-2, 0-2, and the obvious thing is that you can't do that
against a team that's in the top-5 in the country. You're not going to win
games if you're losing those kinds of plays, but our kids did do some good
things to get there. Baylor is just playing at a high level.  
  
Q. You had 18 points and a lot of those came in the paint, and if memory
serves it was the same last time. What do you see against Baylor that allows
you to get in the paint so much against them?  
KARYLA MIDDLEBROOK: Well, this game we set a lot of high ball screens and I
was taking advantage when they were going under. Sometimes they were late on
that, and I just had a quick step.  
  
Q. Coach, any idea what was going on for you guys at the free throw line
tonight?  
JEFF MITTIE: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. We've been a solid free throw-
shooting team. Just one of those nights. Kindred Wesemann goes 1 of 4. I don't
know what she was shooting prior to here, but it's got to be in the mid-80s,
or something like that. That's one of those things. Players have to go through
their routine, step up there, knock 'em down. Tonight we didn't do that. We
will go back to practice -- I know we're disappointed that we didn't make
them. I know we're disappointed that we made good plays to get there, and you
know to get to the free throw against Baylor you've got to make good plays.
And I know we're disappointed that we didn't convert those.  
  
Q. Coach, seemed like every time y'all seemed to get some offense going
they had an answer for that. How tough is it to combat a team that always
seems to have an answer?  
JEFF MITTIE: We needed to string some stops together. The margin was about
anywhere from 12 to 15 in that stretch early in the half and we kept talking
about getting three stops in a row. I don't know that we did that. We
certainly didn't do it multiple times, but Baylor is playing at a high level
right now. Their ball movement is excellent right now. Alexis Prince is really
playing at a great pace. I think Wallace in the last two weeks has really
played well. And then you talk about Davis, I thought last night had a great
look to her. She carried that over to today, and we're not even mentioning
Kalani Brown.  
  
So I mean they're playing at a good level. I wouldn't use the word
"frustrating." It's just that the margin of error, you've got to get stops and
our margin today wasn't very big and we didn't take advantage of -- we didn't
play well enough to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Coach, how is Kindred Wesemann doing?  
JEFF MITTIE: I don't know the answer to that. They're looking at her right
now. I think that the best thing I can tell you is we're hoping that it's a
little pulled muscle, but I asked the doctors not to coach and they ask me not
to be doctor. So I tried to abide by that. They definitely don't want me to be
doctor. I can assure you of that.  
  
Q. Now you guys can turn your focus to the NCAA Tournament. What are
some things you want to see out of this team as they progress into that?  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, you know, with the way the tournament is set up across the
country for you for most of the Power Five's, we're done here, so we've got a
week before Selection Show. We need to get back and get better the next
practice, get better the next practice I would like so see us continue. I
thought we made strides in the game with our discipline. So I would like to
see that continue on. We did some things different today, so I would like to
see how we can expand that. Not too different, but get back, get a little bit
of rest, get better and wait and see where we end up in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. For the players, what can you learn from a game like this?  
KARYLA MIDDLEBROOK: I mean, we can learn a lot, just knowing that the NCAA
Tournament the games are going to come quick and you're going to have to turn
around and each opponent is going to be different and the game plan is going
to be different, so Coach talked a lot about having discipline in the game
plan and today we wanted to slow it down a little bit more. I think carrying
that over will be a lot for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
BREANNA LEWIS: I agree with her and having poise and taking it one minute at a
time.  
  
JEFF MITTIE: You know, the one thing -- one of the things that in terms of
when you already played 18 games and now you go a third time against people, I
think we have the toughest league in the country in regards to the schedule. I
do think that prepares you for the NCAA Tournament. There isn't anything this
team hasn't seen. There isn't anything we haven't experienced. We've got a
good veteran group. I expect our leadership to be strong in that locker room
leaving here. I think we will get back and have a good week of practice and
see where we're going. When we went at the start of the year one of the
slogans was to leave no doubt. Last year we sat on Selection Show and we
weren't sure that name was going to show up there. We thought it was, but
until it came up we didn't know and this year we know that our name is going
to show up there. We feel good about that. We feel good about having a solid
season, and now let's see if we can make a run in the postseason.  
  
Q. Coach, from the time you've taken on the job at Kansas State up until
now how much closer has the gap closed and made the Big 12 Women's Tournament
and the league more competitive than it was when you first took the job? And
how many teams do you think will make the NCAA?  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, I said yesterday I felt like Iowa State was an NCAA
Tournament team. The way West Virginia played those were the two teams that
came in that were kind of on that "bubble" as some of the experts say.  
  
But the way West Virginia looked last night I don't think there is any doubt
that there's an NCAA Tournament team and they're still playing in this. I
think we're going to get six in. I think Baylor is set up for that second seed
nationally, but they obviously still have work to do here with making it to
the championship game for tomorrow.  
  
So I expect that the league is going to be represented very well. I felt like
the league overall this year that the bottom was better and there was more
offensive talent in this league which made a lot of nights very, very
difficult. So I hope I answered your question, but right now I think the
league sits pretty strong for six.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a good season. Best of luck in the NCAAs.

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Tynice Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30434)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 62  
  
Texas - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the West Virginia Mountaineers, Coach Mike
Carey and Tynice Martin his student-athlete. Coach, congratulations on the win
and your thoughts about today's game?  
  
MIKE CAREY: Give credit to Texas. Man, they come right at us, beginning of the
game. We weren't ready for that quickness in the beginning of the game and
then we kinda settled down in the second quarter. Then they came right back at
us the third quarter and then we settled down a little bit. Give our players a
lot of credit, too. They're playing a lot of minutes and that last five
minutes we kept talking about you've got to have heart. Who wants it more? Who
wants it more? Both teams played hard, and we're really happy to get the win.  
  
Q. Mike, I don't know what your status was entering the weekend as far
as the NCAAs go, but I would think two wins here, you're in. Can you say, one,
what you thought your status was before the tournament and if you were in and
what now?  
MIKE CAREY: We felt we had to win a game or maybe two. We didn't know. You
never know. We put ourselves in this position during the year, so we knew we
was going to have to come and win a game or two in the tournament and
fortunate enough we have been able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, some people might ask how come you guys weren't this good
during the regular season?  
MIKE CAREY: I would like to ask that, too. Tynice?  
  
TYNICE MARTIN: I don't know, Coach.  
  
MIKE CAREY: That's a good question. I've been trying to figure that out all
year. To our girls' credit, they kept battling and we kept struggling,
especially the fourth quarter during the season. We would be close and all at
once we would get in foul trouble, and I want to give a lot of credit to Anja
Martin the first quarter, came out and gave us quality minutes especially
defensively and we got a little bit off our bench. But I don't have that
answer. If I knew that answer I probably wouldn't be here.  
  
Q. Coach, to expound on that, today your bench was able to get some
things done when you needed them, especially late when you all needed to make
defensive stops especially around that last media timeout.  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, they come in -- you know, I tell our players off the bench,
you come in and you play defense, don't turn it over. You're going to get a
lot of minutes. We're not looking for our bench to come in and get a lot of
points, just come in, give some people some rest, the harder you play
defensively and don't turn the ball over the more minutes you'll get. I
thought they did a good job.  
  
Also down the stretch we was trying to get Teana Muldrow involved in the
scoring and she hit a big three and started scoring a little bit. Already if
you look, I don't think Lanay, our center, had any points. So we needed to get
another score, Tynice, we needed a couple of others to start scoring because
she was getting more down a little bit.  
  
Q. Tynice, you've looked completely locked in this whole tournament.
What's been the difference for you?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Just knowing where we want to go as a team. When we came down
here our goal was to win the championship, so we had to take that game by
game. And I feel like the energy that we brought to the tournament it led us
to today. We've been playing good, especially defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys will now face the Baylor Lady Bears, played them
close in Waco at the Ferrell Center. What is it going to take you guys to et
go the win tomorrow?  
MIKE CAREY: The same effort. The game is going to be won in the paint. We know
that, so if we don't defend in the paint, stop dribble penetration and keep
them off the offensive boards it's going to be a long game. We understand
where the game is going to be won. It's going to be won in the paint. They got
great players. Make no doubt about it, and they just keep coming in with post
players. They got a great team. We'll come out, we'll fight and see what
happens.  
  
Q. Brooke McCarty, Big 12 Player of the Year, only 12 points tonight,
what was your idea going into the game and how to defend?  
MIKE CAREY: We was going to gap a lot of the guards and stay out on her. We're
up 4 the last person we wanted to take that shot was her. She got two off.
That's unbelievable. You want to know why we struggled sometimes during the
year? That's the last person we said, do not let her have a look. We gave her
two of 'em. I don't know. I got a question, are you the only two from West
Virginia here?  
  
Q. We're the only college radio station here.  
MIKE CAREY: You know what? This happened to me one other time when we were in
the Big East, and I don't want to mention Big East, but I will. Everyone
thought we were going to come down here to lose. We had no media. I only
brought one suit to be honest with you. So I had to keep washing shirts down
there because we won the championship game against Connecticut. Isn't that
amazing? We're in the Big 12, and none of the media comes. We appreciate you
coming out.  
  
Q. We appreciate you, too, Coach.  
Q. Tynice, the shot you took, the 3-pointer right when the clock was
going down, did you know where he were and was that just a moment you just
said, okay, not so much my time, but somebody has to get something done and
we've got to move forward?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Of course. Well, you know, the shot clock was running down, so
I really had no choice but to shoot it. So I shot it with confidence and
luckily it went in.  
  
Q. Mike, did you bring more than one shirt this time? Second, is part of
the motivating factor you guys are the farthest school away in the Big 12 and
a lot of the conference is concentrated here so sometimes you guys are viewed
as outsiders. Does that motivate your team?  
MIKE CAREY: I don't think. What motivated us was to get some wins to get to
the NCAA. To answer your first question, I only brought two suits. But I did
bring three shirts, so at least I don't have to go to the cleaners tonight.  
  
Q. Tynice, I was watching you play tonight and I thought you had the eye
of the tiger in you. Every time you made a shot you were just boisterous and
trying to get the rest of your team up. Was it a case in your mind that you
guys may have wanted it more because, one, you needed it more and you tell
me.  
TYNICE MARTIN: That's how we came down here. The first game we had high
energy. This game we had high energy. It was a close game all game and we
played it down to the wire.  
  
We already knew that in order to win this game we had to get defensive stops,
you know, and we had to -- we just had to shut people down and that's what we
did. Free throws, I feel like we did everything we needed to win this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the win. Thank you.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 62  
  
Texas - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Karen Aston and
her two student-athletes, Ariel Atkins and Kelsey Lang. Coach, your thoughts
about this evening's game?  
  
KAREN ASTON: I think first of all you have to, as disappointed as I am, I
don't want to discredit how hungry West Virginia played tonight. They, I
thought, played incredibly well yesterday. Looked like a team that probably
was on the bubble and was really, really hungry to prove themselves in a lot
of ways. I thought they played tremendous yesterday and played a lot tougher
than we did today.  
  
It was a struggle for both teams offensively, and when it got right down to
it, I thought in a lot of ways they outcompeted us and that's disappointing
for us, disappointing just in the sense of you never want to look at a
situation and say that you got outcompeted, and I thought we did today. I
thought when it came down to loose balls, getting stops, being mentally tough
enough to finish shots when you need to finish 'em. We didn't do that and they
did. So, again, lots of credit to them on their performance.  
  
Q. Coach, after the second quarter it looked like very low energy out
there, second quarter. Adjustments at halftime were they more X's and O's or
were they more mental, emotional, get up and get at 'em?  
KAREN ASTON: It was a little bit of both. Statistically uncharacteristic of
the way that we normally play. We had one assist and 10 turn overs. That's the
sign of a team that's trying to do too much individually, not much of a team.
And that's more of what we talked about at half was just try to get back to
sharing the basketball, reversing it, trying to break their defense down by
reversing it. I thought we did a better job of that in the second half.  
  
But you're absolutely right in bringing up the second quarter and the first
half in particular. I thought after the first 6 minutes of the first half we
completely got out of who we are. That's a problem. That's a problem that we
need to address.  
  
Q. Coach, today you made some adjustments in game situations of
attempting to get your bench more involved. Were you happy, satisfied? What
transpired with that situation today?  
KAREN ASTON: I thought our bench was probably the difference in the game
yesterday. I mean, we just -- I don't want to say they were nonproductive or
productive, not too many people were productive today, including myself. So it
wasn't really a bench problem. We got in some foul trouble, but we were 0-10
in the paint in the first half. We missed a lot of chippies in the second half
down the stretch.  
  
So a lot of focus I think more than anything, mental toughness of finishing a
round when you are in traffic, loose balls, those kinds of things. I wouldn't
point out the bench being significant negatively or positively tonight. They
were positive last night, but I thought Audrey was pretty good off the bench
and that was about it.  
  
Q. Ariel, when you hear "outcompeted" I know how big of a competitor you
are, how badly does that make you feel that you may have lost a game because
you were outcompeted?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Terrible and disappointed. It was my job as one of the leaders
of this team to make sure we show up every day, so I'll take that.  
  
Q. Kelsey, same question.  
KELSEY LANG: I agree with Ariel. Being a leader of the team I think that falls
on us first, and, you know, we set the example not only in the games but in
practice; and I think that we didn't do that today.  
  
Q. Coach, where do you think you stand next week?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I said before the tournament started that I thought that
our body of work was good enough that we had put ourselves in a position to
host, and I do still feel that way. I didn't think that there would be a whole
lot that would change our seeding, other than if we didn't win yesterday. I
think that might have hurt us. I think West Virginia is clearly an NCAA
Tournament team. They've proven that this week. We need to get home and
regroup a little bit, catch our breath in a sense and refocus on how we
prepared and what we did in the stretch that we won 19 games in a row. That
would be my message to our team right now, not negatively.  
  
But what did you do? What did we look like when we won 19 games in a row? And
what have we looked like the last two weeks, and how can we change that? I
think that's a challenge for our team in the next however many days, 10 days
or so before we get ready for the NCAA Tournament. I mean, I'm proud of this
team. I don't want to act like I'm not. You always feel bad when you feel like
you got outcompeted and when you just didn't feel like you did your job as a
coach or as a player, I know it is disappointing.  
  
But as these two said, we have a young basketball team and some of the peaks
and the valleys of this season has been from our immaturity, and it's up to
the mature players and the mature coaches to lead better, and that ultimately
falls on me. We will be ready and be better for the tournament when it gets
going.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about two things: One, the 19-game run. Also the
conference's chances of getting multiple teams into the tournament; and, if
you can, how many?  
KAREN ASTON: Regarding the 19-game run, I mean I -- it's been a terrific
season just from the standpoint of watching this team grow. I said it probably
the first day I saw them practice that I really enjoy them. They're a fun-
loving team, but they do stay on a roller coaster a bit with how they prepare
and how serious they are about what they're doing and we have to grow up a
little bit and continue to grow. During that 19-game win streak I thought that
they were real locked into listening to the leaders and trying to get better
every day in practice.  
  
That's kinda what I remember about that process of that win streak was just
that every day they took one day at a time and they didn't look ahead to
anything and I think that late in the season we've gotten caught looking
ahead. That's the best way I can describe it.  
  
As far as our league is concerned I think I said it way back probably a month
ago that I thought our league was better than people were giving it credit
for. I do think that we should get six teams in. I do think West Virginia
should get in. I think Iowa State has proven themselves late in the year, and
I think there's the rest of us that think we're in. But obviously that's up to
the committee. But that's what I think about the league.  
  
It's really challenging and it's competitive and I think that all the teams
that I've mentioned deserve a spot in the NCAA Tournament, absolutely.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. Ladies, good luck in
the NCAAs.

### [Candi Whitaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30407)

### [Recee' Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32709)

### [Arella Guirantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32722)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 95  
  
Texas Tech - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're now joined by the Texas Tech Lady Raiders, Coach
Candi Whitaker and her two student-athletes, Receé Caldwell and Arella
Guirantes. Coach?  
  
CANDI WHITAKER: Obviously, Baylor is very deep, very tough, very talented
team. But I'm proud of our kids that they battled, had a great second quarter,
tried to keep us alive. We knew we had to make a lot of threes and I thought
we had a lot of players play fearless the at times trying to put it all out
there and win the game. Battled for a while and Baylor does what Baylor does.
Did I say that right? Anyway, they're good.  
  
Q. Y'all were able to cut it down 6, 7 points there, after the 3-point
shooting. What was going right for y'all to open y'all up to get y'all that
momentum going?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: Coach Whitaker and Larryn did a great job calling our horn
stuff and I think it makes for good spacing and Larryn got me involved in the
game and we started doing some drives and kicks and the floor just really
opened up.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen the last three Baylor teams. They've all fallen
short of the Final Four when everyone thought they were really, really good.
Is there anything about this team that makes you think they have Final Four
potential? Anything different from the three years past?  
CANDI WHITAKER: I think that this Baylor team is as talented as anyone in the
country. They have more depth in the post than anyone in the country. I
thought they were equally good last year. Maybe they have more depth this year
in the post. In the tournament it's about doing what you do best, and showing
up every day. I think if they do that, they have as good of a chance as
anyone.  
  
Q. After that barrage and Baylor started to pull away what did they
change to pull away from y'all and take moment back?  
ARELLA GUIRANTES: I think they just got more aggressive and stuck to what they
know. They try to get in the post, Nina Davis kept answering back and they
just stayed aggressive and didn't fall to our runs.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you said you had to have a hot shooting night to
beat Baylor. Seemed like you got there, but seemed like other aspects they
were able to take control of the game. What were the key aspects in how they
were able to beat you today?  
CANDI WHITAKER: Well, I think you look at the percentages, right, 45% in the
first quarter, 52, then we dropped to 35 and 26, so one is that we stopped
scoring with them to remain in the game. You look at their rebounds they just
-- they're really big. We're boxing and it doesn't matter. Then I think you
throw in Alexis Prince and Wallace making shots and there's no weaknesses in
their game. You look at their lineup how do you combat it? You must shoot the
ball extremely well to beat Baylor unless you have the size inside to battle
with them. You're going to have to shoot it from the arc and make 15-plus
threes to stay in the game. It's just what it is when you play Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, regardless of the scoreboard, what was the effort that you saw
today compared to last week? How much more of an effort do you think the girls
played with today?  
CANDI WHITAKER: I thought they played with a lot more effort, at times,
defensively. I thought we played for fearless, more courage to step up and
take shots. The shots that Receé took in the second quarter I think took a lot
of courage. She didn't have much space or time but she knew for us to stay in
the game she knew she had to make big plays. Arella, they were giving her the
three and that's not part of her game, but it took courage for her in the
third quarter to step up and hit those three 3s. So definitely proud of how
our kids fought and I think they have learned a lot this year being on the
road. You have to show up and you have to play with a great deal of energy
regardless if you're home or away and toward the end of the season I thought
you started to see that.  
  
Q. You mentioned it, Coach, but what kind of improvements did you see
from the beginning of conference play until now?  
CANDI WHITAKER: You know, our season was a little bit of a roller coaster as
far as up and down. We were pretty good at home and we struggled on the road.
I've said this a lot, we had six new players that had never been through this
league so there were a lot of question marks going into the season. We knew we
were much more talented and we had more size but what that equates to in the
Big 12 you don't know until you're in the Big 12. I think our players learned
a lot. They're talented young women. They all have things to work on and they
all have great things they bring to our program.  
  
This season was really a matter of just a learning process more than anything,
but I think you saw that through the season, kind of fall down, get back up,
learn, play well, know what that feels like, you know, and just kind of
finding our way through the Big 12 season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're going to let you guys go. Thank you very much. Have
a safe trip home.

Texas Tech - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our Baylor Lady Bears, Coach Kim Mulkey and
her two student-athletes, Alexis Prince and Nina Davis. As usual, Coach said
she would not do an opening statement so we will go directly to questions.  
  
Q. Alexis, Kalani had 6 points right off the bat in the game and then
they started sagging in on her a little bit. How important is it for you guys
to knock town those open shots from the perimeter when they start doing
that?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It's important so Kalani can get touches in there and open the
paint a little bit. They were stating to clog it, so it was hard to get her
the ball. So it was important that we start out hot.  
  
Q. Nina, I think three of you had double-doubles and Kristy got close to
a triple-double. Was it jus the flow of the game that opened everything up?
And you absolutely crushed them on the board, did you know that going in?  
NINA DAVIS: We just wanted to start the game off aggressive. We wanted to
start the game off quickly. We didn't want to come out and get behind or play
around with them. We were aware that they had a game last night. We didn't
have to play. So we just wanted to come out and play hard and this is just a
team with a lot of depth. We have a lot of balance and we have people that
step up different nights and rescore and rebounds is something we've always
been good at.  
  
Q. Nina, when they caught fire from 3-point land, late second quarter,
maybe a little bit in the third, were y'all starting to sweat it a little bit?
What was the mindset?  
NINA DAVIS: Just keep playing hard. We knew coming in that Caldwell was a
great shooter. She puts up a lot of shots and she makes a lot of shots, and I
think Brooks made a hit, too. But we've been playing all year round. We have
dealt with teams. So we have too stick together, figure out what we're doing
wrong and weather the storm.  
  
Q. Alexis, I think career high against Oklahoma Monday, 22 I believe
today. I know what you're having to make up for some of the last points of
Alexis Jones, but why now? I know you've had a heck of a year, but why now?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Just trying to help me team any way I can so if I need to score
I will score, if I need to defend I will defend, whatever, just trying to play
hard every game.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Let me say this about Prince: She has been playing like that for a
couple weeks now. And it's so good to see, a kid that has come through what
she has come through with her injuries but she can tell you this. Her dad is
here for the first time every to play in her life. That's the story.  
  
Q. Kim, I was going to ask you about the week you've had and the things
off the court that you've had to manage. People I think it's safe to say long
to you as the most influential coach on your campus and I would wager a good
guess you are the most influential woman at Baylor University. Do you see how
people are going to look to you moving forward to speak on behalf of how
things are being handled by your university and how important you are in the
public eye because of your unique place at that school?  
KIM MULKEY: Sometimes you don't realize -- I don't view myself that way. I'm
just -- I don't like attention. I don't like that stuff, so I don't view
myself that way. But, yes, I can see now how people do view me. If you saw my
last press conference, guys, I said I was sorry about the timing was one of
the things I was sorry about. So I'm going to answer you like this: It's about
these kids right now. All you can do is say you're sorry and move on.  
  
What a story. Her father has never seen her play basketball in her life! He
comes in and gets to watch her this weekend. I've never met him, can't wait to
leave here and go meet him.  
  
Q. So Alexis what did that mean to you to have your dad here?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It means a lot to see that he was able to come down. In the
past it was hard for him to figure out a time to come down but I'm just happy
that he's here now.  
  
Q. Kim, I did see your interview -- your press conference Thursday and
I'm aware of what you did say on Senior Day. I want you to clarify if this is
accurate on my reading. Seems like you're having to fight your urge to defend
your institution, which I understand completely. You've been there a long time
and have had an enormous impact at Baylor. You're fighting the urge to do that
with the need to be compassionate toward the victims at the university. Is
that a fair way to characterize what you're going through right now?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that I'm going through anything. I said something in
the emotion of the moment. I love Baylor University. I don't know details. I
don't know how the media knows details. Y'all seem to know more than I know.
All I do is go to work, recruit, love my two kids, my son-in-law, love these
kids, graduate these kids and know that I love that place.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. We're going to let you guys go. Congratulations on
your win and we will see you tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Eternati Willock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32719)

### [Kayla Goth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32720)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
K-State - 74  
  
Iowa State - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the K-State Wildcats, Coach Jeff Mittie and
his two student-athletes, Kayla Goth and Eternati Willock. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game? Congratulations.  
  
JEFF MITTIE: Thank you. Well, I think it's what everybody expected of this
game. Two quality teams going at it, a 4-5 game going at it in this tournament
should be this type of game, back and forth, ties, lead changes, all those
things.  
  
I think for us it was certainly a struggle early on. We couldn't make anything
early. We didn't have very good rhythm. Iowa State, that's their system. They
force you into taking open jump shots and I think we were 1 of 10 at one point
to start. I was proud of our group. Goth gave us a huge lift. She was the one
that opened up the basket for everybody and everybody relaxed, and I thought
our rebounding got better as the game went on. That was critical.  
  
But this game didn't have anything that I didn't expect. We had to fight
through a lot of adversity today with our foul trouble issues, with Lewis in
foul trouble, with players not playing good. Our bench was critical in this
game and our bench played very well today.  
  
Q. Third quarter, you hit 5 of 5 3's, at a point where Iowa State was I
think at about 0-9 or 0-10 funk. Did you guys sense that opening? That was a
good time to hit some threes and create separation?  
KAYLA GOTH: I thought for sure it was a great time to do that. When another
team is struggling, it's time to go! We looked up at the scoreboard and it was
a tight game at that point and we wanted to stretch it out there a little bit.  
  
ETERNATI WILLOCK: Definitely our seniors were emphasizing that we wanted to
push and separate at that time, so we wanted to go out there and got some
stops and create some opportunities for us on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Kayla, what was working for you tonight?  
KAYLA GOTH: A little bit of everything. I kinda tried to start with my
defense. I've always been a defense first player, so if I can get steals and
stuff on that end of the floor I can usually contribute to my offensive game.
But just going out there and shooting the ball with offense. We knew they were
going to sag off of me, Shae, and a couple of other players. So coming in,
shooting the ball with confidence.  
  
Q. What were the keys to shutting down Iowa State defensively?  
ETERNATI WILLOCK: I would say one of their two best players, I would say
Buckley and Carleton, we had to stop them first and let the others score
because they're a great offensive team, and Durr hit some big shots. Keeping
those players to minimum points was our key and playing to their energy, I
guess.  
  
KAYLA GOTH: I would say we decided if they were going to beat us we didn't
want it to be by their best two players. So really shutting down those two and
rotating to the other shooters. Durr obviously had a big night, so rotating
hard to her and trying to get hart hits and close-outs there.  
  
Q. Coach, Lewis didn't score until tied at 56. She we want on a 6-0 run.
What do you think sparked her?  
JEFF MITTIE: Probably sitting on the bench a while. I don't have any grand
answer for that, but I wouldn't like sitting over there very long so she
probably got tired sitting on the bench, in foul trouble, a little bit of
frustration and she came back in and decided, you know, I'm going to do
something about it.  
  
I will say in that stretch we did have some ball movement that got her a weak
side seal. So we didn't intentionally put her away from the ball. They were
shoving her off, but ultimately we were doing that in some parts of the game
anyway, but in that stretch she was much more aggressive and much more
physical and our ball movement was pretty good in that stretch.  
  
The other thing I want to make a point of is people get asked this question
all the time about NCAA Tournament teams and all those things, but I feel very
strongly that Iowa State is an NCAA Tournament team and while they may not
listen to me, if the "eye test" is true and anybody has two good eyes, that's
an NCAA Tournament team. They have gone to Texas and won and there probably
isn't a bubble team out there that has a top-5 win on the road at a top-5 team
in the last month. So that was an NCAA Tournament game this morning that you
saw and I hope that they're certainly in there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Diana Omozee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32716)

### [Kaylee Jensen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30410)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 71  
  
Oklahoma State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls, Coach Littell
and his student-athletes, Diana Omozee and Kaylee Jensen. Coach, your thoughts
about tonight's game?  
  
JIM LITTELL: Well, I'm proud of our kids. They kept competing. Obviously Texas
has a great basketball team with great personnel and great depth. And great
teams like that when you make some mistakes, they exploit your mistakes and
they had 17 points off of our turnovers and 12 fast break points to 0 for us.
That's a big difference.  
  
Part of that comes from if you take a bad shot against 'em it just puts them
in a track meet. They're very good at getting it out and going especially when
your shot selection isn't good. I think we had probably six or seven
possessions like that that just got them out in a hurry and allowed them to
get easy baskets and they continually attack the glass, and we did a good job
for a while blocking 'em out. But I think they wear you down a little bit.
They're athleticism if you don't put a body on them we're not going to win
those 50-50 rebounds. Some good things out of our kids, some things to build
on, that's it.  
  
Q. Diana, we've been talking about it a little bit, but barring any
postseason play this was your last game. What was going through your mind as
time ticked out?  
DIANA OMOZEE: I just wanted to play hard for my teammates and my coaches and I
wanted to represent Oklahoma State well. That's mainly what was going through
my mind was just playing hard.  
  
Q. Kaylee, Coach mentioned that you are getting worn down on the boards
and you were outrebounded by 11. What was going on there in the second half?
Were you feeling worn down?  
KAYLEE JENSEN: A little bit. They sent a lot of big girls in through you. They
send in two or three big girls and I'm staying. So I try my best to push as
hard as I can, but sometimes it just kinda gets to you.  
  
Q. Diana, it's good to see you again. I covered you in high school.
Kaylee, the depth of Texas, 32-18 or 14 on bench points, is that what makes
them a cut above most teams, that they can rely on more than just one or two
or three people? People off the bench were actually coming in and making big
contributions.  
KAYLEE JENSEN: Yeah, that's, I think, where -- that's where they are above a
lot of teams is they don't have to rely on one or two other starters. They
know that if one of their starters comes out someone else can come in and
produce off the bench, and I think that's one of their strong points actually.
So they did a good job of doing that tonight.  
  
Q. We were talking about getting worn down. How does it affect you that
you guys played a game the night before?  
DIANA OMOZEE: It's tough, because you don't really have a chance to let all
your bruises and aches and stuff heel up. You don't have a chance to get in
and do rehab and therapy and stuff, but everybody has to do it. It's
tournament time. It's postseason play, so you just have to toughen up and this
is the point in the season where you see what people are really made of.  
  
KAYLEE JENSEN: Just pretty much what Diana said. You have to push through it.
You can't complain about it. You have to play the next game, so don't worry
about why you're hurting. Just play.  
  
Q. Coach, Texas was hitting all their shots pretty much in the first
quarter, but in the second quart you kind of locked them down. What was
working for you? The scout? What was going on?  
JIM LITTELL: We gave 'em a lot of easy baskets. We had a game plan to back off
a few of their people, but we let 'em get way too deep in transition and they
were shooting a lot of 10, 12-footers in the first quarter on us out of
transition. And we did a better job in the second half of containing that and
stopping transition a little bit. But some of the people that we wanted to
back off we just let 'em get all the way to the rim and let 'em get too deep,
and that wasn't the intent of the game plan. Second quarter I thought we did a
better job of getting back and forcing them to run a little more half-court
offense.  
  
Q. Kaylee, I was at your game in Austin and you had trouble putting the
ball in the basket and tonight 5 of 16. Is there anything in particular that
Texas does to you, whether it's personnel or scheme where it seems like you
have a harder time scoring?  
KAYLEE JENSEN: Honestly, I think it just -- and this is on myself, but I think
it just gets to me because they're longer than most other teams in the Big 12.
I think I try to maneuver too much around them instead of powering to the hoop
and that's just something I need to work on. But I don't think it's really
them in particular.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Take care. Good luck in the NCAAs.

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Seanna Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28383)

### [Emily Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32721)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
K-State - 74  
  
Iowa State - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State and with Coach Bill Fennelly,
his two student-athletes, Emily Durr and Seanna Johnson. Coach?  
  
BILL FENNELLY: First of all, on behalf of everyone at Iowa State I want to
thank Oklahoma City and the Big 12. It's an amazing event. Honored to be a
part of it. The class and the hospitality is incredible. It's an honor to be
here. As far as the game, I want to congratulate Kansas State. I thought they
played great. It's a very good team, very well-coached team, very deep team
and what bit us is the same thing that's bit us in the past. Couldn't get a
defensive rebound when we needed it, and obviously we missed a lot of shots.
That's to their credit. They're a great team, and we wish them the best.  
  
Q. Coach, you should know that Coach Jeff Mittie unsolicited gave you
quite an endorsement for the NCAA Tournament. As you stand right now, what do
you think are your chances?  
BILL FENNELLY: I wish Coach Mittie was on the committee. I would think our
chances are good. I'm not one that politics a lot for that stuff. Our kids
have played really hard. We've played well down the stretch. We're 9-9 in a
great league. We've had some huge wins, obviously the win at Texas late. No
really bad losses. I think if you compare us to other teams, I think we've
earned that but, again, that's a choice someone else will make.  
  
We'll be a long week waiting, but I hope this team gets that opportunity
because I do think they've earned it. I really do.  
  
Q. Coach, from your perspective what changed after the first quarter?  
BILL FENNELLY: Well, I think the first quarter we were pretty efficient
offensively. We made some shots. We were 7-34 at halftime, and I think they
did a great job off the bench.  
  
I think Kayla really hit some big shots. I thought we guarded the other ones
really well. I thought we had a good plan. You look at the numbers, I thought
we were good well and Eternati Willock made some big plays. But I think we're
down 12 and we tie the game. But that's the way these games go. You're in a
4-5 game in a great conference tournament, it only takes a couple of plays. We
had about a 3-minute stretch there where we could not get a defensive rebound
and couldn't make a shot and good teams make you pay for that, and they're a
very good team.  
  
Q. How were they able to keep Bridget from scoring today?  
BILL FENNELLY: They guarded her really hard and she was 2 for 11. You have
those nights. Similar game plan. They denied her the ball and did a good job
of preventing her from scoring. But, you know, she got 11 shots off. It just
wasn't her night. She is a great player and a great kid and that's the nature
of basketball. We wouldn't be where we are without her, but today just wasn't
a good day for her.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the great run your team had to end the
regular season?  
BILL FENNELLY: Very proud certainly -- I'm sorry, I'm looking into lights, I
don't mean to be rude. Sorry. I couldn't be more proud. I've had the honor to
coach at Iowa State, a long time, 22 years and I don't know that I've had a
team -- we've had a team that has been that engaged over -- we won five games
in thirteen days. We won 6 out of 7. Four of those games that we played were
on the road. Amazing, amazing perseverance by them and I will say this, and
I've said it many times: I have a great coaching staff and I don't think my
assistants could have done a better job.  
  
Between the effort of the players and the effort of our staff, we're sitting
here today even discussing NCAA Tournament win. February 1st we were just
trying to get this thing over with, so could not be more proud of them and
they've done a lot of things. Iowa State is a special place with a special
program, a special tradition and this team wrote a special story in my
opinion.  
  
Q. Neither team shot well today. How tough is it to game plan and
counter their game plan when you've seen the team two times already?  
BILL FENNELLY: It's hard, but you see what happens in -- number one, you can
control yourself. That's what we talked about with our team; and number two,
it's not a surprise that someone like Kayla Goth comes off the bench and gets
25 points. We got killed off the bench. This game for us is about making
shots, because we're be the going to turn you over and we are not going to
overpower you with our size. You've got to make the hard plays, get a
defensive rebound, you gotta make a key shot. And I thought our kids completed
as good as they could, but today K-State was just a better team. That's to
their credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, good luck. We hope you make the NCAAs.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Maddie Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30446)

### [Vionise Pierre-Louis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30412)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 82  
  
Oklahoma - 580  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Sherri Coale
and her two student-athletes, Vionise Pierre-Louis and Maddie Manning. Coach,
your thoughts about the game?  
  
SHERRI COALE: I've been coaching a long time, and I don't think that I've ever
had a team take the floor and appear to be as ill-prepared or as unmotivated
as we appeared tonight and it's hard to understand and I'm disappointed by it.
I want to publicly apologize to our fans and our administration because that
was not what the University of Oklahoma deserves. It is not the way our
institution should be represented. Ultimately, that's on me. It's on me and my
coaching staff. We have to find a way to reach our guys emotionally and
mentally to get them in a position to perform better than we did tonight.  
  
I want to give West Virginia credit. They were fantastic. They played with
great urgency. They played with great purpose. They played with great
intensity, and they're a very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, is there anything you can point to as to why you came out as
flat as you did?  
SHERRI COALE: No, if I could figure out why then I could correct it. My
coaching staff and I'll get back to work immediately and see if we can unlock
the formula, solve the riddle.  
  
Q. Sherri, even though you only scored 10 points in the opening quarter,
wasn't it on defense where it was frustrating? You couldn't stop 'em
tonight.  
SHERRI COALE: The very first defensive position of the game we did not adhere
to the scout and knew it was a problem right then. We were guarding in a
panicked sort of way, nobody doing their job on weak side and that eroded
trust and it went down the slippery slope really fast.  
  
West Virginia made some plays, too, and it was like we were getting buried
alive there. That's where you've got to have guys step up and remind one
another, stick to the game plan, what did we prepare on today? Let's make sure
we guard 'em in that way.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talked about before the game that your team wants it so
badly that sometimes that can be detrimental, maybe the will to win getting in
their head. Did that play a part tonight?  
SHERRI COALE: I don't know. I think you would have to ask players that. I
think obviously we want to win. I think everybody out there wants to win. The
more fun you have and the more you let loose the more success you have, and
the more success you have the longer you get to pay. So it seems like a very
logical cycle to me.  
  
Q. From a players' perspective, did you feel that overwhelming urgency
or too much that it was detrimental that you guys wanted to win too badly?  
MADDIE MANNING: I don't know that it's that either. The bottom line is we're
Division I basketball players. We need to perform.  
  
Q. When you came out and it started to go wrong, did you know you
weren't yourselves as quickly as Sherri mentioned, or did it feel like it was
okay and then all of a sudden you are down 12-0 and it all sort of crumbles?  
MADDIE MANNING: I thought we were going to get it. We missed a couple of
layups and I thought they were going to go in and things were going to change,
but you have to make a change and we didn't.  
  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: It was 12-0 and we didn't have no leadership. Nobody
stepped up and said, give me the ball or anything like that. It looked like we
were scared out there, like Coach said, and we're Division I athletes. We need
to be performing like that. We can't step on the court and it's automatically
12-0, and we have no leader stepping up. So lack of effort, lack of motivation
on our part.  
  
Q. Given what you just said, is this something the coaches can bring you
out of, or is this something you guys have to have a meeting of minds amongst
yourselves?  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: I feel like our coaches have done enough. They can't
spoon feed us every single time we have a bad game. We need to find that
amongst ourselves, dig down, figure that out. We can't have that type of
mentality going into the Big 12 Tournament.  
  
Q. You guys are coming off back-to-back 20-point losses going into the
tournament. How do you as a coach get your players back on track, and how do
you guys as players get back on track before the tournament?  
SHERRI COALE: We didn't win 22 games this year by accident. So we'll take this
time in the next two weeks and find a way. If I had an exact answer for you
then we wouldn't be having this conversation right now, but we will figure it
out. That's what we're paid to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck in the NCAAs.

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Teana Muldrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28380)

### [Tynice Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30434)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 82  
  
Oklahoma - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the West Virginia Mountaineers, Coach Mike
Carey and his two student-athletes, Tynice Martin and Teana Muldrow. Coach,
congratulations and your thoughts on the game?  
  
MIKE CAREY: We come out ready to play. I knew we was going to be ready to
play. Our shootaround today earlier was probably the best shootaround we had
all year. They were focused, a lot of energy. In fact I had to cut it down
because they were going too hard, so we just cut things down. The other thing
I thought was great is out of 33 field goals we had 20 assists and that means
we were moving the ball and against their traps. 1-3-1 that's what you had to
do, so I thought the players did a great job of doing that.  
  
Q. Mike, you really took control of this game early, didn't you, 26-10
in the first quarter, of course you didn't let off the gas at all, you have to
be proud of your team that they never let up.  
MIKE CAREY: Oh, very proud. That's something we've talked about all year. We
would get leads and then give up the leads and I thought second half we got in
foul trouble again a little bit with Lanay, and I thought Des came in and did
a good job. I thought it was a total team effort and our players at every
timeout up 30 I kept reminding them we've got to continue to play hard, play
hard, play hard because they're going to dribble/drive us.  
  
Q. Coach Carey, you guys shot twenty 3s, 45% from 3, did you come into
the game knowing you were going to shoot the ball well against Oklahoma?  
MIKE CAREY: We took what they gave us, them trapping and once we reversed the
ball we had a lot of open looks. You never know what's going to be open, maybe
the drive open, high-low, or maybe they're not going to guard the three. And
they chose to sag on Lanay and Teana and we were able to hit some shots, which
was big for us.  
  
Q. You were able to hold or the or the to two assists and she leads the
Big 12 in assist-to-turnover ratio. What did you do to make her uncomfortable
throughout the game?  
MIKE CAREY: They have a bunch of good shooters. Oklahoma has a really good
team. They just didn't play well, so let's give them credit. And we played
pretty well. We've had those days, too. The shoe was on the other foot, so I
totally understand that. I hope they do great in the NCAA Tournament because
they're a lock for the NCAA Tournament. Give these two credit. They're going
to try to take Tynice Martin out of the game, but she still got a lot of good
looks and the players rotated the ball and when Teana plays well we play well
as a team, because she can hit the three. She can guard a 5. She can guard a
guard, and she is that versatile where we can use her unanimous different
positions, so it's important that she stays out of foul trouble for us.  
  
Q. Tynice, do you love playing against Oklahoma? You must. You've scored
like 700 points against them. Tonight you had 21, but what is it about you and
Oklahoma and your match-ups there that seems to favor you?  
TYNICE MARTIN: I don't know. We started on defense today and we just kept it
going. We kept our foot on the pedal and that's pretty much it. I didn't know
that I was going to shoot well tonight. I didn't know how I was going to play,
but I kept my energy high along with the team and, you know, we played well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll see you tomorrow.

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

### [Lashann Higgs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30859)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 71  
  
Oklahoma State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Karen Aston
along with student-athletes Lashann Higgs and Brooke McCarty. Coach,
congratulations on the win and your thoughts?  
  
KAREN ASTON: Thank you. I think the first game is always difficult to play,
especially if you play a team that had gotten their feet wet last night. I was
pleased with the way we started. Sometimes we have a tendency if we start
really, really fast to let our guard down a little bit and I thought we did
that, but I also thought that we had really good contributions from our bench
down the line. We had nine or ten people score and lots of good energy off the
bench in particular in the first half when Kelsey was in foul trouble. Then I
thought she got involved in the second half and it made a difference for us.
Good team win for us. We're excited to still be playing.  
  
Q. Coach just mentioned how good the bench played and I think it was
32-18. How critical is the bench especially until a tournament situation where
you're going to be playing back-to-back games and maybe even Monday? How
crucial is the bench play in a situation like this?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I think that it's very critical that the bench players
contribute because you never know who may get in foul trouble or what starter
might need a breather, so just got to be ready when our numbers are called.  
  
Q. Coach, you went on a 15-0 run there in the third quarter. Who was
working for you coming out of the gate after halftime?  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, we didn't play yesterday so you have to give our
team a little bit of credit for probably having a little more energy and a
little more legs today which is the benefit, obviously, of getting the bye.  
  
Second thing, I mentioned just a few minutes ago, is that Kelsey got back
involved and I thought we made a good effort to try to get her the ball early,
and she is a big part of our team and obviously our offense. We seemed to have
a better flow and we limited our fouls.  
  
We had a period of time there in the second quarter where we fouled too much.
It slowed the game down and we got some stops and got out in transition.  
  
Q. Brooke, pretty good week for you with all the individual attention,
but how difficult or was it difficult for you to come out here, one, just to
prove what everybody has been saying how great you are, and is that extra
pressure for you?  
BROOKE McCARTY: No, I don't think so. I think it's about the team. So the
individual awards are pretty great, but at the same time I couldn't do it
without my team and we couldn't do it without each other. So I think just
staying in tune with my team and coming to practice every day and working
hard. I think it was easy.  
  
Q. Coach, did you see something yesterday watching Oklahoma State that
you felt you could take advantage of, and did that work out?  
KAREN ASTON: Honestly, no, because we've gotten to the point where we really
don't quite every know how people are going to play us. So for us to go back
to the hotel and really start to analyze what it is we can attack, you can't
almost decide that for our team until we get into a game because we're not
every quite sure how we're going to be defended. I thought our players did a
good job of adjusting because we didn't talk as much about what we would do
against a man.  
  
I thought early Brooke got some penetration and we got some good looks early
offensively and that gave us some confidence, but I think we could have done a
better job and we just talked about it because we were anxious tonight. We
shot a little quick, and I think had we been a little more patient we would
have gotten better looks.  
  
But I thought we did a pretty good job of adjusting. But as far as your
question, I didn't see something last night that we thought we would attack.
We saw some situations in the game where we were able to post up some guards
and do some different things like that that I thought we executed pretty well.  
  
Q. Brooke, you didn't have any assists at halftime and finished with 4.
What did you adjust in your game? Do you always drink chocolate milk after
games?  
BROOKE McCARTY: At halftime Coach preached penetration, and so when we
penetrated to the middle of the floor the posts were wide open. So it was easy
to make that extra pass; and, yeah, it's kind of recovery.  
  
Q. Coach, Jensen got her points, but 5 of 16, if I remember in Austin
she was almost 0-10 at one point. How pleased are you with your frontcourt
defense and anyone in particular that was active that made it tough on her?  
KAREN ASTON: I actually thought -- they're probably surprised I would say this
because I'm on them all the time, but I thought collectively we were better,
in particular better than we were in Stillwater. I thought they attacked us in
some different ways in Stillwater than they did at home, and we made some
pretty good adjustments to that. Kelsey helped up in the second half kind of
stabilize our defense on Jensen. I thought the best job we did was on Mandy
Coleman because that was the adjustment to the last time we played them. Mandy
Coleman hurt us pretty bad. We relaxed and let Jones come in and didn't really
recognize what her strengths were, and we'll talk about that.  
  
But I did think that we talked at length about not letting Kaylee Jensen and
Mandy Coleman have big nights, and I thought we did a much better job on
Coleman.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is the bench in a tournament situation where you
play back-to-back, maybe even three games in three days? People like Lashann
and Hosey actually had a great game today as well?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it's important for two reasons, and Lashann hit on both
of them. One of them is that we tend to always have someone that manages to
get in foul trouble and I think our team recognizes that. Our players stay
ready. They work in practice like they have an expectation to play.  
  
I think it better prepares them. We coach 'em like we expect them to play in
practice. So I think it helps them to prepare to be ready; and then you're
right, if you have to play two and possibly or hopefully three then you better
have some other people ready to play.  
  
I think we do have several. I thought Shug was really good tonight. She was
aggressive. Jordan was good. You could go down the line. Audrey had a good
night for us. So lots of contributions from those guys coming off the bench.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we will see you tomorrow. Congratulations on the
win.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Brandon Schneider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28904)

### [Jada Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32717)

### [Jessica Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32718)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma State - 79  
  
Kansas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Brandon
Schneider and his two student-athletes, Jessica Washington and Jada Brown.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: I thought our team showed a lot of fight down the stretch.
Unfortunately, Oklahoma State, give them credit was dominant on the glass. You
can't get outrebounded by 29 and expect to win a game. I also think that you
expect Jensen and Mandy Coleman who have been terrific players all year long.
But I would also credit Diana Omozee being an out standing player for them
tonight and really being a difference maker.  
  
Q. Coach, you had 0 wins last year and you were more competitive this
season. How do you think your team improved throughout the year and how do you
see next season going?  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: There is still a lot of unanswered questions for us in
terms of next year because we've signed three players, but we have three open
scholarships and plan to add as many as six new players to our team. I thought
we took some steps forward defensively. We had a bunch of freshmen that played
last year and they all improved, and I think obviously we were excited about
the year that Jess had, being Newcomer of the Year, it's the first major award
winner we've had since 1997.  
  
Q. Jessica, you went 4 for 17 tonight. What was different? What did you
see that was different?  
JESSICA WASHINGTON: Some nights are going to be your off nights and some are
going to be your on. I'm a competitive player, and with my team behind me it
really doesn't matter. They fought back down the stretch, and if I was 10-17,
15-17, 4-17, it doesn't really matter. My team is always behind me and they're
never going to give up.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Diana Omozee going off against you guys a little
bit. What do you think she did guarding Jessica as well?  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: Well, I think when she was on Jess you have a tremendous
athlete who also has length and I thought that Jessica was aggressive, but
there were a lot of shots that Omozee did a really good job of challenging and
turning routine shots that Jess normally gets into tougher looks.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the message going into the fourth quarter that
sparked that 12-0 run in a two-minute span?  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: We preached rebounding in every timeout, but we felt like
we were still in the game and there's been numerous times this year where we
have been able to mount some comebacks with the press and felt like getting to
the free throw line was going to be critical in that stretch as well.  
  
Q. Jada, then Jessica, how have you seen your team grow this season?  
JADA BROWN: Like he said, we had a young team last year, so I've seen growth
in them on and off the court, and I think with more pride and defensively
going into this season we knew if we could be a good defensive team that would
give us momentum for offense. I've seen my teammates learn a lot of
accountability on defense and taking pride in that more than anything else.  
  
JESSICA WASHINGTON: I agree with Jada. Everybody has grown on and off the
court. We did a great job of building our team culture and I don't think
anybody could say that we ever give up. We always are going to play hard and
our team chemistry is going to continue to build.  
  
Q. Jada, so Mandy and Kaylee, they had a lot of rebounds tonight. What
was the challenge down there for you?  
JADA BROWN: I've always been an undersized in this league playing for the Big
12. They are very strong. Solid bodies. A lot of people think they're big, but
they're mobile bigs. So it will push them back and get the rebound. I would
probably say the weight difference makes it a little bit tougher.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks folks.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Kaylee Jensen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30410)

### [Diana Omozee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32716)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma State - 79  
  
Kansas - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls, Coach and his
two student-athletes, Diana Omozee and Kaylee Jensen. Coach?  
  
JIM LITTELL: Really proud of our group for being very resilient. We made some
adjustments at halftime on some dribble handoffs and ball screens that made a
huge difference in the ball game.  
  
Stepped up and hit some big free throws at the end. Feel a little better about
it if we don't blow a 12, 14-point lead in about a two-minute span. But we
continue to find ways to make plays.  
  
Kaylee Jensen, thought she was really good for us tonight. Probably didn't get
her enough touches on the box, but I think their pressure kind of feeds into
that.  
  
Diana Omozee on the right played the best game of her career, here, scored 21
and she was able to break 'em down a little bit. They get up underneath you
and force you to put the ball on the floor.  
  
With them it's kind of you can't make plays because they're going to take you
out of it. You can't run plays you've for the to run plays, and I thought
Diana made plays. Mandy Coleman was huge. Jessica Washington is a handful and
Kylee Kopatich is a really good kid, as well. Proud of our kids and their
ability to make plays there down toward the end.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned going into this game that you wanted them to
have focus. Do you think they were focused tonight?  
JIM LITTELL: I thought we were focused and came out and played pretty well,
especially late third quarter, early fourth quarter and got a little sloppy
with the basketball and that allowed them to come back. But it's a real tough
match-up for us on Jessica Washington, and you know you look at the end of the
night she had 18. I can live with that and I thought we did a pretty good job
on her. Sent her to the free throw line too many times.  
  
I thought our focus was good. The excitement to play in the game was good.
Sometimes we've had a lot of ups and downs. I'm proud of our kids. We've
played well recently if you throw the Iowa State game out, the last five or
six games we've played really well.  
  
Q. Diana, the clock was running down and you threw it up there and it
went in. What was going through your mind?  
DIANA OMOZEE: I just heard the bench counting down and I was looking for
somebody to pass it to and nobody was hope, so I tried my best Jordan, Kobe
impersonation with the fade away.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys usually have a rebounding advantage. Tonight it was
at least double what Kansas had. What do you attribute that rebounding success
to?  
JIM LITTELL: We talked about that, and when we've been successful and won
games, we always do a good job on the offensive boards. It's a goal of ours to
get between 18 and 20 offensive rebounds a night. I thought Kaylee in
particular was very aggressive on the boards and Di to get 5 offensive
rebounds on the board is just huge to get that type of production.  
  
We haven't always shot well this year and it's a chance for us to get second
chance points. Our players knew we had to focus on that, and I thought they
did a real good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, 28 fouls for Kansas, 23 fouls for Oklahoma State, yet you shot
38 free throws to their 22. Big difference. You made more than they shot.  
JIM LITTELL: Well, that's what you hope for. We really didn't want to send
them to the free throw line 22 times and I would have liked to have made a
higher percentage out of the 38, but there was some key ones down there at the
end of the game where it took to two or three-possession games and I thought
we hit the big ones. Some players stepped up and wanted the ball and wanted to
go to the free throw line at the end of the game, and that's what you got to
have.  
  
Q. Kaylee, early in the game we could heard Coach screaming at you to
get inside and hold that position and seemed like that was especially true in
the second half. Talk about your game tonight?  
KAYLEE JENSEN: At first, I thought I wasn't doing my job and as you said he
kept yelling at me to get inside, so when I started to my teammates did a
great job of finding me on the open block or driving it, so that's what I have
to attribute my success to is how well they were able to find me after they
did penetrate on their person.  
  
Q. Diana, this being your senior season you have played well down the
stretch. Is this your best outing every?  
DIANA OMOZEE: Yes, I know my basketball career is coming to an end so I'm just
trying to leave everything on the court and just leave our fans with good
memories of me playing. That's my main focus.  
  
Q. Kaylee, you're now going to play a Texas team that's been hard to
figure out lately. Do you guys feel momentum? Do you think you are playing
them when they are a little vulnerable, maybe?  
KAYLEE JENSEN: I guess and coming off a good win it will help us a lot coming
into tomorrow. We just need to go into our game and stay focused and play for
each other and hopefully get that win.  
  
DIANA OMOZEE: I agree. We just are focused on playing as a team and doing what
we do and staying in -- everybody playing within themselves. So we're just
going to play hard and see what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts about Texas?  
JIM LITTELL: Very talented, and they played a tremendous schedule in the early
going. They ran through a little rough patch, but it still doesn't change that
they got incredible talent. They're very deep and that's why you play the
game. We're going into it with the idea that we're going to win the basketball
game, and, you know, we know -- we're very aware of how good they are and how
talented they are and how many high school All-Americans they are. They're
really, really good and we're going to have to play very well. But I have no
doubt that our group is going to play hard and compete.  
  
Q. Diana, what was your mind-set going into guarding Jessica Washington
in this game?  
DIANA OMOZEE: I knew I wanted to try to limit her touches and obviously
they're going to run her off screens and stuff, so just making sure that every
shot was contested and I tried to make her life really hard on the offensive
end and just being a constant annoyance the entire game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further? Okay, ladies and Coach, congratulations.
We'll see you tomorrow.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Recee' Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32709)

### [Zuri Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30421)

### [Candi Whitaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30407)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech - 76, TCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Coach Candi Whitaker from the Texas
Lady Raiders, along with her two student-athletes, Recee' Caldwell and Zuri
Sanders. Coach, your opening comments about tonight?  
  
CANDI WHITAKER: Really excited for our players and for our team. It's always
such an exciting time when you get to the Big 12 Tournament and the
environment here and just really happy that our team gets to stick around and
live another day and continue to experience the tournament.  
  
Just a big win for us. We have battled all year and have six new players that
haven't been through this league and we've learned a lot and anytime you can
take a young, inexperienced team and win a game in the tournament it's key for
us moving forward.  
  
Q. Receé, Zuri, what did you take from Monday's game and be able to
apply to today for the win today?  
ZURI SANDERS: There was a lot, I would have to say. Being able to play them
twice during regular season and coming in and playing them first round we knew
a lot of their strengths and we knew a lot of their weaknesses. So we tried to
attack their weaknesses and we knew what they were really good at and what
they specialized in. But we put a lot of emphasis on what we could do against
their defense and how we would attack.  
  
Q. Receé, when is the last time you scored 20 points in a half? How did
things open up for you a little more in the second half?  
RECEE' CALDWELL: I don't know when the last time I scored 20 points in a half.
I actually wasn't thinking about that. It opened up, because my teammates
calmed me down, I didn't have the best first half. So my teammates are so
encouraging and told me to settle down and they believed in me and came out
second half, and I felt like our whole team was in a better flow. Things
started opening up. I think we ran stuff more smoothly. I think that's what
happened.  
  
Q. Coach, what were some of the keys to beating TCU in consecutive
games?  
CANDI WHITAKER: You know, for us, defensively it starts with transition
defense. TCU is very good in the open court. They have multiple 3-point
shooters, so it was critical that we did a great job in transition defense to
help that is run good offense. It was important that we didn't let them get
loose in the open court. We thought rebounding was going to be a big key for
us and a strength and we felt like we had over TCU, and then just attacking,
setting screens, attacking the paint.  
  
We had a lot of success at our place with being very aggressive, attacking the
paint with the dribble or the pass and we wanted to really stick with that
same game plan offensively.  
  
Q. Zuri, what was key in getting you open in the second quarter and
getting it going?  
ZURI SANDERS: Something that my teammates and my coaches always tell me is
run. When you run, good things happen?  
  
CANDI WHITAKER: We're brilliant! We tell her to run!  
  
ZURI SANDERS: So when I got my first open run, you start noticing that the
defense is focusing on me, so I was able to help my teammates get shots on the
perimeter. So I just did what I could do best.  
  
Q. Coach Whitaker, TCU makes 9 of 9 free-throws, but you make 14 more
than they do and was that the difference in the game?  
CANDI WHITAKER: I think it's a big key. For us, anytime we are shooting high-
volume free-throws we have won games and that typically tells us that we're
being aggressive offensively.  
  
Q. The time they beat you they had eight 3s. Monday they hit 7. Today 3
of 24, what was the key in the perimeter defense?  
CANDI WHITAKER: It's just what it always needs to be, which is high hands on
all close-outs, not much space and time, keeping them out of rhythm for their
3-point shots. They got some and some of them just didn't go. But they are a
high-volume 3-point shooting team and we've got to limit the easy once as much
as possible.  
  
Q. Couple of times in the fourth quarter TCU got within 6 or 5 and then
wasn't able to convert on the other end. Coach, I will say that's a veteran
move from a team. Would you agree? Was that something more defensively that
you were able to stop 'em when they got close?  
CANDI WHITAKER: I feel like in a lot of ways our team is really growing up. I
thought we had some great defensive possessions, but most importantly secured
that rebound and didn't give them second and third opportunities, kick out
threes off of offensive rebounds. I thought we did a good job -- we were in a
drought for a little bit and called Receé's number and stepped up and made a
shot that got us back on track offensively. Both these two played I thought
extremely well. Zuri was big-time tonight and I thought Receé controlled the
fourth quarter for our team which is what we wanted her to do and what we
expected her to do.  
  
Q. Your perspective on the same question?  
ZURI SANDERS: I would have to agree with Coach Whitaker. A phrase that we
always use is if we get punched we have to punch back. They kept punching and
doing what they do best and we had to do what we do best and that definitely
showed in the fourth quarter. Whenever they would get closer, we would stay
complacent and know where we were and be okay with where we were and know how
to utilize our strengths and it definitely showed.  
  
Q. Y'all struggled on the road this year. How good is it to get a
neutral site win and build momentum?  
ZURI SANDERS: I feel like a neutral site is nice because you have a lot of
energy from, you know, both fans' sections. So I feel like that helps with the
atmosphere. But at the same time the atmosphere is great at the Big 12
Tournament. It's fun to be around and I felt like that showed especially with
our newcomers definitely able to experience that, being on a big stage they
had fun and they showed what they were made of tonight.  
  
Q. I would like for all of you to comment on this. It's not a frivolous
question, it's one that has been a topic of discussion several times for me.
Women's basketball uniforms. Seems like every player is rolling them up and
getting shorter and shorter. Are you buying them too long? Talk about that.  
CANDI WHITAKER: We're really blessed to work with Under Armour and they do a
fantastic job for us. We are able to -- I do think that you see a trend
changing in the women's game and in the men's game. There are men's players
that roll their shorts. We are working with them -- we have shorter shorts
than we probably did five years ago, and I think women typically want uniforms
that fit them well. So Under Armour is trying to work to work with us on that
and get a uniform that fits women well.  
  
Q. You don't get much time to celebrate before you have to face Baylor.
Keys facing them a third time?  
CANDI WHITAKER: I think, you know, when you think about Baylor it's just
you've got to do your best to limit easy baskets which is not an easy task.
The size, the depth, and the post that they continue to run in and out, you
know, I think they've probably outrebounded everyone they've played, so I
think you have to start there doing your best to limit anything that's easy
and then there is no secret.  
  
You've got to get hot, shoot the ball really well to upset Baylor, and I do
think our team has the ability to do that. Baylor is a great defensive team.
It's not like that's an easy task either. But there has to be a recipe where
you can score with them and they do make it hard to get to the rim.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on your win tonight.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [AJ Alix](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32707)

### [Amy Okonkwo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32708)

### [Raegan Pebley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25014)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech - 76, TCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the TCU Horned Frogs, Raegan Pebley the
coach and her two student-athletes, Amy Okonkwo and AJ Alix. Coach?  
  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: Congrats to Texas Tech. Obviously they played a good game. In
short, just a rough offensive night for us and 3 of 24 from the 3-point line.
Then only getting 9 free throws. It's tough to win basketball games when you
give somebody 30 free-throw attempts and they capitalize off of that.  
  
I'm excited for the future of our team. We're extremely young. We've got a lot
coming back next year and excited about the additions that we have and the
opportunity that this off-season presents itself.  
  
Q. When they were taking Jada out of the equation how tough was that to
respond?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: Taking Jada out of the equation? You mean Kianna?  
  
Q. Jada when she started getting fouls, in foul trouble.  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: Yeah, definitely. I think having -- not having Kianna to be
able to fit into the rotation at that point especially with the guard play
they had was tough on our team.  
  
But Jada, as a senior, she is our most experienced veteran player and you need
those type of players at this time of year in moments like that. Absolutely.  
  
Q. Seems like in the fourth quarter there were a couple of times where
you got within 5 or 6 and you were a bucket away from getting right back in it
and it just doesn't fall your way. Were you guys sensing that you were just on
the cusp of things?  
AJ ALIX: I feel like we had a chance the whole time. We had to convert our
stops and we wasn't quite doing that well. We were getting the stops. We just
wasn't converting them on the offensive end, or we got away from what we did
in the first quarter when we started the game. We were on it. We were
executing the plays. We were running the floor and we got away from that, and
I think that's how we lost the game.  
  
AMY OKONKWO: I agree with AJ. I think we needed to get a stop and be able to
score and not being able to get a stops and it dragged on. It wasn't like we
get a stop and a score and we were back in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough is it to play the same opponent in back-to-back
games?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: We have done it the last three years in a row and it's really
hard. It's really hard, but they had to play us, also. You find a way to turn
it into an advantage. Everything is fresh in your mind, but it's a challenge.  
  
Q. What's the status of Kianna? Is she okay?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: We're not supposed to really comment on players' health that
way, but she will be okay. Just won't get into the details. She played really
hard, and I know she would do the exact same thing in the exact same
situation. She is a competitor that way. I think she'll be okay. Thank you for
asking.  
  
Q. You guys have one of the conference's younger teams. Has this season
been a learning experience for younger players adjusting to play in the Big
12?  
AJ ALIX: Definitely a learning experience. Some of the games we lost we didn't
take them as losing them we took them as learning from our mistakes and what
happened. Next game we'll get it in. Sometimes it can't happen that way all
the time, but this is a learning experience and next year welcome back with
the attitude of winning, try to win all our games and it might not happen. But
this year is a learning experience for us and we are going to come back harder
than what we did this year.  
  
AMY OKONKWO: It definitely brought us closer. I think playing a whole year and
learning from our losses and coming together after each one and it's just
bringing us closer for next year because we're bringing basically everybody
back. It's going to be great next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you guys very much.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

### [Amani Wilborn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32754)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 86, DePaul - 78.  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Apologize for the emotions to start with. I think the thing
that I think of right now is our players are going to remember this for the
rest of their lives, and I am so happy for that. And to do it at my alma mater
in front of people that I love and care about, it really is a dream come true.  
  
Q. Amani, tournament MVP coming into the year, did you think this was
really a possibility for you, and what was your mindset heading into the
tournament?  
AMANI WILBORN: Well, heading into the tournament, I was just thinking about
the team winning, but I appreciate Coach for continuing to believe in me and
just believing in my strengths, and we just pulled it off.  
  
Q. Amani, can you just describe what it's like to do all this on your
20th birthday, too?  
AMANI WILBORN: It's the best feeling ever. It's like the best birthday I've
ever had. I feel like a little kid again.  
  
Q. Natisha, what is it like to hit everything in front of such a good
home crowd tonight?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: It's just a great feeling just to be able to put up some
numbers for my team. We wanted this so bad, so this is an amazing feeling. I'm
so excited to go dancing. Literally. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Amani, career night last night, you follow that up one shy of tying
that, and coming off the bench to deliver for this team that's so based on
ball movement, how do you feel right now? What's going through your head?  
AMANI WILBORN: It's unbelievable. Words can't really explain how I feel right
now. It's just -- I come into the game and just look to do whatever the team
needs in that particular game, and that's what we needed tonight.  
  
Q. Natisha, what did it mean to play in front of the crowd tonight? What
did that atmosphere give you and the team?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Our crowd is amazing. The atmosphere in Al McGuire is
amazing, they bring us a lot of energy, we feed off of them, they feed off of
us, and we won it together. Honestly, they deserve it just as much as we do,
and I've just got to thank them.  
  
Q. Natisha, that half court shot right at the end of the first quarter.
When you threw that up did you think, hey, this might go in?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: No, but I was like, it's worth a shot. I don't know, might
as well. It's three points.  
  
Q. To go from rise with us, fly with us, I assume this will be dance
with us or something like that? That progression of what you've done for this
program, how do you put that into words?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, it starts with people, and I think Marquette is so
special because we have amazing people. I mean, obviously great leadership
with Dr. Lovell and Bill Scholl that are ahead of us. They believe in us and
they support us as a women's basketball team, and we can't do it without them.
But I have a great staff, and obviously my team, it's really all the credit
goes to them. We rebuilt the locker room a couple years ago, and I put a
picture of the Big East trophy on the wall, specifically for this reason, and
said nothing given, everything earned, and boy, did we earn that tonight. We
earned it.  
  
Q. Amani, looks like they were giving you a lot of one-on-one looks.
What were you seeing out there and why were you able to have so much
success?  
AMANI WILBORN: They were sagging off of me because my tagging abilities, and I
just felt that was another way for me to get a head of steam and attacking
them on their heels and just finish with my athleticism.  
  
Q. What is it like winning this tournament as just sophomores, knowing
you have a couple more years to contend here?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I feel like we just set expectations super high, so I'm
living in the moment right now, but I'm looking forward to the next couple
years, too.  
  
AMANI WILBORN: Yeah. This one was for -- this one to me was for our senior
Makayla Yentz. She just worked hard, so she was pretty much our motivation
throughout this.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive effort, again, fourth quarter I
think they had six turnovers, three in the first three minutes there. Was that
momentum?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: The first two times we played DePaul, they scored 84 points in
the paint, so we told our team tonight that we were going to defend the paint,
and they had 20, and our team really stuck to the game plan, and they said
we're going to make them live or die by the three. They hit 13 of them but
they only scored 20 in the paint, and our team stuck with it, and I just give
them a lot of credit for trusting us.  
  
Q. What was the game plan for Jessica January and Brook? Obviously
they're two of the best players in the Big East.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Score more points than them. You can't defend them, they're
too good. DePaul is so balanced that it's really hard to come up with one
defensive scheme. You've got to keep changing it and you've got to keep them
on their toes. We tried a couple different stuff off of ball screens to kind
of affect them, but I think the majority of it we just really tried to
eliminate their points in the paint.  
  
Q. You have five really good rotation players and they're all
sophomores. What's the ceiling for Marquette Golden Eagle Basketball going
forward?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, I think our potential is through the roof. I think
we have grown so much in one year, if we do that again in a year, it's going
to be scary.  
  
The best thing I think about this group right now is they're hungry. They're
coachable. And they really want this, and they just don't want it for
themselves, they want it for each other, and our team chemistry is phenomenal.
I give a lot to credit to that.  
  
Q. Not to take you out of this moment, but how do you get ready for the
NCAAs with obviously a young team that hasn't been there, and this is all new
to them.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Keep doing what we've been doing all year, and that's
confidence. I told them tonight that the more confident team was going to win,
and I think having that mantra and just really looking at each other and
believing that we can do this, it's really helping them. It's helping them in
tight moments. It's helping them focus, and it just kind of takes a little bit
of pressure off them, and I think that's what we'll do. We'll keep being who
we are.  
  
Q. Over the past few weeks heading up into this game your offense has
really become more balanced. Tonight was probably one of the best examples of
that. How has your team been able to develop that balance?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Get in the gym and get to work. I challenged them in the
beginning of the year that we were just getting started, but it's going to
take a lot of hours in the gym, a lot of hours when I wasn't there, a lot of
hours when I was there, and I think they're really buying into focusing on
their individual games, but they're not just going by themselves, they're
bringing a Makayla Yentz and Amani Wilborn shoot every single day after
practice together. I challenged Makayla probably about three months ago when
they were sagging off Amani, and I said that's your responsibility as a
senior, you've got to get her in the gym. But seeing the two of them every
single day after practice, that's why we won. It's hard work.  
  
Q. In just three short years you've really turned around this program.
Why do you think your culture -- why do you think the players buy into your
culture so well?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think they understand my confidence in them. My confidence
in them is through the roof, and I'm a very confident person myself, so I
think they feed off that a lot. When I took this job, I knew we could be
special, and I have my sights set very high. I've never been to a Final Four,
and I'm not shy to say that's our goal. We want to get there. The Big East
championship is amazing, but we're not going to stop there. If they know
that's my mentality, if they know that's where we're headed, then they're
going to have to follow along.  
  
Q. Just to put this in summary, these four days, having this tournament
here and that atmosphere tonight, what can you say about it?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think it's one of those situations where when you're alone
at night and you're thinking and you're envisioning how it's going to go and
you hope and you pray that it goes the way you want it, and so now I think the
only thing I can say is I'm blessed and I'm thankful and to be able to do it
here with our administration, to be able to do it with our family and friends,
like I said before, this is a moment they'll never forget, and I just prayed
that they would get the opportunity to seize it, and they did.  
  
To be able to do that at this stage of their career and handle that pressure
playing on your home floor, that says a lot about their character. That says a
lot about their toughness. I've never had this much fun as a player or a coach
in my basketball career. It's a credit to my players and my staff because this
has been one hell of a ride, and we're just getting started.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 86, DePaul - 78  
  
DOUG BRUNO: I would like to first of all thank the Big East and Marquette for
running a great tournament. It was a great environment. I just am thrilled
that our players got to play in this kind of environment, hostile though it
might be. That's what women's basketball is all about, and there's a lot of
people that have been working a long time to create environments like this.
I'm thrilled that our team got to compete in this kind of environment.  
  
Regarding the game, Marquette is really good, and I believe they were really
good all year long. You don't beat Oregon State at Oregon State and Arizona
State and us without being good. You're good. They're really talented, and
they're a talented collection of players that are growing up in front of every
basketball fan and coach's eyes. We knew that we were going to have a very
difficult task on our hands tonight.  
  
I thought I really loved my own team that I'm blessed to coach, and the first
quarter was a rough one because Marquette is too good to self-inflict, and
thought we self-inflicted some of our own wounds in the first quarter, and
Hiedeman throws in the three to end it and we're down 25-24 in a quarter that
we probably had a chance to be up 24-16 or so if we just didn't throw the ball
away a little bit.  
  
After we settled that issue down, then it just became a great, hard-fought,
possession-by-possession battle. And Marquette won a couple key possessions
that we just didn't finish, that we didn't get done. And that's just -- again,
I just really believe when you lose, you can bemoan your own team, but you
have to remember there's other people playing, and they just did a good job.  
  
We got some good looks. I was pleased with some of the looks that we got as a
basketball team, looks that we've knocked down in our run to the Big East
regular season championship, and we didn't knock those down, and that's why
it's a great game and why March Madness is March Madness. You get good looks,
you have to make them. If you make them, you keep going. It's hard to get good
looks, but I thought we got good looks.  
  
Jess January here -- again, this is just a statement about how -- I think what
this shows is how well that team that's in that locker room persevered this
year to be able to play without Jessica, because she was obviously very, very
special tonight and special last night, and she's a special player, special
athlete. And so for our team to be able to win a regular-season championship,
that's very difficult to do. I'm really proud of them for that achievement in
spite of a tough ballgame tonight. It's great to have Jessica back, and I
think you all saw why.  
  
Q. Jess, not the result you were looking for, but a terrific performance
throughout the tournament and a great performance to cap it off tonight. What
does all-tournament team mean to you?  
JESSICA JANUARY: I mean, obviously it's an honor to be recognized on the team,
but we came here to win the Big East championship.  
  
Q. Coach Kieger had some words for you after you got that trophy. What
did she have to say?  
JESSICA JANUARY: She was just saying congrats and good luck in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Jessica, your season doesn't end tonight; how much do you look
forward to being back in the big dance?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Mean, really excited. This hurts that we lost in this last
game, but us seniors, we still want to make a run in the NCAA Tournament, and
we still have a really good chance to play well, so we're going to have to
turn the page and get some good practices in.  
  
Q. I know it's difficult after a loss, but what does a game like this,
the atmosphere here tonight saying about Big East women's basketball?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, like Bruno said, it's just a lot of fun. It's a lot of
fun. There's obviously games in the regular season where the stands are pretty
quiet, and so just being in this environment, even though they weren't all of
our fans, it was just so much fun. It's really exciting for women's
basketball.  
  
Q. I know obviously you're not happy any time after you come off a
losing game, but your spirits seem very high right now, patting Jess on the
back, keeping spirits positive. What makes you so proud and able to be so
positive about this team even though not the result you were looking for
tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, we try to teach our players that we're never going to teach
you how to lose, but it's our job to teach you that you must handle defeat. We
really have our -- I don't have many rules, but one rule is you cry when
somebody dies. Don't go crying over a ballgame because you had a chance to do
something about that ballgame. That's just kind of the stuff we try to teach
our players. We're out there fighting for every single possession, and if
you're fighting to win every single possession and you do your job to win
every single possession in a game, which is the little score, then the big
score usually takes care of itself.  
  
That's what makes this a beautiful sport and a beautiful game. We don't like
defeat. At the same time, you also have a moment here to recognize the
accomplishments and achievements of what this Marquette program has done.
Carolyn is a great coach and she's done a great job, and she's turned this
program around in a very short amount of time.  
  
I just think it's important that people -- that when you lose, are defeated, I
think it's very important to respect the people that are the victors, and
that's really -- it's not something -- if I can write my script, I didn't lay
around all day saying Carolyn is a really nice kid, she was a nice little
guard, she needs some help or whatever. We don't do that. We're competing.
You're a track athlete. You understand, you're running against people. You
run, you're competing. But when it's over, you know what, there's nothing you
can -- they earned the win, so to the victors go the spoils, and I'm happy for
what Marquette has done for our league. It's a great league.  
  
John asked a question, what does this say about Big East basketball. It's a
great question because this is a great league, and we really are a great
league. We're a great and tough league top to bottom.  
  
Just a couple, a few games away from having more than three teams in this NCAA
Tournament.  
  
You have to move on. These are young athletes that, what are we going to
wallow in our self-pity now for a couple -- we don't have time. We're in
Finals. The players are going to have a day off tomorrow and a day off the
next day, and then we'll be on the floor Friday and we'll have a rhythm to get
ready.  
  
The beauty of tonight's game was it was NCAA basketball at its best. It's the
same -- you just take off the words Big East tonight and put first round or
second round or even regional round, that's what we're dealing with. Marquette
is a good team. I think we're a good team. We didn't just ask to be 16 RPI.
Those players did that. So we're both good basketball teams, and I'm looking
forward to having a chance to see what we can prove to the rest of the world
when that NCAA Tournament starts.  
  
Q. Both teams shot well from three-point range, and if Coach Kieger was
here I'd ask her the same question, but why did you have such difficulty
defending the three tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: There's a lot of reasons why we have trouble defending Marquette
in general. They have five people that have to be guarded, and when you have
five people that have to be guarded, there's no games you can play. And their
players are versatile. They have people who can get to the rim and people that
can get to the rim, so you have to guard a lot of different kinds of very
talented players. The game plan wasn't to let Marquette shoot threes. That
wasn't what we came in here to do, okay. But at the same time, they play
basketball, too. They run offenses, too. They execute, also. You're trying to
keep Allazia Blockton from penetrating and you're helping over here and you're
trying to keep King in check because she's averaging 27.5 going into the game,
so you keep her in check over here.  
  
At some place and point in time, when it gets to higher level basketball, it
becomes -- we don't have a whole lot of different things we could do. I tell
my staff all the time, I could play Dougie crazy ball. I've told my staff
that, turn this thing up and let it go 120. People are afraid to run against
Marquette. I'm not, but at the same time, I'm not trying to let them run.  
  
But at the same time, when I say Dougie crazy ball, we could turn this thing
into a 125 to 120-point track meet and see what happens and see who's left.
That's my way of guarding them, really, because I've known that they're a
really difficult match-up. If this was an NBA program, and we're not NBA
players, but there's players on both teams that are hard to guard. Some of our
hard to guard players tonight had some really good shots that didn't get
finished. That's the way it goes.  
  
I love those players, so I'm not going to blame them -- you're never going to
see me blame our players. Those players gave DePaul University a magnificent
season. There's some shots that went in that won the Big East regular season
that didn't go in tonight, the same shots that we got. So you get the players
-- I tell them all the time, look, you're going to coach some day. It's my job
to get you shots, it's your job to make shots. I feel pretty good about some
of the shots we got tonight, and it wasn't always pretty, but we got some
pretty good looks for some pretty good people that have put us in position to
be Big East regular season champs. That's what you're trying to do.  
  
Q. Chante Stonewall had a little bit of a coming-out party throughout
this tournament, you're using her down low on defense and also guarding the
perimeter. What do you expect from her future with this program?  
DOUG BRUNO: That is a really, really good question, and we expect a lot out of
Chante. And yet the reason I'm a little -- where my mind is right now is to
still strive to play one -- we're playing one-and-out basketball and try to
strive to play one-and-out basketball as long as we possibly can. I know that
Chante Stonewall is willing to commit herself in the months between March and
November that she has a chance to be a really, really special collegiate
basketball player.  
  
So when I say what do I expect, I expect her to take a good three-week break
after it's all over with, and then come back in that gym rip roaring ready to
roar and make herself a better player. We'll help show her the way, but she's
going to have to do that. So that's what I expect. That's the process, and
then hopefully next year you're going to see a real, real bright emerging star
in Chante Stonewall. But that's still to be proven and still has to get done.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the play of Amarah Coleman?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, Amarah hit the first three in the first half, and then she
had a couple possessions where she fell asleep on some second shots. When I
talk about that first quarter -- and those are controllables, and we're very
big into the controllables. Stepping up in the big moment is not doing
something you're incapable of, it's doing what you should be able to do all
the time, and I gave her a couple chances to make amends for her not -- that's
a fundamental. In a game like this, you have to control every defensive board,
so I was thrilled -- we debated at halftime was she really ready to play or
not, and I'm glad we went with her. We went with the starting lineup to start
the half, and she caught fire, and she's a really talented player. I think
it's another player that we have to still keep working to get better. But
she's got a chance to be really, really good next season, also.  
  
But again, you've got me thinking next season again. I love DePaul radio, all
right, but at the same time, I can't think next season, we've got a game to
play in a couple weeks, all right.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Aaliyah Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32739)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 59, St. John's - 41  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I thought DePaul did a great job of really making us
uncomfortable throughout the whole game. I felt the first quarter we actually
did a really good job and allowed them to really kind of break our back in the
second. Obviously scoring four points is not a way that you want to stay in
the game, especially going into half. But I thought they did a good job. I
thought they -- it was similar to the first game we played during the year
where they tried to take away a lot of the passing lanes, tried to frustrate
us, not only just putting some of the length on Aaliyah, changing the vision
of her and being physical, and then also just trying to really push us, and we
got pushed out so far offensively I thought we struggled.  
  
Credit to what they did to us, and we were not able to adjust enough on the
fly to be able to counteract what they were doing.  
  
I was happy that we fought a little bit in the third and then going into the
start of the fourth, and then I also thought we were -- we looked a little bit
tired. I thought both teams looked a little bit tired through the entire first
half. Losing Jade in the first half obviously hurt our continuity, and so that
was difficult to manage. I thought we did a pretty good job for a while. We
held her to about 10 and then 12 and then it just got away from us a little
bit toward that three-minute mark in the second quarter.  
  
I'm really proud of this group. I think they've shown throughout the year that
they have really grown as a group. I mean, beginning of the year we have two
games out of the first three that we weren't able to close, and then I think
from that point forward, we've done a really good job in our growth, including
last night's game, and then coming into this game.  
  
You know, it's the same thing I told them in the locker room, you want to play
well even though you come out with a loss, and so we just didn't play our
best, and that's part of what DePaul did to us, and then I thought we self-
inflicted some of those wounds as they frustrated us.  
  
I talked yesterday about not letting one end affect the other, and I think
that happened today for us.  
  
But listen, we have more games to play in whatever tournament that's going to
be, and for this program, that will be a tenth straight postseason, which is a
proud moment for all of us. Hopefully we're in the discussion for the
tournament, and if not, then obviously we'll prepare for whatever tournament
we play in.  
  
Q. You still have basketball to be played; can you reflect on this
season and a life without Danaejah and Aliyyah was going to be tough, but
you've taken that leadership role. Can you tell me what that's been like for
you?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: Last year we lost two great players. But it's a new year,
different players, and I'm proud of the people who stepped in this year as the
wings to take on that role. They did a good job. I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. What makes you think that this team still can do something in the
postseason here?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: Always got faith in my team. We still got a couple games left.
We're just going to go hard this week in practice and just keep focus.
Wherever we land, we're going to be ready to play.  
  
Q. I had the honor of being there with the St. John's women last year in
Waco, Texas, for the tournament, and I was watching you play, Ms. Lewis, and
you definitely were taking some of that leadership role. You were leading a
lot of plays and you were providing some great offense and defense. Going into
this next postseason, how are you going to take some of the energy that you
had last year and really spin it in a way that can provide a winning set of
games this postseason?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: I would just say continue to go harder. It starts with
practice, practicing this week to see wherever we land. Just keep continuing
to practice, bringing the energy. I'm a leader out there, so it kind of starts
with me. If I bring the energy, my teammates will follow, and we'll be all
right.  
  
Q. Yesterday in the postgame press conference after you left, your head
coach spoke about the importance that you've left on this program. What have
you learned now that Big East play is over when you reflect about the program
and what Coach Tartamella has meant to you?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: Well, I actually thank him for giving me the opportunity to be
able to be the point guard here. I've been playing three years starting point
guard since my sophomore year, so you know, just continue the legacy. I've
been in three postseasons since we've been here, a Big East championship. So
I'm just kind of glad that I got the opportunity to do this, and just continue
it to keep going. Whoever is after me, I hope they kind of do better than me.
I always want people to do better than me, so I hope they get the chance to do
better.  
  
Q. You were kind of on the Villanova side of things tonight where the
shots just weren't falling. Were there adjustments made after that second
quarter to try and break down what DePaul was giving you defensively?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I mean, we talked about trying to do some things to free
up our entry to the wing and trying to set some down screens, get in some
crossing action, and it's hard, we have a group that can do certain things I
think on the fly really well and then other things that are a little bit more
difficult, and so I didn't think we adjusted quickly enough in that second
half, although I thought we made some good plays, and then there was a time
where neither team scored for a while, and we had missed opportunity after
missed opportunity. I mean, whether it was a transition lay-up, and we don't
make a bucket or we settle for a pull-up jumper instead of being aggressive or
running our lanes.  
  
You know, I think the adjustments we tried to make, I mean, I think we did a
good job in certain areas. In other areas we didn't. And part of that was due
to fatigue. Part of that was due to frustration. I think from the ball not
going through the hole as much as we had seen over the course of the year.  
  
If you told me that we would hold them to 59 points, I probably would have
signed up for it.  
  
So the disappointing part is we just really weren't able to execute and never
got in the flow.  
  
They did a good job with Aaliyah, and we'll see those similar things again,
and we've got to be able to counteract it, and other players are going to have
to step up. It just wasn't on Aaliyah. I mean, we had multiple players
struggle, and it's hard to win a game when you've got sort of that quicksand
happening to you where you just -- it's just snowballing. The harder you're
trying, you're still sinking, and I think they were really trying hard, but we
just were not able to get ourselves stabilized.  
  
Even when we got to the line, I thought there were a couple times where we
could maybe connect. We weren't able to do that.  
  
The adjustments we made, we tried, and then again, we picked up fouls again
that would adjust the lineup. We were concerned about certain match-ups
specifically. Obviously the addition of January back, of how we were going to
be able to counteract that without having Imani Littleton and her versatility,
but Maya has been really good and Crystal had played really well.  
  
They did a great job tonight, and like I said, I mean, I don't think anybody
gave us a chance yesterday, but I'm proud of how they've played, and to be
ready for that game and then to execute was great, and then I thought we
lacked that level of energy when we needed to raise it to the level that
DePaul was bringing it to, and I thought it was a physical game, as well. They
were letting us play a little bit. I thought both teams were getting calls
that probably weren't going their way, so to speak. But that's part of the
game in the postseason. You've got to be able to play. It's just how it is.  
  
You know, I think it was probably that way on both sides. We have to regroup,
get healthy, get rest, and then prepare for the postseason.  
  
Q. Not to hamper on offense too much, but the bench definitely struggled
only being able to produce two points in the entire game. Obviously we're
talking a lot about tournament play, depth is always something that's
extremely critical. Looking forward, how are you going to be able to kind of
make some adjustments to better utilize the bench?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I mean, we're short-handed now, so our depth has taken a hit.
Our players have done a great job for the most part of being ready and engaged
when they have to play. We started a different lineup today than we have,
played a little bit smaller to try to counteract some of the mismatches, so to
the question you guys asked me the other day, looking at the film we felt we
could make an adjustment.  
  
But again, when you make that adjustment, it affects other things, as well. So
you've got to take everything into account.  
  
I mean, we have to continue to understand that every day we step on the floor
in practice and whether it's shoot-around practice, we have to execute the
things that we go over, similarly to what Aaliyah talked about last night
about following the game plan and letting the game plan fail them and not
failing the game plan.  
  
So we've got to continue to do that and prepare just like we would for any
other game.  
  
Q. The perception in the preseason was that this program was going to be
in a year of some rebuilding and you were picked in the back half of the
conference. How proud are you of this group for putting a 20-win season on the
board?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, this group has surprised me in many ways, both good and
probably on the other side, also. They've been great. They're disappointed
right now. They lost the game. That's what happens. You're going to end on a
loss most likely at some point in the year, as you progress. I've been doing
this a long time now, and so I've -- you have the elation of success, and then
you have the feeling of not real failure but just that you came up short and
it just wasn't good enough in that game, and you want to play well.  
  
For this group to be able to get to 20 wins, to I think be in every game,
today was probably one of the bigger -- it might have been the biggest, I
don't know. I think we've been in every game all year, whether it was Miami,
Arizona State was a weird game, but we didn't have Akina. But these guys have
fought. They've played hard every game.  
  
That's the biggest thing that we talk about, you've got to play hard. So I
couldn't be prouder of a group. Picked sixth, finished tied for fourth, to be
able to win the 4-5 game, being able to sweep a couple of teams that were
close to you, maybe one ahead of you, one right behind you, and then being
able to get that win yesterday. So I think we've done a really good job.  
  
I look around the country, there are teams that you look at on paper we have
better wins than some teams that are already considered to be in the NCAA
Tournament. But we know also that it's not an easy thing to do, it's
selection. I witnessed it. I went through it. I saw it in the mock stuff. But
I couldn't be prouder, and I think there are -- when you look at the
development of Alisha Kebbe as a freshman, you look at the development of
Akina Wellere, Crystal brings you a different dimension to the game and how
she can change it from her energy and defense, those are the bright spots.  
  
Maya Singleton obviously stepping in for Imani, Imani being able to come back
next year. So I think we've got a lot of things to build on where people maybe
thought we were going to slide off because it was and Aliyyah and Danaejah,
Aliyyah and Danaejah. They forget about Lewis and Jade. Aaliyah Lewis has been
a rock -- she said she started for three years because she dispenses the 10
that she started as a freshman. But she's been pretty much part of the mix the
minute she stepped on campus.  
  
And so those kids, I'm proud for -- I'm happy for them that they're able to
leave as winners and they're able to, I think, feel really good about what
they've accomplished. They've been a part of four 20-win seasons since they
got here. I mean, that's a great accomplishment for them but also for the
people who have played with them, the kids who have been through our program.  
  
I'm really proud of this group, and I think that wherever we land, we have an
opportunity to make a run, and I think they'll be ready for it.  
  
So I've been really pleased. I mean, I'll be honest with you, I didn't know
what to expect this year when we came in, not that the year is over yet, but I
wasn't really sure, and then losing Tiana right in the summer, losing Sandra
midway through the year, losing Imani, which teams have had that similar
injury bug in the league. Next person has got to step up and you've got to
play.  
  
Really proud of them. Just really, really happy for those seniors that can
leave as winners.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Amani Wilborn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32754)

### [Danielle King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32736)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 72, Creighton - 65  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: First thing is I cannot give enough credit to my players and
my staff for how much this team has matured in a year. I mean, that was
fantastic to watch them weather that storm, make every right play down the
stretch, and I can't say enough about these two guards sitting next to me and
how much they've matured, not even in a year, just from the beginning of the
season. They looked like veterans out there, make my job easier. But that was
a great environment, that was fun, and I could not be more proud of my players
and staff.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you guys to be playing for a Big East title this
year?  
AMANI WILBORN: Especially on our home floor, I think it means the most. We've
been talking -- this is just one of our steps. We've been talking about this
since the beginning of the season, so it's just exciting being a part of it
and actually playing in the championship game this year.  
  
DANIELLE KING: Yeah, it's very exciting. I think it's an amazing feeling. I
still feel jittery about it.  
  
Q. Your coach said before this tournament started that you guys are
playing without really any pressure. Is that how you guys feel when you're out
there, especially in a game like this where it meant so much to advance?  
DANIELLE KING: Yeah, I think so. I think we played better when we just played
free and played our game and we play up tempo and don't have much to worry
about because we don't have much to lose, we have to prove everybody else
wrong.  
  
AMANI WILBORN: Yeah, just knowing we always have each other's back, that's a
big part of it, too.  
  
Q. When you guys were looking at improving two months later from the
first match-up with this team, I wondered if you looked at cutting down their
good passing. I think they had 26 assists in the first game. Seemed like you
guys really wanted to get in the passing lane. Was that part of your defensive
strategy or were you looking at something else for this game?  
DANIELLE KING: Well, we know that they like to score in the paint a lot. A lot
of people take away a three most of the time, but they get a lot of passes off
those back cuts and face cuts, so we tried to limit that.  
  
Q. I guess you know coming in playing Creighton they like to take away
the strengths of your team and kind of make the other players beat them. What
was the plan of attack for you two coming in knowing that things would
probably be tougher for Natisha and Blockton and those players?  
AMANI WILBORN: I think just playing our game, regardless of what their
defensive scheme was, just playing our game and doing what we know we're best
at.  
  
Q. Probably odd thinking, seeing so much space to create, how do you
know when to pull the trigger, where to create, and things like that? How do
you get into the flow of the game?  
DANIELLE KING: Just like what we work on in practice. We work on pull ups and
stuff a lot, so taking the open space that they give us, and be confident and
knock down shots.  
  
Q. The second consecutive game you guys scored 46 points in the paint.
What made you guys so effective in getting open lanes and driving to the
hoop?  
AMANI WILBORN: I think just knowing -- just being confident in our
athleticism, just knowing most of the players on our team can out-jump a lot
of players, so out-jumping means you just take the contact and go right in.  
  
Q. Playing on your home court, how much was that an advantage for you,
maybe even just walking here, not stressing out about where you had to be? Was
that a factor for you guys, too?  
DANIELLE KING: Yeah, the energy here is great, and we love our fans and all
the support we get. We just feed off of them every game.  
  
Q. You guys are the first Marquette team to make it to the Big East
championship; what does that mean for you guys as players to be that initial
group from this University to get there?  
DANIELLE KING: It's a great feeling.  
  
AMANI WILBORN: Yeah. Just trying to leave our mark, just make memories and
seize the moment.  
  
Q. I know earlier this week and leading up to the tournament, you guys
had an opportunity to speak to some alums, even some that were on the first
ever women's basketball team at Marquette. How did that impact you guys
heading into the tournament, that it's more than just about the people on the
team?  
DANIELLE KING: It's inspiring because they saw the potential that they have in
us, that we have, and we just like to go out and show that it's been a legacy
down the line, that it's been great basketball here at Marquette, and we're
just continuing it.  
  
Q. How fast is Danielle, and how -- can you even measure that? Do you
even have any idea? Obviously she's very tough, but she's oxygen to the brain
for this team.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Her tempo and her speed is like nothing I've seen before, and
I kind of talk about this yesterday, but I think last year our team was
learning how to keep up with her, and this year they've really learned how to
play off each other, and I think that's the biggest difference. And now she's
learning when to go full speed, when to change her pace, and she's becoming a
phenomenal point guard for us, and I love her growth.  
  
Q. It looked like you had a plan of attack from the jump as far as how
Creighton might defend your top scorers, and Danielle looked like she was
ready to kind of execute that game plan. What did you have drawn up for them
from the start?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: We knew the past two games that they played off Danielle and
Amani. We knew they were going to come in and do that again, and just trying
to get them confident and understand that they're just as capable as anybody
else on our team, to stay confident, take the open shot, and to just let them
know that if you're the open one on the floor, that's the Marquette shot. We
have five people on the floor at any given time that can score.  
  
And I've talked to some people about this. At the beginning of the year, I
felt like we ran a lot of the offense through Allazia and everybody thought
she had to score 27 points. Now, she's capable of doing that every night, but
on the flipside, now we have other people that are stepping up. And that's I
think the best part about our team is any given possession somebody else can
step up and knock down a shot, and that's how I think we're evolving as a
team.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be going into the championship game against a
team you beat twice in the regular season?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: We don't know yet. Either way it's going to be fun.  
  
Q. You said that you were proud of your girls for withstanding the
pressure at the beginning. Why were they able to do that? What do you think
the mindset was for them to kind of relax into their game?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think we've learned that our team is at their best when
they're relaxed, and I've learned that as a coach. I think I'm learning how to
coach them, as well. So pregame, all week, we're just talking about
confidence. For them to kind of have me let them know, it's okay, let's just
relax and let's have fun. Let's pretend the score is tied every single
possession. And I think they just have bought into that, have bought into
having fun and playing for each other. We had a model that our goal was to get
McKayla Yentz to the NCAA Tournament for the last three weeks, and it's been
really neat to see the team rally around their senior and play for her.  
  
Q. What was the game plan to slow them down on the glass? They seemed to
be grabbing a lot of rebounds in the first half, but the second half seemed a
lot more even.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I just challenged them. I said if we can out-rebound
Georgetown yesterday, we've got to do the same thing today. I think they took
that to heart the second half.  
  
What I'm really proud of is in the first few games they scored 80 points in
the paint versus us. Tonight they scored 26 points. And I think our team did a
fantastic job sticking to the game plan. They had those four threes early and
they looked at us a little panicked, we're okay, let's stick to it, and it
worked. And I'm just really proud of my team for sticking with it and knowing
personnel and really packing the paint.  
  
Q. You mentioned a little bit about it on the defensive end, they got 15
quick on you and then they finished with 65 and became very one-dimensional.
How did the defense kind of just suck the life out of them?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, that's an interesting question because I've never had to
answer one where defense was the answer for us. That means we're growing and
evolving, right?  
  
But no, I mean, from the moment we lost last year against Seton Hall,
everything, every start to every practice has been defense, and so I called a
time-out tonight, and I got into the team in the huddle, and I said, can you
believe it, defense is winning this game? And the big smiles on their face. So
they're proud of their progress on the defensive end, too. But I think it's
maturity, it's growing up, it's understanding how important help side defense
is, not just ball pressure.  
  
That's the hardest, I think, part of the game for freshmen to learn is help
side defense, and you can see how quickly these sophomores have adjusted to
that.  
  
Q. Getting to the Big East championship game, what does this mean for
the program?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: It's huge. I mean, the biggest thing is I'm just excited for
my players. They've earned it. They trusted us. They trusted in the process.
The first two years were hard. We knew that we had talent. We knew we had
potential and we had to weather the storm, and I'm just -- this is for the
administration. This is for our players. This is for my staff. And like I
said, we're going to enjoy this moment because we fought and we've worked
really, really hard to get here.  
  
Q. Just four turnovers for your team; what does that say about this
group that the majority of them are sophomores, that they were able to take
care of the basketball in such a hostile environment and this game meant so
much.  
A. Yeah, it's huge. 17-0 on points off of turnovers, right, so that's saying
that we're maturing, I think. We're confident with the ball, especially the
way we lost the Creighton game last time at their home floor was because of
turnovers, so in a month to have fixed that and to have confidence down the
stretch, that says a lot about our toughness.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Sydney Lamberty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28427)

### [Jaylyn Ganew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32753)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 72, Creighton - 65.  
  
JIM FLANERY: You know, Marquette is a really good team. We knew that when we
played up here two months ago. We played one of our best games of the year,
and they probably didn't play very well, but we were fortunate to beat them at
home. So we knew it was going to be the type of game that it was.  
  
You know, really impressed with King's development and her improvement. I
probably shouldn't tell you, but I voted for her for most improved player
because I think she's made a huge jump as a player. I think her development
has made their team better, and she was really good today, and so was Wilborn.
We have a tough time matching up with those guys, and then Blockton was
Blockton. She's going to make some tough shots.  
  
But I thought we battled. You know, we played well enough to win. The number
of three-point baskets that we had in the first half and in the game that went
in and out were -- I think Audrey had at least four shots that were inside the
rim, maybe five from the three-point line, and I told them at half, we were 4
for 20, and we probably had four or five go in and out. The difference between
three of those going in that didn't go in is huge.  
  
But I thought we competed. Sydney was incredible. I thought easily -- I can't
say easily, but it was the best game she's ever played. I loved her
competitiveness, I loved her leadership, and that goes along with playing
well, but you have to back that up. It starts with an attitude and a mentality
to be able to play that well in that setting. So that was really cool to see.  
  
You know, Jaylyn has just really, I think, had a special freshman year, to the
degree that when she's on the floor late in a game like that, you have every
bit of confidence that she can make the plays that she did.  
  
So I thought we did a lot of good things. And I told the team, the great thing
about the speech that I had to give about 20 minutes ago is that we're not
going to the NIT next Monday. There's nothing wrong with the NIT, because
we've been there enough to know, and they treat us fine, it's great, but we're
going to the NCAA Tournament, and that's exciting. We knew that going in.  
  
Like I said, I'm proud of our team. Marquette has got a great team. They're a
young team, so they're going to be good going forward, and I thought their
guards, particularly Wilborn and King, were -- their ability to finish in the
lane and with either hand going either direction was the difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Sydney, a team you beat twice in the regular season; what would you
point to as the difference tonight?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I mean, as a team we just came in knowing that they're a
tough team and that we've had close games with them and that we really need to
buckle down on defense, and we had to really focus on offense, not a lot of
one-on-one stuff, a lot of cutting and screening because they practice one-on-
one all the time. We just came in knowing it was going to be a tough game, and
we fought as much as we could.  
  
Q. What did it look like for you out there from an attacking standpoint,
when you're making the reads and deciding when to go to the hoop, when to
settle for a jumper, when to try to find someone coming off a flair screen?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I don't know. I mean, I was getting really good screens for
my teammates. Like Bree was hitting really great screens, ball screens. Audrey
with her passes. I mean, just kind of taking whatever they gave me.  
  
Q. I know it's probably weird to talk about this in a loss, but over the
course of your career it's been brought up how you don't really get rattled in
these types of situations. Take me inside your mentality when you're facing a
hostile environment and they're on a roll and then you have to make a play.
How do you calm yourself enough to do that?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I think I just trust my team, and I know that if I don't have
an open shot, someone else is going to and that we can come back. I think it's
all just trust at this point.  
  
Q. You talk about the trust in your team. Now, this is a group that you
guys, your offense relies on multiple scorers. How much confidence does it
give you, Jaylyn, when Sydney is putting up numbers like she is today to get
the ball to her and having the confidence that she's going to hit the shots?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Yeah, it's really huge. She played a great game today. I think,
like she said, trust, and every once in a while her like going to the --
attacking, you're like, Sid has got this, and it's almost like a confidence
booster. And then it just like keeps us going, I think. Her poise helps
everyone else become poised, too.  
  
Q. Marquette did a really good job keeping you guys out of the paint.
What's the biggest thing that you learned taking away from this heading into
the NCAA Tournament?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I think definitely on defense we can learn that we really
have to take away people's strong hands. Their offensive boards towards the
end, we kind of let them get a lot. I think we learned that we can fight with
teams, though, and stay in games, too, so I think there's a lot of takeaways.  
  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Yeah, he said we were very resilient and we came together and we
played hard, and I think even though we lost, we still played hard through
adversity.  
  
Q. It sounds weird talking about this because you guys lost, but that
was one of the best performances in the conference tournament from an
individual standpoint. How do you put that into perspective what she did,
trying to keep you guys in that game as much as possible?  
JIM FLANERY: I don't know. I mean, I think it says a lot about our team from
the standpoint that we said, you know, four of our five starters got an award
from the league. Lauren was sportsmanship, Bree was most improved, Marissa was
second team and Audrey was first team, and the one kid who didn't get
recognized was Syd, which is fine, but I think it speaks to the balance of our
team.  
  
I've had a couple -- I had a coach ask me, well, how would you vote all-
conference for your team, because I want to take that into account when I put
in my all-conference ballots, what do you think. And I was like, uh, doing
that, because I think we are so balanced. On a given night Sydney can be our
best -- easily today. So I think that speaks to the balance that we have, and
also speaks to the willingness of others to kind of just let somebody go when
they're playing well and not force plays. There were a couple times where I
thought Sydney had Audrey open on a lift, she shot the ball, but they went in,
because I think that was what she was feeling.  
  
When you put the ball -- the thing about Sydney is when you put the ball in
her hands you know she's going to make a good decision. She's been a really
high assist-to-turnover ratio kid throughout her career, and then the other
thing that's really pleasing is what she's done on the glass, 15 rebounds in
that game, including four on the offensive end. I just thought she played --
for a kid who played 40 minutes yesterday, for her to come out and get 15
rebounds today says a lot about what kind of heart she played with, over and
above her productivity from a scoring standpoint.  
  
Q. The game plan obviously was to give Danielle and Amani some space to
plug up things for the other players. From their perspective, how did they
exploit those things, and how much did that compromise what you were trying to
do defensively?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, I thought -- as much as King was kind of -- King and
Blockton kind of owned the first half, I thought Wilborn was more prominent in
the second half. She's just creative with the ball. You know, we can play way
off her, but she still can get to five feet and finish with her hand. Nothing
against Lauren, but we don't have a great match-up with Lauren on their team.
We tried her on Hiedeman some, and maybe in retrospect we should have played
her on Hiedeman a little bit more, but even then, she finished not just over
Lauren, she finished over Audrey, Jaylyn, Sydney. They're tough because,
again, you look at their team and you've got -- their three leading scorers
are Davenport, Hiedeman and Blockton, and you look and you say, what did
Wilborn and King do, at least I think King is their fourth leading scorer, I
don't think she's their third leading scorer. Great balance, and just --
again, I think -- Wilborn is super creative with the ball, but I like how
attacking King is. Like she attacks. She makes you get back in transition, and
then she's gotten better in the half court, too.  
  
Q. We talked about yesterday how your team -- they usually come out with
a slower start. Today that was quite the opposite. Was that something that you
guys talked about as a strategy heading into the game?  
JIM FLANERY: No, we didn't -- I've long since abandoned the idea that anything
I say in pregame is going to affect our start either way because we've been --
you know, sometimes you try motivation, sometimes you try just matter of fact,
comedy, whatever. It hasn't worked in a lot of cases.  
  
You know, but it does -- I did talk about just Jaylyn said, our resiliency. I
said, I don't know how we're going to get it done, but we can get it done. And
the idea that we started out the press conference yesterday with, we had won
nine games trailing at half. You've got to be confident when you've won that
many games trailing at half.  
  
So when I said at halftime today, we've got them right where we want them,
we're down six. But yeah, our start was great. But I don't know what that -- I
think part of it is you're more tired on day two so you're more relaxed.
You're hyped on day one and you're not tired. You've got that win. But I was
that way as a coach. I felt more relaxed, so I can't imagine -- Matt would
tell you that I'm not always relaxed. And I'm sure that was the case.  
  
And offense is -- I say all the time, it's about relaxing but concentrating,
and sometimes you put too much pressure on yourself, and I think that's where
we were yesterday and where we are a lot of times early in games is we're not
relaxed. So back-to-back I think can help that offensively.  
  
Q. A real postseason atmosphere in the gym today; how can you use a game
like this as you head into more postseason play?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, that's great. That's a great comment because it was -- it
was fun. I told them that -- I told them that throughout the game, enjoy this,
because this is what you're going to experience. I like the fact that we chose
a homesite, because I thought it was a great environment today. I don't know
how many were in the building, but the building is small enough that it was
rocking and our kids enjoyed that. And like you said, it's good prep for -- we
played a good team in front of a good crowd, and we competed and battled, and
every time it looked like we were dead we came back. So I think it's great
preparation for whatever, a week and a half from now.  
  
Q. Even though it's a disappointing day, historic, too, as far as being
ranked. It's an amazing accomplishment. Talk about the strides the program has
made.  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, I think it is from the standpoint that I think there's --
it's a little -- in my opinion, it's a little difficult to make headway on the
women's side than the men's side because there are so many guys leaving on the
men's side to go, so I think that takes away or that allows for parity,
whereas Maya Moore and Brittney Griner and those guys stay for four years on
the women's side, and that makes it -- if Maya Moore was leaving after one
year, you kind of -- so I think it's a little bit harder to make the gains.  
  
I think what DePaul has done has been great, and I think we've hopefully been
-- our profile has been elevated, I think, by admittance into the Big East, so
we're excited about that. We're excited about where we were when we came into
the league because we were coming off a year in the NCAA Tournament when we
came in the league, but I think our program is in good shape going forward,
and I told our team, we played 11 of our 20 conference games against teams in
the top 65 of the RPI. Nothing against our old conference, but we didn't --
that wasn't the case. So we played -- there are five other teams in the top
65, and to get to play 10 regular season and today, it's a great challenge,
and it's fun, and it's going to prepare us for the NCAA Tournament.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

### [Lauren Prochaska](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32756)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 59, St. Johns - 41  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Once again, I'm really pleased with the energy that our players
and the focus that our players brought to the beginning of the game. In an
overview, I think that we really played with good energy. I thought we had a
good defensive game plan and did a good job defensively, and at the same time,
on the offensive side of the basketball, while we had some good individual
possessions, I don't think that we did a great job offensively of getting into
any kind of rhythm or flow, so I think offensively we were very, very choppy
all game.  
  
I'm thrilled that we were in position to be up 24 points when you're not
playing well offensively, and that speaks to the defensive side of the ball
and what we were able to do defensively.  
  
I just think that has to really get cleaned up for tomorrow. St. John's is a
really good basketball team. They've had some really good wins this season.
Joe Tartamella and his program is a really, really solid program. They're very
tough. They're very tough defensively. They're going to make you work very,
very hard to score.  
  
A big part of our offensive lack of flow must be credited to the St. John's
defense, but I still think we've got to find a better flow.  
  
We got in foul trouble in the first half with some unintelligent fouls, and I
think that helped chop us up. It's great to have Jessica January back. She
just really brings us energy and competitiveness. And Lauren Prochaska,
sitting next to me, has been an unsung hero throughout the season. People
don't think that she does very much because her numbers don't jump off the
page at you. We wouldn't have won the Big East regular season without her
stepping in for Jessica and playing the kind of ball she's played all season.  
  
Again, I'm really excited about the opportunity to play Marquette tomorrow.
Marquette is an excellent ballclub. I could talk to you more about Marquette
after we talk to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jess, this is just your fourth game back, and you exploded for 20
points tonight, three of four from downtown. How did you find your rhythm so
fast?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Well, I think I'm obviously really excited to be back, and
like Bruno said, we kind of had a choppy game offensively, and I think
everyone just did a good job being aggressive still and trying to take
advantage of the easy opportunities that we did have.  
  
Q. Lauren, are you able to talk at all tonight about your role as kind
of the engine of the offense and also your defensive work on Aaliyah Lewis?  
LAUREN PROCHASKA: It's definitely a team effort. It's not I stop you, it's we
stop they, and I think we did a pretty good job. Aliyyah was coming off an
amazing scoring game last night, so I think everyone did a really good job of
when it was their time to step up and defend, got the job done overall pretty
well.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a very big game coming up against Marquette
tomorrow; what's the biggest thing that you're really looking out for
concerning their offense, and what exactly are you going to take away from
this game? Obviously St. John's is a very active team, very fast team, that
you're going to be able to carry over and guarantee yourself a win?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Like you were saying, Marquette is a really aggressive team
and they're extremely athletic, and I think that we were able to play against
some of that tonight, against St. John's. And we're really just going to have
to do the same thing, execute the defensive game plan and try to get some
better flow offensively.  
  
Q. Coach Bruno, you talked about having a game plan defensively, and it
was clearly executed well, shutting down Aaliyah Lewis for the most part and
really frustrating her. What went into that defensive effort?  
DOUG BRUNO: Because we are a team that scores the ball, I like to score the
ball. I don't think people have ever thought of us as a defensive basketball
team. But we've always worked very hard to be a good defensive basketball
team. And if you're scoring in the 80s, you're going to give up points, and
the speed of the game with which we play, we tend to give up points.  
  
But I have great assistant coaches. All of my assistants are great scouts. So
we spend a lot of time examining film and understanding what our opponents'
strengths are and weaknesses are. It was beneficial to us to have Jade Walker
in foul trouble the first half. That was huge for us, and I just think that we
were able to also do a real nice job -- it was a team effort defensively. You
know, we were able to one-man monster or one-man zone off of Simmons, so there
was always a secondary player in the paint when Lewis did penetrate. It's not
like we just shut her down by herself. We always had a secondary defender in
the paint, and I think that was really, really important, as well.  
  
It's never -- Lauren said it but she said it very quickly and she's very quiet
when she speaks. She said, it's about we stop they, it's not about I stop
mine, and I think that's what she was trying to say.  
  
The second half, I thought we did do a good job of getting to Jade Walker with
the secondary defenders well when Joe's game plan coming out of halftime was
to go right at us with Walker. I thought we did a good job of getting a
secondary defender to her in the second half, also.  
  
Q. Marquette, a team that you guys have played twice and fell to, is
very hard to beat a team three times, but playing on their home court, what
extra challenges does that bring to your team fighting for the Big East
title?  
DOUG BRUNO: The concept of beating a team three times is something that people
like to say, and I guess it's true, but the way we approach basketball is we
never play three times, we play one time. And we played them once in Chicago
and we felt like that game, to Marquette's credit, they came and took it from
us after we had a 15 or 16 point lead. Prochaska here went down in the second
half.  
  
In Game 2 here in Milwaukee, they just kicked our butts. I mean, they just
came out and flat-out beat us from the opening jump to the end of the game,
and that's, again, a credit to a really, really talented Marquette team.  
  
I'm really excited for the Big East that Marquette is as talented as they are.
I really can't say it often enough, that when you look at their résumé, they
have beaten Oregon State, they have beaten Arizona State. These are two teams
that everybody is saying the PAC-12 is the best conference in the country, and
these are two of the better teams in the PAC-12, and Marquette beat those two
teams.  
  
We're not a shabby team. Their wins over us I think count for something. So
Marquette is really, really talented. And it starts Danielle King is averaging
27.5 against us, so those are pretty good numbers. But they just have talent
at all five spots. Blockton is really a special basketball player. Davenport
is just really tough inside. Just can go on and on. Wilborn comes off the
bench. I didn't even talk about Hiedeman. She's had a triple-double. They're a
hard team to guard. I'm excited for the atmosphere tomorrow.  
  
I'm blessed to be the only guy in this tournament that got to play coach Al
McGuire. So I know Milwaukee arena before it was the mecca and what the place
was like when it was packed, and we walked out with three-piece suits and we
walk up to the corners made sure the place was packed. You put visitors up in
one corner for sure. So I know what this Marquette thing is all about, and I'm
excited about that, and I'm excited about the fact that now women's basketball
-- I expect it's going to be a full house, taking on a stage that is the Al.  
  
He's up there in heaven right now saying, when I grew up in Brooklyn I never
thought about girls playing basketball, but you know what, this is pretty
cool, and now we're going to be rocking in both corners in the Al. So I mean
I'm just excited for the game. I think we'll make it a good game. I know
Marquette will make it a good game. So I think it'll be a good classic battle.  
  
Then you've got the rivalry factor. Marquette and DePaul are two great rivals,
and DePaul and Notre Dame. But before there were leagues, there were
independents. Marquette played DePaul twice, Marquette played Notre Dame
twice, Marquette played Dayton twice, the four of us played each other twice.
So we are natural rivals. Kids from Chicago go to Marquette. Kids from Chicago
go to DePaul. It's just a big, big game. It's an extension of the Packers and
the Bears, even though the Bears haven't made it a rivalry for about 15 years.
It's an extension of the Bears-Packers rivalry.  
  
It's all that into one, and the Big East has done a great job here hosting the
tournament. Marquette has done a great job hosting the tournament. So I'm just
excited for the opportunity to be a part of what I think is going to be a real
cool event for women's sports and women's basketball in the El.  
  
Q. You lost three starters this year. Jessica obviously has returned now
in her fourth game playing. When she went down you saw so many players step up
into different roles, but now that she's back, how do you help create that
same energy of those players stepping up even though she's returned?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, Jessica gives us energy. She gives us energy, she gives us
competitiveness, she gives us talent. It's all about working it all together
and getting it all into a flow and into a sync. That's what we're trying to
put together right now. We've had some good flow since she's been back. In
four games here we've had a lot of really great flow. I'm not overly concerned
about the fact that -- St. John's was the reason it was always a -- you've got
to always give credit to the opponent, and you can't just say we were bad on
offense. You have to understand that St. John's is good defensively. They made
us bad on offense. We have to recover from that even though we did win the
basketball game handily, we still have to recover and find some flow between
tonight and tomorrow.  
  
But we have to -- Marquette is a great ballclub. When we average 81 points a
game, you can't be giving -- you can't average 81 and give up 96 and give up
102, even though it was an overtime game. That's a lot of points. You have to
do better than that. They're good and they're hard to guard, but still, that's
a lot.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Aaliyah Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32739)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 56, Villanova - 40  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, really proud of our effort tonight. This has been an
elephant in the room for about five games for us, and Villanova has kind of
beat us up a little bit in the last five. Really just proud of how we were
able to take control of the game probably after the first possession of the
game that they had. Coming into half tied, we felt pretty good about how we
guarded, and we felt if we could produce that same effort in the second half,
we felt we could score at a higher rate than we did. Obviously having Akina
out with foul trouble, and then Aaliyah Lewis was as good as she's been, and
couldn't happen to a better player or a better kid.  
  
We know how special she is, and she showed it tonight against obviously a very
well-coached team.  
  
I thought we won a lot of the areas we needed to. We came in with a deficit on
the glass. We were able to finish that on the plus side. They had more second
chance points. They had zero in the second half. We did a lot of things that
we tried to prepare for, and we saw a lot of engagement from everybody on our
team. Really pleased with the effort.  
  
And now we've got to get ready quickly obviously as we turn for tomorrow
against DePaul.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, coming into this tournament as defending champions of last
year, do you guys have the same mindset coming into this tournament?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: Yes, I'll say we have the same mindset. You know, we're kind of
in the same predicament as last year, three games in three days, so we just
take each game day by day, and we already got one down, and we're on to the
next.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, what would you say was the key to you being able to score
the ball so well tonight?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: I sat down and watched film with Coach, and he told me to push
the ball in transition. I executed the game plan, and I think that was my
strength tonight.  
  
Q. This game is tied at 23. Coach said you felt pretty good. What
shifted, though, for you guys to really separate yourselves?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: I would say our energy and also we stayed together the whole
time, and we just told each other we know they're going to make shots but
we've got to keep our head up and stay mentally focused. We just executed the
game plan on the defensive end and and we got out and scored and that got us
the win today.  
  
Q. Was that elephant in the room on the players' minds going into this
that you didn't want to see your season end to the team you've had trouble
beating?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: True. I think it's probably been four or five games we
consistently kept losing to them, and now we're in the tournament, and this is
the opponent that we wanted to face against, and we got them today, and we
played really well, and I'm happy for my team.  
  
Q. That defensive identity this team has, how much could that matter in
a game like tomorrow against such a high-powered attack in DePaul?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: Yeah, we know DePaul are a great offensive team and we're a
great defensive team, so we're all going to lock in tonight, watch a little
bit of film, and we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. Obviously tonight you were awarded your trophy for Defensive Player
of the Year in the BIG EAST Conference and you were able to come out and
provide some amazing defense. Can you elaborate for us a bit how you were able
to really lock down on Villanova and take advantage and provide some amazing
defense?  
AALIYAH LEWIS: I was just using my strength. I'm quicker than everybody, just
get out in transition. I'm smaller than everyone, they're going to try to
bully me inside, posting me up, just stay in front and be physical right back
with them and stay focused the whole time. That's it, just play my game.  
  
Q. Just take us into what the overall game plan was. Obviously you were
very successful, but what did you see from this game that you're going to be
able to take over tomorrow to DePaul, and what worked for you guys best?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I mean, Villanova is such a unique team in how they play, but
so is DePaul. Creighton plays in a similar fashion. But you know, I think the
takeaway for us is just our ability to prepare for a game, execute that game
plan, and then play as a group and really play the 40 minutes. The goal was to
win every five, obviously, and win every 10 minutes as you go through. We
didn't do that in the second. However, we did it three out of four. And for
us, finishing the third and the fourth, and the third quarter kind of tells it
all at 21-6 where you can kind of take a stranglehold of the game.  
  
You know what, I think the way we're able to guard didn't -- I thought
affected us in a positive way, where in the past it's affected us in a
negative way. Sometimes we would let a play on one end affect us on the other
end, and tonight we didn't do that, and that's a big thing is next play,
especially in postseason it's huge because you've got to get over the play
before.  
  
So I thought we did a really good job. I thought Jade -- and I talked with
Jade for a while about how we wanted to play her in this game, and I thought
she really bought into it. And her numbers may not look the same, but what she
provided us was really important for us to win, and we're going to need that
moving forward, as well.  
  
Just really pleased. I mean, people forget we lose Imani the last eight games
of the year, a kid who was playing the best she's played, giving us a lot of
versatility defensively, so we're trying to figure that out. And Maya has done
an unbelievable job stepping in, and we knew she was that good.  
  
But I think tonight is about Aliyyah. Tonight really was her night, and we
need that from her since that's what she can do. But it's not about one
player. I think we take away here that when we really dig in and play as a
group that we can accomplish things that they may not even think were
possible, and that's the beauty of any game.  
  
I'm just pleased that they were able to get over that hump of being able to
beat this team.  
  
Q. Aliyyah has been the floor general, really the heart and soul of this
team, but a lot of times you see her dishing out assists, but today she was
able to shoot from range. How much does that impact the momentum of this team
offensively when she's knocking down shots from range?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think everybody's game plan is for her to shoot it, so it
changes a lot of people's thought process through the game. So when she can do
that, it's kind of put the hands up in the air and tip your hat sometimes.  
  
But I think when she's making shots, it changes the complexion of our team
because now you don't just have maybe one or two guys that can flick it on
you, but her game just then expands, because now if you have to respect the
outside shot, she can go by you. And really, I think for her she's worked on
this, she's worked on it her whole career. It hasn't been probably as
consistent as she'd like it to be, but the lights were on tonight and the
pressure was on tonight, and these are the kids that play for us, and they
want to be in these moments, and they're going to have more.  
  
You know, but the beauty of it is to watch them really play well, all right,
so really, really happy for her.  
  
Q. What kind of legacy does she leave on this program?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think people look at her and they marvel, oh, I love that
kid. They don't watch her every day. That kid has practiced every single day
she's been here. She does not take a day off. She practices as hard as you
watch her play out there. I think she squats three times her weight, like
benches like twice her weight. She's a freak. She really is. And that's her
like just at a normal day. You know, and so I marvel at what she does on a
daily basis. I'm really proud of how she's grown from a leadership standpoint
because she's not an overly vocal person. She started her first 10 games as a
freshman, and then I sat her because I had Eugenia McPherson came off an ACL
that year, and she was a fifth-year senior, and we plugged her in. And Aliyyah
had to go from starting 10 games to then coming off the bench on a team that
played in the final of the Big East Championship that year and played in the
tournament and went to the second round.  
  
And so I knew at that moment that we had a pretty special kid, but I knew when
I watched her at Bishop Ford High School she would take a ferry and a bus two
hours each way to get to high school. What kid would do that? A kid from New
York, but kids do that. I'll miss her more than she'll be know, but her legacy
will be one that -- it's one for the little guys, I guess, is like the -- as
you would say. But people like -- thanks for taking -- people tell me thanks
for taking a chance on a kid who's small, like people who have kids who are
smaller, like parents who just watch. So people look up to her that she
doesn't even know.  
  
I'm really happy for her, but I know she wants more. She doesn't just want it
to be about her, she wants it to be about winning, and that's been the biggest
thing in our program over the years is to make sure it's about the group and
not one player and being able to win these types of games.  
  
Q. Seeing how tonight's starting five played against Villanova after
struggling this season, are you going to use the same starting lineup tomorrow
night or are you going to change it up a little bit?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Wow, we'll keep them guessing. I mean, I've started the same
lineup every game. Outside of Maya stepped in for Imani. I don't know, we'll
see what happens. But I think they probably know what we're going to do.  
  
But no, I've been pleased with our group who's started the games. We've had
Maya step in for Imani. You've got to be able to adjust on the fly. I thought
we did a good job of that today because lineups, again, playing bigger,
playing smaller. DePaul can give you mismatches. I would expect the tempo to
be pretty high octane, plus they had the ability to rest some players today in
their game.  
  
But it's this time of year. You know, this is what it's all about. This is why
you prepare when you're really in July.  
  
Again, you don't know what's going to happen at the end of the year, but the
guys that don't play as much and really for me from the beginning to the end,
they were as engaged as they've ever been in a game for 40 minutes, and so
that to me was really pleasing to be able to see, especially when they had an
opportunity to maybe get in for a couple minutes.  
  
But we have players on our team now that may have played limited minutes that
have to do some big things tomorrow. So we'll see. But I would expect us to --
I think we're pretty much an open book at this point. So I would think we'd
have something similar tomorrow, yeah.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 56, Villanova - 40.  
  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, I just thought that St. John's defense showed up today.
In the first two games we played them, their defense did not show up. I think
we scored 55 in the first game and we scored like in the 60s in the second
game. So today their defense showed up, and when it does, it's very difficult
for us to score because they take away a lot of our perimeter shots.  
  
Q. How did you feel at halftime when it was tied 23-23?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I felt like we were in trouble because we couldn't score. You
know, we couldn't get three-point shots, and we couldn't score inside, and
eventually I felt like our defense would break down because they were driving
the ball and we were having a hard time guarding them. I just felt like
eventually you can only hold back something so long, you've got to score the
ball. In the third quarter you saw what happened, we only scored six points.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the first half, you talk about their defense, but
they were really pressuring you, the length of the court, the on-ball
pressure. Did that then end up taking a toll in the second half on you?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I think it took a little bit of a toll. It took us out of our
rhythm. We started our offense a little farther away from the basket than we
normally do. So I just think that it didn't totally disrupt us, but it did
throw us off kilter.  
  
Q. Positives that you take away from your team going into the off-season
if you go bigger picture on the season?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, it's just a young team who's trying to learn how to
play. Sometimes they're going to fall apart and sometimes they're not. We beat
them twice in the regular season, and I'm shocked that we beat them twice in
the regular season. But that's what young teams do. And then in a big
environment like this when they get more pressure, young players tend to not
step up, and then they have to learn to step up.  
  
Q. If you look at this one in the second half, Lewis just takes control.
Coach was saying earlier, normally teams look for her to be the one shooting
because her jump shot can be kind of shaky. When she's hitting jumpers like
that --  
HARRY PERRETTA: Right. Again, they came to play, and she's a senior, and she
came to play, and Adrianna is a sophomore and Adrianna could not guard her.
It's like saying the difference between the three games.  
  
Q. How much did Adrianna develop from last summer to now, and how
promising is that for her final two years?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I think she's developed a little bit. She still has to develop
defensively. But the problem is she's struggled more this year because she
didn't play with Caroline. Caroline took a lot of pressure off her.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

### [Danielle King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32736)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 80, Georgetown - 66  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I'm just so proud of my team's toughness today. Obviously it
was started by Natisha Hiedeman. For her to roll her ankle and come out there
and just play for her team in postseason play, she set the example for us.  
  
Points in the paint, Georgetown had 22. We talked all week that we were going
to protect our paint, and everything is going to be cluttered and we were
going to make them jump shooters.  
  
How our team has progressed and how coachable they are in one year says a lot
about them, and I'm just really proud of the fact that they can follow a game
plan much better than they did a year ago. I just can't say enough about our
balance. That's what I just talked to them in the locker room. It's nice to
know that every other possession somebody else is stepping up, and you don't
have to rely on one person to take the load in scoring. They just play so well
together. They share the basketball. They're fun to watch. They're fun to
coach. I'm blessed.  
  
Q. Danielle, this was a career high for you in assists. How have you
evolved as a floor general for your team, do you think?  
DANIELLE KING: I just attack more, and that way it opens up for my teammates.
When I look to be a scorer, it opens up for them because a lot of people
collapsed and the assists are there just by that mentality alone.  
  
Q. Natisha, you go gown with an ankle injury pretty early but you come
back out, hit a couple big shots, what's your mentality in a moment like
that?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: We've been talking about toughness all year, and I just --
you know, it's a big game, and I want to be in it. You know, I just know that
my teammates were going to bring the energy back, and I was ready to go. So
good.  
  
Q. Natisha, how painful was the ankle injury? Did you think you were
going to be able to come back?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I think the adrenaline -- I knew I was coming back
regardless, so either way I knew I was coming back.  
  
Q. Danielle, how does the tournament format set up for you as somebody
who leads the team?  
DANIELLE KING: Well, it helps us a lot being able to play the teams two times
already, so we just know what we have to fix, and we know the teams like the
back of our hands, so it's just about execution.  
  
Q. What does it mean to win your first Big East Tournament game?  
DANIELLE KING: I'm excited because last year around this time we were out of
the tournament. I'm excited to get to play Creighton again.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: For me, too, I'm just excited. I want to keep playing. I
want to go as far as we can. So I know that this win means a lot to us, and
this is just a start.  
  
Q. You really got out on the Hoyas in transition 21-14 on fast break
points. Was that part of the game plan going in?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: It's always part of our game plan. We play fast, and we know
that we're at our best when our tempo was flowing, and we're not stagnant. So
for us, it doesn't matter who we're playing. That's always our pace of play.  
  
Q. Coach, what's the word on Allazia, it looked like she got clocked
pretty hard there at the end of the game. Is that serious or just a
nosebleed?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Just a nosebleed. We're fixing her up. We're fighters. She's
good.  
  
Q. Also, have you talked to Danielle a lot about developing as a
facilitator? Seems like the past couple weeks she's really come into that role
strong and she's getting up to double digit numbers in assists.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, she's so improved and I'm so proud of her. We talked at
the end of last year about having her go to point guard college. She went to
that, and her and I spent a lot of time. We spent a lot of time in the
mornings shooting. We spent a lot of time watching film, and I couldn't be
more proud of her. She's really developing. I tell her that she needs to have
a general mentality, and she's really starting to take that over.  
  
The team is really responding to her. You can see in huddle she's really
trying to direct and lead.  
  
Q. You also broke the single season record today for threes made for
Marquette. Was that a goal headed into the season?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I didn't even know that. No, our goal is to share the ball, so
if it means that we're penetrating and we're kicking out for threes, we just
want the best shot for Marquette. So if it's in the paint, great, if it's a
three, excellent. So we just want to take the best shot.  
  
Q. When you guys are playing like you are today or when you want to play
that up-tempo offense, when Danielle is playing like she is, how helpful is
that for you guys?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, she sets the tone for us no doubt, so we know when she's
pushing tempo, everything is kind of falling into place. Last year I think it
was funny because some of our players were like, we can't keep up, Coach,
she's going too fast. And I think they're starting to learn how to play with
each other. You can just see it now. There's so much chemistry on the floor we
might have not had even at the beginning of this year, and they're really
starting to play off each other well. So she sets the tone. She's our
X-Factor, no doubt.  
  
Q. When you guys last played Georgetown they forced you guys to commit a
lot of turnovers. Today early on it seemed like that was happening again. What
is it about that Georgetown defense that is so pesky and how were you able to
correct that in the second half of the game?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I give a lot of credit to Georgetown. They're a great-
coached team and they're really scrappy and they play really hard, so they get
their hands on a lot of loose balls and they get down low, and they just do a
phenomenal job with being aggressive and being tough. So for us, we knew that
was going to happen. We knew that that was going to be part of their game
plan. We weathered the storm a little bit, but obviously that's something
we'll look at in film going into the Creighton game.  
  
Q. Coach, two of their highest scorers, Woodard and Adomako, were held
to pretty inefficient shooting. What was the game plan to hold them down
tonight?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, pack the paint. You know, we wanted to be in our gap
defense, and any time anybody drove we wanted to stunt and make sure we had
two on the ball at all times, so I think that really helped.  
  
Q. As a coach, can you quantify the advantage of being the home team
here, what this means for your team?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean, it's phenomenal. First of all, our girls to play in
front of their fans, they love to play in this building, so for us we get
really energized here. So I'm hoping that we can keep getting more crowds
every round. So hopefully the Creighton game is packed and they feed off that,
I feed off that, and it's one of the best venues in America, so we're lucky to
have it here.

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

### [Tori Schickel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32725)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please?  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, we've got the utmost respect for Creighton and Jim
Flannery for his program and how they play and how they go about their
business. We knew coming in that we didn't have to play perfect but we had to
play well. We couldn't make mistakes because they're a team that doesn't.  
  
I thought our kids were fantastic in the first half. I thought our kids
throughout the entire game gave great effort. There is a lot for us to take
and learn from this experience, and that's what we want to do. We want to
continue to build and continue to grow as a team. I thought we did a lot of
really good things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: A note about Butler, their second straight year which they've
moved on to the quarterfinals in the Big East tournament. Questions for Tori.  
  
Q. Tori, what was the key to such a fast start for you guys?  
TORI SCHICKEL: Coach has always said we have to get out to a fast start those
first five minutes and kind of set the pace. And we wanted to be really
physical in those first five minutes to just set the tone and relay to them
that we're here, we're playing hard, and we're going to set the pace in the
first couple minutes. Then hopefully relay that through the whole rest of the
game.  
  
Q. What did they do so well in the third quarter that made them tough to
stop?  
TORI SCHICKEL: They really hit shots and moved the ball really well. They were
the aggressor. They came up and did what we want to do in the first five
minutes. They push us off the block, off the three-point line and made passes
hard for us. That really hurt us. Instead of us doing that in the first half,
they did the same thing to us in the third quarter.  
  
Q. Tori, early on they were doubling you and kind of leaving Alexa and
leaving Taylor. It seemed they shot them out of doubling you. I guess, what
happened to the offense when they started playing more straight up and playing
you one-on-one on the post? Did that throw you guys off a little bit?  
TORI SCHICKEL: You know, we've kind of been working with that all season,
going back and forth between the double team and whether they're not double
teaming. It's something I have to get better at realizing is when they are
double teaming and when they haven't aren't, and when I should throw the ball
out.  
  
It makes things more difficult for me is when they're not double teaming
sometimes because it's a recognition thing, and when they're just kind of
helping in the middle, but they're not really double teaming. No one else is
really open, so I have to get better at making my move quicker and being
stronger and being able to go up through the contact. 50 did a nice job of
setting straight up and not fouling.  
  
Q. When they get going from the perimeter at all five positions, how
much does that compromise what you're able to do defensively, specifically
down low, and how much does that open up the basket for them when they start
hitting those shots from the outside of the four and five position?  
TORI SCHICKEL: Right. I think when there is a big girl and I can stay closer
into the basket, and I don't have to go out as far, but when they went with
that smaller lineup, I had to stay out on faber. With 17 points, I think she
knocked down basically everything tonight, so I knew I had to stay out on her,
and I couldn't help as much. I could point help on the drive or on screen
rolls. I just wasn't there as much as I could have been when they had their
bigger players in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like in the first half you were really keeping them
from getting a lot of looks inside. You're holding them to some long jumpers.
In the third quarter, was it a matter of ball movement by them or what did you
see that shifted things?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: I think a lot had to do with their kid's mentality. We were
able to push them off the three-point line and try to follow our game plan and
be aggressive off-the-ball situations, and our kids were really good at it in
the first half, and forcing them into short shot clock situations. That's
where we wanted to get to. We wanted to hopefully contain ball penetration
better in those situations.  
  
But I think their kids' mentality was completely different in the second half.
That's Jim. He does a wonderful job, and he knew what he had to do to be able
to advance in this tournament and his kids really turned it on: That's the
type of kid they have. They're experienced and have that winning mentality,
and that's something we aspire for.  
  
Q. What is the next step for your program to get to that mentality of
winning consistently?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: We've got to get some depth, first of all. That's kind of hurt
us all year, so we've got to take this off-season and get our kids
individually better in certain areas so we can get more minutes out of kids.
Then it's really got to be earned. That's kind of the Butler way. You've got
to put in your time and go about your business in the off-season preparing
yourself and in the preseason practices about how you're going to do that. And
that's really kind of how we are. That's how we've got to be, and that's what
I talked to them about in the locker room after the game.  
  
Q. I know it's only a matter of two games, but what does this say about
your group the way you won yesterday? And in that first half today, you were
forming a nice story there.  
KURT GODLEVSKE: I think it's our growth, and it's about what the kids want to
do and want to be. It goes back to what I said yesterday. This isn't the end
for us. First time I talked to a group where I had no seniors and really only
two juniors. So they can make this into whatever they want to.  
  
Q. You went to the half court trap there once Creighton got a little bit
of a lead. What about their ability to kind of bring the trap and then readout
of it made it difficult to turn them over and get back into the game?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: I think it's their size. They've got a lot of length in almost
all the positions and they're able to throw over the top in a lot of those
situations. I think the kids he has also do a great job of reading situations
and want the basketball and cut into open areas. So it's really a combination
of those two things. They've got basketball savvy kids.  
  
Q. What did you see from the sidelines as far as what your offense was
looking for when they started double teaming Tori in the post and kind of
playing everybody straight up once you guys shot them out of the double team
early in the game?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: They still went back to it a little bit. And Alexa had some
shots and we knew going into it, based off of our film with the kids last
night that it was going to take a perimeter effort from our kids to make shots
and shoot shots. Tori had a lot of good looks and opportunities to kind of
make things difficult again for them. She struggled a little bit from the
field. But that's also a credit to Rollerson. She's not an easy kid to move
around and get around inside. That's a great experience for Tori because
that's only going to help her in years to come.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Audrey Faber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30416)

### [Sydney Lamberty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28427)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 64, Butler 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Audrey, Sydney, I guess it looks like you guys hadn't played a
basketball game for a week. Did it feel like you were stuck in the mud there
to start? Did you kind of have to get the instincts going again?  
AUDREY FABER: Yeah, we were playing kind of fast, actually. We were really
anxious coming into the game. Just needed to slow down. We blamed it on nerves
at halftime, so second half, it was a little more comfortable.  
  
Q. It probably helps that you guys have played games like that
throughout the season where the offense has kind of gone through lulls and
you've had to rely on getting stops to stay in games and keep from kind of
getting blown out early. Was that kind of what you guys kept telling
yourselves in that first quarter and the first half?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I mean, whenever offense isn't working, we turn to defense,
and that's what we were doing today. If we can't score off offense, we might
as well try to get something off of defense, whether that's fast breaks or
getting stops.  
  
Q. How do you explain the third quarters? I looked at the numbers
against Butler, it was 16-4, and 22-12, and today it was 22-13. How do you
explain that?  
AUDREY FABER: I don't know, honestly. It's been a trend all season. I don't
know how to explain it.  
  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: We always make jokes that we're a third quarter team. I don't
know if this time we were like, all right, we need to pull it together.  
  
AUDREY FABER: Talking things out at halftime. I don't know what it is.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, I guess obviously Marquette, which the game last time
was unbelievable or Georgetown. Can you talk about each potential team
tomorrow?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I mean, both of them are good teams and quick teams and they
like to fast break a lot. So, I mean, we're going to have to play good defense
to win against them, and whoever we play, we'll just have to focus on defense.  
  
Q. I guess you guys didn't really double Schickel as much as you guys
have in the past, and, Audrey, you got caught a few times on some switches.
What were you trying to do when you were isolated on her to make things
difficult for her?  
AUDREY FABER: Just trying to push her out as far as we could so we didn't get
pinned necessarily, especially me. But then just not fouling, staying straight
up, and only giving her one look. Boxing out and not giving her second
chances.  
  
Q. For the players, I'll ask Flanery this, he doesn't lack for
motivating you guys. But it's a unique position for you that you for all
intents and purposes have kind of locked up and you have a little consolation
prize if you don't play well this weekend. How do you keep your edge and
playing well this weekend and still trying to play for something, even though
you know it's not do or die?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I don't think we've really thought about that. Over the whole
entire season we haven't really talked about the NCAA Tournament. That's
always been the goal and that's the end goal for us, but, I mean, winning this
is a really big goal for us too, and it has been from the start. So I don't
think that's really in the back of our minds right now, especially after last
year too.  
  
AUDREY FABER: Especially after last year too. We lost in the championship
game, so we want to get back there and win it this time.  
  
Q. Flan, what went behind the decision to not double so much on
Schickel? I mean, that usually seems to be the game plan for Butler is to make
other people beat you, but it seemed like you were okay with Bri and Audrey
guarding her one-on-one at times today?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, well, the kids that we kind of felt like we could help off
of made more threes than we wanted them to make. Bailey made one, Buford made
two, Brey made one, so once we got ahead, I felt like we needed to be a little
bit more three-point conscious.  
  
Plus, the other thing, Schickel played 37 minutes yesterday, so there is a
little bit -- in my opinion or in my head, there was a little bit of kind of
willingness to make sure that she was going to make everything before we
doubled her as much as we thought we maybe needed to last weekend.  
  
I think, you know, that's the advantage. I think of them having played, gotten
off the court at 6:00 o'clock last night. So I thought that definitely played
into my mind as far as how much we were going to double.  
  
Q. You find yourselves down 14-5, I guess, kind of late in that first
quarter. You call timeout, and it seemed like you were more concerned that it
was more than just missing shots at that point. What did you say to the team
to get them to relax or refocus or to kind of get them back to playing well?  
JIM FLANERY: You know I never get my team to relax, because I'm the least
relaxed person out there. But I just say get the ball. My frustration was with
the turnovers. I felt like Marissa forced some passes, Syd forced one. I said,
Get the ball up on the rim.  
  
We talked about coming off ball screens and shooting a 15-footer, because
Schickel's not going to come out and defend that. I felt like we kept forcing
the ball to the post off of ball screens and we got hurt. We had a harder time
guarding them in transition. They got probably three lay-ups in the first half
off of turnovers.  
  
So I said, you know, I always feel comfortable that at some point we're going
to make some shots. We've got too many shooters, and I think we're harder to
guard as the game goes on and teams get a little more fatigued. We have to
make them have to communicate as much as we have to make teams communicate.  
  
So it was mostly about taking care of the ball and mid to late shot clock,
taking a shot rather than forcing the pass. I felt like that was the stretch
where I became the most frustrated was the overpassing.  
  
Q. With Audrey getting going there, it seemed like she was the only one
for a while that was hitting any shots. I know with the motion that it's
possible for everybody to get a touch without necessarily being specific. But
was there a point in that first half there where you made a conscious effort
to kind of get Audrey into some scoring positions, considering she got hot
there?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, we felt like we talked a lot about setting flair screens
for both Audrey and Jaylyn. Because they're less likely to switch on four
players. They're less likely to switch on those. So that was a big part of the
game plan, was to set flair screens for Audrey and Jaylyn. You know, but they
also had to read it, and the pass has to be on time.  
  
But typically, again, we don't always read it well, the flair, and we don't
always get the ball there on time. But when we did, I thought she had good
looks. And that was a big part of the game plan, was to set flairs for those
two specifically.  
  
But, even for Lauren, a big part -- the other part was just getting Schickel
away from the basket. That hurt us early in the game. I felt like Bri was
hesitant to shoot the ball from 15, and she hit the line in the second. You
know, we talked about it.  
  
We need to be shot ready, five players from 15 to 17 because the more we can
draw Schickel away from the basket, the more the basket area's going to open
up. We felt like against a team with young guards, you know, we needed to open
up the basket area so that when they miss communicate on switches, the basket
area's open. So that was the other thing where we weren't where we needed to
be early is we just weren't shot ready with our fives.  
  
Q. Jaylyn played a fantastic game, obviously scoring great bursts with
the way she plays. But also defensively she got on the weak side a little
defensively for you guys. Talk about her success there?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, she's been -- she's been just playing her more throughout
the year, the more we played her, the more productive she's been. To your
point, she did a great job on Weaver. Weaver, whether they put shooters on the
floor and they've got Schickel out there, Weaver's tough to stay in front of.
But Jaylyn's length, I thought, really bothered her.  
  
So I thought defensively she made an impact, and I just like her confidence
offensively. If she's open from the three, she's going to take the shot. Then
she's good. You saw in movement. We finally got them to miscommunicate a
little more late. She got some wide-open shots. But just moving without the
ball even earlier, I thought she and Lauren, I think, put a lot of pressure on
defenses because of the way they move without the ball.

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Brooke Schulte](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32737)

### [Jaqui Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32738)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 92, Seton Hall - 60  
  
DOUG BRUNO: I'm just really proud of this basketball team for being able to
focus and not have a hangover from their accomplishments from the regular
season. They just did so much in the regular season, I think it would have
been human nature for them to let down a little bit. And the Seton Hall team
that I watched last night and the Seton Hall team that I watched against St.
John's last weekend is a much improved team. Coach Bozzella has got these
young players playing a lot better as the season goes along here. So I was
really concerned that we were going to get a great Seton Hall shot, and I knew
that we could deal with it if we came out ready to play, and so I just was
really -- I was just really concerned that our players would be ready, and I
was really impressed that they were ready.  
  
It's hard for young people to walk out before a game and receive the accolades
that were so well-deserved and then shut that down right now and go to the
jump ball and be focused and ready for the ballgame, and that's what I was
really impressed with these players about.  
  
Q. Brooke, are you able to talk about the team's strong first-half
performance? You started the game off I think with a turnaround jumper and
things got better from there.  
BROOKE SCHULTE: Yes, well, the coaching staff and Coach Bruno always do a
phenomenal job each and every game of preparing us, and we came in 110 percent
prepared, and I thought as a team we just came out with a spark and ready to
play and ready to have our first game.  
  
Q. Jaqui, you had an outstanding game, really got it going in the third
quarter. What went into that second-half performance?  
JAQUI GRANT: Definitely sitting on the bench with two fouls is always tough
for a player, especially when we just -- everyone wants to be out there.
Coming out strong was definitely something at halftime that I definitely
thought about and the coaches and teammates both gave me confidence just to
play my game.  
  
Q. Brooke, what was behind such success with that full-court press you
guys were in?  
BROOKE SCHULTE: I think just coming out with that spark that I talked about
and answered earlier. Just being ready to play and just having fun with it. We
had our legs there, and we were just coming out and being all over the floor.  
  
Q. Can you explain Jessica didn't do much scoring tonight, but assist on
assist on assist, what it's meant to have her back in the picture?  
BROOKE SCHULTE: I speak for myself, but I love it and I'm pretty sure all of
our teammates love it, she was such a spark on the bench just cheering us on
in such a positive energy and now to have her out on that floor, it's an
mazing feeling.  
  
Q. Jaqui, can you talk a little about that, as well?  
JAQUI GRANT: Yeah, one of the things that isn't really on the stat sheet is
how she forces those turnovers by the other team, by that pressure defense.
Being one-on-one against Jess, I would probably take Jess 10 times out of 10.
That's how much confidence we all have in her, and that's how much we just
love her on the floor. Nine assists, that's amazing, and she does that all the
time like it's nothing. And then two steals, like that's great.  
  
Q. How much has the adversity that you guys have gone through this
season with the starters you've lost, how much does that help you now in a
position like this?  
BROOKE SCHULTE: I think it prepared us, if anything. We had to constantly
change during throughout each season, just changing our lineups and who we had
in, and losing people, and we never succumbed to it. We never let it take us
over, and we definitely just kept a positive attitude, and the players that
were hurt kept a positive attitude and were always there and had our back. I
think as a team we just stayed together.  
  
JAQUI GRANT: Yeah, Coach definitely threw out that whole adversity, no excuses
team, and I think everyone really bought into that, and that was huge from
every single player who played or don't play, like every single person bought
into that, and I thought that was a really big contributor.  
  
Q. Are you able to talk about your bench play tonight, particularly
Chante Stonewall?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, yeah. I mean, the question that was asked of the student-
athletes about playing without Jessica and Ashton and Mart'e, you know, I
think those -- the seven players that were in the rotation all regular Big
East season got valuable experience. I thought Chante really -- she's coming
along as a freshman and she had some great possessions and she had some
freshmen-esque possessions, but I think of all the experience that she was
able to get while Jess was not in the lineup were huge.  
  
Tanita Allen today played with the flu, so it was very -- we didn't know if
she was going to go right up until game time, so it was really -- it was just
kind of important that the bench did play well and she played well. I was
prepared for us to be a seven-player bench again tonight with Jessica being
the seventh player instead of Tanita Allen, but as it worked out Tanita got
some good minutes in, and hopefully she'll be okay by tomorrow.  
  
Q. You had 35 combined points from your freshmen tonight. Can you talk a
little bit about how they've contributed to this run down the stretch?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, Kelly Campbell is a much-deserved all-freshman Big East
player, and she's been playing with us all year long. She's been starting, and
what makes Kelly so special is her competitiveness. And then Chante gave us
some good offensive lift off the bench tonight, knocked down those two threes
in the first half, and really she probably could have had -- she just
sometimes gets a little bit ahead of herself offensively, she probably had two
or three more that she could have knocked down. So I think it was really
important that our freshmen played ball tonight and were ready to play.  
  
I think just everything, every one of these players -- I can't have this
microphone and not speak to Jess January. We're sitting at halftime and she's
got no baskets and eight assists. That's the aspect of the game and our game
that I've noticed the most with her presence back on the floor is our
traditional DePaul ball assist totals and sharing is just unbelievably
different with her out there and her not out there. That was really important.  
  
The other thing about the freshmen giving us good minutes was it allowed us to
-- Schulte and Jessica January played a lot of minutes in the first half, so
they didn't have to play very many minutes at all in the second half. I think
that was very important. We had three players with two fouls that had to sit
most of the first half, and those players got some minutes and Jaqui got some
good third-quarter minutes and Coleman only played three in the first half, so
Tanita Allen down, that's why she had to get more minutes and probably would
have had her out there, but we had nobody else to put in at that point.  
  
Q. Is this the most battle-tested group that you have had?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, I don't know. We play a traditionally tough schedule every
year, so I don't know that it's any more battle-tested than some of the other
teams that we've had. I mean, I just -- the non-conference schedule was
really, really difficult. It's always difficult. It's difficult by design. And
I think you're looking at three No. 1 seeds in our loss column in UConn,
Baylor and Notre Dame, and then Marquette here is really, really good. So
that's a couple of defeats we had to Marquette, that's a really, really good
basketball team in our BIG EAST Conference, as is Creighton. And the two teams
that are going to play in this next game are really well-deserving to be in
this NCAA Tournament, both of them. Everybody thinks I'm crazy when I say
those kinds of things, but some of the football five leagues are not really
that strong in the bottom, so there's some of those leagues that people are
talking about getting eight teams in and some of them do deserve eight, but
some of them have also fattened up on some teams on the bottom of the leagues
that have not been that strong. We'll see how this all plays out.  
  
St. John's and Villanova are both really, really good ball clubs, so we'll see
how the next game plays out, but this is a great league that we play in. And
the teams like Seton Hall tonight, that's a really -- they are a strong
basketball team. Tony has got young players, so they've had to -- got through
some tough experience this year as freshmen and had to play, but they're going
to be really, really good down the road. Hilaire is going to be really, really
good. Winters is going to be really, really good, Samuels. They've got
everybody back, large access back, a large group coming back. Marquette has
got great group coming back. Villanova has got everybody coming back. And I'm
probably forgetting somebody a that's got a lot of people coming back, but
this league is just going to keep getting better and better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 92, Seton Hall - 60  
  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I give congratulations to DePaul. I voted for Doug for Coach
of the Year because he's done such a great job for many years, but this year I
thought was his best job. He's taken the team that's been decimated by
injuries, and obviously now January is back and really still kept them at the
same level if not even a higher level. We know how great a team they are. We
were fortunate to win some games against them the past two years, but they
handled themselves so well.  
  
Someone asked me, oh, it's a tough chore, you've got them. I was glad we
played them because I was glad we won a game to play them because I wanted our
kids to see what the best is like, and there's no fooling here. Taking nothing
away from Creighton, which is an outstanding team, but DePaul is year-in and
year-out the best team. If you want to be the best, which is obviously the
goal and the standard that Seton Hall wants to have, then you have to play the
best.  
  
And this is where you were and so you can't go in the summer being like, oh,
we only lost a quarterfinal game in some other bracket by a few here and
there. No, no, we know we got our rear-end kicked by a really good team. So if
we want to become a really good team, which is the people who are in our
program, that's what their standard is, then we know what we have to do. And I
was so, so happy to be in that bracket. And I was so happy to win yesterday
because I wanted the opportunity for our kids to see what the best of the best
is on this thing, because a lot of our kids weren't on the teams that went to
the championship game and made two NCAAs in a row like we did.  
  
So this is great. I give Doug a lot of credit. The score isn't indicative of
what it could have been. He handled himself with class like their whole
program is. I really wish them a lot of luck. Obviously you don't want to root
for one team or another in a tournament like this, but I would love to see
DePaul be successful so they can get a top 16 seed and let's get them on a
run. We've had Syracuse and Washington maybe make a miracle run. I'd love to
see this DePaul team because they really exemplify I teamwork. They've had a
lot of individual injuries, and I'd love to see this team go really far.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the positives that you take with you into the off-
season with your program?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Well, again, we've played well the last few weeks, and
obviously we won a game yesterday, which was important. I mean, that game was
important, one, you want to get a win and, two, you want to advance in the Big
East Tournament to play the best team. We did and while they dominated us
today, I still think you see someone like Jayla Jones-Pack had 13 points and 5
rebounds, made some nice moves. Deja Winters got more experience, even though
she didn't shoot the ball well, got more experience.  
  
KK, even though she struggled against great women guards, which they are, she
was able to see how strong she has to get and how hard she has to work in the
off-season and do everything, and I wanted this to help us win the Big East
Tournament either next year or the year after or the year after, and it will.  
  
Q. This conference, if you could speak to it here, your third or fourth
year now with this program and you've seen this league evolve here through
four years, can you speak to where it stands and what's next for Big East
women's basketball?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I think it's interesting, and I think obviously Creighton
and Marquette will get into the tournament and Villanova and Georgetown and
St. John's if they don't win this tournament will be in the NIT. I'm
interested to see where it goes and how successful they are, because obviously
we were in the tournament the last two years, and unfortunately couldn't win a
game. We were in that eight-nine slot, and obviously St. John's got in the
tournament last year and wasn't successful winning their game. So I'd like to
see someone else win a game, whether it's a Creighton or Marquette or someone
else who wins the tournament, Villanova or St. John's at this point.  
  
So I think that'll show us, but I do think it shows that we have a competitive
league. We have good teams, and very good coaches. I think you can take our 10
coaches and put them up against any coaches in the country. There's no
question about that.  
  
If we can get a little more TV for the league and get a little more publicity,
I think that's been a big success with the men. They've done a great job on
their things and we have a great partner in Fox and they're trying their best
to get us more and more coverage, and I think if we can accomplish that we can
even grow even more. But we're lucky to have a partner like Fox. We really
are.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Natasha Adair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28400)

### [Faith Woodard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32735)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 80, Georgetown - 66.  
  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, obviously not the outcome that we wanted. But like I told
our team, this time of year, it just comes down to those extra-effort plays. I
felt like coming out of the half, we made a run. But there were just
opportunities that we needed to capitalize on that we didn't.  
  
The beauty of this team is we didn't quit, and that's just not who we are. We
competed. But my hat goes off to Carolyn and her program. They stepped up.
They made big shots. That's just what they do.  
  
You know, it's hard as I sit here because it's more about my players, Faith
Woodard as a senior, who's had one heck of a senior campaign, who's even -- I
mean, we're not even sitting here without her. So you know, this part is hard,
but the big picture is where we've grown as a program, as individuals. This
doesn't feel well, but we're still a team that will be playing in the
postseason, so it's not the end of our season.  
  
But this also means that there are things we have to work on because our
ultimate goal is to be Big East champions. We fell short today, but we will be
back.  
  
Q. Faith, what's it like coming into Marquette and playing against the
home team that's hosting the tournament?  
FAITH WOODARD: I mean, we've played them multiple times. We've played here,
and I know for myself, like as a senior, I've been in this arena, I've played
in this arena, and I think there was just a certain focus and a want to get it
done. Obviously we didn't get the win, but it was something that we focused on
all during the week. You know, we've been here for quite some time. We played,
ran through some plays, and we couldn't get it done. But our coaches were just
re-instilling like we have a third chance to get it done. We've played them,
we know their personnel, and it's going to just come down to toughness, grit
and want-to.  
  
Q. As coach said, you guys are going to be a postseason team. What kind
of things are you looking at developing going into this last push?  
FAITH WOODARD: Probably just pushing over the hump and just refocusing and
buying into all of the things that we said that we wanted to do at the
beginning of the season, because it will be a new season for us. So just
staying focused and staying true to the things that we said we wanted to do
because I think that it's well within our capabilities.  
  
And I just think if we just are mentally tough and are able to put this behind
us and start fresh, I think that we have a good shot at going pretty far.  
  
Q. Faith, you've been a part of this program in some tough times and
have risen up to this level here. What can you say about what Coach and you
guys have done here as this program has risen?  
FAITH WOODARD: I would definitely say when I came in as a freshman, there was
a lot of change going on. But I'm just really thankful for the staff that I
got, Coach A, Coach Jenkins and everyone else, Coach Chambers, Coach Howard,
to just give that sense of consistency, that love, and just that we're in it
together, and that's something that, you know, they've instilled in this
program since they've gotten here.  
  
Even when we don't get the ballgames that we want, and even though we have
some adversity to face, I know at the end of the day that we'll be able to do
it together, and that's something that they just said from the very beginning.  
  
My experience here has been really awesome, and I'm looking forward to just
keeping that going with this team during postseason.  
  
Q. Is there anything in particular about this Marquette team this season
that's given you guys a little bit of trouble?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, they can score the ball, I'll tell you that. No, I mean,
coming in, you know that they're very efficient from the field, and what makes
them hard to guard is they're not one-dimensional. You know, they can score,
they can take it off the bounce, and again, we change defenses a little bit,
and that's something we worked on. We went man, we went zone. But your room
for error against them, and especially this time of year, is minimal. If
you're just a half second off that rotation, Yentz is letting it go, and she's
pretty efficient. If you close out and you leave your feet, Blockton is going
to go downhill. Things that we talked about.  
  
But then on the flipside of that, we make a run, and we get six straight
possessions, and we don't score. And so I think it's a double edged sword,
where you're trying to contain them and slow them down, every opportunity that
we get we have to capitalize on it, whether it be lay-ups, whether it be free
throws, the easy opportunities. And so I think it was more about us not
finishing those plays versus what they were going to do because they didn't do
anything out of the norm. I just felt like we didn't finish in areas that we
needed to.  
  
Q. You guys had -- I felt like you guys moved the ball really well
today. It was something like 14 assists on 24 made field goals. The passing
looked good today. Can you talk a little bit about that?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, we worked on a little five-out option and we didn't want
the ball to stick. Again, if you're not moving the ball, defense is stagnant.
So we just really wanted to have more movement, and in our offenses, everyone
who touched the ball is an option, it just depends on where. We wanted to open
the floor, create opportunities to the rim.  
  
But again, they packed it in a little bit, and teams force us to shoot because
our three-point field goal percentage isn't as high as we would like for it to
be. But there were still opportunities for us to bring them away from the rim
and get things around the rim.  
  
So I felt like the game plan going in was the right one, and I just felt like
in areas where we got the shots that we wanted, we had the pace in a sense
that we wanted, it just came down to finish, and we just didn't finish.  
  
Q. In terms of that and in terms of what you said earlier about being a
postseason team, what are you guys looking for in terms of selection, and
given that, what are you guys going to work on going into the postseason?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, right now, we'll see what the postseason options are. I
haven't looked that far. But I know there will be some.  
  
Regardless of who we play, it's going to come down to defense. It's going to
come down to making sure we make it hard for any opponent.  
  
And then on the flipside, the efficiency of what shots we're taking, who's
taking the shots, and we'll go back and watch some of this film, and film
sessions are learning sessions for our team. Good shots, bad shots, winning
plays, time and score, because this team is still learning, and for us to be
that team that we want to ultimately be and consistently be, we have to
continue to grow, and so we will get better.  
  
Q. How does playing in this conference prepare you for the postseason?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Oh, it's the best conference in the country in my opinion. To
go night in and night out from top to bottom, it doesn't even matter who
finishes where, all the coaches in the league are very talented. Each team,
they pose a different challenge, and I think that whoever we face, whether
they play a five-out motion, whether they have perimeter scorers, whether they
have players that can take you off the bounce or just defensive-minded teams,
playing in this league night in and night out will prepare you for anyone in
the country.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Brian Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28397)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Butler - 68, Xavier - 66  
  
BRIAN NEAL: My opening statement would be, I guess, I thought Butler was
locked in more for the game. I did a poor job of having our team ready for the
environment that we were going to play in. I think that they didn't blink
throughout the game, and there were a couple of times where we blinked. I
thought our players played really hard and showed a great spirit, but we just
couldn't -- I always felt like we were on our heels a little bit too much
mentally. We were trying to force too much, and because we were in that state
where we're forcing things, then even when we got good looks, we were not able
to make the shots that we should be able to make, and I think we just couldn't
get into a good frame of mind, a good rhythm, especially on the offensive end.  
  
Q. What is it about Tori Schickel that makes her so tough to stop?  
BRIAN NEAL: She's a great player. She's got great composure in the low post,
and she's very difficult to play one-on-one, which unfortunately was not our
game plan but what we did a lot tonight. She's a -- she's one of the best low
post players in our conference, and if you are not on detail, she's going to
make you look foolish, and that's the way we look right now.  
  
Q. Just that final sequence, obviously they go one-on-one there to get
that 15-footer. Do you think of that last minute, do anything differently --  
BRIAN NEAL: Yeah, calling a time-out would have helped. I'm coaching 2010,
it's 2017. Should have called time-out and we got plenty of quick hits, and
that's -- I was looking for an advantage before their setup, but it was just a
poor decision on my part.  
  
Q. What's the off-season hold for you and the group?  
BRIAN NEAL: Well, we have a new club, a whole new group coming in. We've got
six signed freshmen and another player or two here coming up. It's
interesting, people look at our record, especially here in the Big East, and
it hasn't -- we certainly haven't won like I felt like the quality of play --
and I think our players have never faltered from an emotional standpoint,
especially some of our younger players, so that's something that we can build
on.  
  
But I, just to be honest with you, felt like we've been playing a play or two
short in some situations, so hopefully these new young players can come in,
can give us some enthusiasm and kind of fill in some of those gaps there.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

### [Michelle Weaver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32724)

### [Tori Schickel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32725)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Butler - 68, Xavier - 66  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: First I'd like to say that I have so much respect for all of
our coaches in the Big East and all of our players in the Big East, and
especially the job that Brian does with Xavier. That was two teams in the Big
East that just went toe-to-toe, possession-by-possession. We had a difficult
time stopping them, and they had a tough time stopping us, and thankfully, we
had two great execution possessions down the stretch that I thought were huge.
Sydney Buck three out of the time-out, what I thought was a fantastic
execution by our kids, and then Michele Weaver's pull-up jumper. But I can't
say enough about how mentally tough our kids are with the type of season that
we've had, and then to come up here and really for the last 10 games just
continued to battle, and I couldn't be prouder of them as a coach.  
  
What can I say about Tori? She's done that all year, and that's why she
doesn't sit down in timeouts, because if she does, her knees start getting
locked up and tired with all the minutes that she's logged, so she's been a
warrior for us. Super proud of all our girls, though. It's been fun, and what
a way to start the Big East Tournament for us.  
  
Q. Michele, when you were dribbling down the last 20 seconds, what was
going through your mind as the clock was ticking?  
MICHELLE WEAVER: Just Coach needed us to get the ball with like nine seconds
left and just go off of a screen and try to get to the basket, and I couldn't
get to the basket, so I decided on a pull-up jumper, shot it, hoped it went
in, and it did.  
  
Q. Michele, Coach talked about it a little bit, but you guys have been
through quite a bit as a team throughout the season. To get a dramatic Big
East Tournament win, what does that mean to this team?  
MICHELLE WEAVER: I think it shows truly who we are as a team, to win, what,
two Big East games and then to come here and not give up at the very end and
not cave in when we were down by some points. So I think it shows who we
really are, that we're able to overcome adversity, what we've been through
this whole season, and still pull out through the very end and get a win in
this tournament.  
  
Q. Tori, this is an automatic for you, but can you tell me what it was
that the working so well for you today?  
TORI SCHICKEL: My teammates did a really nice job of getting me the ball, and
I think that's something we've done all season. We kind of found our offense
good inside, and it's been really key for me to just take a breath sometimes
and just be able to relax and understand when people are coming to double-
team, when to get the ball out to my teammates, but also at the same time to
look to be a scorer as much as possible.  
  
Q. I watched you play, and it seems like sometimes you don't even have
to say anything to Michelle or your guards, just by looking at each other you
guys know what's about to happen, that entry pass to you.  
TORI SCHICKEL: Yeah, for sure. Like I said, Coach has done a nice job in
preparing us to run our offense through the post play, and then our guards do
an amazing job just to get the ball down inside when they can. That's their
first look.  
  
Q. Xavier gets the ball after that big-time shot, what's going through
your mind as a player, that final sequence?  
TORI SCHICKEL: Yeah, we've had issues stopping them all game, and so coming
down, we knew this was a huge stop for us, and we knew they were going to come
at us, try to get a foul or try to get to the basket and shoot a lay-up, so
that was really key for us to get that big stop, just to get a hand on the
ball that was passed and then get the loose ball. That's been something that
we've been working on, just diving after balls and getting on the floor and
being the first person to every ball.  
  
Q. Why hasn't this team -- it could be easy for them to just enter the
postseason with your win total to say, we're done. But why didn't this team do
that today?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: I think it's our youth. I think it's our excitement within our
locker room for the future. We started back in -- really when we lost Kristen
back in January, we started talking about what do we need to do not to get to
the end of March, but what do we need to do to get to beyond March. That's
really been their focus, and I think that they've really taken it day by day.
Really to me it defines their character of how they are as people and why they
got to this level, just because they are competitive kids.  
  
Q. Defensively I think Dion Gaffney went 5 for 11. You really made the
players around her really work for everything they got. What was behind
that?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: That was our game plan coming into this. We new with their
ability to penetrate and with the type of style that Brian runs offensively,
we struggled with it at our place, he really did a fantastic job of changing
up things from Game 1 to Game 2, and so it was our strategy coming into this
to mix things up as much as possible. We stayed on some possessions, we
switched 1 through 3 on some possessions, we switched 1 through 4 on some
possessions, went some zone, went some different presses because we wanted to
try to keep him and his penetrating guards off balance as much as possible.  
  
Q. Last weekend you guys got off to a good start even though you guys
lost. Did that play a factor in building confidence for today's game?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: We've actually had two really good games with them. It was a
four-point game at some point midway through the fourth quarter at their
place, and they're a team that we match up very well with. His -- the job that
he's done with those kids is scary because they are really good. But
thankfully we match up really well with them, and I don't think our kids are
going to go to sleep tonight worrying about whether or not we can compete with
them. I think they're probably going to go to sleep worrying about whether or
not they can get the baskets because Jim does a fantastic job of defending
himself.  
  
Q. Obviously the game just finished; is it déjà-vu kind of like last
year in Chicago, you guys knocking off Xavier?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Yeah, like I said, we've had, over the last six games with
Xavier, they've been fantastic games, and they've been fun to watch. I'm just
happy that we're in a different side of the bracket than DePaul this year.
That's the one thing that's different about this year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Jim Crowley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32727)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 73, Providence - 60  
  
JIM CROWLEY: A lot of credit to Seton Hall. You know, we knew they were
obviously a very dangerous team, and watching their last game against St.
John's and seeing how their guards played, we knew that they would come in
very confident and aggressive. I thought in the first quarter Jackson really
hit some tough shots, but in the second quarter they were able to get to the
rim and really get their confidence going, and then we were just kind of
chasing them the rest of the game. I was proud of our kids' fight. We've done
that pretty much all year, just when we had those opportunities to overcome
some of those things, we didn't come through with that, but again, a lot of
that credit goes to Seton Hall with their defense and their offensive
execution when they needed to make plays.  
  
Q. Coach, your first year in the BIG EAST Conference, what was the
biggest learning point of this season?  
JIM CROWLEY: It would be tough to identify a single one. You know, the word I
keep using is it's been educational. It's been educational within our own
program and certainly within the league, as well. Really feel lucky to be a
part of it, certainly fortunate to be at a great place like Providence, and
hopefully we'll continue to get better to be a part of representing what is a
great league.  
  
Q. 3 for 16 from beyond the arc, very uncharacteristic of your team. Is
that more on the Seton Hall defense or was it just an off-night?  
JIM CROWLEY: Well, I thought they did a really good job. They mixed some
things in. They on occasion would throw in a three two zone, which I thought
threw us off a little bit, and they really got in us from the start, so I
thought they got some of our shooters a little uncomfortable. But to go along
with that, I thought we had some good looks and didn't knock them down.
Certainly credit to them, but I also thought we had some opportunities with
some pretty good looks and didn't make the ones we should have.  
  
Q. Despite what the record book says, I believe that it is a turning
point for Providence college basketball. What are you most looking forward to
in year two?  
JIM CROWLEY: Making some more of those shots would be great.  
  
You know, just to continue to develop a mentality. It's really hard when
you've not had a lot of success to overcome that doubt that creeps in. You
know, I thought our kids really did a great job of fighting away from losing
big. We've got to continue to -- today kind of summed it up, where we don't
make those mistakes to dig a big hole, and if we do fight back, the plays
we've got to make to do that. So hopefully we'll continue to analyze that.
This is the coaches' time. We've got to make sure we're doing our job to get
people better, and our players got to make sure they're doing their job to
listen and execute those things that we talk about.  
  
Q. Sarah Beal, 18-5-5. What can you say about her performance tonight?  
JIM CROWLEY: Sarah has done that all year. Really we've adjusted her role a
little bit, got her off the ball some, and she's really had a really solid
year with that. She always plays pretty well at this place I understand. I've
only been with her twice here, and they've both been pretty good. But she
really competed all year for us, and certainly that'll be something I'll miss.  
  
Q. Getting back to Sarah, what mark does she leave on this program?  
JIM CROWLEY: It's tough to identify that having just had her for a year. So I
don't feel that it would be fair for me to do a generalized statement like
that. But certainly this year she never backed down, and we need more of that.
She went right at people, whether it be whoever was in the league, and I think
that carried over to some of our other players and helped with Yoyo and CC and
Maddie having more of an aggressive mindset.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

### [Jaquan Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32728)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 73, Providence - 60  
  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: First of all, I want to congratulate Providence. I know, you
look at their record and you would think that it wasn't a successful season,
and obviously they just -- obviously on wins and losses they have a tremendous
leader in Coach Crowley. As somebody who's played against Providence now for
four straight years, they're very well coached and have a very bright future
ahead of them. They have some very good young players, and obviously are led
by a tremendous coach. So I know you'll see Providence be a big force in the
Big East as we move on in years to come.  
  
But I am very proud of our girls. We've obviously struggled recently. But
we've actually had two real good weeks. We had a good week of practice before
St. John's and we played a very good St. John's team in a very competitive
game. The young lady on my left played outstanding as she has all year, and
then we had a good week of practice this week. So I thought we would play
well. I didn't know how well we would because a lot of our girls have never
played in a Big East playoff game before, and they came through, and I'm proud
of them.  
  
The young lady on my left and Kaela both, I thought, could have been honored a
little bit differently by our league's coaches, so I think they came in with
definitely determination, definitely focus, and all year the young lady on my
left has been a focused, determined young lady, seeing double teams in her
first year of action in the Big East. She's never complained. She just works
as hard as she can. She's going to be a tremendous player obviously for us the
rest of this year, but for next year I'm proud to coach her.  
  
I was proud of the team. I thought Lubirdia really exerted herself in the
second half. In the first half she hadn't scored any points and stood in the
locker room pouting and said, no, Coach, we got it, don't worry about it, my
time will come, I'll be more aggressive on the boards. And she was, and I was
proud of her because she is a senior and she didn't want to go out with a long
losing streak, and she's not going to. She's going to advance to the
quarterfinals round of the Big East, and for our program that's a stat, and
that's what we needed to do.  
  
I thought having Deja win us back, as you can see, No. 15, clearly she's a
working team member, as well. She was injured and she missed a lot of time.
Not just her, 9 and 5. But I thought she played with a lot of energy
defensively, as did Shadeen Samuels, a kid who has been hurt all year. So
we're getting there little by little. And obviously this is just a small stat,
but for us it was a big stat.  
  
Q. Why was the offense so in sync today?  
JAQUAN JACKSON: It was just us being patient and knowing what to do. We've
been practicing all week for a good shot versus a great shot, so I thought
that was very important tonight.  
  
Q. When you see that there were five players who scored at least eight
points in today's game, it's been you and KK carrying the load this season,
but when other players are contributing, what's that like?  
JAQUAN JACKSON: It's very great. We just tell them just be ready to shoot;
we're going to kick it out to you, so always be ready to shoot.  
  
Q. How did you guys kind of handle this stage going in, knowing that
it's the postseason, knowing that you're playing for your season to keep
going?  
JAQUAN JACKSON: At first it was tough, but we just keep pushing. As everyone
knows, we haven't had like a great season, but we're just here to make a
statement. We're going to keep pushing and fighting as much as we can.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the offense, but Providence has been a team
that can hurt you from three-point land, and today you guys did a nice job.
What was behind that?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: No, I think that was our main focus. There's no question
when we beat them in our gym we did a great job on defending the three-point
line. When we played in their gym 8 in a row and 11 for the game and we knew
that was unacceptable. So we give up some drives, and obviously they adjusted.
Coach Crowley is a great coach, and he told the kids just keep their head down
and drive the ball to the basket. Botteghi was hot early, but in the second
half she cooled down. And that's when we were able to Lubirdia inside a little
bit. I thought that made a little bit of a difference. I just knew that if we
could stay competitive from the three-point line we'd have a chance. And
obviously not only did we stay competitive, we won by 15 points. That was a
big thing. That was a huge part of our strategy and to stay close on the
boards and actually out-rebounded by them by a lot and that was a big thing
for us.  
  
Q. Encouraging some regular season finale and it seemed like offensively
some of those stayed with you through today. I know you broke it down, but why
now? Are you noticing an offensive rhythm here?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Well, that's a really good question. It's obviously been --
you obviously know me very well. It's been a very frustrating season for me,
not because of the record, but because of how uncompetitive we are sometimes
in some games. And I'm a really transparent coach and it's unacceptable to me.
I think we really struggle with our confidence. We've had a lot of meetings,
too many meetings, to be honest with you, and I just felt in the past two
weeks we showed them some film of some other coaches and what they do and how
they talk and how they treat their team. We watched the UConn film the other
day in the new thing on HBO special, and even Coach Auriemma, a friend of
mine, how he coaches the team. And I think they understood a little bit
better, we're not yelling at them, we're coaching them.  
  
I think the past two weeks they've adjusted on that a lot better. I think
maybe they're growing into themselves, taking a little more accountability,
moving the ball better, sharing the ball better, and I think those things are
important. And I think when you're young and things go bad, you don't know how
to react. So this win was important to us. At the end of the day, I understand
the task at hand and who we play, and we've been in that spot before, so I
know that.  
  
But for us, this was an important step in our progression. We're going to go
into the off-season knowing that we've won a game in the Playoffs again, that
we have some confidence. Of all the players we played today, 3, 5, 8, seven
are returning, and I think those are big steps for us.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the character person Lubirdia Gordon?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: She is -- people don't realize the health issues she's had
and how she's battled it. Before the St. John's game she was in the hospital
for two days because of her medical condition, and she walked into the game at
2:00 and played, and she played well. So you know, she's been a good
inspiration for the kids. And I'm just glad she came in with a real big game
in a Big East playoff game because she's a great kid. I've known her since
she's been in eighth grade. And I just would like to see her go out with some
confidence and stuff. And today I thought she carried us in the second half.
She had nine points and I think 10 rebounds in the second half. She did very
well.  
  
Q. You were pretty excited at the end of the third quarter put back
buzzer, right?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Yeah, you want to score the last point of every quarter and
the first point of every quarter. And our goal today was to just break the
game down into quarters. And we just said win every quarter, and we did. We
won all four quarters. And I think if you win every quarter you have a good
chance to win. And we just want to make it so small for them to see some sort
of positivity. So that was important, and that made us win the quarter. We won
by two, not I can go into the huddle and be like, we won another quarter, and
that was important for the girls.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2017

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Bridget Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32650)

### [Ashley Morrissette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28301)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 74, Purdue - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Purdue has joined us. Sharon, we'll start with a statement from
you.  
  
COACH VERSYP: Just really proud of this team. Played four games in four days
and playing pretty much toe to toe. The third quarter was very difficult for
us, but when you look at the stat sheet they made shots we didn't. And
obviously they scored in the paint, and they do that to everyone in the
country.  
  
So Maryland's a very, very good basketball team, but we're not too far behind
when you play in the fourth game, and I'm just really proud of what we've done
and the journey we've had with these kids.  
  
Q. You guys know that Jones is a challenge is a handful, just how
difficult was she in this game, in this environment?  
BRIDGET PERRY: You know, she's big and physical, very hard presence to guard.
She's one of the best post players in the country. So at times we did a decent
job. And at times when she gets deep she's scoring the ball. And we did good
at times but not the whole game.  
  
Q. Ashley, did they come at you with more size tonight and seem to --
you faced a lot of double teams this year but eventually did that wear you
down, actually play four games in four days?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: Yeah, they definitely played some good defense. So credit
to that.  
  
Q. Ashley, this game stings. It's fresh. But what you guys have done
over the last couple of weeks and now putting yourself into a position to make
the NCAA Tournament, are you overall pretty happy with the run you guys have
been on?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: We're happy we're getting there. But we're not satisfied.
We're definitely looking to make a run in the NCAA Tournament, and I know that
this group can do that.  
  
Q. Ashley, you guys played excellent all game. Going into the second
half, that's when they had the biggest lead against you guys. Why is that?
What were they able to do?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: Well, we didn't come out in the third quarter like how we
wanted to. And I thought they took advantage of that very well. And they
scored a lot of points in the paint. And we just needed to cover down more on
Jones and a couple of times we did, but a then a few times we didn't. And
against a team like Maryland you have to do that every time.  
  
Q. Bridget, why did things start to click for this team, not only these
last four days, but maybe these last three weeks?  
BRIDGET PERRY: You know, I think everyone was surprised except us as a team.
We knew we've had it in us and we've seen flashes. And I think being in a high
pressure environment, playing for a championship completely elevated us as a
team. We stayed together down the stretch no matter what. As a unit, nothing
could break us and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Sharon, do you think you guys passed the test for an NCAA Tournament
team?  
COACH VERSYP: I'm not the NCAA committee. But if it's their parameters, we hit
every checkmark. So, yes, we should be in. If we didn't beat Ohio State, we
probably wouldn't have been in. But we beat a No. 9-ranked team in the
country. We won seven straight. Besides Illinois everybody was higher ranking
than us.  
  
We had major injuries through the entire season. We had concussions. We never
had a full roster until really the last five games. So if the NCAA is saying
certain things matter, then we're definitely in because we got the marquee
win, and we deserve it.  
  
Q. What did click for this team?  
COACH VERSYP: After Penn State, people stepped up and got in people's face.
Peer pressure is a lot better than coaches going after you.  
  
And I think that totally changed it. And I think Ashley started it, and then I
think Bridget continued it. I think they both did it together. But after Penn
State, we weren't real happy about losing. So then it all changed. And Ashley
kept everybody accountable and so did Bridget.  
  
And I think when a player gets in your face, says it's unacceptable, it's your
teammate they responds, and they did. And these two did great.  
  
Q. Coach, you said before that with Maryland, the problem of trying to
come at them is they don't have one star player that you can focus on. So how
does that just change the game plan going from Ohio State into --  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, it's difficult. Because they have such great shooters. If
you look at their stats. They made shots; we didn't. We struggled offensively.
But if you look at everything, I mean we just didn't score. And for them,
Jones has scored on everybody in the country, the No. 1 team in the country.
They couldn't stop her. And I thought, like Bridget said, we did some really
good things, but then we let her go.  
  
We had littles on her and our bigs should have been on her. And we were out of
position a little bit. So credit them. They just know how to pound it inside.
They do a good job and they share the ball very well.  
  
So again, it's -- holding them to 74 points, people probably don't think is
great, but I thought it was pretty decent. But if you look at the shooting
percentage, that's where we got hurt.  
  
Q. Ashley, what's the takeaway from not only this tournament but the
last three or four weeks?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: The takeaway is definitely to stick together and this team
has stuck together ever since that Penn State loss. And I think this team's
heart is huge. And when we get to NCAAs we're going to be a dangerous team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 74, Purdue - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Maryland is here. Coach, an opening statement and then we'll go
to the students.  
  
COACH FRESE: You know, we talked about before this game that we were going to
have to come out and nothing was ever given. You were going to have to come
out and earn it. And the moment Bri and I just had on the court, she talked
about how none of these, all three, have been easy in terms of what you have
to go out and be able to go get.  
  
So just really proud. We talked about Shatori told the team as we came in here
that it was going to be the team with the best bench and depth in three days.
We needed every single person.  
  
And that's why we worked behind the scenes and to be ready for our moment. But
I thought our seniors led the way, set the tone like they have all season
long.  
  
Purdue, I can't say enough about, when your 6 seed gets all the way to the
championship game, your 5 seed, Michigan State, to the semis in terms of just
the parity of our conference. And I thought Destiny in her first tournament
did a phenomenal job in terms of leading the team and really, really proud of
our team and it's just an incredible feeling.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Brionna and Shatori, how does this compare to the last three you won.
You're both seniors; is this one a little more special?  
BRIONNA JONES: It's definitely special but getting to share it with this team
makes it more special.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Like Bri said, sharing this moment with my teammates
is really special. The way everyone played collectively, it's really
indescribable.  
  
Q. Shatori, what can you say about Brionna? You won most outstanding
player last year. She won it this year. Her performance was much like
yesterday, just outstanding.  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: She missed, like, eight shots in three days. It's
just unheard of. She was unbelievable. That's just what she's been all year,
but she's the best post in the country. She plays like it day in, day out. She
makes us go. And she is just a beast down low offensively and defensively.
We're blessed to have her.  
  
Q. Brianna and Shatori, you played a bit slow compared to how you
finished. How did you deal with the early struggles and come out with the win
and have productive wins?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think having confidence in my teammates knowing they were
going to knock down shots when they were going. And just picking it up from
there and just build off that when they got hot.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, I definitely struggled with it offensively.
But I mean the way our team came in, the minutes Ieshia and Blair played, and
the big shots Destiny hit, they were definitely big.  
  
And they did not play like freshmen. Like Coach said, our bench came in and
did a great job, and I thought we did it in great ways. It wasn't pretty at
all times but I thought we played really hard as a team.  
  
Q. Des, you had not your best half in the first game but yesterday and
today you shot with great confidence. Did anything change for you mentally?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: My team giving me confidence, always being there. After the
first half, they made sure after halftime to give me a little bit of
confidence, tell me to keep shooting, simple as that.  
  
Q. You were able to shoot again 52 percent against one of the best if
not the best team in the conference. How was that able to happen?  
COACH FRESE: Again, this team does a tremendous job, I think, of sharing the
basketball at times. We just really slowed down and we were really poised. But
they just continued to feed the hot hand, and you saw a lot of contributions
that we were able to get to see our bench depth. The spark that they gave us
tonight. But just a lot of great contributions, Kristen Confroy tonight, just
a lot of key plays for us.  
  
Q. How do you compare this championship to others that you've won?  
COACH FRESE: Oh, my goodness. I mean, they're all indescribable, what it means
to be able to continue to take these championships home and represent
Maryland. But, again, I credit the players. I mean, they make it look easy,
but like Bri talked about on the floor, they're not.  
  
And it's even more incredible when you have two seniors who have spent four
years of the hard work, the sweat, the tears, to be sending them out in the
Big Ten in terms of just their success, all they do is win and one more
remaining.  
  
Q. Before the tournament, you said you were optimistic about your team's
depth. What was it that you saw that made you feel they could have the
performances they did this weekend?  
COACH FRESE: Well, because they've been fighting all year, and I know the
character in our locker room and how we played for each other. So I think just
early when they saw how important in the first game the quarterfinals, how
important our bench was going to be and just being ready, I think they were
able to see how valuable they were.  
  
I think our seniors layered it in their locker room talk and conversations and
that was huge.  
  
Q. Destiny, you were a freshman who plays beyond your years. What drives
you?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Just my team. They're always there. They make me better than I
look, I promise you. To have these two to pass to, it's crazy. She makes every
shot. She also makes every shot. So they make me look better than I really am.
But it's just the hard work putting in every day and having these people by my
side always lifting me up.  
  
Q. Destiny, what's it feel like to win your first tournament?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: It's exciting, especially knowing this journey started in the
summer, and we're still not finished and that this is one step on a long
journey.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo, Mark Turgeon, talked about the Big Ten being underrated as
a whole on the men's side. Do you think that translates to the women's side?
And how do you feel about the conference as a whole going into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH FRESE: No question. I said it after the game. There's not enough credit
given to the parity in this conference. And when you see a No. 5 seed and No.
6 seed be able to get to the semis and finals and to win games and push us, it
speaks volumes of the parity in our conference. And we just have to continue
to keep exposing it where people continue to watch the teams in the Big Ten.
And we need to do well in the postseason, which I feel like we should get a
lot of teams.  
  
Q. Brenda, what does Destiny mean to this team going forward into the
future?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, it's indescribable. You talk about -- she's the engine
that makes us go. And you see just with her energy, with her spirit, she makes
also everybody else around her better. She's the point guard that we've been
missing. And, you know, she starts everything for us.  
  
Q. Shatori, Maryland, I think, is the first team in Big Ten history to
win both the regular season and tournament titles for three straight years.
When you were a sophomore, did you envision that being able to unfold by the
time you're a senior?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Not really. Coach does a good job telling us to look
out what's ahead, like what's right in front of us. And I think that's been --
we've been using that mindset since our sophomore year, just take it one game
at a time, and see how that unfolds and how that mindset looking back how it
played out now. I mean, it's a great mindset. And I say this confidently. I
don't think Maryland's done now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Dominique Oden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32692)

### [Ashley Morrissette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28301)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 71, Ohio State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Purdue has joined us. We'll go to Coach Versyp for an opening
statement and then we'll go to Dominique and Ashley for questions.  
  
COACH VERSYP: Ohio State's an exceptional basketball team. And when we played
them at home we felt we did some good things against them. And tried to do
some of the same things, adjusted some things on our defense, and our players
just did a great job of executing our game plan defensively.  
  
And then offensively we tried to control the tempo as much as possible. Ashley
did just an amazing job controlling the game the whole time. And when the ball
was in her hands, breaking the press, she just did it exceptionally well.
Sometimes we're aggressive. Sometimes we pulled it back using clock as much as
possible.  
  
But this is obviously a big win for us getting to the finals and our free
throws were exceptional today.  
  
Q. Ashley, just managing their press, the job you guys were able to do,
you in particular, and being able to get the ball in the front court and take
advantage of the opportunities when they were there or back into the half
court, just take us through the decision-making process there and how you
think you were able to manage that?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: They definitely were trying to deny me the ball. But when
the ball got in and they would collapse, I would just find the open person,
because if two people are on me then somebody has to be open. So I would try
to get the ball to the middle as much as possible so we would have an option
on both sides or up the sideline if nobody was at the sideline, to Nique or
Keys.  
  
Q. When you're playing against a team who is Big Ten champion, they're
going to be heavy favorites in this game is there a sense you have nothing to
lose in this one? Does that affect you at all?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Definitely, because there's nothing to lose when you're
playing a team that everybody expects to win. And it's just, well, you feel
like we're just going to win anyway because y'all expect us to lose.  
  
Q. Ashley, while you guys wanted to control the clock, how important was
it to pick your spots and be aggressive and attack them when you had those
opportunities?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: You know, obviously we had a wide-open layup, take it.
That's what we were talking about in huddles. But definitely we wanted to make
them play defense 30 seconds. They like to push the ball. They like a fast-
tempo game. They want you to take the first shot that's open so they can
rebound and run on you.  
  
But sometimes we would just slow the tempo down, run some time off the clock.
If it got too hectic, that's when we would do that.  
  
Q. Ashley, what do you try to do against Mitchell, because that was her
second off game against Purdue?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: We, as a team, you know, in huddles we were just like on a
string, you know, one team.  
  
So we definitely did a great job on her. We surrounded her with two people
almost at all times. We wanted to make her play on the right side of the
floor. They ran a couple of plays where she got open looks on the left side of
the floor. But I thought as a team we did a great job defending her.  
  
Q. Ashley, can you talk about your role in the zone against Mitchell?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: You know, when we ran one, which is 1-2-2, at the top I
would just want to force her to the right side of the floor. And then we would
have a wing that would crowd her, and then I would just try to not let her go
back left.  
  
And then we ran a 2-3 zone. I thought Nique did a great job, whoever was at
the top with me, did a great job of just extending the 3-point line. She has
deep range. So we didn't want to play a regular 2-3. It was almost like an
extended 2-3 because she can come down and pull from anywhere.  
  
Q. Ashley, first, what's going on with this team? Three weeks now, seven
straight. You got your marquee win that you've been searching all season for,
what's up?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: Honestly, we believe in each other. We have great team
chemistry. We trust in each other, you know. We've been through some tough
losses, you know, to ranked teams, and we just pretty much said we're not
losing again.  
  
Q. Dominique?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: I agree with Ashley wholeheartedly. We trust each other as a
team. We're together with everything. We win and lose together, no matter
what. It's like everybody cares about us as a team; it's not about
individuals.  
  
Q. Dominique, you set the school record for 3-pointers made, what does
that mean to you?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: It just means, for me, I just helped my team win. And it
doesn't mean anything personally because like, yeah, I've set a record, but
it's helped us win and that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Dominique, are you kind of growing up these last two games, the
ability to hit some big shots in key moments?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Definitely. I feel like my mindset and my mentality has
definitely grown since coming into the tournament. I don't know why, but it
has, and I'm glad it has.  
  
Q. Sharon, 31 defensive rebounds. You guys cleaned the boards. You
eliminated a lot of second shots that Ohio State loves to do. Did you work on
that pretty hard?  
COACH VERSYP: We work on it every day. Why work so hard on defense and then
not secure the rebound? And our identity is defense, and that gets our offense
going.  
  
And so, you know, we can't -- we shouldn't change who we are. This is what
we've been doing. We've been successful.  
  
Q. Coach, you held Kelsey Mitchell under ten points. It's only the
second time in her career that's happened. What goes into that defensively and
is that something you thought your team could do going into this game?  
COACH VERSYP: We defended the team very well at our place, and it always
starts -- we were playing more 1-defense at home and it started with Ashley at
the top and then everybody else joins in. Like Ashley said, we're kind of
trying to corral her where two people are on her all the time.  
  
And today we went to 2-3 zone because they had 2-guard front more. And they
just adjusted. It takes a lot of time and effort. It takes focus for these
kids to execute the game plan and what we needed to do. They executed it and
trusted it and said let everybody else shoot the outside shot and just corral
her.  
  
So again it comes down to a lot of planning, it comes down to a lot of hard
work for these kids, and they're just playing really, really good basketball
right now.  
  
Q. You guys were trying to be patient there in the fourth quarter but
there were several instances where you needed a bucket and weren't able to get
it. Did you feel like in those instances it got down to five, you had the
rebounded basket, Ashley took one to the hole and scored. Did you feel in
those instances you guys were smart with what you did with the ball?  
COACH VERSYP: I think we were very smart. I was just going to keep the ball in
the Ashley's hands. People have got to understand: Give Ashley the ball. Keep
it in her hands. She's the one that understands what we're looking for. She
understands double, triple teams. She's our ball handler.  
  
So we're just trying to run some time off, trying to find some mismatches.
They're very quick so you saw some steals during that time.  
  
But just trying to have Ashley go to work. Our offensive board, like you said,
Bridget scoring and Ashley being able to score that layup was big.  
  
Q. Sometimes Bridget Perry plays a little soft -- hasn't been soft in a
while. And she was very physical in there battling all night long. Talk a
little bit about Bridget.  
COACH VERSYP: Bridget's played very, very solid for her team. I just thanked
Ashley and Bridget for carrying us to the finals. They deserve that. They're
the most competitive, most fierce competitors. I'll be on their team any day
because I know they have my back. And Bridget did just a great job on the
boards.  
  
She's intense. She challenges all the time, and when you make her angry she
plays better. So she got a little angry out there today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Branndais Agee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32675)

### [Tori Jankoska](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26530)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 100, Michigan State - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Spartans are here. Coach, an opening statement and then
we'll go to the students.  
  
COACH MERCHANT: I guess Michigan State and Maryland were not good games today
for either side, mine or Izzo's. But give Maryland a lot of credit. I thought
they played with great toughness and energy. Their size and their strength is
usually what gets people in the paint.  
  
We tried some different things, and we did the first time we played them. And
it did open up some things, but I thought, you know, we kept cutting it. We
just couldn't get over the hump. We'd get it to 5, get it to 7 and then they'd
make a play or get a rebound putback.  
  
It's difficult, the free throw disparity. Whenever you play them, it makes it
difficult sometimes to kind of slow the game down enough to give you some
points with the clock not ticking.  
  
But they're a good team, really good team, and led by two very good players in
Brionna Jones and Walker-Kimbrough and wish them luck tomorrow and in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Tori, could you talk about your 3-point shooting there in the third
quarter? I think you guys knocked down 7 of ten to get back?  
TORI JANKOSKA: We're a good 3-point shooting team, I think, one of the best
since I've been here. And when you're scoring 3s and they're scoring 2s it
helps you get back in the game.  
  
And we were moving the ball and getting open people and trying to get
ourselves back.  
  
Q. Tori, obviously 89 points is usually enough to win a game, you would
hope. But they made a lot of runs -- you would make a run and they countered
everything. Was it just hard to guard them?  
TORI JANKOSKA: We know they're a great team. They're ranked top 5 in the
country. It's for a reason. They have players that can score from all angles.
You try and double one person and you leave another McDonald's All-American
wide open.  
  
So it's tough. But there's some times where we just didn't get rebounds,
defensive rebounds, when we needed them, and those are hard to guard. And
they'd go on a run, and that's the sign of a good team.  
  
Q. Tori, in this state there was a legend called Scott Skiles. And I had
somebody sitting next to me that said you kind of emulated him a little bit
today, your toughness and fierceness. Where was the drive at, your last game
in the Big Ten, and comment on that, please?  
TORI JANKOSKA: No, I don't think that's where it comes from. I think it comes
from every game. I think that's pretty similar to how I play every single
game. And when you play a team like Maryland, they're built on toughness and
rebounding and packing it in the paint and driving. To be able to beat them
you've got to raise your level of toughness, no matter what.  
  
Q. Branndais, you've been good at this tournament for a long time. You
had a really good solid game today. Talk about what it was like facing Jones,
Shatori, people like that?  
BRANNDAIS AGEE: It's always great to play a top-ranked team. We fought hard we
just didn't come out with the win. It's always good to play a good team.  
  
Q. Suzy, tough in the moment, obviously, but to take away from these
three games, even there's a loss, you guys played well against a top 5 team.
Is there something you can spin forward to the NCAAs here?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think so. I think we've been doing a good job of having
multiple people score the ball. There was times earlier in the season where
we'd struggle with that. And these two right here have been the most
consistent and really come on, and we've got Taya playing really well. I think
Jenna's starting to come around a little bit.  
  
We have kids that sprinkle in a little bit. It's nice to see Coco have some
confidence and play well yesterday. That really helps. Sometimes it's Taryn
and Kennedy helped us win a couple of games when we played Penn State. It's
been nice to see us kind of come together.  
  
I like how we share the ball. We had 23 assists on 34 field goals. So I think
that part's really good. But there's some areas we need to improve on for
sure. But give Maryland a lot of credit. Like B said, they're a very good
team. We played them in the championship game last year. And we all kind of
had that feeling of wanting a little revenge and get a chance to get back at
them. But to their credit -- I think the Slocum kid is the difference. I mean,
she had like eight in that fourth quarter, whatever. When we would get to a
hump, she'd hit two 3s. And the one at the end the quarter she was at like 28
feet. She's a heck of a player, and I think she gives them a head to a monster
that they really haven't had.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yeah, I think so. They deserve it. We've been going pretty
hard. And just the way the season is a little bit. So I'll give them a couple
of days and we'll regroup and let their bodies heal a little bit, and then
we've got to get back at it. The thing is you don't want to get too out of
rhythm. We're playing really well.  
  
Coming in here, we won four of our last five and won a couple here. We're
playing good basketball. I don't want to lose that either.  
  
But there's some things we can work on, improve on, and keep their legs fresh
and stay mentally fresh at the same time. But we'll give them some time, for
sure.  
  
Q. Brionna Jones, 32 points, nine rebounds, what was she doing to give
you guys fits?  
COACH MERCHANT: Can't stop her. We tried to double her. Last time we didn't
double her and she didn't score that many points.  
  
I really don't know how to guard the girl. I thought, oh, we're going to
double her and she's going to struggle. And she had 32 points. We couldn't
keep her off the board.  
  
She had six offensive rebounds. That's the other thing. When you play
Maryland, it isn't the play -- Tori, I think you were trying to box her out.
And Tori boxes her out and she gets the foul. So, I mean, the kid is just a
beast around the bucket. There's not a better post player in the country as a
true 5.  
  
Maybe the kid at South Carolina, is a little more mobile, but in terms of
efficiency, kid shoots 70 percent from the floor, makes her free throws. She's
just a load to move. And if you double her, she's learned how to pass it out.
That's the thing that earlier in her career you could get her on. She was a
left-shoulder-only kid as a freshman.  
  
Learned to be able to do a little bit more in her sophomore year. Started
handling doubles late sophomore, all of her junior year. Now as a senior,
she's a point guard down there. I give her a lot of credit for improving her
game. She's lost a lot of weight and committed to her fitness level.  
  
I don't know. I thought we could double her and make a difference. But clearly
it didn't matter, it didn't work this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Shayla Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28374)

### [Linnae Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26552)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 71, Ohio State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State, Coach McGuff and student-athletes
Linnae Harper and Shayla Cooper. Questions.  
  
Q. Shayla, obviously a tough loss. Moving forward for this team,
especially as the lone senior what's the message to your team after a loss
like this?  
SHAYLA COOPER: Locker room I sent them a couple of text messages, let them
know how important they are to this team, every individual push forward and
get ready for the next game.  
  
Q. Shayla, how difficult was it to, to contain Ashley on both sides of
the court?  
SHAYLA COOPER: She's a great player. She's a great player, but we had to dig
in a little bit more on the defensive side.  
  
Q. Shayla, you had nine points in the fourth quarter and it seemed like
you were really vocal as a leader too sometimes like physically putting
players in the right position. What's going through your mind in that
situation?  
SHAYLA COOPER: Just trying to step up and do everything possible to get my
team the win.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously anytime a game goes like this it's disappointing.
What were they doing and did they show you anything you didn't expect to see
from them?  
COACH MCGUFF: Yeah, Purdue played great. They deserved to win the game. They
played really, really hard. Their defense was -- really bothered us. They
played great zone the whole game. I thought we played hard and we just didn't
play well.  
  
So that was the difference. They played better than we did. It wasn't our
effort or our want-to or anything like that. They just played better than we
did.  
  
Q. You played like legitimately great defense at times, honestly like
the whole game. Were you just kind of waiting at some point maybe for the
averages to work out and you start hitting shots?  
COACH MCGUFF: Yeah, we didn't hit many shots. And part of that had to do with
their defense. They were really effective. Also I think one of the keys to the
game, too, was we didn't play well from behind. Once they got a lead we seemed
to get out of doing the things that we've done all year and allowed us to be
very efficient on offense, and we were rushing shots and taking quick,
contested shots instead of just showing a little more patients and a little
more trust in the execution.  
  
Q. What does this mean going forward? Because you still have the regular
season championship and you're highly thought of nationally?  
COACH MCGUFF: Well, this is going to tell us a lot about our team, because
we're either going to learn from this and take some things here and make sure
we're a better team the next time we play or you can sit around and pout about
it and not get better.  
  
So we have a great opportunity to go to the NCAA Tournament and make some
noise. And this could be something that kind of resets us and allows us to
refocus and really energizes us as we head to the NCAA Tournament. And that's
on us. That's what we have to make sure happens.  
  
Q. Kelsey had a career low nine points today. What do you do offensively
when she's not hitting?  
COACH MCGUFF: She didn't. She didn't have a good game. She's a spectacular
player, one of the very best in college basketball and tonight wasn't her
night. But no one's going to work harder. No one's going to be in the gym more
than she will. And she's going to make sure that her having an off night
doesn't happen again this year, I can assure you of that.  
  
Q. How do you go about going over the next week and a half? And I think
you said you expect to have Stephanie back. How do you kind of work her back
in and fit her back into the rotation?  
COACH MCGUFF: She's making great progress. We're very confident we'll have her
when the NCAA Tournament rolls around. We'll work her back in. I think in her
absence Alexa and Tori have done a great job.  
  
That's another thing that we can be stronger with really having a lot of depth
with our post players. A lot of depth overall, obviously, but to add another
player like Stephanie will be a huge asset for us.  
  
Q. Linnae, what's the team feeling right now? Are you angry? Just what
the emotions are.  
LINNAE HARPER: This is really a tough loss. It's not a good feeling. But one
thing I do know is that we're ready to get back into the gym this coming week
and just work on little things, watch film and make sure that we grow from
this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Brionna Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26977)

Kimbrough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28346)

### [Destiny Slocum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32729)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 100, Michigan State - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Brenda Frese and the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH FRESE: I thought both teams fought tremendously hard. And it was
definitely a game of runs. I thought that we obviously needed all the 100
points that we got tonight. But I thought we were able to really kind of find
in different runs who to be able to get the ball through, whether it was Tori,
Bri, Destiny late in the second half.  
  
So we just had a great sense in terms of what we were doing. I thought we got
great minutes off the bench, when you talk about bringing Sarah Myers in and
Steph Jones. They were tremendous for us. But Michigan State played hard and
from our end we're excited about being able to move on to the championship
game.  
  
Q. Brionna, can you talk about your performance tonight -- 32 points,
nine rebounds and six assists?  
BRIONNA JONES: My teammates made it easier for me. Shatori hitting threes
outside and Destiny attacking off the bounce, I think that just opened up the
paint for me.  
  
Q. The team gets to the line, I think, 16 times in the fourth quarter.
What were the factors being able to get to the line so often?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think just staying on the attack and just being aggressive
and not letting up on our offense.  
  
Q. Bri, you had a similar performance last time against Michigan State.
Probably not quite as good. Is there anything about them that you kind of like
playing against or what is that?  
BRIONNA JONES: They're a really physical team and I kind of embrace physical
play. So I think that just gives me a little extra energy today.  
  
Q. Destiny, how did you guys kind of weather the storm in the second
quarter when -- or in the third quarter when Michigan State was kind of
raining 3s down on you?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I think just sticking together and just playing together. We
know how to come back from tough situations, and I think that's what's good
about us is we're going to stay together through it. And I think that gets us
really far.  
  
Q. Shatori, when you see two freshmen, Kaila and Destiny, have 18 points
and contribute to such a big win, your thought about young players stepping up
in a big time situation?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: I forgot they were freshmen until you said that.
They do not play like that at all. They give our team -- they're like our
engine. They make us go. Kaila, defensively with her energy. Destiny with her
tempo. They make us go and I'm blessed to have them as teammates.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's ability to get runs at the end of
quarters, you did that at the end of the half and then again at the end of the
third?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, Coach said it was important for us to keep
pushing tempo, especially with them coming off I think it was day three or day
four for them. Their legs are tired. We were only here -- this is only our
second game coming in.  
  
So we had really fresh legs. And continue in the same way. Like Coach said,
Sarah Myers came in, gave us great minutes. Ieshia came in and Blair came in
to continue to give us ways to put our foot on the pedal.  
  
Q. Destiny, for you I saw at one point you talking to Shatori about a
certain play, when you guys were coming down the floor. How important is
communication in the game that you're all on the same page and that you're
taking in input from your teammates as to what's working, and Coach?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I think between these two and Coach B, they're so
knowledgeable. And to not ask them questions would be me doing something
wrong.  
  
So anytime if I can go and ask them a question about anything even if I know
the answer, to get them to talk back and just give me communication about
anything is super important and is a big reason for our success.  
  
Q. Kaila had her left hand taped up after the first quarter. Do you know
what happened there; how she's doing?  
COACH FRESE: I thought it was an injury that I missed. But it was a cut. So I
guess we don't use Band-Aids anymore. We bandage them. It was a little --
she's fine.  
  
Q. Brenda, did you come in expecting this offensive show, did you think
you had to get 100 to win the game?  
COACH FRESE: I didn't think against Michigan State, I know we're capable that
we can play any style which is a beautiful thing. I did think Michigan State
might be a little more tired on day three of legs, but I thought their grit
and toughness was tremendous to watch. When they started banking in 3s, I knew
it was kind of their night. So we needed every single one of those points.  
  
Q. Destiny, you hit three big 3s late in the game. Could you talk about
that? How big was that for your team?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I think it was big for our team. But like I wouldn't be able
to get those shots without my teammates, and them giving me confidence to keep
taking them even though I had missed three earlier, like, they gave me
confidence to keep taking them, and that's why it helps.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned in a lot of ways it was Michigan State's night
with their 3-pointers. How did you weather -- what does it say about your team
that you were able to pull it off?  
COACH FRESE: You have to find different ways to be able to win, and obviously
they were red hot from the 3-point line. You knew Jankoska wasn't going to go
down without a fight. Tremendous player.  
  
I'm proud of the fact -- I thought during the game just different flows and
whoever had the hot hand, each player stepped up and played with a lot of
confidence.  
  
Q. You have a chance to win a third straight Big Ten Tournament title.
Are there nerves at this point (indiscernible) or is it a calm feeling?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think it's a calm feeling. I think just knowing we can
prepare ourselves the best that we can, and going in there we're going to be
the most prepared, I think that's going to give us the confidence we need to
go out there and play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Ashley Morrissette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28301)

### [Dominique Oden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32692)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 66, Indiana - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue Coach Versyp and student-athletes Ashley
Morrissette and Dominique Oden. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH VERSYP: It's definitely a tale of two halves. The first half they just
kicked us in every category. And at halftime we just talked about games that
we've been in before and we have an opportunity to change what we need to do.
We made adjustments defensively.  
  
And then obviously on the offensive end being able to rebound and run, got us
going, and we were able to knock down outside shots. Ashley and Nique hit some
big, big shots. And then we made free throws, which is always big.  
  
So this is a huge win. IU is a really good basketball team. They have three
1,000-point scorers so whenever you play against teams like that you know they
can score the ball, but our defense prevailed. We wanted to keep them to 60
and we did.  
  
Q. (Question off mic)?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: Coach came during halftime and she gave us a choice: Go
home or come out and win or come out have some pride on defense. Purdue is
known for defense. In that first half we had very little. So I think that's a
big reason everybody responded.  
  
Q. Dominique, (indiscernible)?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: In the second half, we switched to switching one through four,
and that just helped us stop the penetration more than when we were just not
switching. I don't know why, but it was a big help for us. And that just
helped get our energy up because we know we were going to stop them because we
were switching one through four and there's no reason to get beat.  
  
Q. Nique, you got going pretty early. Did you feel pretty good?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Yeah, I felt pretty good. It was just I didn't want to go
home. So I was just going.  
  
Q. Ashley, what's it say about Nique being a freshman, stepping up in
this environment (indiscernible)?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: It says a lot about her maturity, pressure situations. You
know she stepped up and she hit big ones for us. And I think that she's done
that all year. I think she's been in a tad bit of a slump but I think she's
definitely come out of it with this game.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to have a deficit going into halftime and
coming back and winning?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: It just says a lot about this team's character, how we
believe in each other, how we believe in the coaches and the coaching staff
and their scout. And we just wanted to implement what Coach V said. She said
switch 1 through 4 and we switched 1 through 4 and it definitely disrupted
them on offense.  
  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Going into halftime, losing by so much, it's like you think
you look at yourself and you're like we shouldn't be in this situation because
we know we're better than this and that's why when we came out the second half
we played like we did because we knew we were better than we played in the
first half.  
  
Q. Sharon, you're really searching for something defensively obviously
in the first half. What did you think you were able to get out of that?  
COACH VERSYP: First half we played one defense, 2-3, played man. They kept
getting the edge on us, being able to penetrate going right. All their
offenses are set up that way to set up their shooters on the other side of the
floor. So in the second half you switch 1 through 4, then you don't let them
get the edge. You keep them out of the paint and you don't have to help as
much because you're not hedging, getting over the top. The post has to be able
to find their players. But our kids just believed in it and they did a
fantastic job doing it. I thought Nora Kiesler played amazing tonight. A big
key to our success, being able to guard Jenn Anderson down there. She was the
only one that could matchup. I thought she did a fantastic job. She's a great
communicator, brings great energy, and she really helped with our defensive
stops during that time as well.  
  
Q. Were you just searching for someone to be a force down low tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: We were searching for anybody on offense. Anybody at the time
because our first half was sluggish. I knew if we could play defense we'd be
okay. If we played defense we were going to be able to run get some momentum
going and then our kids' energy level would go up and that's what helped our
defense. Our defense helped our offense and our offense getting up and down
and when Anderson came out, we put our smaller posts in and then put Nora back
in. I thought our staff did a good job of rotating coaching the game down to
the wire. I think that's very, very important. But kids are the ones who play
the game. They've got to execute it. They executed it.  
  
Believed in it, like Ashley said, and for us to only have six turnovers and
then to shoot 7-for-32 in the second half and have 11 turnovers, that was the
game.  
  
Q. From a coach's standpoint, how proud are you of this team right now
that they took into consideration what you told them during halftime and just
ran with it and were able to come out with a huge win?  
COACH VERSYP: We've been doing that our last six games. We've kind of been on
a roll, we feel. We've been playing great basketball. This group, it's about
their character. It's about their heart and grit. And I think when you
believe, when you believe in the process, and this group has, it starts with
Ashley, and she's believed in the process from the get-go and everybody is
going to follow. And that's how you have good basketball teams. I've never
been so proud of this group, being 21 wins already and being in the top four
of the Big Ten. This was just a nice way to end the day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Marlene Stollings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27751)

### [Gadiva Hubbard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32702)

### [Carlie Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28378)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 92, Minnesota - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Minnesota. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH STOLLINGS: Thank you. Well, first of all, credit to Maryland. They're a
seasoned team and a team that's used to playing in these moments. And every
time we made a run, they came right back. We were trying to get it to 10 in
the second half and every time that we would get on a little run, they
answered it. And that's what championship teams do.  
  
And they're very seasoned and used to that. So I think a lot of good takeaways
from our team at the same time, especially with our youth.  
  
If you take the second, third and fourth quarters, if I did my math here
correctly, we won 66 to 65. But the start of the game, obviously, hurt us,
transition defense and then turning the ball over. The 27-14 deficit made it
difficult for us to dig out of. But three very good quarters for us. One first
quarter start that really cost us the game.  
  
Q. Maryland's offense, they have a lot of talent, perimeter players and
they pass very well. What stands out to you, though, about their offense that
makes them difficult to defend.  
CARLIE WAGNER: I would say they have good ball movement and they just find
each other really well on the floor when they're playing. You can definitely
see that when they're playing, too.  
  
Q. Gadiva, you obviously had a very good night. What kind of was there
within the offensive rhythm for you, or what kind of enabled you to have so
much production tonight?  
GADIVA HUBBARD: My teammates and my coaches were just telling me to shoot. I
know the last game I had an off-shooting game. So I tried to keep shooting and
attacking, mix it up.  
  
Q. Carlie, obviously five, six days ago or whatever you lost by 33, what
strides do you feel you made even within this short span of a week in
tonight's game?  
CARLIE WAGNER: I thought we came out with more heart and intensity. If they
made a run, we didn't break down and stop playing. We kept playing with them
and kept coming at them, kept staying alert, stayed aggressive. And I thought
we did a good job of that throughout the third and fourth quarter just staying
aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach, similar question just about Maryland's offense, especially in
that first quarter, I think you had four scores in the last eight minutes but
they answered every single one of them. What just about their offense and
maybe even the timing sometimes of their offense that is so difficult to
guard?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, I think it's more individual talent. It wasn't so much
a play that was hurting us, it's just that they have a number of people that
can score from anywhere on the floor. So you take away something, there's
another person there. And it was just a lot of times it was just quick ball
movement with several people that could make a shot from many different
places.  
  
Q. What stands out to you about Gadiva's game tonight?  
COACH STOLLINGS: A lot of things. She really stepped up in a big moment. And
she's used to that on the youth level, amateur level, having played for the
Boo Williams program in Virginia. So she's used to big moments. But I'm really
proud of how she handled this because it's even a much bigger moment on this
stage.  
  
She shot the ball extremely well, but she also made some great decisions. She
made very nice reads and you don't often see that from a freshman in this type
of a game and this type of moment. She has an extremely bright future ahead of
her.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on it. You guys are down 27-14, but you cut it to
five. After the way the game went six days ago, what does that say about your
team, you feel that to not let that happen again and cut into that deficit
there?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, we're not into moral victories by any means. But a lot
of positive takeaways: As I said, we outscored them for three quarters. We
outrebounded them, made one more free throw than they did. We made eight 3s.
Statistically you go across the line, it's really solid in a lot of
categories.  
  
Big takeaways for us is we had so much youth in the game, they were in this
moment for the first time. And they'll remember this, and it will sting a
little bit. And they certainly don't want to be done playing this early in
March.  
  
They have aspirations to really put our program back on the map on a national
level. And this freshman class is going to do big things by the time they get
some more experience under their belt.  
  
Q. You mentioned the youth of this team. What's one or two components or
developments they need to make to take that next step forward as a program and
reach a higher level?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, I think a lot of it happened just by them being able to
log so many minutes this year. And we also made our freshmen February and
March captains. So we gave them a voice early on here. We're trying to speed
up their progression. So that in itself will bode well for us in a lot of
ways. And then we'll have an offseason with them so we can advance their
individual skill development, which will be very beneficial to them to have
that one-on-one time with the staff in spring and summer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Teri Moren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27752)

### [Alexis Gassion](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26488)

### [Tyra Buss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28292)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 66, Indiana - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Indiana has joined us with Coach Moren and student-athletes
Alexis Gassion and Tyra Buss.  
  
COACH MOREN: We're very disappointed. Thought we really played well in that
first half. But the start of the that third quarter, with six turnovers in the
first five minutes of the game. And we had 11 turnovers and Purdue
capitalizing, scoring 14 points off those turnovers. Just never could get in
rhythm offensively.  
  
I thought they just really hurt us in transition defense. And there were a
couple of set plays where they scored, but most of their scoring came
throughout transition. And then we switched up what we were trying to do
defensively and we just had some game slippage down the stretch and gave up
some easy 3s to their best shooters.  
  
And so give Purdue credit. Don't want to take anything away from them. I
thought they battled back. But we got great looks. We just didn't capitalize.
We turned it over too much. The game was ours to go get and we didn't complete
the task.  
  
Q. They switched 1 through 4 in the second half to prevent you guys from
penetrating into the lane. Did you notice that or was it something about their
defensive intensity? What was different about them in the second half?  
TYRA BUSS: I think we just were careless with the ball in the second half,
especially the start of the third quarter. We just didn't come out with the
energy we had in the first half. But I could definitely tell they were
switching 1 through 4 and we just didn't find open players.  
  
Q. Tyra, you had 14 first half points. What was working in the first
half? And the second half was it just their defense, did it hurt you in the
second half?  
TYRA BUSS: We were just moving the ball a lot. I was just trying to move away
from the defense and whoever was flashing middle we knew that their zone we
would get a lot of post touches especially flashing in the middle with either
Amanda or Lex especially, but they just did a good job of looking opposite and
finding me on kick-outs.  
  
Q. Lex, in the second half seemed like they were going inside/out and
finding open 3s. Could you have thrown anything different at them to kind of
slow that down?  
ALEXIS GASSION: For sure. Personally myself I kind of got stuck helping in too
far instead of stunting more, so I think that's something I could have
changed.  
  
Q. Coach Versyp was talking about switching 1 through 4. There's
offensive adjustments you guys tried to make once you see that --  
COACH MOREN: We just didn't hit shots. We really didn't. We had great looks.
The third quarter -- I'm getting all -- we shoot 12 percent. We're 2-for-17.
We got the shots; we just didn't hit them. And that's the frustrating thing.  
  
They got us out of rhythm. I don't want to take anything away from what they
did defensively. That's why they're at the top of the league defensively in
the Big Ten. I don't want to take anything away from that.  
  
But we just, we didn't hit shots. And that third quarter really hurt us. And
then we gave them confidence because at the beginning of the third quarter --
we just got done talking as a staff -- it was like we would miss, they would
go down and miss, we would miss, they would go down and miss. That's how it
got started.  
  
We never capitalized and took advantage of them missing. We continued to miss
unlike the first half. And then I thought again their transition, you know,
anytime you give up a transition 3 to Morrissette, that's a problem. You don't
know that Oden goes, what, 4-for-8 from the three-point line, or 5-for-8 down
the stretch there, and you leave her wide open in the corner.  
  
There's no excuse for that other than we blew some of our coverages. And maybe
that's Lex saying that she was overhelping a little bit too much. But to me
you have to have a feel for the game. And Morrissette and Oden were proven
scorers today in the second half. We didn't have to wonder if they could sit
out there and hit 3s. They did it. And we didn't adjust ourselves defensively
individually.  
  
Q. When you're not hitting shots, I know you like to get to the free-
throw line, you were 7-of-7 --  
COACH MOREN: We tried. We tried to get to the basket and tried to draw
contact. One of -- our emphasis was on knowing that Harris, McBryde, they want
to block shots, and Nora Kiesler. And so the game plan was to continue to
attack and try to get to the free-throw line. It's just that we didn't get any
calls, you know. But I didn't think our kids stopped being aggressive. It's
just things didn't go our way.  
  
Q. You seemed like (indiscernible) in the second half 20 seconds of
dribbling. Was it a matter of just them throwing the weird looks?  
COACH MOREN: We got out of sync. We really did. We were making play calls on
the sideline over there, and there were times that we were doing things that
they're not in our sets. And it led to us looked like we were dribbling around
and low shot clock, and Tyra trying to have to go make a play.  
  
And so we'll have to go back. I can't specifically tell you what went wrong
with us offensively. But we were not -- we got out of sync.  
  
We stopped doing the things that -- and again we forced them to get out of
their zone, too. So they played us more man. And then Jenn, I thought she got
great looks on the inside, but she either turned it over with her traveling or
she got called for charges, a couple of charges there. But clearly out of sync
in the second half offensively.  
  
Q. The same question last year, do you think you've done enough to make
the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MOREN: Again, you never want to -- I don't know. I hope. I think that we
went out intentionally, we've scheduled people. We haven't had a bad loss
other than Nebraska, I guess, if you consider that a bad loss.  
  
I'll say this: The Big Ten is a really dang good conference and it doesn't get
the respect it deserves. You've heard me say that on numerous occasions. So we
got beat by a really good team today in the Big Ten. And there's 14 of them.
And on any given night you can go whether you're home or away it doesn't
matter.  
  
If you're not ready to play you're going to get beat. It's real easy and again
there's a lot of conferences out there that aren't like that. You can show up
and play average and still win. You can't do that in this league. I personally
think we've done enough. We've got a veteran team. Obviously we had some
success last yearly being in that thing. So I would like to think that 20 wins
in a really good conference, 10-6, getting the double bye here this afternoon,
on paper looks good, I think.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Victoria Gaines](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32712)

### [Tori Jankoska](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26530)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 74, Michigan - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tori Jankoska, Victoria Gaines and Coach Suzy
Merchant.  
  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought it was a well-fought game. I really liked how our
team responded to certain things that Michigan was trying to do early with
matchups especially for Coco. She really took advantage of their decision to
put a guard on her, and I thought she did a great job, was super aggressive.  
  
I think we did a better job this game than we did last game of handling their
transition defense. There was a few times in the first half I think we got a
little confused, but for the most part we really wanted to make sure we were
back and taking out their transition game, and we were happy with that.  
  
And just happy that we won the game, I guess.  
  
Q. Victoria, could you talk about that second quarter when you guys had
that good run that just started -- I think you took two charging calls and I
think the team took three.  
VICTORIA GAINES: Yeah, mainly my defense gets me going for offense. So I just
love playing defense. And it showed today. So, yeah.  
  
Q. How important was it to get on top early and stay on top?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, it was kind of back and forth there. The beginning of
the second quarter was what sort of, I guess, separated us a little bit. And
the first quarter was pretty fast paced. There was a long stretch there where
everybody, I think, both teams were dying a little bit and just playing at a
really high rate of speed and transition.  
  
So that first quarter was anybody's and then we ended up tying it. But I
thought that second quarter was something where we got some confidence.  
  
They don't have a very deep bench. They play their five starters almost the
entire game and sprinkle in a kid or two. So we really felt like if they were
going to keep that pace we were going to win the game.  
  
We also think we had an advantage inside. So we just really tried to stay with
our game plan as much as we could, really be connected defensively in that
first half, especially when they were trying to play north and south and Coco
did a great job taking charges.  
  
Q. Victoria, huge game for you. What were they doing defensively that
you were able to take advantage of?  
VICTORIA GAINES: I just used my height and size as an advantage, just being
aggressive on offense, driving the ball and it just clicked for me.  
  
Q. When Allen hits those jumpers in the second quarter, that's a dynamic
they really can't see coming. How much does that change things for you guys
and kind of open things up?  
COACH MERCHANT: The one thing our bigs can do that's sort of probably what
they do best, to be honest, Jenna and Taya and Kennedy. And Coco, too. We have
a few sets where we try to run them off a little pin-down or off a cut or
whatnot.  
  
And Jenna hits her first one, you're almost sure, you better run a few more.
Then the way they were guarding the post, we felt also if we threw it in there
they were doubling early in the game, so we put Jenna at the high post and she
was able to knock down a few of those shots and take advantage. She has one of
the best shots of any post player I've ever coached. Really smooth, really
natural. Gets her feet set. Doesn't rush it. She's really a really good
shooter for a true center.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that defense again in that second quarter, not
only her charges but she blocked the path a couple of times, players driving?
And so did Allen?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought Jenna and her also, even Lexi got in there did some
things. I think when you have guards like -- Gondrezick really likes to play
downhill and she doesn't usually change direction when she starts to go. When
she's going as hard as she's going she's not going to cross you over now.  
  
Flaherty is a little different animal because she's got some hesitation and
some stopping and going and she can change directions. But Gondrezick is the
one if you can get over there she's going to come right in to you. And so we
really tried to concentrate on that defensively when she put the ball on the
floor because she's so powerful to the rim that if we could shut those driving
lanes off we'd be in good shape. And we couldn't do it from the strong side
because that's where their shooters were, so we had to come from underneath
from our bigs and have a complete rail rotation.  
  
Q. This is about tomorrow's game now. Maryland, you've never beaten?  
COACH MERCHANT: Never beaten.  
  
Q. And it seems like they're here again. Went to the NCAA Tournament
since they've come into the Big Ten. What do you have to do differently to get
a different outcome?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, I mean, a lot. You know? I think they're a well-oiled
machine. They're deep. Athletic, gotta handle their pressure. The thing with
Maryland, I think, and with us is you just can't have stretches. And two or
three minutes, it's like it's a close game. And in two or three minutes it's
12. I think you saw that with Minnesota.  
  
So every shot becomes important. If you want to beat them, you've got to
really be strong with the ball. You've got to be able to make reads. They're
athletic, handle multiple defenses. They don't foul you, so you've got to be
able to score over some size and athleticism.  
  
And defensively I think handling their transition game and keeping them out of
the paint. I mean, it's a challenge for sure. I told Brenda, I think she has a
team that can go to the Final Four now that she's got Slocum at the point. I
think that kid is as good as anybody in the league as a freshman. And she's
got some veteran guys around, and they just play very well together.  
  
And they have depth and size. So, I don't know, we're just going to enjoy this
one for a few more minutes and then not sleep for the next 24 hours. Maybe
their bus won't show up on time. (Laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 99, Northwestern - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Northwestern student-athletes and Coach
McKeown. We'll start with an opening statement from you and we'll take
questions from the students.  
  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, we got off to a rough start. We struggled a little
bit and Ohio State hit 9 3s and we just couldn't recover from that. And I felt
like we had a really good game plan. We played really well against them, our
senior group. And I thought we were ready to play.  
  
And you've got to give them credit. They just made a lot of shots, took us out
of what we did. And, you know, really that was the story of tonight's game or
today's game.  
  
On the other side of that, I can't tell you what these three student-athletes
have done for our program, for Northwestern. We're 20-11. They've won 23
games. Got to the NCAA Tournament. They've averaged probably 20 wins a year,
but more important the impact they've made on Northwestern women's basketball
nationwide and as student-athletes in the community, everything they've done
just really proud of them.  
  
And I think there's a chance we might get to play again, those things are out
of our hands right now. So we'll see. But, again, played such a great game
against Iowa and to come back today just didn't play as well as we're capable.
So disappointed. But really proud of this team.  
  
Q. Ashley, seemed like in the first half, first quarter especially you
guys struggled to get good looks offensively. What do you think that was?  
ASHLEY DEARY: We just had difficulty breaking their press.  
  
Q. And then the turnovers were a big issue. What kind of went wrong in
the game that led to so many turnovers?  
NIA COFFEY: Their press was giving us a lot of problems and we just turned
over the ball a lot, and we couldn't get into the flow of the offense.  
  
Q. Obviously got into first half trouble struggling against the press
how much was that a turning point to have to go deeper into the bench and find
some options at the point?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I mean, listen, Ashley Deary is -- she's played probably more
-- I don't even know in four years probably as many minutes as anybody in the
history of this program. So it's hard to be on the floor without her. And
picking up three fouls put us in a bind there. But, again, but the things we
probably needed to that we did in the first game against Ohio State, we just
couldn't get done today against the press.  
  
Q. Touched on it in the opening statement, but what has sort of the
senior class meant to the program and just to you as a head coach having them
on the team?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think the biggest thing to me personally was all three that
are sitting here could have went to hundreds of schools all over the country.
Great high school careers, were highly recruited, great student-athletes. For
them to take a chance on Northwestern and then on me, because at the time we
were just building, we were trying to turn the program around. And I spent a
lot of time recruiting all three and I'm really proud that they bought in not
just to me but to Northwestern and our family atmosphere.  
  
Q. You got into a bit of foul trouble early in the game and in the third
quarter. How were you guys adjusting to sort of Ashley with the three early
fouls?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yeah, obviously we could have done a better job handling the
press. With Ashley out and we just didn't do a very good job of -- and Ohio
State did a really good job of getting in passing lanes, trapping us,
deflections, forcing us to play faster than we wanted. That led to us taking
some, not just turnovers but some quick shots too that we thought those played
into the transition of both teams.  
  
Q. When you did break the press, it seemed like you were out of sync
offensively. Was the press a component of that, not being able to run really
crisp?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think there was some that. I think when we did break it we
were able to score. When we were able to run our offense and reverse the ball,
we were able to get good shots.  
  
I don't know how much playing yesterday, with so many injuries we have, played
into today, but we're not a program that's built on excuses. It's not how we
ended up being Northwestern.  
  
So just didn't get it done, just didn't execute. Didn't make the right pass at
the right time. And when you win 20 games and you have over .500 record in the
Big Ten, we made a lot of great plays this year. So today was, I think, an
exception to who we are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Shayla Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28374)

### [Kelsey Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28375)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 99, Northwestern - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you don't get to take many fourth quarters off. What was
going right for you out there tonight?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: It was going right for our team. I think we jumped out on it
aggressive on the defensive end. Put us in a good position to take off in the
right time and get ourselves right. And throughout the course of the game, I
think our defense stayed hammer down, not frustrated and I think it helped us.  
  
Q. You forced, I think, 17 first half turnovers and it was resulting in
points in the other direction. Was that the point of emphasis, just coming up
to set up the press early?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I think Coach McGuff put a big emphasis on returning to our
defense, which is what it's called, making sure that was really effective,
make sure we apply pressure when the ball was put in and when that happened
and we were able to get turnovers and get deflections and stuff like that, it
helped us throughout the course of the game. That was all.  
  
Q. Kelsey or Shayla, I saw intensity from the get-go even though you had
a four-day layoff. No Mavunga and the fact you're playing the ninth seed. Can
you talk about that?  
SHAYLA COOPER: Coach really put out an emphasis of coming out strong from the
gate. Like you said we had four days off, a lot of time in the gym to get
better. And we took this game as a step forward to get better.  
  
Q. Shayla, was there a point in this game, seemed pretty early on
looked, like, you guys knew you had them tired and they played yesterday and
you didn't. At what point did you realize we can kind of run away with this
thing?  
SHAYLA COOPER: From the beginning of every game. It was the pressure -- I
think the defense pressure had a big emphasis on them. We wanted to get out
running because we knew they played yesterday.  
  
Q. Shayla, when you have a player like Coffey who is a great rebounder,
great scorer, how much pride do you take in pulling down boards and battling
down low with her, especially with Stephanie out?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I took a lot of pride on the defensive end, especially playing
against a great player like that. As you said she's great offensive player
defensive player and great rebounding. So I wanted to make sure I kept my body
on her at all times.  
  
Q. Kelsey, with regard to Coach wants you to play faster and sure looked
like you did it today. Talk about that.  
KELSEY MITCHELL: It's not like it's a good or bad thing that I play fast.
Sometimes it's bad. Sometimes it's good. In this case I think it was really
effective knowing that a lot of teams don't like it and I think we're a
benefit that have a lot of players that want to keep a hot pace and a high
energy, and I think running the floor offensively and defensively is good for
myself and my teammates and our program. When we play against opponents that
don't like to run or aren't comfortable with that I think we have to take that
and utilize that and make it our positive.  
  
Q. Talked a little bit about defense, but I didn't see anybody this year
that played inbound defense like Asia Doss did. Talk about that. She was
awesome at that.  
COACH MCGUFF: She did a great job guarding the basket. Northwestern is
effective executing out of bound plays. They have to guard the basket. She did
a great job guarding the basket. Two nice steals. We went over it. It's one
thing to go over it, but it's another thing to have a player understand what
you're trying to accomplish, and she did a great job of it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Makayla Waterman and Alexa gave you off the
bench today?  
COACH MCGUFF: They were both understanding -- I think our bench in general
gave us a huge lift today. As we mentioned earlier we wanted to utilize our
depth and the pace of the game at which we play to play against a Northwestern
team who had played a hard-fought game yesterday and you can't do that unless
you have people off the bench in particular. I thought KK and Alexa were
excellent.  
  
Q. What in particular about the threats do you think really flummoxed
them today, was there any one aspect to it?  
COACH MCGUFF: Our initial pressure was really good. And we wanted to make them
play 94 feet and try to wear on them. And the only way that really works is if
when they inbound the ball we get initial pressure and we got what we wanted
today. And I think that really set the tone for everything else.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team? You scored 99 today. You tied your
own record for most points scored in the Big Ten Tournament. What does it say
about your team that you can do something like this against a team that in the
last couple of years has played you pretty tough?  
COACH MCGUFF: No, we played a good team today Northwestern has a great
basketball team they're talented and well coached. I think it just speaks to
the fact that we have continued -- I think in the last month we've gotten
better. We've stayed committed to who we are from a style of play standpoint.  
  
And that's with relentless pace and full court pressure. I think that was
evident today. And like I said you can't do that if you don't have the right
players and you don't have depth. We've got that and I think as long as we
continue to stay committed to that good things are going to happen for us.  
  
Q. You guys had 11 turnovers in the first half, I guess. But you only
had two points off of those turnovers and you were killing them in transition,
what does it say about your team they were able to get back into defense?  
COACH MCGUFF: We were committed to transition defense. I think of those 11 I
felt like we had all 11 in the first two minutes. We couldn't get a shot up.  
  
But we were a little anxious, I think, to really impose our will on the game
and we got a little sloppy to start. But once we settled down we were fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Kaila Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32703)

### [Shatori Walker-
Kimbrough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28346)

### [Brionna Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26977)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 92, Minnesota - 80  
  
MODERATOR: We've been joined by Maryland. We'll start with an opening
statement from Coach Frese. Then go to the students for questions.  
  
COACH FRESE: I thought we started a little slow, which sometimes it's typical
when you start a tournament and then Minnesota came out, having played in the
game before really aggressive, especially on the glass. But I thought once we
were able to kind of settle in we were able to make a lot of plays. I thought
our bench contribution with Ieshia and Brianna Fraser off the bench gave us
some great minutes. Shatori in the third quarter really gave us great scoring
punch.  
  
And again when you look at, from Kaila and Bri, they continued to do great
things on the defensive end. Kaila was very active for her first tournament
game here. So I was proud that we were able to use our depth in terms of this
game.  
  
Q. Shatori, third quarter you had 16 points. Can you talk about that?
You seemed comfortable shooting the ball in that quarter.  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: My teammates kept finding me, kept giving me great
confidence. I air-balled in the first half. Kristen looked at me, told me to
keep shooting. Come in at halftime, Ieshia said let the thing fly. So I let
the thing fly in the second half.  
  
Q. Kaila, what was it like playing in your first tournament game,
playing in an NBA arena? (Indiscernible)  
KAILA CHARLES: It was exciting. It was a good team win. I like how we pushed
through fatigue, and we had a slow start so we were able to pick everything
up. In terms of just how it felt, I love challenges. So I like that we have
this tournament where everybody's playing their hardest to win. So it's a fun
experience.  
  
Q. Brionna, another quiet double-double. I say quiet because Shatori,
six 3-pointers. She mentioned a slow start, Minnesota had the day before to
play, did it feel good to get this one out of the way?  
BRIONNA JONES: Yeah, it feels good to have one under our belt, just to get our
flow back and just getting prepared for the next game.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up for any of you. You plan on watching the game here
that's about to take place, or are you just going to go back and focus on the
game you just played, get ready for tomorrow?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: A little bit of both. Probably watch the minutes and
probably go -- not watch the full game but we'll try to be the most prepared
team going into tomorrow. If we don't we'll definitely be prepared for
tomorrow for film.  
  
Q. Shatori, you guys mentioned how you're expecting to get everybody's
best punch here in the tournament. Everybody is 0-0. Is that what you kind of
attribute the slow start to, just Minnesota coming out intense, or what do you
think happened there?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, I think Minnesota came out and threw the first
punch. I give credit to them. They came out pushing tempo, pushing in
transition and had us on our heels a little bit. But I thought we responded
really well. I thought we came out in the second quarter, third quarter
defensively and offensively putting the pressure back on them.  
  
Q. Are there different things you want to clean up before going into
tomorrow night's game, especially after Minnesota shoot 53 percent or
something like that?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, we definitely talked about that in the locker room after
the game. I think we can give a better effort defensively and rebounding the
basketball. So I know how much these guys pride themselves on both areas. So I
know that we'll bounce back in terms of playing better on both ends.  
  
Q. On the flip side, fourth time in five games you've shot as a team
better than 52 percent. What's kind of been working offensively for the
team?  
COACH FRESE: I think just the way we share the basketball. When you look at
our assist-to-turnover ratio. We're just really starting to understand they
want to collapse on Bri, and being able to play through her, and it gives us
easy looks. But I thought our ball movement again was really, really good as a
team.  
  
Q. Again, you blew them out last time, just less than a week ago, 33
points or something. What do you kind of attribute the difference to? What do
you take away from this?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I think they shot the ball extremely well. Hubbard was
someone we talked about that hadn't played in the contest against us. You saw
the line she had tonight with 28 points. So there's a big difference right
there with a player that didn't play last time.  
  
We did want to utilize our depth having a big picture. So I think when you
look at the fourth quarter and we got beat in that quarter, I thought
defensively we gave up a lot of points in the fourth quarter.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Kysre Gondrezick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32714)

### [Katelynn Flaherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32715)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 74, Michigan - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan here. And Coach, we'll ask you to make
an opening statement.  
  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Obviously we're extremely disappointed. We've had a really
great season and we were hoping to make a little bit of a run in the Big Ten
Tournament. Michigan State's a great team. I know they've had some
disappointing losses, but they've had some great wins throughout the season.  
  
And they've always presented a difficult matchup for us. I thought we did a
great job in the game plan of following the game plan of making Tori work for
everything she's got. And it was, you know, kids, other kids on their team
stepped up and made plays for them and that hurt us.  
  
Q. Katelynn, in the second quarter, when the run goes against you, how
hard is it to get it back when you're going back and forth and it's been so
close for so long?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I think it's just tough especially when we got in foul
trouble, and when they make shots it's hard for us to get into transition,
which we're really good at, so I think that just kind of hurt us. But we just
have to learn to face -- work through tough times and just work on our
momentum and just try to stop their momentum and get it to swing our way.  
  
Q. Kysre, talk about you brought a lot to the table today, determination
and we could see how much you wanted it but it just wasn't happening. Talk
about how you played and also the frustration with the outcome?  
KYSRE GONDREZICK: I'm not going go by individual performances. I think on both
ends it's a team effort. We had a game plan and other players just stepped up
with the personnel they had and the range with the post players knocking in,
and Branndais coming down and hitting two crucial shots. It's stuff like that
that just gives you kind of like mental lapses but we just had to regroup. I
know one thing that Coach talked about was that she admired the fight in us,
and we just had and we had to play to the end and we just came up short.  
  
Q. Katelynn, you've got four or five you've lost. Are you concerned
you're going to the NCAAs about momentum or do you think there's a way to get
it back, matchup or something?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I mean, I think some of these losses are good for us. Coach
says it kind of puts a fire in us. It's definitely disappointing to lose today
after coming off the past couple of games where we haven't performed like we
would have. But we're definitely determined especially after losing this game.
It really hurts but we're focused to get back in the gym and get ready and
work hard, especially look at these games and work on what we see that we need
to do.  
  
Q. Katelynn, the shots just weren't dropping for you guys. That's an
understatement. But what was behind that? Was it something you saw in terms of
why that was happening?  
KATELYNN FLAHERTY: I think we got great looks. We missed shots. Sometimes it
just happens. Moving forward, we definitely need to find a way to keep scoring
when that does happen. But I think we got great looks and we just couldn't
knock them down today.  
  
Q. When Allen starts hitting those midrange jumpers in the second
quarter seems like that is a matchup you don't anticipate and you kind of have
to react to?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, and I thought it also hurt that Hallie was in foul
trouble in the second quarter, too. That really affected our scoring. We only
had nine points. And part of that was Hallie's matchup with Allen.  
  
They did a good job. And we had watched this leading up of, they back screened
Tori coming through the middle. And if you step over to help, they pop Allen,
and she's a 6'4" kid who hit a bunch of jumpers for them today.  
  
I mean, that's the difference. If you look at their bench points compared to
our bench points, they really made an impact for them today.  
  
And obviously it was led by Jenna Allen and Gaines, who was another kid that
we thought didn't score in bunches for them, she wasn't a key going in, really
made us pay for that as well.  
  
Q. There was a point, I don't know if it's the end of the third or
beginning of the fourth where they substituted pretty much everybody except
for one starter. And it looked like here's your opportunity to make a run.
Talk about what happened in that time and why you weren't able to make a run
right there.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Well, I think we got a little stagnant offensively. We had
trouble scoring against them offensively, but then I thought during that time
Hallie got a lot of great looks and a lot of great touches. She's a kid that
shoots 60-something percent from the floor.  
  
And I think in this second half, if I'm correct, she was like 5-for-13, which
is not typical of Hallie. So we were able to get the ball inside and we went
with a smaller lineup to get more offense. And then she missed and we didn't
get any offensive rebounds.  
  
So we never really got anything going. Hallie was getting touches. We got good
looks, but we didn't make them. It was a case where we weren't really scoring
the basketball, and then we weren't getting stops so we couldn't really get
anything easy in transition either.  
  
So a combination of a few things, but I thought there was a stretch -- I mean
in the second half we really got good looks. We just didn't get them to fall.
And I think part of that is the pressure of the situation. Part of that is
Michigan State, for sure. They're bigger bodies. They're aggressive bodies. We
were getting bumped and banged around and that definitely weighed on us for
sure.  
  
Q. How do you regroup from here? You've got time to do that. But as a
coach you probably are already running those things through your mind. What do
you need to do to get your team back on track?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: That's a great question, and we're sitting as coaches and
talking about that already. We lost a really tough one the other day at Penn
State that we felt should have gone our way.  
  
So down the stretch here we've had the tough part of our schedule, and
obviously we have to regroup from that moving forward. I think a couple of
days, obviously, off will get the kids a break and get them fresh again. And
we had a really good week of practice leading up. We felt really good about
today. Michigan State's just -- it's been a real tough matchup for us. It's
interesting, we get them every year we come here.  
  
It's just been a tough matchup for us. I think we gotta move forward from it.
We've got to continue to work on improving. And our kids will bounce back.
They still have an opportunity to be a part of the best team that's ever been
at Michigan. And I think that's really important to Siera and Danielle to
leave that legacy behind.  
  
So I know that they're going to go out fighting and that we are going to
regroup. And if we get selected, which we still feel like our total body of
work, which will get us selected to the NCAA Tournament, it will be the first
time anyone on our team has ever been in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So we still have a ton to play for. And I think that's really important for
our kids to know and I think they're competitors, they're fighters, and they
will definitely bounce back from this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

### [Teniya Page](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32663)

### [Sierra Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28296)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 70, Penn State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you just want to take questions?  
  
Q. You guys were able to fight back tonight (indiscernible). What does
that say about this group?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think we really tried to rally back. Minnesota got
off to a good start in the first quarter. And then I thought the second
quarter our defense locked in pretty well and made it a game. And then we just
competed down the stretch.  
  
Q. You guys, after that first quarter, seemed to kind of tighten things
up defensively and then offensively as well with the turnovers. Was there any
kind of change in philosophy there?  
COACH WASHINGTON: You know, I think it just took us a quarter to kind of feel
them out. And once we kind of figured out the game and the way the game was
being called and things of that nature, we just kind of settled in.  
  
Q. You had players on both sides, you had Teniya, and Sierra with a
double-double. Can you talk about their performances?  
COACH WASHINGTON: They've been key players for us all season long. And they're
the barometer. You know coming into every game that they're going to compete,
they're going to fight. And they did the same thing.  
  
I thought Sierra got some big offensive rebounds and made some big plays for
us in the fourth quarter. And Teniya was fantastic all night. So those two
certainly came with a lot of energy, a lot of effort and made a lot of big
plays for us.  
  
Q. You guys obviously were hoping to play more basketball here. Is that
the kind of thought process and mindset? I know it's tough right now.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, it's something we've got to talk about as a team.
We're competitors and the opportunity to continue to play is something that
we'll look forward to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything for the students? Okay. Thank you, ladies.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Bridget Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32650)

### [Andreona Keys](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32651)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Illinois - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue, Coach Versyp, Andreona Keys, Bridget
Perry. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH VERSYP: We knew it was going to be a battle. Big Ten Tournament,
anything can happen. Illinois played really well yesterday and shot the lights
out.  
  
So we needed to really take away the 3. Knew it would take a little while for
our bodies to get going. So the first half we weren't as sharp as normal, but
I thought the second half we really started doing what we do well, rebounding
and running. And I was obviously very pleased with the effort and the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Keys, you looked pretty determined today. What was your motivation
out there?  
ANDREONA KEYS: At the beginning of the game, I told my team that we didn't
come here for one game, and we didn't want to go home today. And that's really
all that I needed to keep going and push through that game.  
  
Q. Bridget, why was Keys so successful today on the offensive end?  
BRIDGET PERRY: She just didn't hesitate. She took what the defense gave her.
She had her mid-range going. She had her 3. She was attacking, so she was
really a force in all facets on the court. So that's why she was successful.  
  
Q. Keys, you said before that you were motivated, but seemed like the
fourth quarter especially you were even more motivated. What were you feeling
there in the fourth?  
ANDREONA KEYS: Illinois, they kept fighting. So it was just a game of runs.
And it was starting to get closer and closer to the fourth quarter, like you
said, and the end of the game. And once we went to man, we started getting
more aggressive and our defense was just coming along. So I started getting
excited from my team.  
  
Q. Any chance this is a carry-over from what happened on Sunday with
your last-second shot?  
ANDREONA KEYS: Probably so. But that was just a really special moment. I
wanted to carry that into here and just build my confidence. And I know that
we came here for one thing. So we're trying to get it.  
  
Q. Bridget, I guess overcoming the second quarter there, you guys had
the drought. What did you feel going into halftime? Getting the five-point
lead going into the half, did that make you feel at least like you had that
going a bit?  
BRIDGET PERRY: Yeah, I think the first half was a little bit just kind of the
nerves of the Big Ten Tournament, and we definitely had some lackadaisical
plays on defense that we shouldn't have had that we didn't have in the second
half.  
  
But we just wanted to get out and really just kind of send a message, like,
we're here in the Big Ten Tournament, like Keys said, we're not here for just
one game. We came out and played like it.  
  
Q. You get a matchup with IU. They got you earlier in the year. What
kinds of things have to change?  
BRIDGET PERRY: We need to play better defense. Last time we played them, our
defense was not nearly as good as it is now. So playing defense, knowing their
shooters, and just playing hard and with heart.  
  
Like we did especially in the second half, you know, we got to go out and have
fun as a team every single time.  
  
ANDREONA KEYS: Like Bridget said, defense has to be there. When we played them
at IU, we didn't show up. This is a bigger stage, and it's still IU. So we're
still keeping that rivalry there, but we just have to go out and play
basketball, have fun and be aggressive.  
  
Q. Sharon, just, you know, usually with Keys, today she added in the
scoring. What did you see from her from an aggressive point of view trying to
take the ball to the basket?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, Keys was just, what I always expect from her. And
now you really saw it in the stat sheet today. Every part of her game was
going. But she was focused from the get-go.  
  
From ever since we won on Sunday, her focus of coming in here has been better,
her and Bridget's have been at the highest level, and that's what you want.
And she was hungry and, she kept saying we're going to do this at huddles and
we're going to do this.  
  
And she kept communicating. And I think that shows great signs of leaders. And
her stats line was just phenomenal today.  
  
Q. What do you have to do different against IU?  
COACH VERSYP: We've got to do a lot of things. We've got to be able to play
defense. We've got to be able to rebound. We've got to be able to make
adjustments on the fly. They're a good shooting basketball team. So we've got
to be able to limit some opportunities. Not all.  
  
And we've got to score the basketball and see our mismatches and see what we
can do against them on the offensive end.  
  
But, like I said, we've got to be very aggressive on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Sharon, every time Illinois seemed to tie it, you guys answered.
What's that say about your club, the way they're playing right now?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, you know, it's kind of that never-say-die attitude. And
that's how it's been our last four, five games. Somebody makes a run. We said
everybody's going to give us a punch. And we've got to be able to come right
back. You saw the Big Ten Tournament these last games; that's all it's been.
All of a sudden somebody's 30-6 runs and 18-3 runs. That's going to happen, so
you've got to prepare yourself for that. But you've got to just stay confident
and stay poised and that's what I felt we did. We executed and got the shots
we needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Cayla McMorris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32674)

### [Avyanna Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32632)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 70, Wisconsin - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Coach Tsipis and Wisconsin student-athletes Cayla
McMorris and Avyanna Young. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH TSIPIS: I think that game is reflective for 35 minutes of what we've
been able to grow, not just since the last time we played Michigan State on
January 24th. But throughout the season.  
  
And I'm really proud of our group. To be able to come back, having the game
yesterday and again the first half I thought we did a phenomenal job
attacking. We did a great job, I thought, on the glass.  
  
In the second half, I thought Michigan State stepped to another level and
challenged us on the glass and we weren't able to respond the way I would have
liked. But it wasn't anything to do with an effort or a competitiveness with
our kids.  
  
And it's always the hardest game, because only one team at the end, I guess
two, walk away as winners. And as I told our team in the locker room, we have
grown so much to just be able to compete and fight and put ourselves in a
position to be successful. And we cut down on our turnovers. I thought we did
a great job of getting the ball inside and working off of that.  
  
And I thought that part helped open up things for our guards. And I think as
we're trying to build our program at Wisconsin, you go through highs and lows.
And I still remember on March 30th to be able to meet the team and see that
excitement. And that's what I saw tonight from our team. And that excitement
of we're going to go out there and show them.  
  
And I still can remember, I tried to smile after the game because I still
remember when Avyanna Young was interviewed right after I was hired, and she
said what was the one thing that stood out and she said he has a nice smile.
Hopefully I can continue to have coaching match how my smile is.  
  
But I'm really proud of our seniors, of Avy, of Mikey Crall, of Taylor Kuhn
and how they were able to navigate through the ups and downs and put us in a
position where their legacy will be how hard they worked and that front end of
moving our program forward. And I think that's the part that now falls on
Cayla.  
  
And I think Cayla showed tonight why she's an All-Big Ten All-Conference
member, and that attacking part as we move forward. And there's nothing, I
think, from this game that I look back and say our kids played a two-minute or
three-minute stretch where they didn't leave it all out there. And as a coach
that's what you can ask for is great effort and understanding of playing
together on both sides of the basketball, and in the end not worried about
individual goals.  
  
And I think that's what they did. And I'm proud of them. I'm excited. They
need a little down time. But this one is going to stick, I think, as something
to help motivate us this spring and this summer to continue to build Wisconsin
women's basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Avyanna, 17 points, 8-of-13 from the field. What were you doing that
was so effective against Michigan State defense?  
AVYANNA YOUNG: I was trying to beat the double team but my teammates really
put me in a good position to finish at the basket. They led me to the basket
when we played inside/outside. They fed us back the ball in the post instead
of just they could have took it themselves and they didn't, and I really
appreciate them for trusting me in being able to finish.  
  
Q. Avy and Cayla, could you talk about the change from the first half to
the second and how Michigan State pretty much kind of stepped up, especially
Jankoska?  
CAYLA MCMORRIS: Yeah, I would definitely say she did what she does best I feel
in the second half. I feel like I could have played a lot better defense on
her. I feel like we carried over our momentum, though, as far as still
fighting and pushing. They just out-hustled us.  
  
Q. Avy, you and Marsha have this great combination inside. Can you talk
about how it's been being able to play with her?  
AVYANNA YOUNG: It's been great playing with Marsha. Because I love her
intensity, her aggressiveness. We just feed off of each other and everything
just goes back down to trust. We trust each other once we pass each other the
ball, dive, rebound. We knew we were going to finish. We were just there for
each other.  
  
Q. Avy, you talked about coming to Wisconsin was your dream. Can you
talk about what your career has been like and the improvement you've seen this
season?  
AVYANNA YOUNG: The improvement is definitely growth in myself and with the
team and just being able to grow as a person, and I thank Wisconsin for being
patient through all my ups and downs and how everything happened. And I'm just
happy that I was able to finish with the team and Coach and everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how this was going to stick with you.
In the past, like volleyball, the end of their season, they put the score up
on the scoreboard. Is that something that you're going to refer to, or is
there going to be a new season next year?  
COACH TSIPIS: Well, I think if you're a competitor, as a coach, as a student-
athlete, it's what is driving you. And I think being driven as a team is
knowing the position we put ourselves in throughout this game, and to be able
to advance to the next round of the Big Ten Tournament. And an understanding
of the work that it took to put us in that spot.  
  
And I think that part individually knowing that we have people that grew their
game through the season, I'm a big believer that teams develop throughout the
journey and that individual players are able to put themselves where they can
improve through the offseason. But I think that part of our kids being able to
look at and say all the things we did to put ourselves in a position to be
successful in this game, you know we took better care of the basketball. We
didn't foul.  
  
I thought we did a good job -- I thought Jankoska made a couple of really,
really good one-on-one moves. I think Cayla, I think that's -- Cayla wants to
be that defender. And I thought she made a couple of moves. I'm not sure
there's a lot of people in the country that could stop that. But I think
finishing possessions out. I think we can learn from that and use this score
of how do you finish that part out.  
  
And we talked about 37-30. That score at halftime. But again you hope -- if
you're competitive, you hope you're getting somebody's best effort. And I
think that's now the difference is going in to this spring, there's always
that growth of learning your players and as they mature.  
  
I think now that part of being able to reflect and see what we've done and
move forward that we can be stronger. We can be better ball handlers. We can
do those things and continue to put that part together and grow our team.  
  
If that score doesn't stick with you whether you put it up on the scoreboard
or in the locker room things like that it will be referred to. But it will
also be referred to the progress we've made not just since we played Michigan
State but since the Ohio State game at home, I think that part of growing off
of that and knowing going into next year that we have to have somebody step
up. And I think we're in the situation, even the last two nights, not having
Malayna Johnson, I thought Kendall stepped up. And I thought with having
Chelly Marble, how she played last night and stepping in the role today,
having three assists, no turnovers, doing a great job defensively, with three
rebounds, that part of advancing her game.  
  
And as I told them, there's no room for settling. And my first year at George
Washington we won our first conference tournament game and the next day I
think we were excited to warm up to play in the second one.  
  
I'll tell you what, tonight, our kids, as soon as we met last night and
started talking about it, it was great to see that belief that they were going
to execute things today to put us in a position to be successful.  
  
And that's what you want a group to have that belief every time they step on
the floor. And if they don't accomplish that, that itself drives you no matter
what you're doing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Marlene Stollings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27751)

### [Carlie Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28378)

### [Kenisha Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28389)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 70, Penn State - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Minnesota. Coach Stollings, we'll ask you to
make an opening statement then we'll go to questions for the students.  
  
COACH STOLLINGS: We have a lot of people in here because it's their first time
at the Big Ten Tournament, so we wanted them to see what this is like. I'll
say it's -- really proud of this team for how they battled the entire time and
a pretty physical game. I thought we handled the physicality very well.  
  
A very talented Penn State team on a great run, great momentum coming into the
tournament. Most proud of us forcing 18 turnovers and what we did with those
turnovers. We're coming off a game at Maryland where we forced 21 but we
didn't do anything on the offensive end of the ball. Tonight with those 18
turnovers we scored 23 points which is a huge key in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Carlie, in the fourth quarter you guys held Penn State without a
field goal for about just five minutes roughly. Defensively what was
especially working in that stretch for you guys?  
CARLIE WAGNER: We just knew we had to sit down and play defense and stop
dribble penetration down the middle because that's what was really hurting us.
I thought we did a lot better job the fourth quarter, coming out and sitting
down and playing defense, not letting them get to the basket so easy.  
  
Q. Carlie, you've been here and what did you try to tell some of your
teammates about this atmosphere and this stage?  
CARLIE WAGNER: There's nothing like it. This is March Madness now. This is so
much fun. This is what we work for all year. And to be here is just so
exciting. It's amazing. It's an experience that you'll never forget.  
  
Q. Kenisha, in the fourth quarter and the first quarter your offense was
really good. What stands out when you guys were clicking offensively, because
in that second quarter there you kind of stagnated a little bit?  
KENISHA BELL: I think moving the ball with pace helped us a lot because at
first we kind of were playing casual, going through the offensive sets,
without being a threat. And then the fourth quarter we just talked about that
and had to pick up the intensity.  
  
Q. I don't see you guys play, but after the halftime you guys came out
with five or six minutes to go and had about five or six players shooting up
shots in a hurry. Is that normal or something special you wanted to do
today?  
COACH STOLLINGS: It's not special. We always try to get out from halftime and
get a lot of shots out. But we came out a couple minutes early because we
haven't been on this court or we had not been on this court prior to the game
pretty much. So you know we want our shooters to get out there and be able to
see the basket and to be able to get on that end because we had not been on
that end of the floor at all.  
  
Q. Page with them obviously had 35. You really held everything else in
check. Were you somewhat content to some degree with her getting points but
holding everyone else in check?  
COACH STOLLINGS: She's a special player. And she hit some tough shots. But
then she also got away from us some. So we mixed up into a box and one to try
to cool her off a little bit. But she's a phenomenal player and had a great
game for them. But what we did very well was not let another player, as you
alluded to, go off on us. So it's hard to get beat by one player. And I
thought we did a good job containing the rest of their team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Branndais Agee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32675)

### [Tori Jankoska](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26530)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 70, Wisconsin - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Merchant, and
then we'll go to the students.  
  
COACH MERCHANT: It was sort of a rusty go of it in the beginning. You know, I
think sometimes when you wait around and have like a bye game it's hard to get
into a rhythm. Give Wisconsin a lot of credit. I thought they came out and
were really aggressive on offense and we were a bit tentative. I thought the
second half we made some changes and some adjustments and started to do some
things that bothered them.  
  
And we adjusted what we were shooting. We were shooting a lot of outside shots
in that first half and really tried to get back to the paint and attack
inside.  
  
So I was proud of coming up with a win. I think Wisconsin was playing really
well at the time. And we had to fight and scratch and claw to get the win. And
that's all you can do at this time of year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tori or Branndais.  
  
Q. Tori, when you struggle like that out of the gate is that something
where you try to let everyone get back in it and you'll find your spots? Or
were you just kind of force it until it worked?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Like Coach Merchant said it's kind of hard to sit out for a
couple of days when the other team is in a rhythm. I think as a team we had to
find our rhythm defensively and get some stops, and we can get some transition
buckets on the offensive end and we can all settle in.  
  
Q. How about you, that first quarter, (indiscernible)?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Just kind of letting the game come to me. It wasn't really
anything that they were doing, but, yeah, just letting it come.  
  
Q. Branndais, can you talk about the offensive rebounding you guys did
in the third quarter? You had, like, 10 offensive rebounds as a team and got a
lot of second chances?  
BRANNDAIS AGEE: I think it's very important that we offensive rebound because
they're a very good defensive rebounding team. So for us to get those boards
and get second chance shots it was very important for us, and it helped us get
this win.  
  
Q. When you're down seven at the half and you have played a strong
second, got contact in the first after the poor shooting, how do you tell them
to stay in it when this is a team you blew out earlier in the year?  
COACH MERCHANT: I mean, a couple of things. Certainly our post defense we
talked about. And we just talked about tactical things. You know, number one,
our post defense wasn't very good. We switched to our zone to try to deter
some of those things with some traps.  
  
And then I felt like we were really, it was kind of a struggle on offense.
There wasn't a lot of flow. So probably the first time in a while I've
actually got into Tori a little bit. Sometimes when she gets frustrated she
can get on a little bit of an island and kind of just try to do too much and
not play the way we know she can.  
  
So I kind of got into her a little bit there. And she had a great -- obviously
a great second half. I'm not sure it's exactly what I said. But I think she
needed to understand that, like, she needed the guys to her right and to her
left. She had a edge to her.  
  
But I said after the game I think when you're the only senior on this team,
you know, that there is an edge to you. And that fear of it being the last
game for you in the tournament is real.  
  
And she doesn't like to lose and I think sometimes it manifests itself in a
way that isn't always healthy at times. I give her a lot of credit. Because I
thought that second half she was driving the ball more. She was dishing and
getting rebounds. She was really attacking the basket. She had some nice post
feeds. She just kind of really took it to heart and adjusted what she was
doing and giving to her teammates.  
  
Q. 12 points -- 12 rebounds for Taya Reimer, four offensive rebounds.
Could you talk about her performance?  
COACH MERCHANT: Our post defense wasn't the best the first half. They had
quite a few points in the paint. And that was disappointing. I don't think we
were working real hard to fight their duck-ins and really challenge their
shots.  
  
So we kind of talked about that at halftime too. And I thought that Taya had
two really big offensive rebound putbacks that kind of kept the momentum going
our way, and she had two really big defensive rebounds down the stretch.  
  
So it was really positive for us to see her have a double-double. She's been
close a lot of times where she's had seven, eight rebounds. But for her to
kind of step up and keep the ball alive and finish down there was really
important for us.  
  
Q. You guys played so well in that game at Michigan. They had that big
crowd and everything. Is that something that carries over? Does it matter in
this game or is it a different scenario?  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't think anything matters. We beat Wisconsin by 24 points
at their place, on the road. And then turn around and had to squeak one out. I
don't think anything matters. Look on the men's side, look on the women's
side; it's all across the country. Records don't matter. Seeding doesn't
matter. It's teams that work the hardest, play the hardest and do the right
things, and the ball falls for them, and they're making their own breaks.  
  
I thought Wisconsin made all the right moves in the first half and played with
a lot of energy and aggressiveness and we didn't. And then we changed our
minds and flipped it in the second half.  
  
So, you know, it was a good victory at Michigan. But I think that seems like
forever ago.  
  
Q. You guys used -- you're not the rusty team tomorrow. You played a
game is that your advantage?  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't think it hurts. I think sometimes the jitters kind of
happen. I was telling the team when we played for the Big Ten Championship
last year against Maryland in that first game we almost didn't get there. We
had to play a Purdue team, I think, was an 11 seed, and we had to hang on like
to the very end and catch the ball and hold it and make some free throws down
the stretch or we wouldn't have even gotten there. We could have been bounced
in the first round.  
  
So sometimes when you're waiting around and you haven't played, you know, you
get the jitters. I feel like it's nice to play sometimes and stay in a little
bit of a rhythm. But the hard part is now you've got to play back to back and
the other team didn't.  
  
But it will be a tough game. They're very well-coached and they've got some
really, really good players. And they run good stuff and they defend. So it
will be a battle.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Ashley Deary](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28349)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Northwestern - 78, Iowa - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach McKeown and the Northwestern student-
athletes Ashley Deary and Nia Coffey. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MCKEOWN: It was a great game, a game of quarters. And I thought we
played so well in the second quarter. Went into halftime I thought with a lot
of confidence. I thought we played really well in the third quarter too.  
  
I thought Iowa is too good offensively to not score. And I thought they
started to get the ball inside. And we had to change some of our schemes. But
our players adjusted really well.  
  
And then I like how we finished the game out. We got rebounds. We made free
throws, and that's what you want to do this time of year, pretty much. This is
a game where last year we played great here. And I just love how we played
today as a team, just the energy, the effort. And when you have my two
bodyguards with me, you think you've got a chance to win, you know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students, please.  
  
Q. Nia, 34 points today. 15 of 26 shooting. What was working really well
for you?  
NIA COFFEY: Just attacking the paint and getting easy layups and being
aggressive.  
  
Q. In that game scenario what's going through your mind and what's the
important thing when you're at the free-throw line in that moment?  
ASHLEY DEARY: Just to stay focused. That's what we practice, playing under
pressure. And we did a good job of keeping control of the ball for the most
part and knocking down free throws when we needed to.  
  
Q. To start the game you had, I think, seven turnovers in the first
quarter. How important was it for you to stay focused and to not let that
bother you for the rest of the game, Ashley?  
ASHLEY DEARY: It was really important. Once we slowed the game down a little
bit and just -- we knew they were going to anticipate. So when we controlled
the ball and took care of it, good things happened and we scored.  
  
Q. Ashley and Nia, it's been a lively season for both the men and women
of Northwestern this season. Is there any feeling, can that momentum and
enthusiasm go from one to the other? Do you have a lot of connections with one
another?  
NIA COFFEY: We're very supportive of both teams at Northwestern so just seeing
the success happen on both sides, so it really feels good in our program and
we make sure we continue that in both sides.  
  
ASHLEY DEARY: I echo that. We see the guys working hard in practice. We
support them just like they support us. It's a family thing.  
  
COACH MCKEOWN: When Chris Collins came in and when you see how hard they work
-- their staff, their players -- I think it's you see now you see the results.
And I think it's just great for Northwestern, our athletic department, our
university. But just you really -- the guys you want to see win because
they're always trying to do the right thing and their staff, they've just
grinded so hard to get to this point. So hopefully last night it was fun to
see that.  
  
Q. You've played a lot of close games lately but haven't won any of
them. What was the difference in getting a win today?  
ASHLEY DEARY: I think not turning the ball over was a really big thing for us.
And we took care of the ball. That made a big difference. We got open looks.
We really locked in on defense and got some key rebounds. So that was a big
difference maker between past games and this game.  
  
Q. There was that one play with just under a minute left when you picked
the ball up off the floor and somehow saw Nia there. Could you either describe
what was going through your mind -- it was like a broken play and she passed
it to her?  
ASHLEY DEARY: Where I was by myself? Yeah, that was just hard. We had people
diving on the floor. She was open and so I gave it to her.  
  
COACH MCKEOWN: Statue of Liberty play. We haven't used it until today.  
  
NIA COFFEY: I was just open so I called for it.  
  
Q. Joe, during the run with Coffey having four fouls, what were your
thoughts, because she went a long way with four fouls?  
COACH MCKEOWN: My thoughts were don't get your fifth foul, number one; and
number two, don't try to block every shot where you might get your fifth foul.  
  
But she's right next to me now. Nia, she's matured so much. And she knows how
to play, I think, in those situations. And this maturity, and I think she
showed great poise today by not fouling, but still being aggressive in
offense. That's why I kept her in. Iowa was making a run. We needed to score
and I thought she did a great job of keeping her poise.  
  
Q. Another year with a crazy game in the Big Ten Tournament, what's
special about this event where you played such crazy, such good games?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I will tell you, you know, without going back that far, we've
been in the semifinals the last two years and have had great games. We had a
great game with Maryland two years ago in the semifinals where we had a
13-point lead. Last year the run we made, the way we did it, you know, it was
special. And I think these guys, I brought them all here. They're seniors,
which is really hard. And I think they want to go out on top. They want to
prove whatever there is to prove.  
  
Not so much to the outside world, but I think just to us, too, that they're
going to walk out of here and they're like hey, we did this the right way, we
just had special careers here and they don't want it to end.  
  
Q. You made the decision to give Pallas her first start of the season in
this game. I don't think she scored any points but she had a bunch of huge
offensive and defensive rebounds and big presence on defense. What went into
that decision maybe when you made it?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I will tell you I had Chris Collins actually talk to my team
yesterday. He's been on me every day about Pallas, and so has my wife. And so
has everybody else that wonders how you have a player that gets every rebound
and there's two players in practice you don't want to play against. And one is
her and the other is Pallas. And so I think she's been through a lot this
year.  
  
I think she's overcome some things. She's starting to play at the level that
we feel like she's capable of. She brings something that very few players have
in our league. And that type of explosion and just her ability to get to the
ball quickly like I said.  
  
So this time of year when rebounding is so important, post defense, and just
diving on the floor for your teammates. She does all those things.  
  
Q. Probably most obvious question to ask is between Ashley and Nia and
you, Jordan came from this town, Hankins, every day this tournament started
with the mention of her passing this year. All three of your comments about
winning a game and about Jordan?  
ASHLEY DEARY: We know we had a big run last year and a lot of that was because
of Jordan. So she's been on our hearts. We go out and we play for her. It's
great to be in her hometown. She's always on our minds, always thinking about
her. So we're just going out playing for her and trying to make her proud.  
  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think Ashley said it about as good as you could say it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

### [Brandi Beasley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32625)

### [Kennedy Cattenhead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32652)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Illinois - 58  
  
COACH BOLLANT: Coach Bollant.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Matt, we'll just ask you to make an opening statement.  
  
COACH BOLLANT: Proud of our team. I felt like we didn't get off to a great
start, didn't make shots in the first quarter. We were down 20-8. And then we
battled, battled and fought. Tied it in the third quarter, and made a lot of
plays.  
  
Today we left some shots short, but we outrebounded them. They battled and
they fought. And I could take some mistakes when you're battling and fighting.
And I was really proud of their effort today.  
  
I thought Kennedy played great and stepped up and made plays. And Brandi had
another good game. I thought Ali in the second half was really good. She had a
tough first half. But then, you know, typical Ali she's got that toughness
comes back and makes plays in the second half for us.  
  
So proud of our team. Didn't get the result we wanted. But they fought and
tried and did a lot of good things today. We just didn't come out on the
winning end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Brandi, sum up your team's performance today.  
  
BRANDI BEASLEY: Like Coach said, I think we fought hard. We gave it all we
got. It's fun to see the drastic change from the beginning to the end of the
season, just with our heart and effort and what we gave and coming together as
a team. I felt like we gave all we had. I think we played to the best of our
ability and just left it all out there on the floor.  
  
KENNEDY CATTENHEAD: I agree with Brandi, and I agree with Coach as well. I
think I was really proud of my team. We all fought and we all showed our heart
throughout this tournament, and especially like, you know, Ashley's last games
and Alex not being able to play with us. And CC as well.  
  
Q. Matt, talk about Keys.  
COACH BOLLANT: I didn't realize -- if there's such thing as a quiet 26, I know
she was making shots in the second half. But when I saw the box scores, that's
more than I realized. She did it just kind of quietly. She hit a couple of
really tough pull-up's. And I know one time over Kennedy and I think one time
over Ali.  
  
And she just made all the shots. 10 for 14 from the field and did a lot for
them. And I think her pull-up's, when we needed to get a stop, seemed like she
was knocking down the shot and made the shots to make the difference.  
  
Q. Could you sum up the season and looking ahead to next?  
COACH BOLLANT: I'm really proud of the growth of this team. Obviously we
weren't the team we wanted to be in the non-conference and got better
throughout. Obviously Ashley graduate, walk-on graduate, and Ashley incredible
heart.  
  
But yesterday to have 71 points out of 79 from freshmen and Kennedy step up
today and play the way she did, makes it really exciting.  
  
And I told them in the locker room, I believe we can compete for Big Ten
championships in the years to come. We're not there right now, but it's the
first time I've said that at Illinois to the team and really believe in my
heart that we can be a team that competes for a Big Ten Championship in the
years to come.  
  
With what we're adding, we've got an incredible class coming in, and the
returners we have, it's a really exciting future. We're going to be playing
deep in this tournament next year and playing in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Northwestern - 78, Iowa - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Iowa here. Coach Bluder, Ally Disterhoft and Megan
Gustafson. Lisa, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BLUDER: All right. I want to congratulate Northwestern. They came out
and played a terrific game today. They're much more aggressive than they were
at our place, especially defensively. A lot of Nia Coffey out there. We just
didn't really have an answer to be able to stop her. She was tremendous in
both zone and player. I want to congratulate her.  
  
Also want to make note that Ally was named the Academic All-American of the
year this year, back to back with those honors. It's an amazing accomplishment
to be named captain of the All-American team academically. We're really proud
of her successes in the classroom.  
  
Megan had a career high tonight, nice to see. But again it was a box-out
problem and just too much Nia Coffey.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the students.  
  
Q. Nia Coffey is a very good player but in that second quarter and third
quarter what was Northwestern doing or what enabled her to really get in the
rhythm and they consistently were able to go to her and find success?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I think in the second and third quarter they were able to get
a box overload on us. And sometimes I got stuck in the high post and then
coming down I wasn't able to close out baseline. Our traps needed to be a
little bit better. I think in the second half we did a better job of taking
away the trap.  
  
Q. Megan, how did the game change a little bit when she was in foul
trouble in the second half. Seemed like you were obviously trying to get the
last foul on her and attacking inside. And did that also open up some things
where maybe she wasn't as aggressive inside defensively?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I don't think she ever stepped down from her aggressiveness.
She kept going, but I think it really gave us confidence going in there when
she was getting fouls and so we were able to take the ball and to get it
inside more often.  
  
Q. Ally, late in the first half Coffey went to the bench I think with
her second or third foul, whatever it was, and they took a two-point lead,
stretched it out to nine, 10, 11 different times. What happened defensively
there where their star player went out and they extended the lea?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: They have a star player, but they also have a group of other
young women who are very capable of scoring. That's just basketball for you.
Basketball is a game of runs. And they went on a run in that stretch. Like
Coach Bluder said, they were upping their defensive and offensive intensity at
that point. And we just didn't respond as well as we could have in the end of
the second quarter.  
  
Q. Ally, obviously the loss stings, but the Academic All-American, what
does that mean to you?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Really appreciative and grateful for that, not just myself,
but I know my entire team. And every student-athlete puts a lot of work in
their studies and it's something that we take a lot of pride in. So to be
recognized for those accomplishments is always nice.  
  
Q. Lisa, the same question with Coffey, what in that second and third
quarter specifically, why was she able to have so much success?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought she got in a real rhythm in our zone. I thought we had
trouble finding her in the zone, in the first half. They did a great job of
isolating her and finding her. But we went player almost exclusively from then
on.  
  
And we just couldn't -- we didn't really have an answer for her. And it was
her night. I mean, she's been playing really well. She didn't play very well
against us the first time as far as consistently scoring. But she's a
tremendous player. And give credit to her. I thought she just did a great job.  
  
Q. You guys were down, I think, 12 points late in the third quarter.
What turned it around? You took the lead at I forget what moment it was.  
COACH BLUDER: We hit a couple of 3s, that's always nice, kind of gets us going
a little bit. I think that we scored a lot better in the third quarter.  
  
I think it was our best scoring quarter of the night. There's a stretch where
we didn't turn the ball over. We turned the ball over down at the end of the
game too many times and just didn't give ourselves opportunities.  
  
They shot the ball seven more times than we did and outrebounded us. That's a
little of what's frustrating, I guess, is the rebounds because you have
control over your box outs, and that's the one that's a little bit
frustrating.  
  
Q. You touched on Ally's Academic All-American honor. I assume it's got
to be easy as a coach to have a player you don't have to worry about in the
classroom. With her talent, too, as well. It's probably, I assume, quite a
luxury to have someone like her?  
COACH BLUDER: It is. It's just a real blessing we've been able to coach Ally.
She's a local product and that's fun for those kind of players to come to Iowa
and have success. And anytime somebody has success in one area you're thrilled
for them, but to have success in all areas, it takes a lot of work. It's a lot
of work as a student-athlete to be able to do both well and she's been a great
role model to everybody that it can be done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Hannah Whitish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32623)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Illinois - 79, Nebraska - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Cornhuskers, coach Amy Williams and
student-athletes Hannah Whitish and Jessica Shepard.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Disappointing loss for our team here today. We certainly felt
like with the two wins out of our last three here heading into the tournament
that we had a little bit of momentum and we were going to be playing our best
basketball. We didn't show that here today. So it's a disappointing loss for
our team.  
  
It's a disappointing way for our seniors to end their careers. But something
that we hope to be able to grow from moving forward as a program.  
  
Q. Jessica, what did Illinois do to try to keep you from having as many
looks in the fourth quarter, what did you see defensively?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think they were just doubling down the whole game. But just
later in the game, obviously we needed some 3-point shots. So I think that's
why you didn't see the ball get inside necessarily as much.  
  
Q. (Question off mic)?  
HANNAH WHITISH: Like Jess said, they were doubling down in the post. You get
it in to Jess and she's going to hit the wide-open.  
  
She does better out on the arc. And I think since we were knocking them down,
we kept shooting with confidence throughout the game and that helped us.  
  
Q. (Question off mic).  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think -- you know our goal was to be playing our best
basketball down the stretch here. Today was definitely not our best game. But
I think you have seen the progress of the fight that we have and just the will
to win. And I think we've grown a lot as a team over the past since we played
them the last time.  
  
Q. Amy, offensively what went wrong with you guys out there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I mean, I think we kind of just got a little bit tight there
and tense. We were pushing just a little bit and kind of waiting for the big
play and it just really never came. I think we just weren't in sync there in
that last five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. (Question off mic)?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that Illinois, it appeared they felt like, without
Alex Wittinger, that they really needed to come in and double team inside. And
Jessica has demanded that attention all season long. They were bringing double
teams from the perimeter, with the guards kind of doubling. We've seen a lot
of post-to-post doubles. We've seen a lot of different kinds defenses to pack
things in and make life difficult inside for Jessica. And she draws a lot of
attention.  
  
Today, she was drawing a lot of attention from perimeter double teams which
left our shooters open and that's why we were able to knock down some open
shots.  
  
Q. You mentioned obviously you guys had a couple of wins here near the
end of the year. And you played well today. Wanted to win, needless to say.
But what have you seen the last few weeks having you optimistic going into
next year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we've had some players that have started to just play
with a lot more confidence and they're expecting things out of themselves that
maybe we weren't early as we were kind of growing and trying to find
ourselves.  
  
And so adding some balance scoring, when we've looked at the games that we've
had success in down the stretch, we've had other people really stepping up and
helping to contribute with the scoring and that's encouraging for us as we
move forward.

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Avyanna Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32632)

### [Marsha Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32633)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 61, Rutgers - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Tsipis and student-athletes Avyanna Young
and Marsha Howard.  
  
COACH TSIPIS: We've talked a lot as a team since the game ended at Iowa on
Sunday night about doing something that nobody in the program currently had
done, and that's as you get prepared for the tournament, be able to win a
first-round game. And again it may sound like a short goal, a low goal, but I
think having to do something together like that culminates what we've been
trying to work at all season long.  
  
And playing a team a third time, knowing they know you well, you know them
well, to be able to be at our best. And were we at our best the whole time?
No, but I was really proud of our team to continue to fight and compete.  
  
And Marsha and Avy, as I said in the locker room, started that part of an
aggressiveness in the first quarter -- catching the ball in the low post,
making a hard cut, having a post-to-post assist right out of the gate, I think
that sets the tone for how aggressive we were in the first half.  
  
And I thought again I know Rutgers has struggled to score. But to hold
somebody to 13 points, you're working hard. And I thought we changed defenses
as well. We knew we didn't rebound well in the first half.  
  
And I think we knew, when you're in a situation, it's a win-or-go-home, that
records are out the window and people will continue to play. And I thought in
the second half they made an early run and we came right back at them. And we
got the lead in the 20s. And again I thought we were attacking against their
press to the point where we were getting baskets at the other end. And I think
that part of it, they kept coming at us, and again to end the game, turned a
little bit into time and score. But when we needed to have stops, we got
stops.  
  
And again we were able to do, I thought, a good job. Marsha got two fouls in
the first half. When she got her third I wanted to try to get us through the
third quarter so we would have her fresh for the fourth.  
  
I was proud of the way our team came together. This isn't just the preparation
for the game versus Rutgers today. This is another step in the journey all
year. And I think what hopefully that you see across the country is seniors
sometimes don't let you lose.  
  
And I thought when they got it into single digits late in the fourth quarter,
a huge play. Avy gets the and-one after knowing that she had made a mistake on
the box out and given up a layup. She didn't put her head down. She came down
to the other end, she posted up hard. She got a good post feed from one of her
teammates and went up strong. But those two, their ability to finish inside
against bigger players and get to the free-throw line tonight I think was the
key to our aggressiveness that spread out through the whole team.  
  
Q. Coached talked about the first time you guys have won in the Big Ten
Tournament since 2010. What does that mean to you guys to be that team that's
different?  
AVYANNA YOUNG: It just means progression. Like we're getting better, game
after game, practice after practice. Coach pushes us and supports us win or
loss. So it's definitely showing that we're growing at a team.  
  
MARSHA HOWARD: Definitely excitement. Seeing how this is my first Big Ten
Tournament. So that part and then just being able to continue to fight and
grow as a team.  
  
Q. The two of you had some great high/low combinations. Is this
something you guys are working on obviously in practice or is it just kind of
developed over the year?  
MARSHA HOWARD: We work on it a lot with our position coach, Coach Sasha, but
it's also progressed over the years, us being able to work the inside,
high/low, nice seals, nice dump balls, and also being able to go inside/out to
our guards.  
  
AVYANNA YOUNG: And trusting each other on knowing that we're going to see you,
and when we pass it you're going to finish, we're going to dive. It's the
whole process and I feel we're trusting the process and we're believing and
it's showing out on the court.  
  
Q. Avy, you struggled with free throws during your career, but these
last three games you've been like ice. What's been the key to that change?  
AVYANNA YOUNG: Confidence. Just knowing that I can do it, and my team, like I
said before, Marsha's always, like, on your toes, Any, on your toes. Just the
confidence that they believe in me. I believe in myself.  
  
Q. When Rutgers started making the comeback in the fourth quarter, you
guys didn't panic, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about the mentality that
this team has?  
MARSHA HOWARD: Once they started making their run we just knew we had to come
together collectively and not go outside of the script that we were prepared
for. To just calm down, take it slow, one pass at a time, and make the easy
pass and not force anything major.  
  
AVYANNA YOUNG: Like we didn't crumble. We didn't get rattled up when they were
starting to pick up their intensity, which I feel like in the beginning of the
season we would have done. And we are finishing out games now. So like I said,
progression and progress.  
  
Q. How do you think the team handled that late rally that Rutgers had?  
COACH TSIPIS: I think anytime there was a stoppage and we had the whole group,
I think continuing to talk to them about being aggressive and what we were
able to do when we shot 13-for-22 in the second half it was a part of, there
were a lot of those times off extra passes against the press. And I think that
part of things you have to take through that first wave. And I'm a big
believer, basketball is a game of runs, that somebody's going to make one and
then you've got to be ready to make yours.  
  
And I think trying to stay positive with that point, I think we talked to the
point guards a little bit of specifically how they could move the ball, people
having to come back.  
  
I think a big part, I thought Marsha and Avy and Kendall Shaw did a really
good job in pressure relief situations, whether it was flashing to the middle
or as the inbounder helping our guards.  
  
I think when they looked up the floor, they looked up the floor with
confidence. And I think that part of things, again, when you're at this point
in the season, you have to be a confidence-giver greater than any other time
because we've seen this.  
  
We've seen pressure. We've seen zone. We've seen matchups. We've seen man, and
we've had success and pieces against it just kind of to continue to remind
them. But I tell you what, the huddles were good, active discussion before I
ever got in there. I think that's growth of the team of moving on.  
  
Avy's play is a perfect example of not putting her head down. She knew she had
made the mistake and she came down and it was completely behind her. And the
same thing. I didn't feel like Marsha allowed the three fouls that she had
collected through three quarters affect her energy and her effort in the
fourth quarter defensively, meeting the ball, trying to work again of being
physical.  
  
And again that's the growth of our team. I think these two can tell you that
part all, of a sudden if you get in foul troubles, there's been a wave, you
can get a little bit of stage fright. I didn't see that in our team. And I
think that helped get some of our kids who had never been in a Big Ten game,
like Marsha, through in the third and fourth quarter playing with more
confidence.  
  
Q. You talked in the locker room about how this was a team win. Can you
just talk about how these were the two double-digit scorers? You have a lot of
other people contributing even if they didn't score.  
A. I thought Kayla was really aggressive attacking. She got to the free-
throw line early. She had six rebounds. I thought that part. I thought Chelly
Marble's minutes in the third quarter were huge. She had a huge 3 on an extra
pass against the pressure. She got all the way to the rim on one action. That
part, Ashley Kelsick was able to put some things behind her from, foul
trouble-wise and help us find people.  
  
I think that part she finishes with two assists and no turnovers playing
more in the second half. I thought one of the biggest plays of the game we had
fouled on the other end, Kendall Shaw had fouled Shrita Parker at about 12
feet and reached down and she knew that part. She came back down, we trusted,
we got the ball inside and she got an and-one. Small plays I think you can see
the confidence in the team building.  
  
I talked to Kendra Van Leeuwen, it's like her first time, like Marsha. That
wave, no matter how many times you play Rutgers you're playing them in a
different environment, that part of people continuing to come after you. And
again I thought that part was huge that these guys were able to help her, that
she didn't have to break the pressure her alone. You can see that confidence
in her. She made two big shots -- she made a big shot and went 4-for-4 from
the line. I think a lot of that was through the confidence from these two in
the second half.  
  
Q. Michigan State playing No. 6 seed. Not a great game against them when
we played them earlier this season. Can you talk about what you need to do
make it a better game?  
COACH TSIPIS: First of all, like these guys, I have a short memory. And so the
only thing I remember from that game was we didn't play our best and that was
at home.  
  
And I think that's the pride that our team has, we want that opportunity. You
are going to play somebody you've already played again in the tournament. But
I think that part of where we've grown as a team. And again we'll get prepared
on that front. I think this is a group that just has been sponges on what's
the game plan, how can we take things away, and now we have an opportunity.  
  
And I think that's what life's all about. You don't sometimes get a second
opportunity. And knowing the last time Avy is going to play against Michigan
State no matter what happens tomorrow I think is really important. Because I
think that sense of urgency we have felt from Avy in these last couple of
weeks. And I think it's that part of knowing. Marsha knows, and we talked
about again that part of we want to make sure we go out playing our best
basketball and showing that growth and knowing we have a great game under our
belt. And that's the big part. We know Michigan State is playing for a lot on
the line.  
  
We're excited to have another opportunity to play tomorrow to continue our
season, no matter who it's against, and believe me we'll get that taken care
of with the plan and how we're going to attack it.  
  
It's exciting to be able to still go right now no matter who we're playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

### [Shrita Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32630)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 61, Rutgers - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Opening comments from Coach Stringer and then we'll go to
Shrita for comments.  
  
COACH STRINGER: It's unfortunate. In a way I'm kind of glad. It's been painful
this year. So we will get started next year and see if we can't do it. We'll
have a whole lot better than we do this year. That's it.  
  
Q. Obviously not the outcome you guys wanted today. But coming to the
Big Ten Tournament and having this experience, what does this mean to your
team, and is there anything positive that you can take away from it?  
SHRITA PARKER: No, there's not really nothing positive that we can take from
it because we wasn't planning on coming here and losing and going home the
first night. But I can say that next year starts now and we're going to work
on the things that we had a lot of problems on this year. And we have a lot of
great players that will be added onto the team next year. So you'll have to
see.  
  
Q. With a couple of sophomores on your starting lineup, does the
experience, is that valuable at all, just to have them in this atmosphere and
at this type of event?  
SHRITA PARKER: Yes, experience is always good for players that's young because
they can always learn from those mistakes. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Vivian, talk about the first half. You really struggled
offensively.  
COACH STRINGER: I don't know how you explain it. I mean, we're missing
everything. Just we seem to be slow. Late. The cuts that were coming in front.
You would think that we're playing at 12:00 at night. And the movement had
everything to do with it.  
  
And, quite frankly, we tried to start a press which we normally don't, we
tried to do that because we wanted to up the energy up and step the intensity
up, where at the beginning we were afraid to go into man because we have had a
lot of fouls. Just not moving our feet well and we've had a lot of fouls
called on us.  
  
So that was the issue. So we thought, okay, let's step up the press, rather
than, because normally it would be something we would gradually get to. But
it's like now or never, we either get it done or go home as simple as that.  
  
Probably what was most disappointing is we abandoned the importance of moving
the ball and seeing each other, getting those screens and looking for the
attack and instead -- let me give you an example. We're not a 3-point shooting
team. We shot three for 17. Is that for real? That's crazy.  
  
So I'm just upset about that, because we abandoned what we should have been
doing and didn't see the inside.  
  
I thought one of our people, Vickie, Vickie was scoring well. She's been
scoring well the last couple of weeks, but did we see her? No. We're taking
shots.  
  
So that hurt us when offensively we're not executing. We all of a sudden
decided to start taking 3s real quick. Didn't have it. And if the defense is
not there and the defense wasn't there because what we were trying to do is to
press them and then try to fool them, if you will, we fooled ourselves because
we weren't moving the way that we should.  
  
It's like should you just go and play one defense, whether it's a 2-3 or a 3-2
or man to man, just one, keep it simple.  
  
I thought -- I and I still do think that we're capable of playing any one of
those things that we needed to do. But I'm still at a loss just missing shots
and taking the shots that didn't allow for us to see.  
  
But I think Shrita is right: We should be a whole heck of a lot better with
some experienced players, people that have been in this situation. And see, I
could use that as an excuse that it's a tournament; but, honestly, I can't do
that because we've been doing this all year.  
  
We just have not demonstrated that we have the ability to settle down or that
we've had control. And hopefully next year we'll be a much more controlled
team and able to run as we should but also get the ball back.  
  
It will be better. I can promise you that. It's got to be better.  
  
Q. Pressure did speed them up in the second half, forced 22 turnovers,
20 points off those turnovers, and got you back in the game.  
COACH STRINGER: Of course. But defense has always gotten us back in the game,
you know what I mean? But we seem to be moving too slow at first. But now,
with a sense of urgency, oh my God, there's 20 minutes left; it's now or
never, we really better step it up.  
  
And we began to move much more aggressively. We just tended to play a little
too soft and I know that that's what got us in the game. If you can imagine if
we can apply that kind of pressure at the beginning, but keep in mind we're
working with eight players. One of the people that's sitting there can't play
right now. She's redshirted. And three of those players are centers.  
  
And so at no time would we be playing two centers. And seldom never three. And
most of the time only two centers. So that meant that it puts people like
Shrita, puts KK, puts Jaz and of course Aliyah picked up her five fouls. She
wasn't in there anytime talking about it. So we basically had four people on
the perimeter to play and five people, and we need four on the floor at any
one time.  
  
Now, if you compound that with a foul situation, which is what happened, then
you start to mix and match and trying to figure out how we can run this, we
can't run this because this person doesn't do that, she's playing out of
position. So we've been -- it's been a mess. We've really patched things
together and hopefully next year we'll have all of the positions and the depth
at each position that we can take one out, put another one in, not miss the
depth and keep the intensity up and not be strained with what we can do, but I
just felt strained. We were strained quite a bit today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

### [Ali Andrews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32624)

### [Brandi Beasley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32625)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Illinois - 79, Nebraska - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Bollant and the Illinois student-
athletes. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BOLLANT: Just really proud of the way we guarded in the fourth quarter.
Give Nebraska credit. I thought they were really good offensively in the third
quarter, scored 29 points. And then I thought we were better in the fourth
quarter. Obviously missed a couple of open shots as well but we just defended
better.  
  
And give our freshmen a lot of credit. They came in and did that, played with
-- Brandi had 20; Petra, 21; and Ali 24. For the first time playing in the Big
Ten Tournament, to have 65 points from your freshmen says a lot about them not
playing with fear and just how they came after.  
  
And again the other thing they get rewarded for being in the gym. This
freshman class has been in the gym more than any other class I've coached. And
they got rewarded today. Brandi's worked on her 3-point shot, and to go
3-for-3 -- and Ali, such a great stroke and did a lot of good things. And she
did a good job defending as well. Really happy for our team and happy for
Ashley McConnell, our senior. We said let's give her another day. Let's allow
her to play again and we did that.  
  
Q. Ali, defensively in the last five minutes you guys held Nebraska
without a point. What stood out defensively for you guys late in the fourth
quarter?  
ALI ANDREWS: We had to come together as a team just collapse on Shepard. She's
a really good player. And basically their offense rolls around No. 3. So we
tried to take away the 3 in their inside game.  
  
Q. Brandi, what was it like being a freshman playing in your first
tournament game?  
BRANDI BEASLEY: It was very exciting. I was looking forward to it. I think we
came out and played great. We came out with a lot of heart and energy.  
  
Q. 40 minutes, are you tired?  
BRANDI BEASLEY: Not really.  
  
Q. Same question, defensively, what was the plan to try to keep it from
Shepard? And at times Nebraska was really hitting 3-pointers in spurts, and
other times you were really able to hold them in check for the most part?  
COACH BOLLANT: I thought we tried to get double teams early. Just could not
let her get going. Obviously her size, with Alex being out, it was tough to
guard her inside. But Ali did a good job finding her and then we got some good
aggressive teams and made her wonder whether we're doubling or not.  
  
Then I thought we did a better job -- in the first half and a little bit in
the third quarter we didn't really get to their shooters very well. In the
fourth quarter we were kind of anticipated better and took away some rhythm
shots which was great because I felt like they got some pretty good rhythm 3s
in the first three quarters. And made adjustment in the fourth, and just said
make sure you're moving, slide to the ball and anticipate, and let's make them
have to dribble to a shot, especially their guards are making shots.  
  
Q. It's been a while since you played Nebraska, but what ways have they
changed from the first matchup?  
COACH BOLLANT: I think they're better offensively. Whitish has really come
around and had a great year. And today they made 13 3s so they shot the ball
better and were a lot more confident. I thought 5, 5's a really good player,
great defender. And today she stepped up, made four 3s as well. Their freshmen
have matured some and they looked much better offensively today because they
had -- Whitish made shots but typically they didn't have three or four kids
making shots like they did today. They were a lot better offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got Purdue tomorrow. Thoughts?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah. We played them pretty tough at our place. Morrissette and
Keys got going and made a lot of 3s against us.  
  
Obviously gotta do a good job at that, and physically, they go to the
offensive boards so well. They're long and athletic and so we've got our work
cut out. But we're excited for the challenge.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2017

  

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Candice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32758)

### [Bego Faz Davalos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30478)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 66 Fresno State - 53  
  
COACH JAIME WHITE: You know, I thought we made a run to begin with. It was
8-2. I thought we started the game the way we wanted to. I thought Boise
played a great game. They were able to score. And there was a time when there
was a drought there in I think it was the third quarter, early fourth quarter
that we just needed to score. And I said to my assistants, if we would have
scored we'd have been up ten. But we struggled to score late. I think we ran
out of gas there in the fourth quarter; four games in five days is really
tough.  
  
Really proud of our kids. Made a run and really believed that we could win
that game and I guess as a coach that's all you can ask.  
  
Q. Coach said as far as the scoring, but it looked like you had so many
good looks and the shots were high-percentage shots. At one point you looked
at the rim like, are you kidding me? Like there was a lid on it and it wasn't
falling. You were taking shots that were falling all week. What were you
thinking, just the frustration of the balls not falling in the hoop?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, of course it was frustrating. I didn't know what was
happening. But I think my teammates and my coaches told me how to react. And I
tried next time, hoping it would start working, but we ran out of time, I
think.  
  
Q. You came out firing, hitting your shots. Just where did it go awry in
your eyes? Boise got the momentum and they were hitting timely shots. It's not
as if they shot well, either. Where in your mind did you think it sort of got
away from you?  
CANDICE WHITE: I think they just tightened up their defense, doing a good job
finding the shooters, finding the girls who would drive on our team. And I
think our easy looks, it gave them momentum. When they weren't making easy
looks, they just had more energy to just keep going at us.  
  
Q. This may seem rhetorical, but two years in a row now, what do you
tell the girls after this one? What do you say afterwards in the locker room?
You still have hope, assuming, for an invite. But how did you react after?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, you know, we struggled down the stretch, but I was
proud of our kids bouncing back from two really tough games coming in. And I
think we played one game at a time. And every game we had to grit it out. And
I'm proud of them. I'm proud of them. I was proud to be in this game. And I'm
pretty sure when we walked out of that locker room to start the game we all
thought we were going to win it.  
  
Again, we're going to be back again. We're going to keep coming back. This is
what it's about. One game doesn't really define us, although I hope it helps
us be more motivated as we learn to deal with this kind of thing and move
forward next year.  
  
Q. Does the three wins you had this week, does it temper at all the
disappointment of today's loss?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: No. Definitely we did a good job coming back, we were the 7
seed and I thought we did a good job in the three games. We had good moments
in the championship, I don't think we did terrible. I'm proud of my girls.  
  
CANDICE WHITE: Same thing. I'm just proud of everyone for working hard and
gritting out four games in five days?  
  
Q. A lot of teams like to get physical with you, it seems to be the game
plan. What is going through your mind, how do you react to that when you're
getting tossed to the ground and pushed around a lot, especially early in this
game?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: It's kind of weird, but I kind of feel proud about it.
People try to defend me really hard, and that's something to be proud of.
Definitely I knew they were going to be physical. And I think you adjust to
that. Like I said, I think we just ran out of time.  
  
Q. Were there times in the game when I'm watching you and you have a
scowl or frown on your face. Is that a look you have during the game or are
you really unhappy at those moments?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: No, that's my game face (laughter).  
  
Q. Does what happened this week, does it change how you feel about the
season overall?  
CANDICE WHITE: No, it just kind of defines our season. It was an up-and-down
roller coaster ride. And unfortunately today we weren't able to finish it. But
I think that just motivates us for this next season to come.  
  
Q. Last year was tough, especially at the end, and as a 2 seed. But does
this one sting more because of the run you made, the bond, the camaraderie as
a 7 seed? And coming from Monday, does this one sting or are they just two
different deals?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: I felt the same way.  
  
CANDICE WHITE: Yeah, they both sting. Losing a championship game two times in
a row is hard. But like I said, all you can do is get a positive out of this
and motivate ourselves to come back next year and get it.  
  
Q. Almost positive your answer would be that you would trade all the
records that you broke, established or set for a championship. But can you
talk just a little bit about establishing the records that you have for
double-doubles, career blocks, and sort of etching your mark into Mountain
West history.  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, it's something to be proud of. Definitely my teammates
helped me get those, all of these assists, all of those rebounds. I feel like
it's a team effort. So I'm proud and I'm happy for my teammates, too.  
  
Q. I hate to put aside what happened this week and ask you a leading
question, but is what happened this week, is this a springboard for next
season? You have a lot of your key players coming back. Maybe last year it
seemed a little bit more of a finality, you had a lot of seniors that
graduated. Is that correct? Do you feel that way? The three games you won as
the 7 seed, is that what you're going to be harping on in the off season to
encourage your ladies?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Absolutely. We came in -- we started the year with only two
kids that have really played, Breanne Knishka and Bego. Then Bre got injured,
we had two starters back, then we only had one. The kids that played, Emilie
Volk, Kendra Martin, even Anais Kirvan, all of them, none had had experience.
Emilie Volk went from playing five minutes a game to 30 minutes a game.  
  
I am so proud that they held it together as well as they did for the three
games, and even into the championship. There was no doubt in my mind we were
ready to win. There's a lot of things on top of that now.  
  
Then you have young kids like Cavey and Candice White, who would have thought?
She went from two minutes a game to 30 minutes a game.  
  
It's really this period where we have to rebuild. And for us to have this kind
of a finish in a rebuilding year, I'm really proud of them. I'm really proud
of them. We know sports. It's always a work in progress. We're definitely
going to use this. This will sit with them when we're back in the championship
game again.  
  
You think about Shaw and Rodriguez were freshmen. And probably Pahukoa then --
no, Pahukoa was a sophomore. They were, when they won the championship two
years ago. That kind of experience helps you win the next time. So it's not
all bad.  
  
It's terrible today and it hurts right now, but at the end of the day we just
want to get them better. And I think our year could have been better. But we
needed to be more consistent. But with youth that happens. And so we'll
regroup and get on it next year.  
  
Q. With Bego, the strategy of every team, and I remember last year's
final, it was basically just mugging of her out there. Early in this game
today she got knocked down a couple of times. How does she respond to that
physical play, what do you tell her? I mentioned her facial expression a
little bit. Is that something you talk to her about, body language? How does
she deal with all that stuff?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: It's one thing, it's funny, now that I've not played for a
while, I forget that along with emotion and the physicality and being in shape
and then there's just all the anxiety of a big game. But, yeah, we talk to
Bego all the time. I think it's got to be the first thing everybody says. And
everybody puts on their scout when they play us. And for the most part she's
done a really good job playing against that.  
  
I thought we had done a pretty good job getting her some breaks, so she can
calm down and regroup and go back in. I did think with -- sometimes we play
two big posts together and sometimes that would alleviate some of the pressure
that she has underneath.  
  
She's a tough kid. She's one of our hardest workers. She's resilient. You
can't get that many double-doubles and you can't be day in and day out our
leading scorer and leading rebounder and not be tough. So I'm really, really
proud of her.  
  
Q. As clutch as Bego has been all week, can you talk a little bit about
the timely shots and how clutch Brooke was in that she just stymied every
effort on their turn down the floor and her play today?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah. Brooke is a nice player. She definitely -- and I
think what she's done is she used to just be a three-point shooter, that's
what we'd say when we scout her. And now she's slid into a little bit more of
a driving guard. And then she was able to pull up the multiple times we were
on her with her hands straight up and she shot right over us, along with Shaw.
And I said it from the very beginning, I felt like Boise was one of the
deepest teams coming into the tournament.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 66 Fresno State - 53  
  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Just want to commend Fresno State for a great run in the
tournament. Four games in five days is really remarkable. And we felt like if
we could get them into the second half and make a little run, at some point
fatigue would set in. They're very competitive. Very well coached and there's
a reason they've been here so often.  
  
I also want to thank our administration, Curt Apsey, Dr. Kustra, Christina Van
Tol, for all their support. I'm really proud of our players. I'm proud of
these three, but I'm proud of the other 12, as well. It was a great game. And
they made runs at us, and we got in some foul trouble. But in the end I think
our leadership kind of prevailed and really fortunate to win. It's been a
great season and hopefully we get one more chance.  
  
Q. Brooke, a couple of days ago you talked about how important the
chemistry of this team was and how you just wanted one more game. You go back
about a month you guys were on a 3-6 stretch and you had been struggling.
You've won ten in a row and Mountain West Champions. What made you believe
that you could do this?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: You know, even when we had that stretch where we were losing,
I don't think that we ever thought we weren't going to come here and win. We
always had that was our goal at the end.  
  
Anyone who's played sports enough knows that every season is a little bit of a
roller coaster, and you peak at the end. That's what you want to do. And we
knew we had that in our future. And I think the injuries that we had and the
sicknesses that we had in that roller coaster season led us to be able to come
here and win those close games for sure.  
  
Q. You became the second player in program history, 800 points, 600
rebounds, 200 assists. Talk about that accomplishment and just your role in
the team during your career at Boise State.  
SHALEN SHAW: I found that out walking over here, what an accomplishment. I
don't even have words for it. As for my team, it's just playing for them and
doing everything I can to help us win and get here and win the championship.
And I'm speechless right now.  
  
Q. I remember a couple of years ago you were laying on the floor crying
as a sophomore. Compare that moment, that feeling to doing it as a senior?  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: Well, I'm going to go home. I'm going to stay in Boise, but
not to be able to play next year with my teammates, at least I'm giving them a
ring and I'm going to have that memory forever. So it feels amazing.  
  
Q. I just want to ask you the same thing. To do it as a senior, to go
out this way, what does it mean?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: It means the world and I think that our team worked so hard
this year to be able to come here. And I knew, gosh, the second we came here
this year, we're going to win. The look on everyone's faces, the attitudes we
had, I said there's no one stopping us. And I think it showed the way that we
played. We played a different level of basketball here this week, and I think
that's going to continue for us.  
  
I couldn't say it any differently than I did yesterday, I love my teammates, I
love my coaches, I love Boise State. I want to be here as long as we can, we
want one more game. We want as much as we can together.  
  
Q. To do it twice in three years here, kind of cements a legacy within
the program. What does it mean for you to win two in three years and get to
the tournament again and really try to get Boise State women's basketball to
that next level?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Boise State, the atmosphere when you step on to that campus is
we succeed. As athletes, as student-athletes, in the classroom, off the court,
you succeed. We're champions everywhere you go. And that wasn't something that
started when we came here. That started a long time ago and we got rolling
right into it. It's a fun place to be, it's a fun place to be a part of. And
definitely that culture has been here before we set foot on campus.  
  
Q. I've got to ask you, two years ago you sat up there on that dais
upset because you couldn't get to your cellphone, we talked about this the
other night. Tonight you see your parents in the stands. That had to be a
special feeling for you.  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, the first thing I did after I was finished with the
radio, I went to my dad and I -- it means everything to me. I knew they were
going to be here this year. They've been around everywhere with me with the
national team. My dad, he's really emotional, when he's emotional I get
emotional, too. So it just means everything.  
  
Q. The other night when you overheard me talking to her about the story
I wanted to do, you came around for the interview, you were there. How special
is it for you for how close, as you talked about the team, the camaraderie,
but to be able to see your best friend, your point guard, have that moment?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: It's a really special bond that this entire team has. And we
want each other to succeed and be happy and thrive off the court and on the
court. And we try to do whatever we can to make it happen for our teammates.
And to see the joy that Yai had yesterday, being able to talk about her
parents and being here, we want to be a part of it.  
  
I'm like, I'm going to see her face, because I want to see my teammates happy.
It brings me joy. I love being a part of it. They deserve it. We have really,
really good girls on our team that deserve the best. I want to be there every
step of the way for each of them.  
  
Q. It wasn't necessarily the best shooting night, yet timely shots and
runs that you took advantage of. Can you talk about how the chemistry sort of
kept everything together, and defensively to shut down Bego and that team?  
SHALEN SHAW: Yeah, we were just trying to run the clock down at the end. We
were trying to control the game. And Coach P was, Slow down, do our thing,
move the ball and communicate on defense. And fronting Bego, and making sure
they're making a tough pass, so they're not getting easy shots. We just worked
together and made sure they didn't get anything easy.  
  
Q. A lot of teams talk about the importance of senior leadership. And I
think pretty much every team kind of says that. But it seems like with this
group, the two girls to your right, really made quite an impact on you and
your teammates. I wanted to know what those two girls next to you mean to you
on this team.  
SHALEN SHAW: You're going to make me cry. They mean everything. I'm going to
miss them. I'm going to miss them on the team next year, but they're not going
anywhere, they'll still be in Boise, so I'll be able to see them. But everyone
loves them. And I'm happy that we're sending them on with a good note. We have
to keep going. We have more games to play.  
  
Q. You get the experience against Tennessee a couple of years ago, and
played well for a good portion of that game. What are your thoughts, and
probably being the underdog again?  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: I think going to NCAA, you get a great experience, not
everybody can get to go to the big dance. No matter what team is in front of
us, if we played with each other like we played in the tournament, and keep
one more game playing, we're going to enjoy it, and no matter what it's going
to be the outcome of it.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I think everyone in that locker room right now is excited to
represent Boise State at a bigger level. We're going to do our best. We're
going to prepare. He's like, we're going to get the rest of the week off. Two
days. Then we'll start practicing again. And we're going to be ready to
represent.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Shalen's game and just her overall -- to reach
that plateau and what she's meant to the program?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Well, when we went through our bad January where we were
3-6, she was missing in four of those games and we lost three of them. And we
haven't lost since she came back. And so the reason she's not starting is she
has a bad habit of picking up an early foul, so we wanted to shorten the game
for her a little bit. And it gets Joyce involved more. And I thought Joyce
came up big for us. Marijke got in foul trouble, and Joyce did a nice job on
their big hits.  
  
Sha is an unusual player in that she can play all five positions, and she
point guard some of the time, but she can guard a post player as well. So to
have a player to have 800 points and 600 rebounds and 200 assists is pretty
remarkable in women's basketball. I'm excited about what she can do for us
next year when she has to step in and be a leader.  
  
Q. How does it feel right now compared to a couple of years ago? The
second one, does it feel any different to be able to do it twice in three
years?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: There's so much pressure. We were joking, it seemed like
the New Mexico game was a year ago, and it was just last Tuesday. Yeah,
there's always pressure. But you just have to grind.  
  
And the thing that I was really proud of our players this year is -- and this
week, I'm sorry, is that we did grind, and we haven't done that a whole lot.
I've told them over and over if we can get to a higher level than everyone in
the league, but can't seem to get consistent like a Colorado State who seems
to consistently play well.  
  
That being said, I think we went 12-1 to start and 10-0 to finish, so we had a
bad stretch there in the middle. There's pressure and we're just going to
enjoy this next part of this season and see where it takes us.  
  
Q. Brooke said that when you guys arrived here she knew in her heart,
and she seemed pretty adamant, that she was confident. Coming into today, top
three seeds done, did you feel this was your tournament to lose at that point?
How much confidence did you have?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Brooke sat up here with me last year, we were one and
done, we lost, third seed, and lost to UNLV, and she sat up here in front of
everyone and said, We went one and done my freshman year, and we won it my
sophomore year, and now we're one and done, and when we come back we'll win
it. And we did.  
  
She has competitive greatness, has the ability to be great when you have to be
great. That's Brooke Pahukoa. She's a wonderful leader. Her sister Brittney
Pahukoa is a phenomenal leader on our team, and got us through summer
conditioning, and team mom, and so many wonderful things people don't see.
It's going to be hard to lose them, but they have made a wonderful impact in
our program. And have been so thankful to be part of their lives.  
  
Q. I was just going to bring up the seniors, too. Last night Leon Rice
sat up here and broke down talking about Nick Duncan. Seems like you have a
special relationship with Brooke. Just kind of want to know about your
relationship with them and what they've meant not only to you, but to this
program as a whole.  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: They come from an extremely athletic family, the
Pahukoas. And they just bought in. They didn't just buy into me, they bought
into Boise State athletics, they bought into the administration of Boise
State, into Boise State academics. And they're ambassadors, not just for our
program, but for the university and the school. Boise State is a great place,
but those guys, they really buy into it. And that part, it makes people want
to be around you if you're positive all the time. And they've been great.  
  
Q. It seemed like every time that Fresno State tried to make a run in
the second half Brooke or somebody, seemed like more often than not it was
Brooke, had to silence her.  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: She has the ability to step up. But we've had so many
close games, and that was our pregame talk was about we tripped up in January
and we're accountable for it. No one won at Wyoming, no one won at Colorado
State, we went to Pullman and won. We've been on the road, we're battle
tested. We're not going to put our head up, we're going to go right through
the finish line and when adversity hit we kept on pushing.  
  
Q. You've made runs here in the last few years, what is it about you
guys when you get down here to Las Vegas, three games in three days -- I guess
three in four days, isn't too much for you guys?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: I don't know, we just had some competitive people that
believe in the system and believe in the university. And we're not going to
put up a white flag for anybody. And like I said, we had the rough bracket. If
you think about it. New Mexico is a terrific program. And Colorado State is
the No. 1 seed. And we just kept plugging away.  
  
Q. What is it like stepping up on the ladder with the scissors in your
hands, and just that moment, can you realize what you guys had accomplished?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: You know, I'm from an Indian reservation. And I used to
play in a lot of Indian tournaments. And one of the guys won a tournament and
he went up and he slipped the knife in his hand and it caught his ring finger.
And so I wasn't thinking about -- I was just thinking about I've got to get
this up, clip it fast, get down before I fall down, because my friend Nick bit
it. That was kind of what I was thinking about (laughter).  
  
Q. This is your 12th season?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Yeah.  
  
Q. Obviously you were at Seattle Pacific for a while and now you've been
here a while. There's probably been opportunities that have come up. Just want
to know what is it about Boise that keeps you there? Why do you keep coming
back to Boise?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: It's a great place. And we have progressive leadership
that's always looking beyond the next fence and trying to make things better.
And there's always that feeling that there's something good coming around the
corner. And it's just a great place to work. You've got people that care about
you. I'll go back to my phone and there's going to be a bunch of texts from
Boise State people, I promise you. I kind of cling to that. It's a good place.
We've got great leadership, Christina Van Tol, Curt Apsey, it's great
leadership.  
  
Q. I was asking about playing Tennessee a couple of years ago, but that
experience to have some leaders that have been to the tournament and played
and done that, how can that benefit you and what do you hope to -- obviously
hope for a different result, but how will that help having some experience
going to the tournament for some of your players?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: We were picked to finish second. So we've always kind of
are the hunted a little bit, except for Colorado State. And then even here we
wear white twice. It's fun once in a while, it's fun not to wear white. You
want to wear white, that's the goal, but it's always fun to be the hunter.
That's what makes the NCAA tournament fun. We do have a high RPI, but we're
going to play someone with a higher RPI, and we're going to wear the dark
jerseys, and we're going to have nothing to lose and have fun and let it fly.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Ryun Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25027)

### [Elin Gustavsson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30472)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 65 Colorado State - 61  
  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Boise was outstanding. It's a really good college
basketball game. I think you saw two talented teams out there and you saw kids
on both sides that didn't want to lose. You saw a lot of really neat plays and
special plays being made. They just made a few more than us tonight.  
  
Q. You guys' defense has been so good this season and really throughout
your careers, but in the second half it just seemed like Boise caught fire
offensively and couldn't miss. Was it just a matter of them making shots or
what was it about that second half with Boise?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: I don't know. As you said, they play very fast on the
perimeter. They set a lot of screens. They made their shots. We played good
defense, but they made their shots. They're good basketball players.  
  
Q. Have you ever seen a team just really get that hot? Lupfer scores 15
of her points in that fourth quarter after having 2 in the first three
quarters. It just seemed like once they got going, everything was going to go
in for them.  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Yeah -- are you asking if I've seen a team --  
  
Q. Just like they did.  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Yeah, I played basketball for a while, so I feel like, yeah,
I've seen teams play really good and make their shots. And I've seen our team
make our shots, too. But I don't know. Today was just not -- I don't know.
Sorry.  
  
Q. You guys have been in a lot of tight games this year and you've won a
lot of them, six of your last ten games have been fairly slim margin
victories. Is it frustrating to be ahead of the game all the way but never to
be able to put a team away, and maybe give them a chance to get hot in the
fourth quarter like this? Is there anything in particular you haven't been
able to finish off some of these teams?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Of course it's frustrating. But sometimes, I mean, teams are
just going to make shots. So I think we tried to stop them.  
  
Q. You guys shot 16.7 percent from the field in the third quarter today.
Yesterday against San Jose State that's when they got back in the game as
well. Was there any reason you are struggling in the third quarter lately or
is it just a coincidence?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I don't know, I think for us we come in with the same mentality
for every quarter.  
  
Q. You two are going to go down as two of the best basketball players at
Colorado State, and unfortunately things like this can happen to you girls.
What are you going to take from this moving forward, not only from basketball,
but for yourselves?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: I know after this season how much I really love basketball.
And how much I love playing with Ellen. I don't know, my four years here at
Colorado State has been so amazing. And I feel like I'm just going to -- I'm
enjoying every little single thing here.  
  
I'm not going to say that I'm enjoying losing, but I love my team. I love
playing with Ellen. And I'm just going to take all the positive energy, all my
positive memories, happy memories, and everything. I don't know, keep loving
basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously tonight didn't go the way you guys would have hoped for.
Following the game Boise State coaching staff and players had a lot of praise
for both of you and the CSU coaching staff. I believe they went as far as
saying you two are two of the best players in Mountain West history. What does
it mean to you to receive that type of praise from a fierce competitor?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: It means a lot, of course. But I would never be the player
that I am today if it wasn't for Ellen.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Same.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: So I feel like -- yeah, we're good as individual players, but
I would not play -- I would not have this good a season if it wasn't for her.  
  
Q. When you had that stretch, you made that jump shot and you dived for
the loose ball and it leads to a layup. It seemed like that was going to be
the turning point. Is that the impression you got and allowed them to get the
momentum back on their side?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I'm going to try to do everything I can to win the game. And I
feel like we all tried our hardest, and they kept making shots, yeah, tough
shots.  
  
Q. I know it's extremely difficult to go through right now, but you guys
won it last year, and then knocked out the two years before that. Can you
process the emotions right now, what's going on? How tough is it?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: It's tough, because who knows if I'm ever going to be able to
play with Eli again.  
  
Q. And then obviously a brutal matchup facing a Boise team that is a
tough draw for you. Just how difficult is it to face a team like this, not
even in the championship, but in the semis this early in the tournament?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: When you get to the semis these games are supposed to be
like this. We've had two really tight games with Boise. So this shouldn't
surprise anybody. And I think on paper that's as talented a roster up and down
as we faced in the league. I said that from day one. And so it's a very, very
good basketball team. You run into them in the semis -- you've got to go
through them. And today they just -- they made a few more plays than we did.  
  
Boise was, again, they were outstanding today.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the loss, Myanne played well, she had 14 points, and
her season high was 16, but she doesn't score double figures that frequently.
How was she able to be so successful today?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: I'm really proud of Myanne. I'm proud of our whole team,
the way we just kept making plays. We'd get down. We'd answer. And we'd get up
and Boise would answer. And Myanne was a big part of that. She played with
such great confidence.  
  
And to see Myanne, if you were to see Myanne game one this year and where you
see her now, you have to be so, so proud of that young lady. Her confidence
just as a basketball player and as a young lady has just really, really grown.
And that's what the game of basketball can do for somebody. She's a more
confident player off the floor, as well, now, because of what she's done.  
  
But she showed great courage today. And that's impressive. She's got -- she
has a lot more games left in her Ram uniform. And so the conviction she shot
the ball with today, that's, as a coach, that's all you can ask a player to
do, put a good stroke on it, be confident and shoot it. And Myanne did that.
She had a smile on her face a lot tonight. I'm glad she was having fun,
competed like crazy and she was outstanding.  
  
Q. Back to the third quarter struggles, would you say there's a
particular reason your team hasn't done well in the third quarter recently,
would you say it's a coincidence?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: I would say it's a coincidence. We had good third
quarters, but we just didn't play good in the third quarter.  
  
Q. Coaching cliches, that you don't remember the wins so much as you do
the losses. Curious as your thoughts on why is this one going to stick with
you for a while, assuming it will.  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Well, yeah, our goal was to win this tournament, which is
very hard to do, by the way, okay, as a 1 seed. And why will this stick with
me? Because this is -- as far as Mountain West conference play, this is the
last time 13 and 22 will represent Colorado State in Mountain West conference
play. And that's what makes it tough. You don't want it to ever end.  
  
But you don't always get a win. And our kids know that. And that's why I
respect these two to my left so much is they have respected every single
opponent every single game every single year of their career here. And that's
why their record is so outstanding. They've really helped change the culture.
They've changed this culture into a championship culture, a high-character
culture.  
  
So the toughest thing, it's just that, yeah, coaching these two, I mean you've
seen a lot of basketball. You don't get these two rolling into a program that
often. So that's why I'll remember it.  
  
I won't remember the loss, okay? We'll all have more losses. But when you lace
it up with a team like we had this year, with these two individuals, it's just
-- it's special. And when it ends it sucks. And tonight it ended.  
  
Q. Coach, like I said before yesterday, Gordy referenced these two as
two of the best players in Mountain West history. What does it mean to you to
hear that type of praise about two of your players coming from an opposing
coach?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: I respect Gordy a lot. Gordy coached a really good game
tonight. They've won a lot of basketball games, too, during these four years
that Ellen and Eli have played. So for him to say that, that's quite a
compliment, because he knows what he's talking about.  
  
And Gordy is right. He's right. These two -- this duo right here, they're
special. They've won a lot of games. But I wish the whole league could just
know Ellen and Eli, just know them as people, not as basketball players, but
just know them as human beings, they would be even more impressed with these
two. But it's very nice of Gordy to say. I think he's got some really good
players, too. And like that Lupfer kid, we got Lupfer'd in that fourth
quarter. She was outstanding.  
  
We tip our hat to Boise. They beat us tonight.

### [Kristina Cavey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32844)

### [Bego Faz Davalos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30478)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 53 UNLV - 51  
  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, I thought we played another great defensive game. I
feel like we've put three really good defensive games together on this run.
Just proud of our bench came in and really gave us a lift. And kids that
haven't played in a couple of games and they just never stopped believing and
got in and did whatever they could to help the team. It's just nice to see as
a coach everybody excited for those kids.  
  
So we kind of survived in the first half and then come back, we did a good job
getting the lead. Lost the lead, but we maintained our composure. And I
thought in the second half a little bit different things that we needed but
down the stretch our kids were just determined to win the game.  
  
Q. Two field goals over the last seven minutes of the game for you.
Candice hits a three, you hit the inside jumper for the game winner. Talk
about resiliency for either one of you or both of you. The defensive effort
you had to put up against a team that can fire at any given time.  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: My teammates, that's how I did it. They never stopped
believing. And no matter what was the score, no matter -- or defense, if it
fail or something happen, they never stop believing, and that's what keep me
pushing. And I'm super glad they did it, because we're going to the
championship.  
  
KRISTINA CAVEY: Teammates and I think our style of defense that we started to
run definitely helped. They kind of -- I think we kept them where we wanted
them and were able to get up in pressure, and I think that was a big part was
just being able to pressure. And I think our front line did a great job of
pressuring the balls, and then the back line definitely got some steals and
didn't let the ball come in, have an entrance to get into their offense
quickly. So I think that was awesome. And we all kind of helped doing that so
I thought it was great.  
  
Q. Huge performance for you as a freshman here in the semifinals,
matching a career high. What made you play so well in a big spot like this?  
KRISTINA CAVEY: Definitely the effort of my teammates and being able to run
and have them pass it up to me, definitely started and helped get in
transition. And also just great passes, running the offense, being able to go
through it and then just kind of working it around. It kind of all just fell
into place.  
  
Q. Last year tough, tough exit. What's different -- I may have asked you
this the first day -- what's going to be different about this team come Friday
in terms of its mindset and again, the resiliency, and just the talent that's
stepping on the floor, the chemistry? What will be different as a No. 7 seed
but that you feel it's more prepared to contend and win the championship?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, I've been saying all year that we're inexperienced
and now I'm saying we have experience. We were here. We feel it. We're excited
by it. We've played enough games in there that it's like our home court. And I
think our kids are just young enough to just be having fun. And that's nice,
as a head coach.  
  
And then they saw what happened last year. And even I've seen -- we've had
some close games, but I've seen kids say, Hey, it's not over, we get leads,
Hey, it's not over, we have to keep grinding it out. And that's what we were
probably the most upset with is losing a little bit of that lead in the
championship game last year. Our kids really understand they've got to play
all 40 minutes now.  
  
Q. You scored 38 points in the first meeting with UNLV. What adjustments
did you have to make and what did you do differently to be able to pull this
one out?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Right. That's why you go to college to be a coach, because
they always have to tell you what to say sometimes. We played them once during
the regular season. So we played Wyoming at their place and we got beat pretty
good. But then we beat Wyoming at our place. Look, it's just the second time
we're playing them. We've split with a lot of people. We had a close game with
Colorado State, we had a close game with Boise. It's just our second time
playing them, anything can happen.  
  
And I just think they didn't think too far ahead. It's kind of nice when
you're the 7 seed, you don't think too far ahead, you think one game at a
time. And I think that's what they did.  
  
Q. Only one step to look forward to. You have to look ahead, what do you
have to do to beat Boise State?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, Boise is a solid team. I think they are a solid
defensive team, also. They have a little size. They have a couple of shooters.
And I think we just have to do what we've been doing, but better. We're going
to have to defend better. They have a post player that's a nice post player.
Their guards are nice. We have to understand where the shooters are. And we
have to have a passion and we have to put all these three games behind us and
just go for it.  
  
Q. Obviously it was a tremendous stretch there the last five minutes-
plus of this game. You guys defensively were able to step it up. What was said
as far as time outs when you addressed this team from a defensive standpoint
against UNLV?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: We've been through a lot of close games and late-game
situations. We'll run some of our pressure stuff but then late in the game we
really have to protect the three-point line. And so whether we were going to
matchup, whether we were going to switch on the screens, obviously that small
stuff.  
  
And then that advancing the ball makes things tricky and we wanted to make
sure they caught the ball out, outside of the three-point line and everything
was contested with no fouls. Really the small stuff.  
  
And then a little bit of, Hey, we can do this. We've got this. And it does
help, everybody looks around, but when you see Bego, you have a confidence.
She got a -- if I'm correct, she got a monster block towards the last 30
seconds of the game. And that really gives our kids a lot of confidence
knowing she's back there.  
  
Q. Kristina came off the bench and matched her career high with 13
points. How impressed are you with her as a freshman?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: When we recruited Kristina she was the hardest working kid
in every gym we were in. That's going to pay off. Just like Emilie Volk. But
for Kristina, I know she got popped in the mouth, and I think she said, Let's
go, let's play.  
  
She's got good speed, decent length. We knew she could hit that shot. Ice in
her veins a couple of times. We said, Work it around, make sure you have a
good shot. She caught it, she knew she was open and she knocked those down.
And we absolutely needed those. Those were big times for us, big baskets.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Brooke Pahukoa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28504)

### [Riley Lupfer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32836)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 65 Colorado State - 61  
  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: I thought it was a great game between two teams that are
pretty evenly matched. They've had great games for the last two or three
years. And most of the time Colorado State has come out on top in real close
games. We split this year. And then this one we thought it would be close, and
we didn't play probably as well as we'd have liked in the first half. But the
second half I thought we played much more aggressively. I thought we did a
good job trying to run motion, instead of trying to run special plays like we
did in the first half.  
  
Defensively I thought our coaches did a great job, Cody Butler did a great job
doing the scout and getting us ready. And certainly kudos for them, for sure.  
  
Q. Seemed like in the fourth quarter, actually second half, timely shots
more than anything. Right at the right moment. Just to stop their momentum,
whatever it took. Where does that resiliency come from? And what sort of
things were you saying to one another in time outs and the huddle?  
RILEY LUPFER: You are who you surround yourself with, and Brooke Pahukoa steps
up every night and is greatness. We feed off her. If she feels great, she
makes the whole team feel great.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I think that the special thing about our team is there's not a
superstar. We have every single person that can step on the floor and just be
a baller and dominate and make plays, and you saw that today. Special moments
for Yaiza and Riley, Marijke, Sha. We can't stop -- if you have five players
who can score, it's fun.  
  
Q. Was there ever one moment in that fourth quarter where -- it's a
rhetorical question -- did you know you were going to win? Of course you had
confidence. Was there a point where you felt you had seized the momentum and
you were going to win? Was there a play? A shot?  
RILEY LUPFER: I think it was our point guard, Yai. If you see her getting in
the game and flexing and screaming, you feel like you have the game won. You
have the momentum.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I'd have to agree. When she gets into it and she controls the
game it's hard to stop her. This girl over here didn't want to miss. I think
she had 15 points in the fourth quarter. You can't stop that.  
  
Q. Can you comment on your team's resiliency and pulling it off once
again, and just where it came from, the heart this team has?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: We had a great start for our season, we went 12-1. Then
the wheels fell off a little bit. We got hurt and sick. Sha missed games and
Brooke missed games. And we went 3-6, and we have could easily turned it in,
but we didn't. And now we've won seven in a row, eight in a row, something
like that -- nine in a row and getting to play for a championship. So I think
it's a group that is pretty resilient and they feed off each other and they
enjoy being together.  
  
Q. Was there just a point where you felt like you weren't going to miss
the rest of your shots?  
RILEY LUPFER: Oh, yeah. I was behind Yai and I was screaming, Give me the
ball. I really don't even remember it. But I guess I was feeling it. When I
was screaming at Yai, you know I want the ball.  
  
Q. You hit the game winner. Today you and Yai had some big shots in the
final minute, she scored 15 in the fourth quarter. What is it like to put your
trust in a freshman like that?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: You don't get to see what she's like in practice every day. I
knew the very first day that she's something special. And it's amazing how
she's going to have four years here. And she got better and better every day.
One of the best players in the conference already as a freshman, so you guys
are in for a treat.  
  
Q. What's it mean to be back in the title game again? A couple of years
ago you won it. The season started off so hot, and it didn't look so good for
a while, but to have another shot to get back to the big dance, how does it
feel?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: It feels awesome. I love Boise State. I love being a part of
this team. I love my teammates. I love my coaches. This isn't about going and
winning a championship. It's about playing one more game with the girls that I
love. You're going to make me cry, here, that's what it's about for me. One
more possession, one more game I want to be a part of.  
  
Q. To have another chance to play for the title after a couple of years
ago, and maybe you guys were top ten in the RPI for a while there and got off
to such a hot start. What does it mean to get back to the tournament and
achieve your goals?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Obviously I'm excited to be the coach and for me and the
school. But I'm really excited for them. And they put a lot of time and
effort, just like everybody does, but they live their lives right and they're
high-value kids. And to see them rewarded for a chance to play for a
championship is awesome. It's great to be a part of their lives for a little
bit longer.  
  
Q. I'm trying to recollect a couple of years ago, and I believe -- I
want to say it was Yai that was up on the dais. She was talking about how her
parents at home had to livestream the game, and it was in the middle of the
night back there. I'm just curious, I was hoping she would be here to ask her
again, if they livestream, if they still do that?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: They were wearing blue today. They were here. They came
over for senior night and they've stayed through the tournament. And I think
she's making some wonderful memories for them, that's for sure.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: She has been looking forward to this since her freshman year.
And during the tournament her sophomore year, that was her biggest regret that
her parents weren't here. They weren't going to miss that again. They've been
here, and they've been here about a week before the tournament and about a
week after and enjoy Las Vegas.  
  
Q. It was a very emotional game, a lot of back and forth there,
especially in the fourth quarter. How do you stay grounded knowing you have a
day off before this championship game?  
RILEY LUPFER: We just prepare. We don't take the day off. We don't think about
we're in Vegas. We're here to win a championship, not enjoy Vegas. We'll spend
tomorrow getting ready.  
  
Q. Coach talked about how you and CSU have had kind of a good rivalry
going over the last couple of years. Can you talk about what it means to win
that season series this year and what it means to you guys to beat a team with
the senior duo like Gustavsson and Nystrom?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Colorado has been a powerhouse in our conference since I've
gotten here. And anytime you can steal a win from them it's a good feeling.
They have had amazing careers. They have been the best players that I've
played against in the game of basketball. So I love playing against the best.
And it's a fun rivalry. And they got First Team, I think almost every year
they've been here, and much deserved.  
  
They're amazing. Their team is amazing, their coach is amazing. We knew it was
going to be a tough one. Colorado is a team you have to play your best game,
they won't beat themselves. We knew we had to come out and play our best game.  
  
Q. Back and forth at the end of the basketball game. What was you and
your staff's approach from a defensive standpoint, as you were able to get key
stops late in the basketball game?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Cody does defensive calls, and we went into the game
with multiple defenses. We switched up man, zone and middle of possessions. We
ran a couple of different multiple presses. And we were trying to keep them
off balance. If you let them get in rhythm and feet set and it's over.  
  
They expect good things to happen. And good things happen to them. And they
have the ability to hit the dagger three. And tonight Riley and Yaiza hit
dagger threes for us. We're fortunate here to be on the podium because of it.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 8, 2017

  

### [Kathy Olivier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19395)

### [Dylan Gonzalez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30479)

### [Brooke Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30467)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 53 UNLV - 51  
  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, I thought Fresno did a really good job. They have
great length in that zone and it gave us a little trouble. We never really got
into the flow offensively.  
  
But we've done such a great job defensively all year. I thought we did a great
job on No. 4 in the first half and then she just got hot in that second half.
They're smart, they went to her in the second half. We didn't really have an
answer. And our post players have been tremendous for us the whole year. We
hoped one could get it going. We relied more on our outside shooting, but
usually our defense creates some of our offense, and it really didn't do that
tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously a very disappointing way to end the season, but can you
guys kind of take a little solace in the fact that the whole team is going to
be coming back next season?  
BROOKE JOHNSON: No, because we don't plan on our season being done right now.  
  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: We've been talking about postseason all year, that's
really been their focus. And these ladies are really -- they were dialed into
the NCAA. We played a non-conference schedule that was very competitive, beat
a good SC team at the time, now they have injuries. Beat an Ole Miss team, an
SEC team. We were rolling. We could have beat Oregon State, we had our point
guard injured, that's when Nikki got injured.  
  
Our mindset was postseason, postseason, and it was really thinking about the
NCAA and we'd be more than happy to go to the NIT and be very proud to
represent the Mountain West in the NIT.  
  
Q. Then to springboard off of that, do you think that you've done enough
to get there?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: 22 wins, I think these people -- I mean obviously I'm a
little biased because I'm the coach, but they're amazing. They worked their
tails off. They have captivated the community. We have so many different
options. We have so many different people that can step up at any given night.
And with 22 wins and the schedule that we played, I would think that the NIT
would be more than happy to have us represent.  
  
Q. I asked Fresno their opinion on this, for you on this side of it, you
held them to 38 points when you beat them just a week or two ago. What was the
difference tonight as far as not being able to shut them down like you did in
the first meeting in the regular season?  
DYLAN GONZALEZ: I think tournament time is a different time. So it's kind of
like everybody comes and plays at a completely different level. When you come
into any game you really have to act like you haven't played that team before,
just because it's a completely different mindset. Everybody is coming to try
to take things to another level and that's exactly what Fresno did. And we
came and we tried to play our best basketball, too, and it's not like they
came in and blew us out. We respect their program very much. It's tough to
lose, especially in a really close game like that. But it's just a different
feel. Different vibe in a tournament.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Ryun Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25027)

### [Elin Gustavsson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30472)

### [Ellen Nystrom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28464)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 65 San Jose State - 60  
  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Survive and advance, that's what we did. San Jose State
is always a tough matchup. They score the ball so well, and they can score so
fast, with the three ball. So no lead is ever safe when you play San Jose. We
knew that and I think the biggest thing with this game for us is that we
experienced a little bit of everything. We experienced a lead, we experienced
giving up a lead, we experienced having to make free throws in a late game
tournament situation, making some shots, when the momentum is in favor of the
opponent.  
  
So like I told the kids, you're now -- if you weren't in this tournament
before, you are now in this tournament, because you just experienced, I feel,
everything that you might experience throughout a whole week in one game.  
  
How was that for a statement? That was pretty long.  
  
Q. You scored 26 points, 12 rebounds, can you talk about what went good
for you down in the post?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We tried to get the ball into post and I tried to take
advantage of -- if they would play tight I tried to go by them, if they backed
off I tried to shoot them. So kind of make them a little bit confused because
I tried to do both. Be a threat everywhere.  
  
Rebounds, I was playing a lot together with Smith, kind of against each other.
And she's a really good rebounder and she's strong. So I had to try to find my
advantage when it came to my length. And it worked some decisions.  
  
Q. What were you guys able to do to just regain your composure after
they went on the 10-0 run at the end of the third quarter?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I mean, I think that's what's so good about San Jose, for them.
They are always playing super aggressive, always trying to make shots. So it's
always hard to play them, even if you're up by 10 or 20 points, you know
they're always going to play the same. We knew that. And we knew if we kept
our poise and kept passing it where we wanted the ball, we were going to be
fine.  
  
Q. You had only 4 points and 7 rebounds in the first half, you were able
to get it going the second behalf. What were you able to do?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Coach told me to be more aggressive.  
  
Q. It seemed like it was a pretty physical game. We saw a couple of you
hit the floor pretty hard three or four times. Is that something that you guys
are worried about, having to play two or three more games this week?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: No. This is how basketball is.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think it makes the game more fun, if it's more physical. And
I think it's good that the refs allow us to be more physical. It's March, so
that's how it's supposed to be.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: On the court, you can take a lot. It's a different type of
pain level.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: It looks worse than it is.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind, just at some point did you have the
panic of uh-oh, we may be going out of this? Did that cross your mind?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: No. I trust my team. If we're up 30, down 30; I always trust
my team. We knew when we were up by 10 by halftime, that 10 is nothing against
anyone. But I love my team. I trust my team. So, no.  
  
Q. You came out of that timeout late and you drove for a layup. Was that
what you needed to do? That was a very aggressive drive and a critical
basket.  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We knew when we only had 8 seconds and I tried to get Smith
out from the paint and just use my speed and just be aggressive.  
  
Q. You were able to stay really poised and hit timely shots even when
San Jose State came back. You have lost before in the first round of this
tournament before. Did that experience help you and keep you under control so
you were still able to win the game?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We have experience from this season, too. We know what type
of team San Jose is, they're really good. And they're always going all in. So
that was just -- of course, like Ellen and I, and Stine, we remember our
sophomore year. But we're a different team. And we just stayed locked in and
just focused strong with the ball.  
  
Q. What do you guys learn from this game that's going to help you going
into the semifinals now? What do you take from this game as you move
forward?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think our poise was good. Our defense was really good,
rebounding. But I think -- we've got a taste of what the tournament is like,
and all the people that are new to our team got a taste of what it's like, and
how it's like. So now we're in it.  
  
Q. For either one of the student-athletes or Coach, at the start of the
game, defensively speaking, held Dezz Ramos to two shots in the first quarter,
seven in the first half, Jas zero shots in the first quarter, two shots in the
first half, was the goal defensively to shut those two down, let the others
take their shots, sort of isolate their threats?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Those are two really talented offensive players. And we
just needed to -- we dedicated to those two kids, if they were in our area,
you had to stay a little more attached.  
  
But I just think we played our assignments really well in that first quarter
and I thought really aggressive. We were really disruptive on the ball, so
they couldn't get into their game all that much. So the top two kids in our
zone, our matchup tonight, which was Tvrdy, Stine, I thought Myanne Hamm was
great up top. They're distinctively disruptive. And that got us off to a
really good start.  
  
Q. In that third quarter there was a run where they went I believe it
was 24-10. What were you telling the ladies going into that fourth quarter as
far as keeping their head?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Well, all we told them coming out of the end of that
third quarter buzzer was just win the first four minutes of the fourth. Just
break it down into that increment. Just keep it right there, don't -- don't
even really look at the score board.  
  
This team is -- the thing is, this is how we play, guys. We could play Fort
Collins High School girls team and we win by five. That seems to be our
nature. We scored -- what did we score today? 65 points on 1 of 11 shooting
from the three. That's really good offense for us. It is. A couple more three
balls and we're talking 70 points, and we're ecstatic with 70 points.  
  
But it was -- we don't ever seem to panic. We've got Ellen and Eli, we throw
the ball to them. They seem to make some plays. I don't think we ever, ever
saw or ever felt that we were going to lose the basketball game.  
  
Q. You held San Jose State to 18 percent shooting in the first quarter.
San Jose, is there anything specifically that you did it to allow them to come
back into the game and have a chance?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Do you see their shooters out there? Their bench came in,
Turney hits a big three, Gennett comes in and makes a couple threes. These
kids shoot it and they shoot it from deep. And they've got a play maker in
Ramos.  
  
So what they put out there is extremely difficult to defend. And it becomes
contagious, and you see that with their team, if you watch them a lot. They'll
make a couple, and now they can make five more in a row.  
  
Our kids were prepared for that, because we've played them so many times and
we just pound it in their head that no lead is ever safe and that they're
capable of those types of runs. So those are some extremely talented shooters.
And their mindset is catch and let it fly. We might need to steal that for the
rest of the tournament because 1 in 11 is not going to cut it for us.  
  
Q. How nice is it to have Ellen and Eli to turn to, two players that can
create and that are experienced and have been through all this before?  
COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's very, very important and extremely valuable to
be able to play through a couple of seniors that have really, really been
tested. But let's face it, San Jose State put four seniors out there, as well,
that didn't want to lose today. So I think that's why you saw the game work
out the way it did, very, very close.  
  
But I thought Tvrdy was really key, as well. We can say Ellen and Eli, but I
thought Tvrdy made some good plays. I thought Stine's answer, the three ball
answer in the corner, she's done that all year. She's a very mature, reliable
player for us, and no moment really ever intimidates Stine. She just shot it,
caught it. So that mentality by those two kids I thought critical in that
fourth quarter.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Candice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32758)

### [Bego Faz Davalos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30478)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 58 Wyoming - 48  
  
COACH JAIME WHITE: I thought we had probably the best three quarters put
together all season. Our kids played really good defense. I thought we
pressured well. And just caused Wyoming to take some time breaking the press
and work on their offense. I thought we contested the right people. We got
great rebounding position and good rebounds.  
  
And again, I thought we got the ball inside to Bego early, where I thought she
did a good job. We got them in foul trouble. And for the most part I think
they had to play a little bit safe there until the fourth quarter, not excited
about that as much. It's tournament time, teams are going to do that. And I
thought our kids got scared and then came back and held their poise and
finished the game.  
  
Q. Not to take anything away from your effort over three quarters, but
did any part of it shock you as far as just their futility. 24 points in three
quarters, and they scored 24 in the fourth quarter. Is there any point you
say, Is this really happening?  
CANDICE WHITE: When it comes to Wyoming all of them can shoot from the one to
the five. It wasn't surprising, it was just a matter of how are we going to
stop them.  
  
Q. You had a couple of milestones as far as double-double, I think you
needed one more to set a single season mark. And then I believe -- career goal
for blocks for the school. And for total blocks in Mountain West Tournament
action, you needed one more to tie. Talk about personal applications, and
helping Fresno State for their fifth straight semifinal appearance.  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: I'm really happy about it, but I'm definitely super happy
about the win. If those blocks help us out to win the game, definitely I'm
going to try to make them, I'm going to try to block them. I'm super happy
about our team effort and I'm excited about what's going to happen tomorrow.  
  
Q. Any team, either team tonight that you're looking forward to facing,
one team you'd rather not face?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, personally I want to face all of them. It's going to
be fun. I don't think we're afraid of any single team. But I'm just excited
for the next one, definitely.  
  
CANDICE WHITE: She pretty much said it all. Either team, we haven't got a win.
So either one would be great.  
  
Q. Which one do you feel you match up better with?  
COACH JAIME WHITE: You know, we've played both of them. I thought we played a
solid game at home against Utah State, but again, both of them were our single
games during the Mountain West, so it's kind of hard to tell. I didn't think
we played great here against UNLV, but I do think as far as the matchup goes,
they're very similar, both of them. They both play two more post type players
and three guards. And so, you know, whatever it takes. I feel like we're up
for the challenge. We're here. We're in it. And we're going to stay as long as
we can.

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Brooke Pahukoa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28504)

### [Marta Hermida](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32779)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 64 New Mexico - 62  
  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: It was a great game. I think it was a game that fans
would enjoy. It wasn't always that fun to coach, but I was really just really
proud of our kids. And they persevered, and they kept coming back. And they
hit that 3, and I don't know if we missed a switch or what, but no one had
their heads down or anything, and then we went -- we knew we were going to
Brooke no matter what, and Brooke has competitive greatness, that old John
Wooden term, when you have to be great you can be great. And she is. And she
got that last basket.  
  
Q. Was it drawn up in a way that you knew you were going inside or was
there a read that you saw that you got so close to the basket?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Kudos to Coach P, he drew that up, he said you're going to
screen and turn right back around and you'll get a direct pass in, go to work.
It was the play that he drew up. Good job.  
  
Q. Really for both players, how tough is it to be able to keep up with
New Mexico's up-tempo style? You were able to keep pace most of the game.  
MARTA HERMIDA: It was hard. They have a great team. They have incredible
players. We knew that. They competed really well today. And we knew we had to
do a great game to win. And I think we did it.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Our scout said that Beynon, she has 40 percent of her points
in transition and the team has about 40 percent of their points in transition.
We knew that. And they still got us a couple times in transition, so that just
proves what a great team they are with pushing the ball and that pace of the
game. Really great team. Fun game to be a part of.  
  
Q. With some 7:41 left, they take a 57-52 lead. They had a run, they had
a good crowd. The crowd was into it. Media timeout comes and you guys seem to
either calm down or maybe buckets started falling. On the defensive side they
shot 1 of 9 over the next 6 1/2 minutes. Was there something different or was
it a matter of their shots not falling?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: You know, I think that our team just competed today. That's
the only way to say it. And of course a timeout helps and slows down the game
a little bit. As an athlete you want to be part of a game like that where the
crowd is just cheering and everyone is into it and it's a close game. And we
weren't ready to be done yet. You could kind of just tell. No words were
exchanged. You just looked at everyone's faces, I knew my teammates were
ready, and we were ready to lock it down and win the game.  
  
MARTA HERMIDA: I think we don't need to talk. It's just like one look at each
other, and it is like we are going to win this. We knew we were going to win
this. We were together on defense and that worked.  
  
Q. Now you just won a tough game. They won a tough game. You get a shot
at Colorado State. What's going to be the key to win that game?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Some of the things the team showed today, being resilient,
being consistent, knowing scout and making plays. If we do the things we did
today it will be a really good game. We're excited for the challenge.  
  
Q. You got a pretty good compliment, drawing up a nice play at the end.
What you drew up there, was it something you saw on film, was it a go-to type
of a play? Tell us about that last play.  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: This morning at my hotel room I thought it would be
close. We won the game the last time with them. So I drew up about four
different plays, all to Brooke, with different seconds, kind of. And so I felt
like that was one that would work at the time, so that's what we went with,
just putting her in the post. We had put her in the post in live play earlier,
and it didn't work. But I felt like coming out of a timeout and her setting a
screen that maybe the person would back off a little bit and she could spin
around and bury underneath the rim, and fortunately it all worked out.  
  
Great pass from the passer. People don't see that part. It was a heck of a
pass and a long pass, Sha Shaw.  
  
Q. Both teams got this, this isn't to imply one team had an advantage.
In general, your thoughts on the advancement of the ball. They got it to set
up their game-tying three. You got it with one second left. If you aren't able
to advance the ball, the rule on that, do you have any thoughts on the
advancement of the ball?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: The rule changed. I think it makes it fun and exciting.
And I really, really like that rule change part of it. Coaching, you get to
coach a little bit more.  
  
But the part I struggle a little bit with are the timeout situation, because
it's hard to sub. I think the first quarter there was one little timeout or
something, and people were fatiguing out. And there isn't the breakage in play
like there used to be. Maybe it's better than the fans. But as far as getting
the ball and getting advance, I love that part.  
  
Q. I want to ask you the same thing, just another shot at Colorado State
now, you guys obviously have had great games with them. What do you guys have
to do to go beat them tomorrow in a semifinal matchup?  
COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Extremely well coached. Two of the best players probably
ever in the Mountain West, they're do-it-all players; they can post and pass.
They do a great job. And they've been there, and they've made critical shots
at critical times. They've also been really, really blessed. Those two kids I
don't think have even had a cold in four years. We went through the month of
January where it was really difficult. We went 3 and 6, Brooke was hurt and
out, Sha Shaw was out. They've been fortunate.  
  
But also, they're very talented and very well coached. And they run the right
stuff for their personnel. So we've got to hopefully get second-chance
opportunities. And we're going to have to defend their isolations. They play
like an NBA pro team. And they're very good defensively. And we're just going
to have to do the best job we can with all that switching.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Kathy Olivier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19395)

### [Dakota Gonzalez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30468)

### [Paris Strawther](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32784)

### [Brooke Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30467)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 68 Utah State - 43  
  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: I just felt like we had one of our best complete games of
the season. We had so many options out there. And when our defense plays with
that kind of intensity and that kind of effort our defense creates our offense
and it kind of opened the game up.  
  
This team has so many options and that's what makes us a good basketball team.
It's not just one player, it's several players. To have four players in double
figures, and to play that kind of tenacious defense is pretty much what the
Lady Rebels are all about.  
  
Q. 55-53 in overtime, second game you lose 58-49. Tonight as you said
the offense picked up. The defense turned it into offense for you. What was
different, though, that you couldn't get done in the first two games? What was
so motivating? Was it the tournament itself, was it time to prepare?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: For one of these gals?  
  
Q. Any one of the players.  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: Yeah, I would say that, you know, one thing that we
definitely take a lot of pride in here is our defense. And nothing but respect
for Utah State, but as far as we go, I don't think we put our best foot
forward defensively in the first two games that we played against them. And we
definitely came into this game understanding that but not letting it be
something that hindered us, we used it as a motivation to come out and have
that defensive intensity tonight.  
  
Q. The first half you were a little apprehensive as far as your
aggressiveness, which is something you worked on coming into the season and
you became very aggressive. Was part of that possibly tension between the
teams and you got comfortable because you opened up and started grabbing
rebounds the second half?  
PARIS STRAWTHER: I think some of it has to do with the recent foul calls. So I
just want to make sure I stay in the game and don't take myself out by getting
more fouls. But at the end of the day I have to realize that I'm an aggressive
player. But still play aggressive but play smart. And I think that's what came
out more in the second half.  
  
Q. Yesterday we were talking about the loss to Fresno State last year,
the sting of that, revenge is on the mind. What's different about this team
that will enable you guys to get that revenge?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: I would say that this team is just a special team overall.
And we're definitely, kind of like I spoke with you the other day, we used
those feelings that we had in that loss last year throughout I think this
entire season. And I think that's what's been able to get us so much success
because we've found ourselves facing certain adversities that are very
difficult for any team to overcome. And we've been able to come together and
pull out a lot of difficult wins.  
  
Coming up with Fresno, having that in mind of last year, we're going to come
up with that same mindset and staying together. This group has done an
incredible job of that throughout the entire season. And I have no doubt we'll
do our best tomorrow to make sure we all have that same mindset.  
  
Q. Brooke, it seems -- you seemed a lot more patient this year in terms
of whether you're going to take a shot, pass the ball up. And you seem to hit
your stride at the right time. It's like timely. When you hit one you just
take off and you get hot. What's been the difference for you, and you just
seem to get in a groove and you set a record, a school record for Mountain
West tournament game for 3's?  
BROOKE JOHNSON: Personally I feel I've been more hesitant than patient.
There's games I've gone full force and missed quite a few shots and there are
games I haven't taken any shots and been overly passive. Tonight I tried to
find that balance and take a shot when I was open, and once I hit one I was
feeling comfortable enough to take another one and pass when I needed to.  
  
Q. Talk about defense. I believe it was 13 steals. You had eight of
them. That number jumped out at me when I saw it. Did the ball seem bigger on
the defensive end where you could bat it away?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: I would say that, honestly, my teammates made it so almost
effortless to get the steals, because they did an incredible job on our
defensive rotations. We focus so much on that in practice and we drill it
every single day. When they're able to get those rotations and stops it makes
it easy for me to get in position and get the steals.  
  
As far as on-ball pressure goes, I definitely took that to heart to pressure
the ball because I know for myself I did not have very great games against
Utah State both showings. I wanted to do what I could defensively to lead the
team. That was my main focus today. And my teammates definitely helped me out
with that and I'm super proud with the outcome.  
  
Q. What feels different? It's tournament time now, you obviously stepped
up today. What felt different for you?  
BROOKE JOHNSON: Well, we're used to the Thomas & Mack gym. We love that gym.
And so I just kind of feel comfortable in there and it's our own area. Other
than that it's just when one goes and starts to get a feel for the rim, for
the game, and that's kind of how I go from it. If I miss a shot I'm going to
try to drive in a couple of times. And since I didn't miss the three, I didn't
have to drive in as much tonight.  
  
Q. Local girl, you got a bit of a hometown crowd. This is your second
time around on the Mountain West Tournament, were you feeling more
comfortable, less jitters knowing you had that corner over there cheering for
you? I think Coach Kaps was here, too.  
PARIS STRAWTHER: I love playing in front of my hometown and all of my people.  
  
And as far as being in the Mountain West Tournament for the second time,
definitely feel more comfortable, but I just feel that the adrenaline in such
a good way as far as not being as timid like I was last year not knowing what
to expect.  
  
It's a fun time of year. I'm excited to see where it takes us.  
  
Q. All these positive points and positive remarks, big question here, 60
points from four players, eight from four others. Is that a concern that you
maybe need more balance as far as from other players or are you happy with
four main scorers?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: I think that's our strength right now. We have so many
options out there, as much as it was four, we feel like the other people can
score just as much. When you talk about Brooke's 3's, we were moving the ball
so well as a team, it was very obvious that it was about playing good
basketball, and not about me scoring. And we do that, we play the defense that
Dakota was talking about and move the ball, we're going to be a very tough
basketball team to beat.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE)?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Fresno State is a good basketball team. They have a very
good center inside that does a great job blocking shots. She's long, length.
Help me --  
  
PARIS STRAWTHER: Bego.  
  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: But she's that presence inside, we can't get intimidated
by her, but she does an incredible job. They play a lot of zone, a lot of man,
they mix it up. So we have to make sure we're playing together as a team on
the offensive side. We only played them once. It's Fresno State and Boise were
the two teams we only played once this year. The first time around I thought
we did a great job on the defensive end. If we can come out with that
defensive intensity that makes us successful then hopefully we'll get that W.  
  
Q. I know the mood that you're in getting back from Logan last week. You
told me the players were even worse. How easy was it for you to motivate them
tonight?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: It was easy. This group is a very competitive group,
they're determined. No one was happy. I remember you guys had me on the radio
right after, I think it was the next day or actually it was that day we got
home. And they're just a competitive group. They weren't happy. They weren't
happy in the airport. They weren't happy after the game. And we just had a
sour taste in our mouth and everyone worked hard in practice. And it was
actually kind of good for us to play Utah State because I knew that that was
on their mind. It's the team that always likes to pay back, so to speak.  
  
So Fresno State, I mean, that's going to be a complete different game. And we
just prep for them so we have to make sure that we continue to go with that
kind of focus and that determination that we did have tonight.  
  
Q. Before you play you see that the team -- the bracket is kind of laid
out. Was there a bump, now it's laid out for us, just take advantage of
tonight and tomorrow maybe becomes a little different?  
COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Right. I would love to say that and I hear you on that.
But I think this team is just whoever is in front of us, let's go. And I feel
strongly that the team thinks they could have won the Mountain West. And we
were, kind of like I said, mad about losing to a couple of teams that we
shouldn't have. And they're excited about the tournament. And they're like,
bring it, it doesn't matter who we play against.  
  
The Mountain West, I think it's a great conference this year because so many
teams are capable of winning. So we have to make sure we don't look past
anyone. And again, bring that defensive intensity that we stressed all year,
and that's when good things happen.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Natalie Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32782)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 58 Wyoming - 48  
  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: First of all, congratulations to Fresno State. I thought
they were the aggressor tonight, right from the start. Had us back on our
heels and always in short shot clock situations. And I thought that
offensively we really struggled to get a good look at the basket. And that's a
credit to Fresno State.  
  
I'm pleased with the way we ended up competing right through to the end. When
you get down the way we were, things aren't going your way for three quarters,
some teams will just have a tendency to just finish out the night and we
weren't going to let that happen. To get it close back down to seven points is
a testament to the fight these kids have had all year.  
  
There's a number of people that really wondered after we lost Liv Roberts if
we'd ever win again. And to this group, they ended up going 3-1 after Liv went
down, and found a way just to be able to keep competing and making plays. And
tonight we just came up short. But I'm very proud of what they've been able to
accomplish all year long.  
  
But as I said, give Fresno State credit. They played as the aggressor. Played
very well. But it's just another learning experience for a young group. I know
I looked at it one time, I had two freshmen, two sophomores, and a junior on
the floor. And they were learning what it's all about to play in the Mountain
West Tournament.  
  
Q. What was the difference in the fourth quarter, where you were able to
get some offense going, where the first three quarters were tough, what
changed, I guess?  
NATALIE BAKER: I'll just say our fight. We don't give in, and yeah, there was
a chance for us to give in when you're down 20. As long as there's time on the
clock we're going to fight. And just in the fourth quarter we were just trying
to fight as hard as we could. We weren't going to give up. And the ball didn't
drop our way.  
  
Q. The first three quarters there, what were they doing so well on
defense to kind of set you guys off on offense?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: I can answer that one for you. I think one of the things
is their press really slowed us down. We took too much time to get the ball
across half court. And by doing that you're caught in a short shot clock
situation. And that's not how we play best. We're very much an oriented
emotion team, make the right decisions, but we need more time. And so I would
say their pressure up front to keep us in that short clock situation.  
  
Q. I know there's still some season left, and you finished second in
this conference, there's probably a postseason opportunity. Are you looking
forward to whatever that may be, and to still be part of this team and let
them keep playing?  
COACH JOE LEGERSKI: One of the things I told them in the locker room, the
tournament lasts for three or four days. In our case one night. You put four
months in, that's what you get measured by.  
  
This team was picked 8th. We had so many question marks coming into this
season, trying to figure out who our point guard was going to be, who the
leader of this team was actually going to be. And I think from day one they
bought into wanting to play defense. I even thought tonight we played well
defensively. But I know our offense was always going to be a challenge for us.  
  
And I thought tonight really showed not having our leader in Liv Roberts. She
was one that's been able to settle us down throughout the whole season. And
we're looking forward to it. This league was the 13th, 14th best league in the
country, to finish second in this league is a real credit to this group and
what they've accomplished, and now we sit and wait and hope there's a
possibility of playing in the WNIT, and we look forward as competitors to be
able to want to play again.  
  
Q. No. 4 on their team seemed to have some success inside. Was it tough
to match her size inside, especially with some of the foul trouble early on?  
NATALIE BAKER: Yeah, she's an all-conference player and all-defensive player,
and credit to her because she had an amazing game. And I would -- yeah, the
matchup was definitely a mismatch at some points, Bailee getting in foul
trouble didn't help us out in any way. But credit to her. Great player.

COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Well, we anticipated a very close game because we
thought we should have won down here two months ago and then we won in our
place. So we anticipated a close game.  
  
And I can tell the UNLV girls were ready. They had a good warmup period. The
base denominator, our point guard didn't play. And our point guard handled the
game in the last two games for us. We played the point guard position with our
2's and 3's all night long. We had no ball handling.  
  
They seized on it, like a good team does. They saw where our weakness was and
went after our ball handlers, and we just couldn't handle the pressure. Eliza
West, our low point guard, freshman player of the year, really handled the
game up in Logan. She broke her hand that night, and we've been trying to
cover it. And 10 minutes in the game tonight, she really hurt it. That's why
she only had 10 minutes.  
  
It's a sad ending for our team. Very, very young, sophomore, freshman up here.
Most years we started the youngest lineup in the country, all Division I.  
  
I'm proud of our team. We had a good year. We thought we were going to win
tonight. But we were severely handicapped, we couldn't handle the ball. A good
team will seize upon a weakness and exploit it. And UNLV did a very good job
with the pressure on our ball handlers.  
  
Q. I notice Eliza didn't play much in the second half. Did something
happen that made her hand worse?  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: It was a broken hand coming into the game, from the
UNLV game. She got her hand stuck in a jersey, and got her little finger
separated from her ring finger and snapped the bone right there. And tonight
injured it one step further. She's a little warrior.  
  
Eliza was player of the year freshman, Shannon was all-freshman team, and
Rachel was all-conference. Eliza couldn't go, bless her heart, couldn't go. We
disguised her against Air Force, gave a shot tonight. Something happened, I
don't know the exact situation. Something happened, she said, Coach, it
rebroke or broke or I feel it snapping. It wasn't -- it was just a tough thing
for our team.  
  
Eliza plays 35 to 40 minutes a game and has the ball. And I know Rachel and
Shannon, their games are a lot harder to play without getting the ball, they
were expecting to get the ball. I appreciate these two, what they did.  
  
Our kids, from our perspective, it was a good season, and really fought hard
tonight, but we didn't have our quarterback. Just had to go to plan two, plan
three, and hadn't practiced much of our plan two and plan 3's.  
  
Q. Were either one of the players -- what was plan two and plan three?
What exactly was -- every timeout, what sort of things were you trying to do
alternately without Eliza in the game? What were you hoping to accomplish in
terms of schematics with your offense?  
RACHEL BREWSTER: We really just tried to keep doing what we would normally do.
Just with our backup point guards. And obviously it was tough. But UNLV did a
good job of exploiting our weakness, and they had pretty good defense tonight.
But we really just tried to stick with our game.  
  
Q. You seemed like you guys got off to a good start, and maybe that was
part of having Eliza out there. Seemed like you were hitting your shots. Was
part of it just a mindset with not having her out there?  
RACHEL BREWSTER: No, I think UNLV did a good job of guarding me. I wasn't
really getting very open very often. So, yeah, I think that's pretty much all
it was.  
  
Q. Did you feel like once they got up in double digits, did the pressure
or having to be able to score enough to come back, was it just a little bit
too much, especially without point guard in there to help you sort of run
things?  
SHANNON DUFFICY: To be honest, I think we really have dropped, it was hard not
having Eliza, of course, but we did -- like we're used to being down. We've
come back in a lot of games and won really close games. Yeah, obviously it was
really hard and it was a big difference between the scores. But I think we did
well with what we came back with.  
  
Q. Is there part of you that feels like maybe going through this
experience will be something you can draw on later on? Obviously most of you
are going to be coming back and be back for at least another two years.  
RACHEL BREWSTER: Yeah, definitely. The Mountain West Tournament is a great
experience for everyone, and especially having so many freshmen on the team.
It's a great experience for them and we have a lot to come back and work on.
We all sort of know what we need to work on now. So I think that's a really
good thing for us going forward.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Paris Baird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32775)

### [Myzhanique Ladd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32776)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 65 San Jose State - 60  
  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: You know, I think people got their money's worth today.
Colorado State was really good. My team battled. We had our moments. But I
thought a tremendous effort by both teams. Obviously we came up short, but
tremendously proud of my team and the effort put forth today. And I really
think we played a very talented basketball team and played them very well,
even though we were struggling offensively. So I was really proud of our
effort.  
  
Q. Paris, kind of noticed in the first half they really isolated on Dezz
and Jas, I think combined in the first half they had nine shot attempts. It
seemed like you had to carry the burden of being left open. Did you feel some
pressure there or were they just defending well all around as far as the first
half is concerned? Because the second half you guys found some chemistry.  
PARIS BAIRD: I think we just needed to move the ball around. We depend a lot
on Jas and Dezz, but we just needed other people to step up. And I just felt
that.  
  
Q. Yesterday seemed to be a little bit more fluid. Did you have to
change the game plan, Coach, for either one of the players? It's such a back-
to-back quick turnaround, and as far as the strategy, what was different about
today that you have to do differently from yesterday?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Well, obviously Colorado State is a much better
defensive team than San Diego State. We feel we can use our full arsenal of
offense against San Diego State. Colorado State played us in a 2-3 zone most
of the night, an extended 2-3. Anytime we could get inbounds we could go
against their man and we seemed to be pretty successful that way.  
  
We were prepared as you can be. We tried to move Dezz around, get her in the
high post, get her off the top. Get Jasmine some looks inside. They're the
best defensive team in our conference, and I think one of the best defensive
teams in the country. It makes it much more difficult. I thought they did a
really good job in the second half of moving, we were stagnant and settled for
some early quick threes that weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about I guess guarding Ellen, you did a
good job in both halves. How tough of a matchup is she for you who are on her
most of the time?  
MYZHANIQUE LADD: I really didn't guard her most of the time. It was mostly
Paris, keeping her from the block, where she's strong from. She knows how to
work that position. Paris did a great job. I had two minutes on her, but at
the same time I saw what Paris did, making sure she's not on her block, that's
her strongest point, she likes to do her turnaround hooks, and we prevented
that.  
  
Q. What do you think you could have done better offensively? They kept
moving their zone defense out on you guys, and you didn't seem to get the ball
on the inside in the first half.  
MYZHANIQUE LADD: I mean, like coach said, they're a great defensive team. We
tried many strategies. I mean I don't know what else to say. We tried
everything in the book. At times it didn't work. At times it did work. But I
don't think I would have wanted it any other way, because we scored. We came
back. We had great energy. We weren't going to stop.  
  
Q. If you had that energy the whole night do you think it might have
been a different outcome?  
MYZHANIQUE LADD: Is that just for me or is this for everybody?  
  
Q. I'll ask Paris.  
PARIS BAIRD: I don't think it was more the energy. We had energy from the
start. I think it was just being stagnant in offense and their 2-3, we don't
get that look a lot from other teams. So that hurt us a little bit. So that
was it. We never quit and that's what I loved about playing today.  
  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Colorado State obviously has great length. Their zone
versus what another zone might look like, it kind of gets you to stand around
a little bit and we've struggled with that against them at our place.  
  
But the fact that we could come back on this team and got something going and
put some pressure on them. We just couldn't get over the hump. If we could
have gotten past that one or two possessions. But when we needed to score and
tie it up, we didn't, and then they'd go down and get a second possession. It
kept extending it to the five, and we cut it to the one possession. If we
could have gotten over the hump we could have closed it out. But obviously
they made the plays when they needed to.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2017

  

### [Mike Bradbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32780)

### [Laneah Bryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32781)

### [Cherise Beynon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30475)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 64 New Mexico - 62  
  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: Well, it was the game that we expected. We felt like it
would go down to the last possession. It did up there. They hit a shot at the
buzzer or with a second or two, the .7, I think up there today. They hit one
with 1.1.  
  
So it was the game, I think, we expected and probably everybody else. I was
really proud of how our kids played and how hard they played and how we
fought. Once again we come up a basket short.  
  
We've had four of these in the last two and a half weeks that we've lost four
games at the buzzer, on the last shot. Not the last possession, the last shot.
And the way our kids continue -- and it was all against the top three teams.  
  
The way our kids continued to bounce back and practice well and come out and
play the next one and play the next one, you know, that's what made this group
special. We got down to bare bones in players. They continued to fight and put
us in this position.  
  
Q. How reminiscent was it to the Boise State game a couple of weeks
ago?  
CHERISE BEYNON: It was like Coach said, we knew it was going to be almost the
same game, last possessions of the game. So it sucks. It hurts that it came
down to the same way as last game.  
  
Give credit to Boise, they're a really good team. We've had four games like
this. We tried. We played really hard. It just wasn't our game today.  
  
Q. You guys, as Coach said, bare bones, you guys don't have a whole lot
of bodies left at the end of the season. And you guys play a style that's up
and down, and you obviously fight hard and were running like crazy. How much
at the end of the game, how tired are you guys or are you not feeling it? Is
the adrenaline taking over at that moment?  
LANEAH BRYAN: We feel it, but like you said, they're not going to change the
way they play just because we're down players. We had to step up, next man up
and played as hard as we could, and I thought we did that today.  
  
Q. Boise State was able to keep up with you. How were they able to keep
up with that quick pace? If you could talk about what you guys saw on that
final play.  
CHERISE BEYNON: Boise State also likes to play fast. They like to get up and
down. We knew it was going to be a fast-paced game on both ends of the floor.
They run in transition, we run in transition. On that last play of that shot
we did our defensive assignment. We did what we needed to do, no foul, and
Brooke just got the shot off. There's nothing we could have done better.
Nothing we could have did to prevent the shot. We played defense and that's
all we can say.  
  
Q. The first year with Coach Bradbury, just summing things up, how would
you evaluate the season under him?  
LANEAH BRYAN: Well, like you said, the pace changed a lot. But we learned a
lot, me personally, I thought I learned a lot this year. We did have some
bumps in the road with injuries, but other than that I thought it was a good
year.  
  
CHERISE BEYNON: It was a whole new system we all had to learn. We had to learn
us, we had to learn them. It turned out to be better than what we thought this
year. Being down players, we still proved to people that we can still play.  
  
He changed a lot of our mind sets to work hard every day in practice, and I
think that was the biggest thing, like no matter what, nobody really cares.
Every game, we have to focus on that game and play hard every day or it's not
going to matter to us.  
  
Q. With 7:41 left you guys take a five-point lead, 57-52, you went on a
run. There was a media timeout in there. And from about the final 7 1/2
minutes until that three, you guys shot 1 for 9. Were they doing something
different, were the shots just not falling, what caused the struggles in that
stretch?  
CHERISE BEYNON: I think we weren't getting the stops. We were doing good
throughout the entire game and then we were letting them drive it by us. We
just weren't hitting open shots. It happens in the game. It's a game of runs.
So if we weren't going to shoot, we had to make them not make it, and that's
where we didn't stop them a little bit, when they got back-to-back layups, the
guarding part of it. Overall we've just got to do a good job, and we have to
hit shots down the stretch.  
  
Q. The question about the 7:41 mark, you have a five-point lead, and
something seems to switch?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: Yeah, Alex got a wide open 10 footer. It rims out. Rise
got two open 3's and a layup in transition that didn't go in. We got great
shots. We got it to Richelle point blank, came up a little short. Any one of
those go in, they were all great shots. Any one of those go in, the outcome
changes.  
  
Q. You draw up two plays, because they get the warning, and saw what you
were doing. I imagine that's why you did the second one. When you draw up the
play that did go in, have you guys used that before?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: No, we haven't. We have a series of three plays that we
have for any game, last-second plays. And we used two of them at Boise last
time. We used a couple at Colorado State. Each time we use them once we put in
a new series of three.  
  
So we had one drawn up. They take a delay of game. And where that hurt us was
we had to use our last timeout to draw the next one up, because if not, we
would have got to advance it with 1.1 and then we would have been able to draw
up our last one. So then we would have got the last shot. So that's where that
hurt.  
  
Q. Their play they draw, is that something you maybe could have done
something different on?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: Yeah, we thought they were going to get her at the top,
which is why we were in man. And then we could double her at the top of the
key. She slipped down to the block. Good play on them.  
  
Our kids did everything that we told them to do, based on what we thought they
were going to do. It was my fault. We should have -- we should have been in a
different defense. But that was -- so our kids did everything right. If
there's anybody to blame for that last play it's me. We should have done --
been in a different defense.  
  
Q. Both teams benefited from the advancement in the final ten seconds.
General thoughts in the advancement of the ball. Are you in favor of that in
general?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: Yeah, I think it's great. It's a good rule. It makes the
game more exciting. There's a lot more coaching involved when you've got that.
Clearly you could see that today. They're very well coached. And we come out,
have to make a three. Our kids execute it perfect. And we get a wide open one.
Okay. So now it's tied. We're the second best defensive team in the league.
And they draw up one, after they advance it, and get it to their best player,
four feet from the basket. So you could say it was two good plays drawn up and
both teams executed them perfectly.  
  
Q. Obviously the emotions of a close game and tough losses like this,
but you coming off your first season, just maybe a quick evaluation of how
your team performed.  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: Yeah, I thought they were great. For us to be able to win
the number of games we won and finish where we finished with everything that
had happened, you know, throughout the year, I couldn't be more proud. They
were a hundred percent bought in and played hard, with the exception of one
game. We really competed every single night against the best teams in the
league.  
  
Q. They fought hard. They bought in. What did you learn in your first
year. A little bit of a different beast there?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: It is. It's the greatest thing because those people care
and they care about women's basketball. It says 1600 on here, I don't know how
accurate that is, but if that's an accurate number, I'm going to say 1550 were
Lobos fans. The support -- you've got to remember now, our men don't play for
two days. So these people came to watch our kids play.  
  
The fans are tremendous. The support is tremendous. So what I've learned about
it is that. They care about it and they expect our best effort and my best
effort and our kids to act right and do right and all that, every single
second. So that's what we try to do.  
  
Q. You see something, a foundation sort of being built? You can see
something that can parlay your first year into a pretty good run year?  
COACH MIKE BRADBURY: I think so. We've got to continue to get out there and
recruit and continue to build the roster and keep improving with the ones that
are still here and those kind of things. But there's really no reason why we
can't be good there. They've got a good history of being good. There's no
reason why we can't get back there, hopefully sooner rather than later.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Candice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32758)

### [Bego Faz Davalos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30478)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 62 Nevada - 57  
  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah, I thought we started the game off right. Came out and
I thought we scored inside well. It was nice to get some inside scoring. And
then ended the second quarter with a little bit of a run going in. I thought
we ran our transition well. And nice to have 46 rebounds. Turned the ball over
a little bit but I thought we really did a good job and just had a
determination to hang on to the ball.  
  
Q. Bego, for you, so last year you guys were up by 15 midway through the
third, Colorado State comes back, this year, first game, you're up by 9 and
they cut the lead I think to five -- no, maybe two.  
COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, three at the end.  
  
Q. Earlier on. For you, Bego, heading into the fourth quarter is where
I'm headed. 8 points, four rebounds, three blocks, did any of that reminisce
and trigger in your mind? It looked like you came out possessed and it took
over the last quarter.  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: We really wanted to win. Our focus was different. Maybe we
were determined to win, no matter what. I'm really proud of my teammates.  
  
Q. Candice, the same question, in terms of last year you guys were
seeded second. How has that stung and stuck in your mind?  
CANDICE WHITE: It stung a lot, getting all the way to the championship and not
being able to take it home. But being on the bench last year, we learned you
have to finish games here in the tournament, and I think as a team we did.  
  
Q. What did you tell them between the third and fourth quarter to
basically keep them poised, keep their calm and collected, come out and play
their game?  
JAIME WHITE: Well, again, we started doing so well at the beginning of the
game, getting the ball inside, that we needed to get that ball inside and out.
We also felt like we could attack a little bit and maybe draw some fouls. I
thought we did a good job attacking. But then we got a little bit careless.  
  
At the end of the day we've got to contest shots and you've got to rebound
defensively. A combination of getting the ball in and then defending, keeping
shooters in front of us. We knew Schmid could shoot and we knew 4 could shoot,
and keeping them off the boards. And I thought it got scary and the kids kept
their composure. And we got stops when we needed and Candice hit those big
free throws at the end. That was nice to see our kids develop in that kind of
a situation.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Stacie Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26587)

### [Geena Gomez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32755)

### [McKynzie Fort](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30458)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Jose State - 76 San Diego State - 58  
  
COACH STACIE TERRY: Obviously this wasn't the result that we wanted. But I
thought San Jose State took us out of what we wanted to do. And we got
frustrated early on. And then we started to make a couple of runs and then
couldn't quite connect on some of the easy ones we normally get. We didn't
shoot the ball very well tonight. And that's -- that was disappointing,
because I know that these student-athletes, they worked their tails off to
make those shots, and seemed like there was a lid on the basket tonight. We
knew with San Jose State, obviously being the third time we played them, they
score in bunches, and so we needed to do the same.  
  
I thought defensively we made some adjustments that kept us in the game early
on, and then kind of went away from that. But we're excited about the
potential of this team, the majority of our kids coming back are juniors,
underclassmen. So I'm hoping that next year we're talking first instead of
second.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the shooting and it did seem like you guys were
getting off decent shots, decent looks at times. But how much was their
defensive pressure just getting to you, so when you would come down and get
that shot was it in your head possibly or some of the other players' heads,
how much did they have an effect on you mentally with their defensive
pressure?  
McKYNZIE FORT: Honestly, I felt it was more on us. We had the open looks. They
like to play fast, that might have dictated our offense and sped us up. We're
a team that also tries to play fast, as well. But their defense is good. I
wouldn't take that away from them. I think it was more so us focusing on what
we do as Aztecs.  
  
GEENA GOMEZ: I completely agree. I think they sped us up, but I think we
missed a few bunnies that we normally make. Like Coach said, there was a lid
on the basket tonight.  
  
Q. What are some things that you can take, you said that you have some
positives, what are some positives that you can take from this season and that
you are looking forward to as far as the positive impacts that you see?  
COACH STACIE TERRY: Well, first off, those two are coming back, and they're a
big part of what we do. Lexy Thorderson, who didn't shoot the ball well
tonight, she's a lights-out shooter, and she's a junior coming back. Our
junior class is really special. So that's a good thing.  
  
I want to highlight our freshman Baylee Vanderdoes, she gave us a punch in the
paint. That's a great thing to give her confidence going in the off season,
helping her realize that she has a lot of work to do but she has a lot of
potential, and I think that was probably the bright spot for me is our post
play tonight.  
  
We did a good job getting her the ball, looking for her. She missed one -- she
only missed one, but I was mad because she was off balance. She's going to be
really, really good. And I'm excited to get her in the off season to obviously
get her stronger, faster, and being able to do a little more on the court for
us.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Chris Gobrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30464)

### [Mariah Forde](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32763)

### [Dee Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30465)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 46 Air Force - 40  
  
COACH CHRIS GOBRECHT: I thought that it was -- I'm sure not a fun game to
watch, but -- unless you like defense. I thought both teams just really dug in
their heels defensively and made it extremely difficult for one another. I
think that the difference in the game, and she's actually been the difference
in the game every time we've played them, is Antoina, she's been a thorn in
our side. We're so glad she's graduating. That rebound she had and the
putback, that was huge. So I just think she's a very fine player, and she's
tough for anybody to deal with.  
  
But we are out there trying to get it done with a lot of challenges. And I'm
very proud of how my team played. I think the thing I admire most about them
is their toughness; we played six people in the second half. We have had to
deal with the loss of some very key people, two starters, and a player who
probably would have been a starter, but she was injured before the season
began. And so we've been very thin. And these guys have really responded. They
have just said, Hey, whatever we've got to do, that's what we'll do. And
they've gone out and competed every single night. And I think we really have
to respect how they would compete even when it's tough, it's so tough for us
to score. We have to work so doggone hard to score the ball. And yet it
doesn't change how we go back out on the floor the next time. We never falter
from that. We just keep plugging away.  
  
And so I just -- we're way undersized and yet we just keep scraping and
clawing and trying to find ways to get it done.  
  
I thought that Dee did a great job on the boards, Mariah delivered some much
needed offense. Mariah is out there trying to play point guard for us and
score as a freshman. And Dee is out there guarding night after night after
night players 4 inches taller and 20 pounds at least heavier and bigger and
stronger, and she battles every single night and comes down the boards.  
  
The steps we took this year are significant, and we have a lot to look forward
to in the future. We're very excited about the future.  
  
Q. Dee, you played with such tenacity, very physical, as coach said. Has
to be frustrating. Was it more their defense frustrating you in terms of 1 for
13 or were the shots just not falling? Did you feel you were getting good
looks or were they stepping up and just frustrating your offense?  
DEE BENNETT: I got my usual looks, I've just got to finish more. And No. 41
had some really good blocks on me, she's a great defensive player. I have to
give her credit, too. They made an adjustment from previous games where she
was guarding me this game. I have to give her credit for her good defense. But
I didn't finish the shots that I had. They were pretty good shots my teammates
were getting me, I've just got to convert them.  
  
Q. It seemed like toward the middle of the third and into the fourth
that even though it was a close game back and forth, but at some point you
guys had stolen the momentum, you had the momentum going. I asked this of
them, were those two blocks by Antoina, was that the pivotal point, where they
just stole the momentum back, and at that point you were having to play
catchup, in terms of momentum, not point-wise?  
MARIAH FORDE: I don't know that's really like the pivotal moment. I can't
remember the exact moment where I was like, oh, we are in trouble, we need to
get this momentum back. I think it was multiple possessions, there were a
couple of times we had good defensive stops or we foul them and bail them out.
So that's what I would say is the momentum killer, is we kept failing at the
free throw line.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [ntoina Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32764)

### [Rachel Brewster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32765)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 46 Air Force - 40  
  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: It was -- as evidenced, it wasn't a very good shooting
game. I thought both teams played pretty good defense. For some reason, Air
Force just has our number, we struggle offensively. I have to credit, easily
credit Coach Gobrecht and what they do. I told on media person out here, I'm
just befuddled, how can we play better against Air Force.  
  
I've always told the girls in the locker room before a game, they play 40
minutes, very disciplined group, high-character group that just plays so hard,
inspirational. They do something against us that I can't figure out. I hope
the other teams don't watch too closely. We had three games this year, and we
struggled every game offensively against the Air Force.  
  
We had probably about five games, maybe six, gone down to the wire, and we've
won probably five out of six games, these close games together. We have to
figure out a way to win. Antoina made a big block and Rachel made that fast
break and layup. We found a way to win tonight and that's going to give us
cause for a good night's sleep.  
  
Q. Following up with what Coach said, monster block at 2:43. You come up
with another block and then a rebound and a putback. Rachel had the big points
but down the stretch, for both of you, was that the pivotal point in the game
that swung the momentum in your favor?  
ANTOINA ROBINSON: Yes, Coach told us we have to get every rebound. And that
was my focus. I probably didn't get every one. But the blocks and the rebounds
and the fast breaks, that was our main focus. So I'm really proud of my team.  
  
Q. Watching her in terms of those two big blocks and her rebound, would
you say that was a pivotal point at the end, that you needed that boost?  
RACHEL BREWSTER: Yeah, she gave us energy at the end of the game. She's doing
what she does. Getting blocks and rebounds is what she does. Yeah, it was
really good for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you had a handful of close games and it comes
down to the end. Always somebody stepping up. Were you waiting for something
to happen at that point, because you're used to it?  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: I wish I would have been that calm inside. At halftime
we told the girls we can't play worse shooting the ball, 17 points. Played
good defense. They had 16 points. We told the girls in the second half, surely
the numbers will catch up and make some shots. And the percentage did catch up
with us.  
  
But Antoina's play, those kind of plays tend to be inspirational. Kind of like
a dunk in a guy's game. There's an adrenaline rush, the team surrounds and
picks up on those same emotions. The two blocked shots, she kind of got beat
in the high post, and then she turned around and blocked from the backside,
got high really quick. They're athletic plays, but they're very emotional
plays. Probably helped us win the game, definitely.  
  
Q. So you came through in the end, what sort of things went wrong? Do
you think it was apprehension? Was it Air Force or maybe first-day jitters at
the tournament? What things did you need to shake the cobwebs? Why were they
there?  
ANTOINA ROBINSON: I don't know, coming off a bye week. We were just a little
rusty. I think everyone in the beginning was a little -- we were a little too
comfortable. And we had to pick it up a little bit. We saw the score and
thought okay, it's time to get each other up and make shots and keep playing
defense. But I think it was that bye week and a little rust.  
  
RACHEL BREWSTER: I think, Air Force, every time we played them it's been a
really close game. And I think their defense is crazy. We could hardly get any
shots off and all the shots that we did get off, fortunately they were
dropping. But they had really good defense and they did a good job of trying
to push us out of our offense. And like Antoina said, coming off a bye week,
maybe we had a bit of game rust, and maybe that's why our shots weren't going
in. But I'm giving credit to the Air Force defense.  
  
Q. Coach, Eliza had her hand bandaged, at the end kind of trying to move
it. What's going on with her hand?  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Eliza is freshman player of the year, and she's really
our heart and soul. She's typically a 35-, 40-minute player. And there's some
things going on in the hand. And so we do tape it up very heavily. And trying
to conserve her minutes. And we're hoping to be here for multiple days. And
hoping her minutes can increase.  
  
But she's a tough little girl. I like to give this little piece of trivia.
Last summer, she was the most valuable player in Australia's National
Championship rugby game. This is just a little rugby injury. But she's as
tough as they come, and she's a little bit of our heart out there. She didn't
get great stats tonight, but she had a lot of fast break plays and break in
the press. Her hand is injured, no question about it.  
  
Q. I thought a saw the bandages, was it one of those metal braces or
splints, is that what's on her hand?  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: You've got some good scouting reports over there.
Yeah, it's definitely -- there's a shell splint on it. It's very restrictive.
It's her shooting hand. And it's bandaged up pretty good. It's an injury that
is very, very painful. But, again, she's a little rugby player. And so it's
not much, don't worry about it.  
  
Q. Turnovers were lower than the past few meetings with Air Force, and I
wondered how that played in the game?  
COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: That was really to our favor. I think we had 22
turnovers at Air Force a week and a half ago. I think the pace of the game,
credit to Air Force. We like the fast break, we like the press. There were
multiple possessions on both sides that went 30 seconds. Their defense caused
us to go 30 seconds. We played pretty good defense, they're patient and they
went 30 seconds.  
  
Some of it was there's less possessions, so less chance to turn the ball over.
I looked at the stats, blocked shots by Antoina helped change the game. Low
turnovers gave us the chance to make some shots in the second half.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Jasmine Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30474)

### [Dezz Ramos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30473)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Jose State - 76 San Diego State - 58  
  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: I thought that we executed a defensive plan
tremendously well. We've had some great battles this year with San Diego
State. They were all offensive. And I thought we took a defensive game plan
and really executed. Tremendous play by these two. They didn't really have an
answer for Dezz or Jas. I'm really proud of them. And we're excited to get to
play another game.  
  
Q. Dezz, just seems to get in the flow, especially in the first half.
Sort of just domino from there. And as Coach said, they really didn't have an
answer for you. Was it to come out, get things going and show no mercy,
because that seemed to be the theme for you guys tonight?  
DEZZ RAMOS: Yeah, definitely. We knew we had to be an up-tempo game and we
thought we did that well starting the game.  
  
Q. What are the things you guys see in your team that have you believing
you can make a run through this tournament, even as an 8 seed? What are the
things you like about your team and the way you're playing right now?  
DEZZ RAMOS: I like our pace of the game we play. Especially when we're hitting
shots, we can go on a tremendous run, and I think that helps us a lot.  
  
Q. Jas, was the game plan from the beginning to work inside to you?  
JASMINE SMITH: Yeah, that was one of the big keys, I thought we did that
effectively tonight. My shooters were there to shoot the ball when I was
inside and ready to score and I did so.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive plan? You stayed down on the ground
and it looked like you guys were closing them out when they were trying to get
inside?  
JASMINE SMITH: Yeah, I just really try to help my teammates out as much as
possible on the defensive end, whether that be helping ball side. Just try to
key in on the defensive end and try to keep going.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you a little bit when you guys played Colorado State
earlier this year, it went into overtime. What was the key to that game and
can you do that again tomorrow? The things you did right in that game can you
do that tomorrow?  
DEZZ RAMOS: I think we had -- that was a while ago.  
  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: They've been focusing on San Diego State.  
  
DEZZ RAMOS: I think we competed that game. We really wanted to win. We had
great energy the entire game. I know everyone is excited to play them
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What was the key to this win tonight?  
JASMINE SMITH: Dictating the momentum early, still. Having control over the
entire game, each quarter, winning each quarter, and coming out strong the
second half.  
  
Q. Coach, I know the players answered this as far as what makes them
believe they can make a run, but what is different about this team now, this
week, in this tournament, in terms of just preparation for the postseason and
how you see them now respond? What's different this week that gives you
confidence?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Well, we have a lot of veteran players. And these two
next to me have been in this position and I think Dezz is the best offensive
player in the conference. I think Jasmine is a special one-two punch with her.
We have a supporting cast that can shoot the ball around them.  
  
They're better when we prepare less. So I think they like the opportunity to
play a lot of games and not practice, not because they don't like practice,
but because they can just play loose and free.  
  
San Diego State, I thought they executed a defensive plan, like I said, really
well. And tomorrow with Colorado State, at their place when we were
successful, we didn't give up the three-point line, and it kept us in the game
when we were struggling offensively. We didn't play particularly well
offensively, 63 shots is a low for us. We're going to be playing a talented
team tomorrow. They've never quit all season long. We've had a tough year. But
we played some people in that preseason, and I watched Mississippi State on TV
yesterday, and if you can play against those guys, you can play against
anybody.  
  
Q. Not for any other reason, but to give local girls some love, talk
about Taylor Turney, how she's improved over the course of the season, and
that little shove at the end of the game, just showing her toughness and her
meddle, she was a big-time player here at Liberty High School. Just holding
her ground right here on her turf.  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, she's done a tremendous job throughout the year.
She's playing behind Dezz, that's not easy. I know she wishes she was out
there for 38 minutes a game. She's tough. She's stubborn, kind of reminds me
as a young Dezz, she gives me a run for my money sometimes.  
  
But I think that's who she is, and that's part of it, feeling like she's not
going to back down from anybody, and I can appreciate that as a coach. We
don't want to back down from anybody. And she wanted to make sure everyone
knew she was here in the building today.  
  
Q. You were up 19-4 in the first quarter, San Diego State went on a 11-0
run. You called a timeout, Dezz hit a 3, and went on a 12-2 run. What did you
say in that timeout that allowed your team to push it out?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: I'm a really big believer that basketball is a game of
runs, especially against San Diego State, the two games we've played them.
It's been all runs, us we'd go on a run, they'd go on a run. We talk about the
fact that we popped them in the mouth and they popped us back. And we had to
go on a run.  
  
Q. Third quarter Gomez hit a couple of three-pointers in a row, cut it
to 5, and then your team was able to respond and come back.  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Same thing. I thought we lost a couple of people in
transition. To think they only hit four 3s, and two of them were in that quick
swing. We locked down on defense. I thought we did a tremendous job, that's
why we could go on our runs. We stopped that one with our defense, and were
able to score on the other end.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense on Lexy Thorderson?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: She's a tremendous shooter and she can get that shot
off quick. We talked about staying tighter and making her put it on the
ground. I thought for the most part we did a decent job. She still got up 7
3s. She can get them off fast. She took a couple off the dribble, so that
helps us be more effective.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's defense, the discipline they've played
the last two games?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, we started in at Wyoming. You're going to have to
play defense in this conference tournament if you're going to win games. I
know we can score in bunches, but we've been challenging them, asking them to
do things better and differently on the defensive end. And I thought they
responded at Wyoming, we couldn't get the ball to go in the basket, which is
unusual for us.  
  
Tomorrow it's going to be one and the same, they're the best defensive team in
the conference and top five in the country. We're going to have to battle
tomorrow defensively, as well.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, you talk about being one of the keys you like
your game plays when they're kind of loose and less maybe studious about what
they're facing. Colorado State is the team that's got all the pressure on
them, they come in as a regular season champ. Is that something you can play
up in this game, is let's just go play free and easy and hope that the
pressure gets to them, if we play our game? Do you almost overemphasize that
for this game?  
COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: I think Colorado State, with them winning it last year,
and going to the NCAA Tournament, they kind of got that monkey off their back.
I know the pressure is on them. But I feel like there's a lot of quality teams
that can win this conference tournament.  
  
For us tomorrow we're going to have to go out and take away the three-point
line, and keep Nystrom and Gustavsson off the block. Our players, if we
overemphasize too many things they get a little tight. And I just need them to
be loose. We're the 8th seed, go out, play hard and see what you can do.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2017

  

### [Jane Albright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24941)

### [T Moe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32757)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 62 Nevada - 57  
  
COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: Well, just congratulations to Fresno State. Bego had
quite a night. We didn't have a plan for her. We had plan A, B, C and D, and
none of them really worked. Her numbers, 16 and 25, First Team All Conference,
I believe. Did they announce that just before? I'll make her First Team All
Conference. I'm not sure. We certainly voted for her.  
  
Jaime did a nice job. Her guards are very unselfish. They did a really nice
job. And I felt like the first half we were pretty tentative. Most of us were
very tentative. I think that comes from just kind of the year, not being able
to close out games. Being in that one-possession game and not really being
able to make the play and get a win. And don't have the confidence that I know
this group will have next year after they have another off season.  
  
I thought it was T Moe's best game of the year, which doesn't surprise me at
all, she's had a great couple, three weeks. Most of you know what her history
is, but she didn't have one ACL or two ACL's but three ACL's, but I've never
heard of a basketball player coming back and wanting to play. And just the
fact that she has done that. And for two seasons she didn't really have an off
season. And she'll have an off season, she can get in the gym and work.  
  
And I know that next coach that Doug and Rhonda are going to hire are going to
have a lot of talent. They're great, coachable players. They didn't shoot the
ball very well today. Some days we did. A week ago we scored 108 points, and
that was a big old hoop. And credit that probably to Fresno State's defense, I
think shots were hard to come by.  
  
I just want to close by just thanking University of Nevada and the women's
basketball family there, Rhonda and Doug and Rory and Cary Groth, who brought
me here, and all the people that worked behind the scenes. This is a great
basketball conference. I know you all invest a lot in women's basketball in
this conference, and I know you talk a lot about wanting to be a two-team,
three-team league, and you've got the coaches and the players that certainly
will get it there. And I will be cheering.  
  
Congratulations to Joe for coach of the year. He had a team that was near the
bottom last year, and came back and even after Liv went down. So it was just a
lot of great things going on in this league. And I'm going to be a great
cheerleader.  
  
Thanks to all the fans everywhere. People have been so kind to me and I'm
very, very blessed to have to game. I'm blessed to have this player. All the
players, really at Nevada. We do a lot of community service. We've got great
grades and they certainly are a great group of young people and I'm very, very
proud of what we were able to do.  
  
That was a long opening statement, I know, but I guess I get to have one
tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of tell us, break down what took place in the
fourth quarter. You made that run, really had the momentum going into the
final period. Seemed like Bego took over. It just seemed like she kind of went
on a mission for that final quarter. What took place on your end, from your
perspective that you could not keep the momentum and finish the job?  
T MOE: I just think that we lost focus for a little bit. We know what kind of
player she is and that she can take over games like that, and we didn't lock
down the way we should have.  
  
COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: She had 7 blocks. I think she still leads the league in
blocks. Our guards kept thinking we could drive. We know not to do that, but
we had such trouble knocking down shots, that's kind of our DNA. She's a great
player, she almost had a triple double. She was three blocks from that. And it
just really -- give her the game ball.  
  
Q. On a personal note, T, away from the game and away from the court
will you take as far as life lessons from Coach Albright? What are some of the
things that you'll value?  
T MOE: I think the main thing that comes to mind is that there's more to life
than this game. And more than the W's on the court.  
  
I came in out of high school and was kind of ball is life, I didn't care about
anything but basketball. I had the basketball taken away from me for the first
time in my life. And then ACL No. 2 and 3 came. I think they're blessings. I
think I've grown as a person and knowing there's more to life. It's about the
people, it's about the relationships, it's about the community. It's not just
about the game.  
  
COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: And about a degree. She's already graduated. And she was
student-athlete of the month. So she's a really, really smart young lady. It
took her coming to the University of Nevada for her to figure that out. She
thought she was a who needs to study. She's kind of a nerd now, you should see
her in the classroom.  
  
Q. What are you going to take from this game that's going to allow you
to move on in life and apply those things?  
COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: We did our best. For me it's not about a game. This game
was going to happen. We were going to lose tonight or the next night or the
next night. There's going to be a last game. It's documented pretty well. I'm
just grateful and thankful.  
  
This was a struggle. It was kind of a microcosm of our season. We got looks,
and we just couldn't make them. And then we would try it again. But they never
quit. And that's really what I'm really proud of them because it's hard --
it's a hard thing when you can't score. We shot, what, 12 percent in the
second quarter, but we just kept going.  
  
So I know when I came to University of Nevada I was left with a lot of really
good players. We had -- Kim had done an outstanding job of getting players
here. And we were able to have some early success. And with a very veteran
team. This year we had one senior. And these kids are going to be older and
wiser and better. And I'm really excited about the team that we have. And I
know someone will add some people to them because the numbers are down.  
  
But I'm really excited about just that they -- this was a lot for them to
handle this last week. Every time we walked anywhere somebody had to come hug
me or give me a card or do something, and they didn't let it distract them.
They just played as hard as they could, and really tried to get that W, and
that really meant the world.  
  
Q. I didn't mean this game tonight, the game, itself.  
COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: So not literally the game. Oh, the game? The game is like
greatest, is it not? Is women's college basketball, men's college basketball,
the game is just great. Look what it does for everybody. It pays for
education. It brings communities together, whether you make 500,000 or 10,000,
it doesn't matter, you get to root for young people and watch people like Mimi
Mungedi come from Africa and she couldn't even do a figure 8 and then you
watch her get drafted in the WNBA. And you get to see growth. It's a growth
mind set. This game is a great game. And just keep putting resources in it.  
  
My school, they're just the most awesome school. You know our year hasn't been
what we wanted it to be. They chartered us home the other night to get us a
good night's sleep. They spent all that money on us rather than just saying
the season's a wash.  
  
So those kind of support, growth, community, the game is awesome. It's just
got so many great people and it's paid for education and gives us lessons to
learn and a way for us to give back to communities that really no other sport
in my opinion does as much as women's basketball, all over the country. I
mean, from Geno to the high school coach to the junior high -- there's just --
there's people everywhere that give to it and we have certainly received --
there's so many young coaches and there's older coaches and there's just --
it's just -- I mean college football is a close second. But it's still second.  
  
Basketball is a big old ball and you get to see them. You see their faces and
you see their emotions. It's the greatest game. It is. Not the NBA. It's
college. Men's and women's basketball.

# [NCAA 2017 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+2017+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2017

  

### [Terry Gawlik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33020)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Terry Gawlik, chair of the Division I Women's
Basketball Committee.  
  
TERRY GAWLIK: I'd like to thank our committee members for the countless hours
they put in the process, not only watching games but meetings that we had
across the country and the meeting sessions that we had to determine and build
a bracket and the work they'll do on the road at the host institutions as
well.  
  
The committee brings into the process the knowledge gained through watching
all these games, and I believe we watched over 1200 games. And some folks had
watched between 200 and 300 games individually.  
  
So they seek input there various groups as well, including the coaches ranking
and reviewing all the extensive team data that's provided. And also the top 16
reveal that we did this year, the three reveals, was really helpful in
building this bracket.  
  
We believe we have put together a bracket that will result in a very exciting
2017 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship that will begin this
week, continuing until we crown the national champion on April 2 at the
American Airlines Center in Dallas at the 2017 Women's Final Four.  
  
Let the games begin. We can hardly wait.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Let me ask, I heard you say on ESPN about sending South Carolina out
to Stockton. If you could just expand on that, because I don't understand the
good of the game -- that's not a thing I understand as being one of the
principles you guys go by. What I thought is that South Carolina's closer to
Oklahoma City than it is to Stockton. Are you saying that South Carolina was
seeded lower than Baylor in your guys' minds?  
TERRY GAWLIK: No. You guys, as you know, the list we gave out as the seeds was
UConn No. 1, Notre Dame No. 2. South Carolina No. 3 and Baylor No. 4. That was
the true seed line in the No. 1 seed. But when the committee has the
opportunity to positively affect site attendance and improve the experience
for the student-athlete with geographic placement, that's what we strive to
do.  
  
So we looked at this long and hard. So you start with UConn. They obviously
went to Bridgeport. And you take the No. 2 team, it's Notre Dame going to
Lexington. So then the decision was do we go and take South Carolina and send
them to Oklahoma City, which would have been in mileage closer but they're
going to have a flight anyway.  
  
And we would have made Baylor take a flight as well. So the decision was to
send Baylor up to Oklahoma City and South Carolina to Stockton.  
  
Q. Just talk for a second on the last couple of teams that got in, I
know it's not one team or two teams you guys decide on it's usually four or
so. But seems like Michigan and Virginia were the two that got snubbed most
than anyone else. Talk about the last two teams that got in.  
TERRY GAWLIK: Certainly I can talk about that. We had obviously the last four
that went in were in alphabetical order, Auburn, California, Purdue and UNI.  
  
And the First Four out were George Washington, Michigan, South Dakota State
and Virginia. In particular, you asked about Michigan. They had an overall
22-9 record, were 11-6 in conference. I think what set with the committee, in
Michigan's case, they only had limited wins in the left column. They had no
top-50 -- sorry, they didn't have any wins in the left column. No top-50 wins
at all. So no top 25, no top-50 wins, and their strength of schedule was 101.  
  
They also had a bad loss to Xavier. At the time their RPI was 207, and they
lost four out of the last five games. And as you know they lost to Michigan
State in the Big Ten quarterfinals.  
  
Q. Had one concerning Maryland. I'm just curious, if you continue
through the overall process and also specific to where they ended up, does the
fact that they're a 3 in UConn's bracket represent something that they're on
the row of 3s or zero is three? And was the loss against Ohio State, in the
committee's opinion, what cost them the 2?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Again, when the committee takes a look at all these teams,
obviously we look at the overall body of work. So their wins and loss
considered, strength of schedule, RPI, et cetera. In Maryland's case,
defending the entire body of work was really, really difficult. It was tough,
because we felt Maryland didn't test themselves as the same manner as a team
we were considering at the time.  
  
They had 117 strength of schedule and that stood out to the committee in
comparison with the top 16. And they had only three games with teams in the
RPI top 25 and 13 games against teams against teams with an RPI of 150 or
higher. So those were the factors in looking at Maryland.  
  
Q. The specifics of a loss to UConn, but a very close loss, how did that
factor in? Or was that simple one game against in this case the top team?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I think you said it best. It's one game in the whole
consideration of it.  
  
Q. I just spoke this evening with Coach Fernandez from the University of
South Florida. He feels the committee may have overcompensated for geographic
favorability at the expense of some seeding. What's your response to that?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, while I don't have specifics in terms of the question that
he's asking for, what we have to realize is once we get below the 4 line which
would be 1 through 16, then we have the ability to move teams up and down a
line to allow for matchups that we don't want conferences to face in the first
and second round or hopefully in the semifinals of the regionals.  
  
But we want to make sure that we do everything possible to look at those and
make the bracket work.  
  
Q. Talk for a second about Stanford, because obviously they couldn't
play at home. Did you guys try to keep them as close as possible to home by
putting them in Kansas State? I don't know about the other 7 seeds, but what
was the thought of making them go to Kansas State for the first two rounds?  
TERRY GAWLIK: That's a great question, and you had it right on, because they
were a 2 seed the line that we looked at was a 7 line. So we vetted all folks
on the 7 line trying to be sensitive to time zones and what we thought would
work best. And you have to figure in all the other factors in building the
bracket. So Kansas State just worked out the best.  
  
Q. And secondly, I know it's a couple days off, but the weather that's
coming in through obviously the northeast right now, does that factor at all
in what you guys do as far as trying to figure out when teams will play on a
Friday and Saturday? I know ESPN is in charge of that, but do you have any
sort of pull when teams might play with potential weather issues that may
happen?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, when we had our discussion yesterday with ESPN on, or was
that today, today is the bracket. We had it this morning. My days are all
running together now.  
  
We didn't even talk weather. In fact, we've been so locked up in our room, I
looked out at the window and it was snowing here and we didn't realize that.
But, no, we don't try to manage that, to manage around the weather. I'm sure
Shorts is trying to figure things out as we speak because they're obviously
the department that handles all the travel.  
  
So we don't try to think ahead about the weather. I wish we could. But that
would be something we can't -- so hopefully, knock on wood, everything works
and all the teams get in where they need to go.  
  
Q. The last two seasons Texas was eliminated by UConn. Do you consider
this a reprieve for Texas, not to have been in the UConn bracket again this
year, and give them perhaps a better chance to wind up in Dallas where their
fan support might help the Final Four?  
TERRY GAWLIK: First, before we start talking about that, hello. I'm so excited
to be coming to Dallas for first-ever championship being held there. I'm a
native Texan so it makes it all the better.  
  
But to answer your question specifically, we do look at past competitions, and
Texas had played UConn two times. So we did look at that and factor that in
our decision-making when we were building the bracket.  
  
Q. Does the fact that Texas might be able to bring more fans, did that
factor into the decision not to put them in with UConn?  
TERRY GAWLIK: No. We can't predict who is going to win. That's the beauty of
having a bracket.  
  
Q. Only one quick question for me. There's been some commentary about
how the committee, quote/unquote, must have overlooked our diminished
conference play when they made this bracket up. Can you comment on that as any
thoughts you might have on that assumption?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I actually don't know where that's coming from, because we do
consider conference play during the season and in the tournament. It's not the
number one factor but we do talk about games, because I think maybe perhaps
they're mishearing that we don't -- when I walk out of the room, I'll put it
this way, I couldn't tell you how many teams are in from a certain conference
or not. That's not what we look at. We take the whole body of work and do the
comparisons, and that's how we build, well, select teams and seed them in the
bracket.  
  
Q. That's good to know because you've mentioned you've watched 1200
games or whatnot yourself. I know I read that. That's a lot of games.  
TERRY GAWLIK: No, no, myself, I watch -- I almost hit 300. But as a group, the
numbers that we run is 1200. So that would mean, like, there might be five or
ten of us watching one game. So Rick keeps count of making sure that we're
watching people, and we have monthly reports on who we need to watch. And,
again, I think that top-16 ranking really helped us get an early start on it
and talk about the teams early and really get people prepared more to do the
bracket once we got here to Indy and started on Friday.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up also on a specific decision that was made. Cal and
Oregon, if you could take me through that in terms of Oregon had a better
conference record. Cal did not play as well down the stretch. Just curious
what decision-making process was to end up with Cal is a 9 and Oregon is a
10?  
TERRY GAWLIK: So from your perspective, looking at the bracket, that's where
you see them now. In order to make the bracket work, we have procedural moves
that we could make within our bracketing principles.  
  
So once we get past the 4 line, a team can actually move up or down a line
because as you can imagine it gets quite complicated in order not to have
those conference matchups.  
  
And, of course, we're always sensitive to try to put teams in venues or areas
where they can get to, and their fans in particular, can get to. So that was a
procedural move in our bracketing principles.  
  
Q. The question, and I've heard other people raise this as well is, Cal
and Oregon being the same conference, what procedurally led you to Cal being
the 9 and Oregon being the 10 in those particular spots?  
TERRY GAWLIK: I don't have all that information right here at my fingertips
right this second. But when we vet those discussions, it just happens to work
out if somebody's there on the line -- remember, you can go in -- let's say,
for instance, you could go in on the 8 line and you're in above -- and we
could move you up or we could move you down to make it work. But I'd have to
go back and look at our notes and see in particular what we were, how they
were moved there.  
  
Q. Similar to what was just asked, but in terms of Drake and Northern
Iowa, what was the circumstances that led to those two being on the same seed
line given the head-to-head competition this year? And what role did that
title game play in the conversation about UNI?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Well, we did note as a committee looking at it that UNI and
Drake did ended up on the same seed line, and I don't recall if one was above
or below the other, but, again, the same principles could apply, move them up
or down a line to make sure the bracket works. We were tracking on all the
conference championships, all the way through the conference championships,
watching games and whatnot.  
  
So watching that UNI/Drake game, that was pretty exciting. And then we vetted
the information that we had in front of us with all the numbers and whatnot
and watching the games and went from there.  
  
As a follow-up, UNI did have the two top-25 wins against Creighton and Kansas.  
  
Q. Tell us about your challenges this year and your feelings coming out
overall with the bracket. And obviously we start play this weekend?  
TERRY GAWLIK: Now I'm a little worried about the weather. I think that might
be one of our biggest challenges. Hopefully we don't have to move some games
around. But certainly as you get on this committee and it's a five-year
commitment, it's my last year, so it's been a great opportunity to get to meet
all the NCAA people and meet some good friends.  
  
But really, for the love of the game and looking at all the teams and trying
to build a bracket and being the most fair, I think that the biggest challenge
would be, I guess, certain pinch points, you'd call them, if you will.  
  
So obviously the No. 1 seed line. That always gets a lot of discussion, who is
where and how does that shake out. And certainly the top 16 now because they
get to host.  
  
So when you're going to make that 16 to 17 turn, you better have good
information and good intel and have your decision made who is going to go in
the 1 through 16 lines. And in this case obviously Stanford couldn't host, so
that was unfortunate. So then we even had to go down to the 7 line and figure
that out.  
  
And then certainly putting the last teams in and the last teams out, I mean
that's hard. That's really, really hard. I believe we had 11 teams we were
talking about for the last four slots. So somebody's not going to make it. And
that's always hard. And people can always say, well, such and such went in and
such and such went out; how did you make that decision? And we just took the
information we had, all the stuff I talked about earlier, watching games, all
the numbers. And you have 10 people in the room that all have 10 different
ideas and you work through it and you come to a vote and build a 64-team
bracket.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. FastScripts by ASAP Sports

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 84, NC State - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by North Carolina State, Coach Wes Moore along
with Dominique Wilson and Miah Spencer. We will open it up for a comment from
Coach Moore.  
  
WES MOORE: I just couldn't be prouder of our team and in particular these two
right here. What unbelievable games. What unbelievable careers they've had.
They have big hearts. They're competitive, and they laid it all out there
today. They're warriors. They're great players. I hate that it had to end this
way. Again, it's a tough one, take a long time to get over. Like I said, it's
been a good run. Would have liked for it to last a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Did you think you had won the game with that shot?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I thought so, but the refs had other things in mind.  
  
Q. Dominique, take us through when you got the ball to the time the
whistle blowed.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Coach Moore called for a pick on whoever has the ball and at
that point he wanted me to come off the screen and go to the basket or
basically try to score because the time was running down. I seen that the post
player showed big so I knew that my man was coming. So I went the other way
and I had the lane and I just shot a layup, but the refs called a charge even
though the girl was still moving. It's on them.  
  
Q. Miah, despite the big comeback that you guys had, the fouls started
to mount, picked up your fourth, at that point you probably became a little
bit cautious, looked like Brooke McCarty was fighting her way through that, is
that what happened?  
MIAH SPENCER: That's exactly what happened. The refs already called it. They
saw the second contact but not the first and one and I guess that's what got
me in trouble.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to be on the bench helplessly after that?  
MIAH SPENCER: What would you think it felt like? It was my last year, last
game. I'm a leader on the team. To end my career like that, it hurts. My team,
they still fought hard. Dom tried to make something happen, and I thought it
was a good take. I thought we won the game with that one.  
  
I mean, Coach Moore this year has been one of the best years of my life
playing basketball. They picked us 7th in th ACC, we finished fourth, beat
Notre Dame. Won at Florida State. We beat Duke. We won at Louisville. What
more could you ask for a senior season?  
  
Just unbelievably proud of my team and thankful for a coaching staff and the
opportunity I have had to play basketball at this great university. It's sad
to end like this, but pretty sure y'all know we could have won that game, too.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIAH SPENCER: We were down big at Louisville, too. But that comes with the
maturity of our four seniors, you know? Never give up. It's something we
appreciate that you can be down 20, but I know the four seniors that we have
were going to fight back and we're going to show the younger girls what it
means to have a mentality of we're capable of beating anybody in the country.
I honestly felt like that tonight and for it to happen the way that it did.
It's real heartbreaking, but I'm proud of the way my team fought today.  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I agree with everything Miah said. It just hurts. You just
feel helpless. I'm very happy with the way we fought, gave it our all. There
is nothing more Coach Moore could ask for. Nobody should go home with their
heads down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse Dominique and Miah. Thank you very much.
Questions for North Carolina State head coach, Wes Moore?  
  
Q. Coach, seems obvious, but can you address what the foul situation did
to you at the end because you were missing Spencer and big bodies up front to
challenge Joyner Holmes on that last rebound?  
WES MOORE: You're right. We had three kids foul out and they were three key
players for us. Actually, four players fouled out. Three of them were posts,
so it did make it tough. Texas has such great size on the interior, you know.
First quarter we played man and they ate us alive and so we went to some junk
defense and obviously it worked really well in the second quarter. In
hindsight, fourth quarter maybe I should have got out of it. But I had that
first quarter in the back of my head. A lot of decisions I wish I'd have made
different and I hate that I couldn't help these kids a little more.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Yeah, they're great players. First team All-ACC, both of them.
They've done it all year. Great leaders, competitors. That's what I'm afraid
of looking ahead in the future. We got some young kids on the bench that I
think are pretty good, but they don't have that warrior mentality right now
that those two do. We're going to have to get that. They've been great mentor
and they represented this university on the court, in the classroom, in the
community. Couldn't ask for more.  
  
Q. Coach, obvious question is the charge. You're this close to it.
Dominique seemed to indicate at the end that maybe the girl was still
moving?  
WES MOORE: That's the toughest call in basketball, you know? Yeah, they didn't
seem to go our way today, but that's the tough call. Until I see the film it's
hard for me to really know. I didn't have a perfect vantage point by any means
and obviously I'm a little bias. So I'm probably not the one to ask. There
were some throughout the game, block and charges both ends that obviously
impacted the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you got behind early, fairly big.  
WES MOORE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you make any adjustments after the first quarter? Did you say
something? What went in your favor?  
WES MOORE: First of all, yeah, I said something. I told 'em we were down by
probably more than this at Louisville and we know we can overcome a deficit.
We switched to a junk defense in the second quarter, and like I said, it was
effective for a while. Fourth quarter I think we should have gotten out of it,
but I didn't think we matched up with Texas athleticismwise and sizewise. But
we might have done a better job on the boards if we would have gone man-to-man
and been matched up a little.  
  
There are things looking back that I could have done differently. The last
offensive rebound on the free throw we had a small lineup in there,
anticipating her making it. I think that's the first free throw they missed in
the fourth quarter and they shot free throws well all day.  
  
So we had a small lineup hoping we could push five shooters and push it on the
floor and ended up being a bad decision on my part. Should have had some size
in there.  
  
Q. Coach, when Miah went out, what did you sense in your team at that
point being the floor leader she was?  
WES MOORE: Critical. You know, you go from a senior to eligibilitywise a
freshman. It's a big difference. Miah has been our leader all year long. You
know, it's a tough one. Fifth foul is a tough one. You're talking about a
minute left in the game, 30 feet away from the bucket. That was a tough one.  
  
It definitely impacted us, and there again, like I said, I could have done
some things differently. So I'll definitely -- felt like the kids did a great
job. They made me very proud as they have all year and those two have for four
years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Congratulations on a great season.

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 84, NC State - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas, head coach, Karen Aston, student-
athletes, Brooke McCarty and Joyner Holmes. We will have a comment from Coach
Aston.  
  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, I want to really express a lot of appreciation for
everybody that had a hand in this hosting, in particular our group here at
Texas. They do a terrific job. Most importantly, I want to thank the fans. I
thought today was a really, really terrific environment for women's basketball
and they helped us get through this one today.  
  
Lots of thanks and really, really proud of our team. I wrote on the board
ironically enough today before the game that it didn't matter what it looked
like that we just needed to win. That was a good thing to write, probably,
today. But our group never gave in. They showed a lot of resilience and
toughness and just really proud. It was a complete team effort, I think, from
our part.  
  
Q. Joyner, what did you see on that last rebound? What were your thought
processes when you saw the ball coming off the rim?  
JOYNER HOLMES: From the first shot it was great, so I thought the second one
was going to go in. But I know we do have a method on a free throw line and me
and Jada talk to each other and tell each other who is going to go first and
second and they came off my side, and I saw the defender. She didn't box me
out, so I tried to save it on the first one and it didn't go in so I grabbed
it and I put it in on the second one.  
  
Q. Brooke, you guys have been in a lot of tough games this year against
really good competition. When you're down 6 or 8 points in the fourth quarter
today did you draw upon anything from the past that, hey, we've done --  
BROOKE McCARTY: (No microphone.)  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: -- Always in every game if I didn't do my job my
teammates always had my back and they always told me regardless of what you do
go out there and have fun and the last couple of games before going into this
tournament I don't think I was having fun. I will put it as simple as that. I
don't think I was having fun. Today it was really fun and we had a great time
and seeing the look on my seniors face and letting them know this is not the
last game although we all didn't have our best game we were going to pull it
out for them.  
  
Q. Brooke, one of the plays of the game late you stole an inbound pass,
play of the day from a defensive standpoint. Talk about what you saw? What was
your job, and how do you cut it off like that?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Well, when they were taking the ball out they were trying to
get it to their point guard. I just read her eyes and I knew that whoever was
there guarding her was there until, I knew if I could get a tip, at least
maybe we could get the ball or I could get the ball and give it to them. I
think it was adrenaline rushing in that moment and knowing what to do.  
  
Q. Brooke, just as big of a play seemed to be that tipped foul. She's
got four fouls, at that point are you trying to engage her to get that 5th
foul?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. She was great tonight. She really did great for
her team, but we knew that she had 4 fouls. So I tried to engage with her as
much as I could and get her that 5th foul.  
  
Q. You said you weren't having any fun. What did you do mentally to get
out of -- I guess if it was a funk or whatever to get back to having fun?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I just listened to my teammates talk to me. Some games I
didn't fully hear them. I wouldn't tune them out, but some games I wasn't
happy with myself or my teammates. So I think I put off listening to them and
them holding me accountable in practices and holding me accountable for
whatever is going wrong and I listened to them and I went into practice with a
different mindset. Ever since then I think we all pulled together and we've
been playing hard and we pulled it out today.  
  
Q. Coach talked about how huge the crowd was. How big was that for you
guys your last game here this season to go out like that?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Me personally I think the crowd was great. I know coming in
here at the beginning of the season we didn't have that much fans. We brought
a lot of people along with us and I love playing here and I'm sad that we're
going out not playing here anymore. But I love the crowd and I thank them for
everything they've done for this us this year and they travel with us, so it's
great.  
  
JOYNER HOLMES: They've been great. Today was a great atmosphere. Who wouldn't
want to play in their own center in front of that great crowd? Hearing them
our there and cheering for us, it was a great turnout today and we fed off of
them as much as they have fed off us and we thank them for being the energy
booster for us.  
  
Q. Brooke, I think you may have the play of the day. But would you take
us through the charge? What did you see her doing and your positioning on the
floor?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Give credit where credit is due. Spencer and the Wilson kid,
they did great. They played their game and executed to a tee, but I knew after
multiple plays of them going downhill and sometimes (indiscernible). I just
knew that her going downhill as fast as she was coming I could have blocked
the shot, but I just didn't think that was the right decision at the time and
just letting her body fall into mine and I took the charge and I don't do that
often.  
  
It was a surprise for me. So when I took it and I fell and I looked at the ref
I thought they called a block at first, but I looked to the ref at my right
and he called a charge and it went from there.  
  
Q. Brooke, what does it mean for this program to get to the Sweet 16?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's a standard. We come in and work hard every year
and just this past year stringing along these Sweet 16s, it's the standard
here. This is what you do. So you come here to do this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse Brooke and Joyner. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you address -- I asked Brooke about trying to engage Spencer.
That's the sort of play she has been making for you all year, coming up with
the three-point shot, drawing that fifth foul. What has Brooke McCarty given
you?  
KAREN ASTON: She's definitely kind of a calming force for our team. You say a
little engine or whatever it is you want to call her, but that's kind of what
she is for this basketball team. I think that sometimes she tries to
facilitate and do what a point guard's job is. But I think she has grown in
the sense of understanding what is the moment where she needs to make plays.  
  
She didn't really understand that at the beginning of the year. At the
beginning, I think she tried to do too much and then as the year has gone on
she has grown into knowing what moments are best for her to shoot and really
-- I don't want to say take over, but definitely make plays when they need to
be made.  
  
Q. The size and the quickness and their strength. Talk about the ups and
downs, and did you see someone that you know will be great one day?  
KAREN ASTON: I'm assuming you're probably talking about Joyner the most of all
and definitely the other two had an impact on our game today for sure. But the
roller coaster for a freshman is pretty normal. I've never seen one that
doesn't ride the roller coaster. The thing that I've probably been the most
impressed with about Joyner is that she has never backed down from the
expectations here at Texas.  
  
In particular, the expectations that everyone had for her. She had the
typical, I would say, moments where she got some hype and then had to learn
how to handle that and stay focus and had then she went through the moments of
I'm tired and I've never been this tired before in my life and I don't know
how to get through this.  
  
But I still have been impressed with how she has handled her freshman season.
Lots of expectations. She came in here as Player of the Year from a high
school perspective. Some people go into situations where they might have
expectations, but the window of opportunity isn't there for them to have
impact like she did. She stepped into a role that was very much needed in our
team. We hadn't had a power forward since Neka graduated, really, and for her
to step in and take that responsibility I've been impressed with. Sure there's
moments when you want her to be better and more grown but she has handled it
pretty well.  
  
Q. Karen, can you address getting back into the Sweet 16? Third straight
year. Brooke called it a standard. I guess that's what you wanted when you got
here?  
KAREN ASTON: Most definitely. There were some steps that had to be taken for
us to get to the level of consistency in the way that we do things, call that
culture, standard, whatever it is that you want to call it. But most of it
comes with recruiting and most of it comes with recruiting student-athletes
that have that standard.  
  
You can have it as a coach and Texas can have it as a university and as an
athletic program, but when you recruit players that that's their personal
standard to be the best they can be then it helps you get to where you need to
be from a program perspective and she along with many others that we have on
our team have a personal standard.  
  
Q. You guys shot lights out first quarter, couldn't miss. But then the
second and third quarter things went south. How were you able to marshall your
resources and get 'em back especially with those two guards going against you
guys?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, the first quarter was really special for us, and then we
got into that good 'ol foul trouble that we seem to get into every game. I was
really proud of our young kids and the way they responded. They made shots and
made plays and then I thought the second quarter they got a little fatigued.
If you notice I had to use timeouts where I am not accustomed to using them
and that was to get them a break and get them to breathe for a second. And I
think when they got fatigued that's when they stopped paying attention
defensively and that's where they got their guards going and flip to the other
end. He went to the box and one on Brooke, and we avoid that defense when
Ariel and Brooke are in together.  
  
Speaking to the question you asked the players, there wasn't anything that we
hadn't seen this year. We'd seen that before, but the second quarter I thought
we responded with too many quick shots, not trying to get the ball inside
where we could have. Then I thought that we got into a little bit better
rhythm in the second half with an understanding of how to guard and then we
went to the triangle on Brooke and Ariel. But we did a better job of getting
them in the action and those are things I think we learned along the way in
the Big 12. Everybody threw us junk. I shouldn't say everybody but a lot of
people did. We had to handle it. That experience paid off today.  
  
Q. In the locker room when you were talking to the players you said you
can tell by the look on their faces that they were going to win and you've
said that before in a lot of close, big games. Where do you think that comes
from?  
KAREN ASTON: Today it was collective. There's times when I think it's Brooke
and Ariel or times when it's Bri and Kelsey. Today it was pretty collective.
There was engagement with all of them. They were all really encouraging with
each other. Nobody had negative body language, anything like that.  
  
I think it was maybe led by the older players, but I definitely think the
younger players at times this year have kind of felt sorry for themselves when
things weren't going their way and today they all kind of carried a different
mindset like we're just not going to let each other down and that's what
happened in postseason play.  
  
I haven't said anything about North Carolina State, but they were special
today. Those guards were really good and we couldn't help ourselves from
fouling them. We just couldn't adjust to them going downhill, Joyner said it
best. Then when we talked at timeouts about making them make extra passes and
being in help we just couldn't get there in time. I thought we made some plays
down the stretch. Audrey, Kelsey, Joyner, our posts finally made some plays
and helped us out.  
  
Q. You guys were 11 of 12 from the free throw line in the final quarter.
Talk about how big that was for you.  
KAREN ASTON: We've definitely grown up in that area. That was an achilles heel
for us quite a lot of the season. That old saying, I think Jody told me that,
don't talk about it. If you're not shooting free throws well, ignore it. It
will come around at some point. We did stop talking about it. I noticed that
about two weeks ago that we were starting to shoot free throws more
consistently.  
  
Q. Joyner said that people may have been surprised she drew the
charge?  
KAREN ASTON: It's probably the first one of her life. Let's be real.  
  
Q. How do you think she did on that play?  
KAREN ASTON: I looked at it in the locker room because obviously there were a
lot of calls that, I mean, you just look at 'em and in the heat of the moment,
I mean, who knows, you know? Blocked charge is a really hard call. The game
was probably hard to call. I would have to say that. But I did look at it and
she was set. She was definitely set.  
  
Q. You've had some really good defensive minutes from Brianna Taylor
going up against some of the best guards in the country and you were setting
offense and defense. Talk about your role players and how they did?  
KAREN ASTON: They were the difference in the game. I feel quite responsible,
really, for not managing them better in the second quarter. They got on that
run and it's kind of fool's gold sometimes and they kept shooting shots that
were quick and not great ones.  
  
I should have given them some more tools in the second quarter for us to be
better. Again, I thought they got fatigued, too, and they stopped playing
defense. That's where we lost -- we lost our lead defensively in the second
quarter, but you can't -- I thought they were all huge. Shug was confident
today. She looked like a confident basketball player and I've just been
waiting on that, because she is such a special player. Nobody has really seen
the real Shug yet because she did come in off of an ACL and she is going to be
a special player at Texas.  
  
Lashann gave us big minutes. I thought Jada gave us really good minutes in the
first half and then the last, but definitely not least I thought Audrey was
huge for us. She got a couple of offensive rebounds and she sort of -- I
thought our post players kinda stood around a little bit too much and Audrey
was the one that we were able to point to and say, okay can everybody else
give the same effort that she is on the boards? And all of the sudden she
started scrambling and getting offensive rebounds and I thought the hustle
plays and the scramble plays were huge for us and Jordan gave us good minutes.
Everybody that came in gave us something.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started. We are joined by the North Carolina
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing Texas on their home court? Sunday game,
probably a big crowd. How did playing on the road prepare you this year?  
MIAH SPENCER: That prepared us a lot because the teams that we've beaten on
the road were Florida State and Louisville and they both have great home
crowds. I feel like that prepared us for tomorrow and what's to come, but we
have to limit them, contain the dribble drive, box out, contain the dribble
drop and not let them get too comfortable. We have to control the tempo and do
the little thing to win this game on their home court.  
  
Q. Dominique, what is the challenge -- (No microphone.)  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: With Texas, like what Miah said, to stop their transition. I
feel like they're a very fast team, as soon as they get the ball they're
pushing and everyone is running, and the post player is running. So limiting
them to one shot and stopping them in transition would be the two biggest
keys.  
  
Q. You're on the road in an environment like this. What are the keys to
(no microphone.)?  
MIAH SPENCER: We know that we're going to go through adversity. We know we
aren't going to get the calls we might want to get. We know that shots might
not fall, but we have to stick together and not get down on each other or
ourselves.  
  
We have to stay together as a team to overcome the crowd that's going to be
there tomorrow. I feel like that's the biggest part, just knowing that there's
going to be adversity. We can overcome it, though, because we've been in this
situation before.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Dominique, you want to add to that?  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: She nailed it. Just to stay focused as a team. I know the
crowd is going loud and try to sign in and listen to Coach Moore the best we
can.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, I feel like we have a chip on our shoulder, like I said
the other day, because we didn't make the tournament last year not because of
the seeding this year. I feel like we had good quality wins to host, but the
committee probably thought differently. At this point, like we all talk about
it's one game at a time no matter where we're playing at. We've beaten great
teams on the road. We've been down on the road and came back and won those
games. Right now we're comfortable with the position that we're in. We've been
in this situation before.  
  
Q. Dominique, a tournament like this, quick turnaround, it's be not like
playing in conference where you get familiar with people. How difficult can
that be to have that tournament run of playing Auburn one day and Texas the
next?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I think it's very difficult, but that's when focus comes in,
just watching film, trying to read the scouting report, trying to understand
the scouting report, try to go through everything in practice and try to
understand everything even though I know we're not going to get through
everything with two hours.  
  
But just have faith in our team. That's what it comes down to and just believe
that we have the ability to beat anybody if we run our sets correct and play a
great team defense.  
  
Q. When you guys are coming out of high school, how much does playing on
television play into where you want to go? Is that part of the condition of
wanting to go somewhere?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: For some players, yes. Some players wanting to go to a
school where they can get a lot of playing time. Depends on the person and if
they want to go to the next level after college, then a certain type of school
they go to is key because they get a lot of exposure and opportunities to be
seen by scouts. I feel like it depends on the player and their motives.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's everybody's dream that's at a
Division I level. We've been working hard all our live. Us two especially I
know we have put in so much work to be where we are, and honestly we weren't
given -- we weren't McDonald's All-Americans or anything.  
  
So we definitely know we have to work for what he want, and yes, it's a dream
to be in the WNBA and to be playing with great players. So I would definitely
say yes.  
  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I always tell people if it is God's will for me. I'm not
going to sit here and stress on it.  
  
Q. How do you size up Texas' backcourt?  
MIAH SPENCER: Like I mentioned earlier, McCarty is really quick. So we have to
definitely slow her down on transition because once she gets going with a full
head of steam she is either going to the basket or making you help and setting
up her teammates. So we have to definitely pay attention to her and containing
her. She is also a great shooter.  
  
So making other people score is probably going to be the biggest thing for us,
but they have great players. But like I mentioned, limit them to one shot and
contain their transition and box out. We will win the game if we do those
three things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We will take questions at this point for North Carolina State head coach, Wes
Moore.  
  
Q. Coach, you won the fist round, now you get to play next on their home
court. Your team has demonstrated you can win. You've beat some good teams on
the road. What's the mentality for this road game?  
WES MOORE: We don't talk about home or away. We want to focus on the game plan
and what we're trying to accomplish out there. We're excited about it. We know
we've got a big challenge ahead of us. Texas, obviously well coached,
perimeter, very athletic, inside, got great size that concerns me. They're,
again, a tough match-up, no matter where you play 'em and obviously here on
the road will make it a little bit tougher.  
  
Q. You mentioned match-ups, any particular one that you want to shut
down? Their speed?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, you start with McCarty. She makes 'em go, leading
3-point shooter, 2-to-1 assists in turnover ratio. Does a great job of getting
out and pushing it. Ariel Atkins can shoot the 3 really well, can get to the
rim, great offensive rebounder. They will try to post their wings up some. So
that's tough. Holmes, tough match-up, great size, can take off with the ball
in transition and go coast-to-coast with it. Lang, again, great size there,
tough match-up. So, again, like I said, a great team.  
  
I had the chance to see them on TV a few times during the regular season when
they played Florida State I thought McCarty took over the game. It was
unbelievable what they did and other games I've watched on film since in
preparation, seen other people step up as well. Very good team.  
  
Q. Tournament situations are a little bit different, quick turnaround
games, running up against opponents that you're not familiar with. How big of
a challenge is that for you as a coach coming after a game like Auburn where
they had full-court press?  
WES MOORE: Thankful it was that way. I'm glad we had three days to prepare for
Auburn because they play a little bit different style, obviously with the
forty minutes of pressing and trapping and zone, so glad we had that time.
I've got a great staff. They had probably six or seven games clipped and ready
for me immediately after our game yesterday. In fact, that's why I left after
the first quarter. I let the staff stay, but I went back and started watching
what we had on film. Staff did a good job of having things prepared so it gave
me with us playing so early yesterday, plenty of time to look at that. We
watched film a little bit later last night after dinner and all.  
  
The thing is, you know, they're most of the time playing a lot of man-to-man
defense and doing things that we have seen most of the year, so I don't think
it will be that big of a changeover. I'm more worried about their personnel
than I am necessarily their style.  
  
Q. Obviously, the game is on ESPN nationally. When you are recruiting
high school basketball players at this level do you find that high school
players -- is one of the major factors to where they go, is it will they be on
television and is that a source of recruiting for you if you're on TV a lot,
do you sell that?  
WES MOORE: I don't think there is any doubt. They like having exposure and
especially if they're away from home a little ways. It's easier for their
families to see them play. I think about all of our ACC games were accessible
in some way or another whether it be on ESPN or whether it be on ESPN3, an
app, whatever.  
  
So we're fortunate in that respect. So this time of year I guess it is being 1
of 32 teams playing and getting that exposure. I think this time of year
people are really tuned into watching games and with the March Madness frenzy
and all that, so no doubt in recruiting it's a big factor.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Well, we've got four seniors so that helps. Then we've beaten some
good teams. You know, you beat Notre Dame, you beat Florida State on the road,
you beat Duke, Louisville, we've had some good quality wins. I think that
gives them confidence. Like I said, also we've got four seniors that last year
we were a little disappointed in the selection process, and I think they've
had a little bit of a chip on their shoulder, and the only way you can prove
people wrong is going out and performing.  
  
So I think they're excited about the opportunity. We know it's a great
challenge, a great program on their home court. But this team has experienced
winning under those circumstances, so I do think they will be confident.  
  
Q. The intimidation factor minimized because you have played on big
stages before? Do you expect them to have any sort of --  
WES MOORE: Not really. I think yesterday we had one or two feel it a little
bit, first game, coming out. But I think it helps now having game under their
belt. As you mentioned, in the ACC you're playing great teams every night just
about. So hopefully that confidence is there and we definitely have tried to
preach to 'em that we can compete at this level.  
  
Q. Coach, running down your resume you've made the NCAA Tournament a
lot. A win tomorrow I think would be your deepest run. Any personal drive
there?  
WES MOORE: No, I mean, again, I think you worry more about the process and
just getting your team prepared. Obviously, when you're at a mid-major like
UT-Chattanooga, which I enjoyed 15 unbelievable years there, you're usually
going to be a high seed in that situation and have a tough match-up and
usually on the road.  
  
We were fortunate to get by the first round, but, again, it's more about one
game at a time. I know that's boring, but one game at a time. Let's don't get
caught up too much. Just go out and prepare and play the best we can, let the
chips fall where they may.  
  
Again, this is where you want to be. This is what you work for all year. Had a
good coaching friend remind me night before last, this is what you've been
preparing for all year. Go out and have fun now. You hope that the players can
relax and have fun.  
  
Q. Coach, a little away from the game tomorrow. A lot of people
criticize women's basketball because UConn is dominant. They say you already
know who is going to win in your viewpoint. Is UConn good or bad for women's
basketball?  
WES MOORE: You know, first of all you look at the ratings, it must be good.
I'm told that even if they're in a situation where they have a 40-point lead
people want to watch 'em. From that standpoint it's good. I grew up in Dallas.
I'm a Cowboy fan. You either love 'em or hate 'em, but, still, they draw a lot
of attention.  
  
Connecticut is the same way. Geno has done an unbelievable job. People say
it's on cruise control now, but when he went there who wanted to go to
Connecticut to play basketball? He's put them on the map and built that
program. Now it's up to the rest of us here in the world to figure out a way
to compete at that level. It's tough. Again, I think this process we have now
of teams hosting and all that, I think sometimes that's a factor, too, as far
as we're wanting parity. We're wanting to get new teams up there. I think
sometimes the home court and all that is a factor in that, too.  
  
No, I think, gosh, you gotta respect and admire what Connecticut has done and
the rest of us gotta find a way to catch up.  
  
Q. Anybody from the old neighborhood coming to watch?  
WES MOORE: Had several come in for yesterday's game. I had a sister leave at
3:30 in the morning because they live a little north of Dallas, but I had a
lot of -- probably, I don't know, 15-20 people come down, probably have a few
more tomorrow. Like I said, I grew up in Dallas. I love Texas, talking about
the state of Texas, and I do like Texas football, also! Got to see Mack brown
yesterday. Talked to him a minute. That was neat.  
  
Again, it's exciting to be here. I guess my last year at Chattanooga we went
to College Station and played. Two out of the last three NCAA trips have been
to Texas, so maybe the committee is looking out for me in that respect. Let me
go home a little bit. Get some Mexican food and brisket, you know?  
  
Q. Mack gave the team a pep talk yesterday, I don't know if you --  
WES MOORE: Did he? I failed to mention it to him. I brought up the Bowl game
when I thought Vince Young was a man among boys. Unbelievable performance. I
forgot to mention to him I saw the last Red River rivalry game in the Cotton
Bowl when they played Oklahoma in the last game. So hopefully he used his best
speech yesterday and doesn't have anything left for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Back to the women's basketball issue, UConn if they go to the Final
Four this year they will basically play four home games.  
WES MOORE: Kentucky has an opportunity to do that as well.  
  
Q. For the sport of women's basketball, do they have to get away from
--  
WES MOORE: I think so. I think so.  
  
Q. What could be done?  
WES MOORE: I don't know. Again, I may be in the minority here in saying that,
because, again, I could benefit from it some day if they ever let us host. We
could benefit from it. Okay?  
  
But I do think it's tough. I think what makes men's March Madness, madness are
the upsets. That's what everybody loves, you know, when a 12 seed knocks off a
5 seed. It's a whole lot tougher to do when you got the top 16 teams hosting.
It happens. No need in crying about it. There are upsets and people do pull it
off, but I do think it's tougher.  
  
Going back to the example of baseball. Baseball let's people host the
regionals or whatever, but I don't think the home field advantage in baseball
is the same as the home court advantage in basketball. It's a factor.  
  
It's tough. You work all year for this moment and some of your kids maybe work
all their lives for this opportunity. I think it ought to be on a level
playing field. Again, there are people that don't agree. There's a lot of
coaches at the BCS Bowl that wouldn't agree because they want that home court
advantage. I do think it makes it tougher for upsets. It makes it tougher for
parity going back to what you just said. People that are on TV now in the
finals, 32, Sweet 16, they're getting that exposure. They're helping,
benefitting from it recruitingwise.  
  
So that keeps those teams going year after year whereas if you maybe opened it
up you might have, you know, some other teams able to get into that circle and
make it -- again, get that parity we keep talking about.  
  
Q. Why do you think that in women's basketball there are fewer upsets?  
WES MOORE: That's what I said, most people are on their home court.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: I think it's a factor, yeah. The men, you're playing on a neutral
site court. Again, I haven't ran the numbers. I would just say that I think it
is a big advantage, but it happens. That's why we're here. Anything can happen
on a given day and hopefully you can overcome the road game.  
  
Also, one other final note. I went to high school at R.L. Turner in
Carrollton, Texas, and that's the home of Keith Moreland. Y'all know Keith
Moreland? I was hoping I might get to see him sometime at the baseball stadium
and I was glad he's in town. I'm a big fan and followed him with the Cubs and
he was a broadcaster there for a year or two. I followed him closely and
pretty neat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas student-athletes, Brooke McCarty and
Joyner Holmes. We will open with questions.  
  
Q. Brooke, I'm sure you got to see some of their game yesterday. It
looked like guards were the strength of their team. Talk about challenges of
their North Carolina State guards.  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think they can score in all positions. You said the guards
are leading their team, but I think they can all score in every position on
their team and we just have to stay disciplined on defense.  
  
Q. Brooke, (No microphone.)  
BROOKE McCARTY: It's great to get past the first round. UCA was a tough team,
and it's March Madness. There are a lot of upsets, so we can only be
celebrating for a few minutes then we have to be focused on the next game. So
we are focused and getting ready for NC State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Joyner, Coach said you have been practicing well the past few days,
between the tournament and now. What kind of a change have you had?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I know going into the tournament we have to have a different
mindset than we came out of the Pac-12 tournament with. So going in,
practicing hard and everybody keeping everybody accountable for any layoffs
and stuff that we have in practice. Everyone is going to keep each other
accountable, and keep each other lifted up. So I knew we had to have a
different mindset going into the tournament.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOYNER HOLMES: No, like we said, just taking it one game at a time. Like
Brooke said, UCA was a tough team and we all played hard and we ended up
winning. So taking this one game at a time, doing the scouting and getting
ready for the next team we are about to play.  
  
Q. Brooke, one of the advantages for the top seeds in the women's
tournament is you get to play on your home court. Did it last year. Got it
again this year. How big of a difference is that for you also knowing that
your opponent tomorrow on the road picked up big wins against with big teams.
They're battled tested on the road?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's another opportunity to play in front of our fans
and friends and family. It is just a great atmosphere when you get to play at
home. You work all season to play at home. Getting a play here for us is a big
thing, just getting the opportunity to get to play in front of our family and
friends one more time. NC State has had some significant wins on the road, and
I think we have to focus on our game plan and I think that will be good are us
going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Joyner, in high school you obviously never played past February. Was
it a physical challenge to play into March and if so what did you have to do
to energize yourself?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Like you said, I never played past February. It is new to me.
I've adjusted pretty well. My teammates have been telling me to take it all in
and enjoy the experience, so going in with a different mindset, like I said, a
different mindset to practice, a different mindset to the games. It's been
tough, but we have been able to do so much recovery as we can.  
  
Q. I would like to follow up. Physically how have you held up with the
longer season, being able to run up and down court game after game later in
the year?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Our be strength coach is always talking about recovery, eating
right, taking care of our bodies and getting rest. We focus on that and being
a young player here I didn't focus on that when I was back at home. So making
sure I really pay attention and tune into what he's saying and doing the
things that he's asking of me.  
  
Q. Joyner, what was that first tournament experience like for you going
into the first tournament game, after getting that done does it make it easier
for tomorrow?  
JOYNER HOLMES: The first experience? Talking about yesterday? It was great. We
had been practicing for quite some time now so it was great to get out there,
and like Brooke said, play in front of our fans and on our home court because
we have practiced to play here all year. Going into the game yesterday we had
a game plan and we executed and we actually pulled out the win. So going into
tomorrow's game we have a different game plan, so taking it one game at a time
and not trying to look ahead.  
  
Q. Joyner, you're going to have a very different physical match-up
tomorrow. What challenge does that bring?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Knowing that majority of the four players that I've been
guarding they're versatile. They can pop out and shoot the three now, so
making sure I stay sound and stick to the scout and play very well. That's one
thing to focus on is playing to my opponent's tendencies.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JOYNER HOLMES: I think right now that is our motto beside hashtags and stuff
we have, but I think taking it one game at a time and not looking ahead has
been great motto for us because when we take it one game at a time we don't
look ahead and we focus on the team we are about to play and execute the game
plan and if we win or whatnot we move on from there.  
  
Q. Was there any celebration after yesterday's game?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I think it's a little bit of both. We celebrated a little bit
but got straight to doing recovery things and getting our bodies ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it's always good to get all of your players playing
time, especially a first round in the NCAA Tournament just so they can get a
feel, new players and players who haven't played at this level. I think it was
good to get them playing time and it was good for -- not saying that UCA
wasn't a good team because they were.  
  
We followed the game plan and when you follow the game plan and execute like
you're supposed to it opens up for other people to get playing time and I
think that was good for our players.  
  
Q. Brooke, you played (No microphone.) Does that benefit you at all
knowing that you've done this before?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it kind of gives you an idea of what you have to work
for and how hard you have to work just to get past any game, first round,
second round, whatever. But it also teaches to you stay in the moment.  
  
We have to focus on tomorrow's game because we're not to the Sweet 16 yet or
anything like that, so we're focused on the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.) How did that come about? How do you flip that to,
okay we're at home, we own this court?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that we just had a rough patch, and every team in
season goes through it. We're past those losses but we know that right now
it's win or go home. Just playing on our court and going out there and
executing and playing together, we have to focus on that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies.  
  
We will open is up for questions for Texas head coach, Karen Aston.  
  
Q. Different physical match-up for your team. Did you have to say to
them the rebounds aren't going to come as easy, defenders are going to be
faster than we faced in the last game? Talk about that.  
KAREN ASTON: I don't think you have to explain that to our team. The schedule
was -- aside from Big 12 play the schedule was tough enough that they
understand the level of play that we're playing at and they understand the
moments. There wasn't a lot of conversation about this is going to be tough or
it's going to be tough or anything like that.  
  
I thought our players did a really good job yesterday, even though there are
things we could have done better when you look at some of the scores and you
see teams struggle, and half of our team, almost half of our team had never
played in the NCAA Tournament game. When I reflected last night when I got
home I thought, you know, the freshmen didn't look that bad for it to be their
first game. They played in the moment yesterday, and I thought they did a
pretty good job of that and they understand what's ahead of them tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think the thing that the schedule did and does for you,
including Big 12 play, is that I'm not sure that there will be team that we'll
play obviously starting with the team we played yesterday and the one we'll
play tomorrow that we haven't seen something that you can compare it to.
That's the thing I like about playing a variety of opponents and really tough
opponents is that when you run across a team in NCAA Tournament play that
maybe you haven't seen that style or whatever. It becomes tough. I'm not sure
that there is a style that we haven't seen or a type of team that we haven't
seen this year. I think that's a benefit that we can give comparisons for our
players.  
  
Q. There has been talk about yesterday's dominant performance -- (No
microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think it was probably just more beneficial that everybody got
their feet wet, especially considering there were a lot of players on our team
that had not played in an NCAA Tournament game. I think that it was positive
for them to get minutes and even go through kind of the bad moment in the
third quarter. But that whole group I was able to reset at the beginning of
the fourth quarter and I thought they played some pretty good basketball in
the fourth quarter.  
  
Just a lot of teaching moments that you always can use as you move forward.
I'm not sure rest matters at this point. I think it's overrated. I think teams
get on runs and they forget how tired they are, and they don't worry about all
that. I don't know that it matters one way or the other. I'm sure we will both
be ready to play regardless of minutes tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've got a chance -- I noticed you were sitting court side
yesterday, that's got to be different than watching film, up-close and
personal scouting them, what struck you about North Carolina?  
KAREN ASTON: Just a really solid basketball team. As you start to get ready
for an opponent you try to figure out what are their weaknesses and how can
you attack their weaknesses? How can you take way their strengths and those
type of things? And the one thing that's striking about NC State is I'm not
sure they have a lot of weaknesses. They do things really solidly, really
well.  
  
The game plan you can tell when you scout them that they have a game plan and
they're disciplined enough to follow it. That was what was the most striking
thing to me as I watched them in person.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: I think we pumped those brakes when we got back from the Big 12
Tournament and they're still "pumped!"  
  
They're having an understanding, based on the experiences late in conference
play of how good they were when they stayed in the moment during that stretch,
and I've said that a few times here in the last week or two. I did think that
was when we were at our best, when we just talked about what are we going to
do today and who are we going to be today? We really tried to get back to
that, including in practice. What can we do today to get better? I thought
we've done a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you mentioned this before, but critics of women's
basketball often say it's too predictable at the end. What is your stance on
UConn's dominance, whether that's good or bad for the sport?  
KAREN ASTON: I mean, I don't think exposure is bad, period, whether it's what
people perceive as negative or positive that they've won so many games, people
are still talking about women's basketball and I promise you people are going
to tune in to this tournament and see what happens. So if they're bringing
notoriety to our sport you have to appreciate that. I appreciate it as a
coach.  
  
Q. If they make the Final Four they will play basically four home games.
Do you think that women's basketball in the future to grow has got to get away
from, at least in the third and fourth rounds, teams not being able to play at
home?  
KAREN ASTON: I think there is some interesting ideas being tossed around, and
I would like to talk about that more than I would that we don't need to be
playing on home sites right now. We tried a different way, and I mean, I think
where we are right now is where we need to be.  
  
But I do think there are some interesting ideas about putting all the
regionals at one site. There has been some toss around about that, and I think
there are some -- you would have to do more research probably to find the
ideas, but I do think some of them are worthy of conversation just because
everything about I think what we're trying to do is to make sure that there's
butts in the seats for the young women that are performing. That's what you
want. The student-athletes put a lot of time and effort and commitment into
what they're doing, and then they get to this stage and they want to play in
front of people. That's the reason why we are where we are, because you don't
want an empty gym.  
  
I don't want an empty gym tomorrow and we worked really, really hard to get to
play at home, and you guys have done a great job of getting it out there at
the Statesman and I think we've done a better job this year in marketing and
everything that's on our side to get a community to be knowledgeable about
what we're doing, yesterday and tomorrow. I was very impressed with the crowds
that we had on Friday. It was St. Patrick's Day, the middle of the day, and I
thought we had a terrific following yesterday. I'm expecting that tomorrow,
and that's it is what this is all about right now is that you want those young
kids to play in front of a crowd. If that's what has to happen in Bridgeport,
that's where we are right now.  
  
Q. Players may not get (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: It is. It is.  
  
Q. For the seniors, talk about finding leaders that steer the ship. What
have Ariel and the others done to lead?  
KAREN ASTON: Bri and Kelsey?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
KAREN ASTON: Honestly, I didn't say anything about it today and I probably
won't tomorrow. So I guess they would have to read this to know we're having a
conversation, but it's bittersweet for seniors and I think different ones
handle it differently. I think this has been a struggle for them to have their
last moments at home.  
  
So I'm going to stay way from that. I know that our team will enjoy tomorrow.
It will be a really fun basketball game and I think our team is excited about
playing at home. I know that Bri and Kelsey -- it will be a bittersweet moment
for them, but it will be fun.  
  
Q. A lot was said earlier in the season about how tough your schedule
was. Looking back, do you think all those tough games could be a benefit going
forward?  
KAREN ASTON: I almost think that that stuff is over now. I mean, it's
tournament play and everybody in the country that makes the NCAA Tournament
pushes that reset button and they try to forget everything that's happened
regardless if it was good or bad or hard or easy.  
  
There is a reset that happens with this. I think if you ask the players they
would tell you that they enjoyed every minute of it, regardless of whether
they won or lost because I think they enjoy playing in those venues that we
played in. I think they enjoyed playing on national television. I think they
enjoy playing against the best teams in the country.  
  
This is all about the student-athlete experience or that's what it's supposed
to be about. If you ask them, I bet you they would tell you that they enjoyed
the journey.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAREN ASTON: It's been a bit of a chess match and I think that it has been all
year long. I wouldn't even say down the stretch. That's where we bogged down.
It's been a chess match all year, in the sense of, especially once we got into
conference play teams deciding who and what they were going to try to take
away.  
  
Brooke has obviously been the focus on a lot of people's game plans. I do
think, and I think I said this earlier, we made adjustments after the Iowa
State game that I thought were really good at K-State. We didn't necessarily
make some of the shots, but I thought we made the adjustments that were
necessary. I thought we played better and looked more confident.  
  
Again, there isn't anything we haven't seen. We have absolutely brilliant
coaches in the Big 12 that are going to challenge you every night especially
because we play each other twice. So that second time around you better be
ready for someone's best shot intellectually, and it's really challenged us to
be better. Nothing will surprise this team that we see, regardless of what it
is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn. I will let Coach begin with a brief
comment.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We knew NC State was a very good team and that they
could score. We did a good job at times but we didn't do a good job enough to
stop them from scoring, and we struggled scoring as well, but we continued to
play hard, and that's who we are. We were relentless all the way to the end.  
  
Q. Thank you, Coach. We will take questions for Katie Frerking and
Janiah McKay.  
Q. For most of the game you really weren't able to force turnovers. I
think in the end the numbers were about the same. Were they better at handling
it than most?  
KATIE FRERKING: I think we weren't as aggressive as we should have been at
times. We weren't rotating like we should have been, and it's tough when we
can't get our press set up like we wanted to. So I think that was a little bit
of an issue, but, I mean, I will give them credit. They did a great job of
handling it, at times, but we needed to pick up our aggressiveness a little
bit.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KATIE FRERKING: I think we just couldn't get shots to fall. Our offense got a
little bit stagnant. We were standing around, not cutting hard. I thought we
got looks at times; we just couldn't get it to fall.  
  
Q. Additional questions for the student athletes? Can you comment on
your overall season, reaching the NCAA Tournament, your overall season as a
whole?  
JANIAH McKAY: This season, it was tough but, you know, we fought like Coach
said to the end, and I'm happy that some of the newcomers got a chance to
experience the NCAA Tournament. This is a culture that we want to continue to
fit for Auburn's women's basketball, and we want to just get back to the grind
and just keep playing.  
  
Q. Thank you. Katie?  
KATIE FRERKING: I think it was an interesting season. It was a little bit of a
roller coaster. We had some good wins, a lot of close games and some tough
losses, and it's a long season, and that happens, but I'll say I've played
here four years, and this is my favorite team I've ever played on here,
because we are relentless.  
  
And no matter what came against us, no matter what we faced, we always bounced
back, and we had 13, 14, 15 girls who just wanted to be out there, and we
loved each other, and we just played hard. It was a good season. I'm proud of
everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Why was it so tough most of the game to turn them over?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: NC State did a very good job. You're looking at four
experienced point guards, four seniors. It's very hard to rattle them. They've
been through a lot, and they did a very good job. They spread us out a little
bit, but just like Katie said, NC State gets kudos for taking care of the
basketball.  
  
Q. Did you see the NC State team that you scouted? Did they do anything
different?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No, they were the same NC State team, and that's Wes.
Wes does a very good job. He's a very good coach. He doesn't really have to
change too much of what he does. He stays grounded to what he does, and what
they do, they do it extremely well. When you've got good shooters, it kind of
helps you, a lot.  
  
Q. You didn't give up fast break points. The press didn't create
turnovers.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: They score in transition, if it's there, but usually
they're a good half court team that can put five people on the floor that can
score at any time.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on -- (No microphone.)  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: The scouting report said she was a scorer. On every
catch she is a threat to score, and that we saw.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions? Thank you, Coach.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 78, Central Arkansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: Current time is 3:44. Central Arkansas here with Coach Sandra
Rushing, also student-athletes Maggie Proffitt, Brianna Mullins, and Taylor
Baudoin. We'll open up with comments from Coach Rushing.  
  
SANDRA RUSHING: Wow. That's not how we wanted to go out and perform today.
Texas, they're big, they're fast, stronger. I just want people to know that
nobody up here or anybody in the locker room is happy with our performance
effort-wise, but that does not define our season. I'm so proud of these young
ladies and what they've accomplished. That's what they need to remember, not
today's game.  
  
Like I said, Texas, I mean, they're very solid. They're going to go deep into
the Tournament. I thought the crowd was great. Maybe we're a little nervous.
Maybe I didn't do a good job preparing them. But, again, I am proud of these
young ladies.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, we'll start with you: Yesterday we were talking about the
Texas height and 33-point difference on rebounding. Was it more difficult than
you expected? Because you expected it would be tough on the rebounding.  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think it was definitely tough. We were sending five
to the boards, and they were still able to jump over the top and get the
rebound. We knew we had to block out, and we probably could have done a better
job than we did. We definitely expected them to outrebound us. Maybe we should
have just fought a little harder.  
  
Q. Maggie, you couldn't get anything going in the first quarter.  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Definitely, it was a rough first quarter. We dug ourselves a
hole, but Coach Rushing just kept pushing us. We were going to keep fighting
until the last buzzer, but we just kind of dug ourselves too deep a hole to
climb out of.  
  
Q. Brianna, you got two quick fouls. Did that impact you rest of the
first half?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I think picking up those quick fouls at the beginning kind of
had to do with how we dug ourselves a hole the first quarter. Coach and me
talked about that all season, me not getting in foul trouble. I think there
was some bad mistakes that I took upon myself.  
  
Q. Taylor, third quarter you guys outplayed and out-hustled them. Talk
about what it was after halftime that things kind of fell your way for a
while.  
TAYLOR BAUDOIN: We went in at halftime, and Coach was talking about how we
weren't playing with a whole lot of effort and not attacking the way we
should. I felt like the third quarter we came out and just started going at
them, and things started to fall a little bit.  
  
Q. Maggie, what do you take away from when you watch Texas? When you see
them on film and then you play against them, what would you say your major
impressions are of them?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: They're a very good team. We knew that coming in. Like we
said, they're bigger, faster, and stronger, and maybe they were a little more
of all those than we kind of expected. But they're a really great team. We
knew we were going to have a battle today.  
  
Q. Were you surprised they played so many people? They kind of emptied
their bench and played a lot of people. Did you see much difference between
their starters and their reserves?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: You know, we kind of knew they were going to play a lot of
people. We feel like they kind of overlooked us. They've got a big game coming
up Sunday. We knew they were going to play a lot of people. When they subbed
and their bench players came in, they kept the tempo just as well as their
starters.  
  
Q. Taylor, if you don't mind talking about the season as a whole and
what you guys accomplished.  
TAYLOR BAUDOIN: I know this season we've been through a lot, and we just
continued to push through and get to where we were. I wanted to send the four
seniors out on top of the South, and we did it in the regular season and into
the Tournament. I just feel like we could have done a little bit better to
capitalize on our season today, but overall, I just wanted to send those
seniors out on top.  
  
Q. Bri, losing against Texas on its home floor is nothing to be shameful
about at all. What do you guys take away from this team. There must be some
positives. You played them tough for a while.  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I feel like my team, we all came together, like I said, in
the third quarter, and came out and played like we've been playing all season,
and just pulling together and playing for each other is something I can take
from this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, we'll excuse Maggie, Taylor, and Brianna. Thank
you very much. We'll move to questions for Coach Rushing.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday you had hoped your team wouldn't be nervous
or intimidated. Is that what happened early? Did they just come out? Were they
overwhelmed?  
SANDRA RUSHING: I think we were a little nervous, but also Bri Mullins being
on the bench hurt us. Her and Maggie have such good chemistry together, and
they look for each other. That's what you want out of your senior guards.  
  
I'm not blaming anything on Bri. That's not what I'm saying. We had other
people that needed to step up, and we didn't. You could tell we were out of
sync. Texas did a great job of denying Maggie and trying to keep the ball out
of Bri's hands. We could never set a screen -- we never set good screens.  
  
I just think the game was so fast early that we didn't really adjust.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it was Taylor that said something about you challenged
them at halftime. Anything in particular you said? Because they played awfully
well in the third quarter.  
SANDRA RUSHING: I just thought we were timid, not attacking the basket. I had
my freshman, Taylor Sells, who's really going to be a tremendous player for
us, but you could tell she was a little timid, and I thought she had some gaps
she could have penetrated. I thought T.B. could have penetrated, and we had to
settle down.  
  
But you could also -- you saw who was started in the third quarter, Bri
Mullins was back in the ballgame, and it's our little comfort zone there.  
  
Q. Sandra, you said you think they'll go far in the Tournament. What
level do you think they're at trying to get through the Tournament?  
SANDRA RUSHING: After getting beat 40, you're asking me that? (Laughing), A
long way then. I don't know. You don't want to have a bad game in the
Tournament. They have all the tools. They're big. They're fast. I wouldn't
mind sitting in the stands watching them. It wasn't very pleasant on the other
side over there on the bench watching them.  
  
But I think Karen does a great job. I thought their fans were great. But I do
want to say this and not putting anyone else down, we have the best fans in
the country at UCA in Conway. They were wonderful. I appreciate them coming
out today and supporting us. I thought it was great. I'm just sorry the end
result is like this.  
  
Q. Was there any weakness you thought you might be able to attack at
Texas that you weren't successful today?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, no. We missed a couple of assignments on doubling the
post. We knew we were going to have to double the post. We knew -- I mean, at
home you're going to shoot well, and we were giving them that 15-footer. We
knew who was going to shoot outside, and you could see them exchanging when we
were backing off. We didn't do a very good job of trailing 11. We got caught
up on that, and she got a couple threes.  
  
But we felt like -- we wanted to give up the jump shot and not give up all the
offensive boards we gave up. We can't help it if we're in front of them and
they're bigger and they get the basketball, but we need to be in front of
them, and we needed to win the 50-50 balls, and I felt like they had a pep in
their step there.  
  
Q. You all won the turnover battle. What were you able to do to force
the turnovers?  
SANDRA RUSHING: I wouldn't mind if it was reversed and we had 21 and we had
that score, so that's a good question. We tried to double, like you said, the
post. We wanted any time that someone got in the lane, we wanted to close it
down. Just make them pass it out. They're great at penetrating. We wanted to
stop that. Especially, I think it's fourth quarter, they got a couple drives
on us. Whether it's fatigue or what's happening looking up there at the
scoreboard, I don't know. We really wanted to keep them out of the lane, try
to contain their drive.  
  
We know they can shoot it, but you have to pick -- we have to pick our poison,
as I like to say. We were going to give up those 15-footers, but they got
several rebounds and put it back in. So it really didn't do us any good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Appreciate it. Congratulations on a great
season.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by North Carolina State. We will open it up for a
quick comment from Coach Moore and then we will take questions for the
athletes only. Coach?  
  
WES MOORE: Just real proud of the effort our young ladies gave today.
Defensively they were really locked in. These two in particular did a great
job with their match-ups. I thought we took pretty good care of the ball
against their press most of the day. I know we had several late turnovers
there. That kind of skewed the numbers a little bit, but I thought we did a
nice job.  
  
Again, it's great to get that first game out of the way. Auburn has a great
team. It was a scary game to go into knowing that they were going to press you
for forty minutes and the way they fly around.  
  
But like I said, I thought our players did a pretty nice job. In a game like
this Coach is kind of blocked out of it almost. A lot of it is up to the
players to make decisions and knock down shots, and they did a great job of
that. Again, these two seniors in particular the defensive job they did and
the way they contributed offensively, really proud. They've done it all year
long; and, you know, we'll keep, as our friend Darryl Roy used to say, we'll
keep dancing with the ones that before you can us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for Dominique Wilson and Miah Spencer.  
  
Q. You weren't happy last time they went and you couldn't go. How do you
feel about this now?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Are you talking about last year? Oh, that I didn't get to go
to LA?  
  
Q. You weren't allowed to travel.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I'm happy. Just taking it one game at a time. We knew going
in, like Coach Moore said, that they were going to press us. I think we did a
good job of breaking the press and slowing the ball down and making plays. So
I'm happy I'm playing.  
  
Q. Did you go with Arkansas or is this your first NCAA game?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: No, I didn't go with Arkansas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pretty good NCAA game?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I find myself more focused because this is your last game,
win or go home.  
  
WES MOORE: I should have told you that earlier! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Did you try extra hard to make an impression after waiting five
years?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Yeah, sure. Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you approach it differently at all?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Um, a little bit because in the ACC there wasn't -- except
Syracuse, not most teams pressed us all game, so we played differently. Coach
Moore said in the locker room we had to execute differently, ran some
different plays that we hardly run because we're not getting pressed. Then
people go back into the zone. So, yeah, I came to the game thinking
differently.  
  
Q. Was there anxiety after all these years?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: No, it was excitement. Happy to be here.  
  
Q. Miah, you're the point guard. I know your coach said the numbers
weren't great at the end, but for most of the game you handled the press. What
was the critical factor in that?  
MIAH SPENCER: Like Dom said, Syracuse, they press us the whole game, too, like
that. So I've been in that situation before, but one thing Coach Moore told us
not to do is pick up your dribble, and that's what I tried to do, stay off the
sidelines and go to the middle of the floor so they couldn't easily trap you.
Once I broke the press just looked for those that were open, drops to the
basket, kicks, shots, take my own shot, but mainly just kept my dribble.  
  
Q. You were kind of spread out?  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah, spacing was important, too, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Additional questions? At this point we will excuse Miah and
Dominique. Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Did playing Syracuse, did it help like that?  
WES MOORE: Well, they have seen forty minutes of pressure, press, and a lot of
traps and they've seen -- these kids have seen it the last three years or
whatever. So they probably were a little bit more comfortable knowing what was
coming, but it's still tough because, you know, there again, it's kinda
random. You don't know exactly when it's coming, where it's coming, so it
makes it difficult.  
  
As bad as you hate to admit it they kinda dictate what you do and you don't
like that. You would like to be the one that controls your own destiny there,
but they dictate what you do and you have to figure it out from there; and,
again, I thought they did a great job of that.  
  
Our defense gets a lot of credit. I think they had 23 points at the end of
three quarters, pretty unbelievable job, and obviously the last quarter there
they scored more in the last quarter than they did the first three. So we had
a dip there, but a lot of it goes to defending and when you get stops it's a
little bit tougher to get in that press.  
  
Q. I forget what her scoring average was for one year, but did you know
what you were getting?  
WES MOORE: Yeah. Again, I was coaching in Chattanooga, Tennessee for 15 years,
and Dominique played and went to school in Atlanta which was about an hour and
a half way. So we knew we were getting a talented player. But she as just
grown so much the last year. I think this year she has been, you know,
unbelievable on both ends of the floor. Today she did a great job defensively
on her match-up and offensively obviously she took on a lot of the
responsibility.  
  
A year ago, maybe didn't shoot quite as high of a percentage, didn't make
quite as good of decisions, wasn't necessarily a defensive stopper for us, now
this year she is all that and more. I'm really proud of what she's been able
to do the last year.  
  
Q. You remember her reaction? Sounded like she was upset that, you know,
the rules don't even allow her to go to the tournament at the time. Do you
remember what that was like for her?  
WES MOORE: Not a whole lot. Obviously, it is tough on these kids when they
have to stay behind, but sometimes a year, that's good for them. They get to
practice with the team. They learn the system, get adapted to it. It's almost
like you would redshirt a freshman, but obviously it was her sophomore year.
It is tough, but I think she is pretty happy with her decision; and I know I'm
very happy with her decision. So glad she's here.  
  
Q. Have you seen Texas at all?  
WES MOORE: I saw 'em on TV a couple of times this year. Obviously, the staff
was putting together film on them but I was more focused on Auburn. Obviously
that will change. We will watch this game here and then get back to the hotel
and, you know, go through the games we've clipped and scouting report and get
ready. Obviously, it's going to be a great challenge. They're a great team,
well coached, and they're on their home floor. All those things make it a
tough challenge, but, hey, we're glad we're getting it.  
  
Q. You both beat Florida State. Did you see that game?  
WES MOORE: I did, yes, great game.  
  
Q. What were your impressions?  
WES MOORE: Great game. Texas played a tough stretch there. They played three
or four games in a week and, you know, I know they showed a lot of toughness
and finding a way to win that game. That's a tough -- Florida State is a tough
place to go and get a "W" as we found out, too. It was a great win for us, a
great win for Texas, too. But this time of year you throw all that out of
window, start over and we'll go from there.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
WES MOORE: Well, we just did a really good job with the scout, with the
personnel, knowing who did what, knowing strengths and how we were playing
individual players. Obviously, Frerking and Montgomery are both great scorers
for them, really for that matter as is McKay. But I thought we did a nice job
of trying to limit their looks. When they did get a look I thought it was
pretty well contested and rebounding too.  
  
They're a great offensive rebounding team, so we knew we had to keep 'em off
the boards. Our guards had to help. We had three guards get 5, 7 and 10
rebounds, so that was a big factor, too. The posts blocked out and the guards
went and cleaned up so to speak, and then we knew we had to take care of the
ball against the press because that is where they score a lot too is off
transition, off turnovers. So I think all those things contributed to us being
able to defend pretty well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Appreciate your time.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 78, Central Arkansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas coach Karen Aston along with student-
athletes Brooke McCarty and Ariel Atkins. We'll start with an opening
statement by Coach.  
  
KAREN ASTON: I thought our team got off to a tremendous start today. I was
very, very pleased with our tempo in the first half. Just our intensity and
attention to detail. I thought it was something that we had worked on during
the time that we had off, and you could tell that it had carried over.  
  
Then a little bit of a letdown at the half that we talked about after the
game. We do understand that that's probably not something that can happen
again for us to advance any farther than where we were. But, again, young
team, may have gotten ahead of themselves a little at halftime.  
  
But overall, got a chance to get everybody minutes in NCAA Tournament play. I
thought that was great. Pleased with the win. It's that time of the year where
you just survive, advance, and move on and get ready for the next one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Texas student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brooke, you feel like the team showed no rust at all as far as the
first half and doing what you wanted to do?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. I think we came out and really executed the game
plan and listened to our coaches. Like she said, it had all flowed over from
practices.  
  
We did have a letdown in the second half and we kind of got away from what got
us off to a good start in the first place. So I think we just have to maintain
that energy for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Brooke, I hate to ask the smallest player on the team, but the
rebounding advantage from your vantage point, how is it that you guys were
able to dominate the paint the way you were?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think we just stuck to the game plan, and our post went in
there and they -- we knew we had a size advantage going into the game. So we
kind of just gave them confidence that, when we gave it in there, for them to
go to work because they did have a size advantage.  
  
Q. Ariel, you played 18 minutes. Do you feel like you exert more energy
in a practice than you did today, since you played not as much as you do in
most games?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I can definitely say practice these past few days has been
pretty intense. I try to give it my all when I'm out there on the floor,
whether it's 18 minutes, 40, or 10.  
  
Q. Did you know you'd be playing that little and that the minutes would
be spread out?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I kind of think I put that on myself a little bit today, too. I
think it's really good we got most of our players in and got a feel for the
NCAA Tournament. And the people on the bench, they carried over what we've
been working on in practice.  
  
Q. Brooke, 21 turnovers with Texas. Is that so many people playing in
different roles or --  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that they really stuck to their -- we knew they were
very disciplined on defense. So when we started doing things that were
uncharacteristic, they got advantages just because of our turnovers. So I
think that they're really disciplined on defense, and then we have to take
care of the ball better.  
  
Q. Ariel, I guess it's not too early to look ahead. NC State looked
really tough in the backcourt. I know you guys saw some of the games. Can you
talk about this challenge that you see ahead of you on Sunday.  
ARIEL ATKINS: They're a good basketball team. They have a good backcourt. They
have people who crash the boards. We'll start preparing for them in a little
bit here.  
  
Q. Brooke, what did Mack Brown say to you when he talked to the team?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think his overall message was basically to stay in the
moment and have fun. This NCAA Tournament should be more about the team than
yourself. When we do it together, it's going to be fun. We just have to take
it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Did he show you his championship ring?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Definitely. He said you have that for life.  
  
Q. Did he let people try it on or what?  
BROOKE McCARTY: No. It was just on his finger.  
  
Q. How did it look?  
BROOKE McCARTY: It was nice.  
  
Q. Brooke, curious that T-shirt that said "Texas Mentality" whose idea
was it, and what does it mean?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I don't know whose idea it was, but "Texas Mentality" has been
our motto all year, Texas tough basically. It's just a reminder to ourselves
that, when you put on this uniform and you go out there and step on the court,
to be tough and have that mentality that you just have to go out and give it
your all, all the time that you're out there.  
  
Q. This question is for both of you guys: Y'all don't seem too happy.
Are you all just worried about what's going on next? Are you kind of excited
that you're moving on?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think you're definitely excited, but we know that we have to
be prepared for the next team, and we have to come in tonight and be focused
in film.  
  
I think you can only celebrate for a few minutes after a win in the NCAA
Tournament. You have to turn around and focus on the next team.  
  
Q. Ariel, when you see people like Mide and Hosey that don't play a lot
contribute, how content does that make you as a starter when you see the role
players, the bench players do as well as they did?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Definitely not content. I think it happens in practice. I think
we're trying to push each other to a new level every day in practice, and I
think it's definitely carrying over for them in the games right now, and I'm
really excited for them.  
  
Q. Ariel, do you feel like you all played at a championship level
today?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Honestly, no. Not 40 minutes.  
  
Q. What do you think you all didn't do?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we got comfortable at halftime. I think we stopped
listening to our coaches. And that just happened. But we know that we have to
fix it and we have to stay connected for 40 minutes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse Ariel and Brooke.  
  
Q. Karen, I'd ask you about the turnovers. They did get a little sloppy
there. Is that a concern, or do you think you can clean that up?  
KAREN ASTON: I think turnovers are always a concern because, at this time of
the year, there's such a value that you have to have for the basketball and
for possessions. We went through a long period of time this year where I
thought we'd really cleaned up the turnover issue, and then the last couple of
games we've played, we've had some uncharacteristic turnovers. But I think
most of them are from lack of patience.  
  
This time of the year, everybody has you pretty well scouted, so you have to
get to those second and third options of offense, and I thought the first
half, we looked dramatically improved in that area. Even though we had some
turnovers, some of them were excitement, I think, from the game and from just
getting out there. So I could sort of forgive some of those in the first half
because I thought our flow was really good.  
  
Second half is where I thought the flow stopped and the discipline to reverse
the ball, it comes from relaxing, like Ariel said. It comes from the place
where they think they can kind of just do whatever they want, and it just
never works. I don't know why we continue to do that, quite honestly.  
  
Q. Just kind of feeding off of that, how do you drill it into them as a
coach that they can't do that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it's just -- I've said this from day one about our team.
They ebb and flow with their attention, and it's not -- I don't mean that
negatively at all. It's just a characteristic of this team. Therefore, our
leadership in the locker room before games, halftime, those types of things
needs to be really strong. It's still a work in progress. I think they still
don't understand how locked in you have to be this time of the year.  
  
So we talked about it after the game, and we'll continue to work on it. We've
gone up and down all year long with our focus. We're still working on it,
believe it or not.  
  
Q. Can you talk about why you invited Mack to speak. What did you take
from it?  
KAREN ASTON: We talk quite a bit, just off and on every now and then. He
always congratulates me when we do well. I asked him earlier a few weeks ago
if it he was going to be in town for a game, and he was having a nice little
vacation, I think, in Baker's Bay. So he wasn't available for a little while,
but he made it back. So I had checked with him and asked if he would come talk
to the team today.  
  
I mean, you know, he's won a National Championship. The nuggets of information
you can get from someone is always good this time of the year. I think it's
always good when you hear from a former Longhorn or someone that's been there
and done it and chasing something that you're chasing, and his words are
really good.  
  
Brooke hit it on the head. He talked about staying in the moment, being the
best you can be, being about the team -- all those things that you have to do
to make a run.  
  
Q. Talk about if you thought about what you guys have to do better
against them (inaudible).  
KAREN ASTON: Just attention, focus has to be better. We ebb and flow with our
focus. When we're good, like we were in the first half, then you're pleased
with that. I understand we're going to have things go wrong. I'm not trying to
say we have to play a perfect game, but we do need -- we can't go through a
stretch of five minutes without guarding and not taking care of the ball.  
  
And they're one of those teams which we're at that place now, where you can't
have a stretch of poor play. I think they're a terrific basketball team. I
know they probably feel like they were not seeded fairly, and I might agree.  
  
It's going to be a really good basketball game. Wes is a great coach, and
they'll be really disciplined at what they do, which leads to what we have to
be better at. We have to be more disciplined offensively. If something isn't
there, just be patient about reversing it and looking for other options. Not
taking quick shots when they're not good ones, and that doesn't mean I don't
want to push the ball, but our shot selection has to be good. Their guard play
was terrific today and has been all year.  
  
Q. Coach, on a positive note, 55-23 on the boards. You can't even
predict something like that. Could you talk about how you expected to
dominate, and that was a part of the game plan was to feed the bigs as much as
you could.  
KAREN ASTON: We definitely thought we would have -- we knew we had a size
advantage, but let me say this much. What we game planned for as far as ball
movement, the flow was really terrific in the first half. So things came a
little bit easier than I think we anticipated. And then we got to the second
half, and they started the doubling, and they started packing it in, which is
what we really thought would happen early, and we got out in transition early
and sort of maybe flowed better than maybe they expected.  
  
What I saw in the second half was what we really game planned for, and that's
what I was frustrated with was that we didn't have the discipline to do the
things that we had worked on. I thought they started to pack the paint and
double and do some things that we thought would happen.  
  
So credit to them that they -- either they made the adjustment at the half, or
their players probably made the adjustment at the half, one or the other.  
  
Q. What all did you get out of this game?  
KAREN ASTON: I think, I mean, little things you can emphasize to young players
-- I mean, we still have half a team that hasn't -- this is probably their
first experience playing in NCAA Tournament play for sure because the young
players didn't play much last year. So just emphasizing that the things, the
little things, the detail things really do matter. They can see that.  
  
You asked were they not happy? I mean, they know that they have to put
together 40 minutes to beat NC State. So they understood that they need to
play better.  
  
But a win is a win. I don't want to -- I mean, we can --  
  
Q. You're not mad?  
KAREN ASTON: No, I'm not mad. They understand. It's a win or go home.  
  
Q. You looked a little mad or irritated.  
KAREN ASTON: I was a little irritated in the third quarter, but they did make
some adjustments. Again, I'm talking about players that are young, that
haven't even been in those situations before in an NCAA Tournament. I did
think that they played much better in the fourth quarter. So they adjusted.  
  
Q. And you liked some of the moments you got from like Sutton and
Goudreau?  
KAREN ASTON: I really did. I think Audrey gave us great minutes in the first
half, but they can't help herself from fouling. I thought Mide was good. She's
a young player that's really starting to grow, and you hate it that it's
getting towards the end of season because she's one of those that the more
minutes she gets and the opportunities come, she's going to grow and grow. You
can see it.  
  
Q. Is there more (inaudible) a difference with Joyner? I thought she had
more pop in her step. She looked confident. She played well. She got 9 boards,
12 points.  
KAREN ASTON: She practiced better.  
  
Q. She practiced better?  
KAREN ASTON: She did. It does matter, and I thought that her practices were,
once she took the little break and came back, I thought she was very
determined to make her minutes count in practice. I thought her reps have been
better in practice. Young players get through that where they're just -- it's
a grind and they're overwhelmed. I did think that the reset -- and I think I
said that in the press conference. The reset for the young players was
helpful.  
  
Q. You didn't try on Mack's ring?  
KAREN ASTON: I did not. It is pretty, though. It's really pretty and shiny.  
  
Q. Was "Texas Mentality" your idea?  
KAREN ASTON: No. Actually, that's -- I mean, every school that is a Nike
school is getting those shirts. So you're going to see that throughout the
Tournament, and then they kind of add on what -- kind of what's your motto.
You know, you could see the "HAW" on the side, and all the teams had different
words they wanted on their shirts. Nike was nice enough to give us those
beautiful shirts. It's great to be a Nike school.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Brandy Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28290)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. Brandy, could you describe the defensive style of play that you guys
have?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: We like to pressure for 40 minutes, full-court press, all
in people's face, trapping them, trying to get turnovers, to go in transition
and score on the other end. We're relentless. We're not going to get out of
it. It's what we do. That's how we play.  
  
Q. Katie, you guys have come in here losing nine of your last 12; do you
feel like you're coming in here with no momentum at all, or did the break
after your conference tournament reenergize you guys?  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think it does. It gives us time to rest, and actually
gives us a lot of time to practice and kind of work on some of those things
that I think a little bit contributed to those losses.  
  
But I also think just making the tournament in and of itself and kind of
getting that news is just kind of a little extra energy and motivation. But I
mean, we're not thinking about those losses at this point. We're looking at
this as kind of a whole new season, so we're ready.  
  
Q. Brandy, I assume you guys have looked at some NC State tape; what are
the challenges you think that you have when you see them?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I mean, we play in the SEC so it's really not nothing that
we haven't seen before. They have scorers. They have an inside presence. We're
just preparing as if how we've been preparing our whole season, especially
during conference where there's threats on the outside, threats on the inside,
but we're just going do what we do regardless.  
  
Q. Will you guys have any time to look at the city, see the sights or do
anything besides just play basketball for a weekend?  
KATIE FRERKING: I don't know. I mean, right now we're just focused on our
first game. That's kind of all we're thinking about right now. Hopefully if we
can get a win, we'll see if we have some extra time, but we haven't really
talked about that.  
  
Q. Being an 11 seed suggests that you were one of the last teams in.
Were you guys nervous about that, and what was that moment like?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I think, yeah, we were pretty nervous about it, sitting
there waiting to see if our name would be called. But like you said, when you
asked the question, does that give us momentum coming into the tournament, I
think just us receiving another opportunity to get to the NCAA Tournament and
play, I think that's a lot of motivation by itself. I know as soon as I saw
our name up on the TV, me and Katie were like, oh, it's go time. We've got
another chance to play and get in the tournament, so that's enough motivation
by itself.  
  
Q. Katie, I would ask you about the defensive style you guys play. One
thing when you're in the SEC, maybe teams have seen you do it before. This is
an opponent who may not have seen anything like that. How disruptive do you
try to make it, and what do you hope to be able to do?  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think that's kind of our goal every game is to just
really take teams out of what they do. It's hard whether or not you've gone
against this press before or not to play against this style for 40 minutes,
because like Brandy said, we don't come out of it. That's what we do; that's
who we are; that's all we know. So, I mean, we think it's an advantage, of
course, when we are playing a team who we haven't played before and they
haven't seen it, and so we're just going to use that to our advantage, and we
think that's our biggest strength.  
  
Q. What did you learn from being in the tournament last year that you
guys can use and that you can tell the young ones that have never been to the
tournament?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I mean, it's one-and-done, so you have to give all you've
got for 40 minutes. You have to play hard. You have to play like you don't
want to go home. And it's a big stage to play on, especially for those who may
want to play on the next level. It's a chance for you to show who you are as a
player, and a team. Just us having experience and talking to the younger
girls, I think that helps them a lot just knowing that we've been here before,
so I think that helps the team.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, and I think the biggest thing that those of us who were
here last year can share with the younger kids is just that it's still just
basketball. It's the NCAA Tournament. It's a lot of bright lights, you're on a
big stage, but at the end of the day, you're just playing a basketball game,
and when that game starts, it's 40 minutes of the same thing we've been doing
all season.  
  
Q. Katie, you guys are in a traditionally tough conference, Mississippi
State, Tennessee, got you guys, Georgia. Does that toughen you up in a way
where once the big dance starts that you guys have been through the fires and
it's prepared you?  
KATIE FRERKING: I mean, it does, yeah, absolutely. Playing in the SEC, you
literally don't have an off-night. You're playing a good team, and I mean even
the teams who are at the bottom of the conference are still great teams. So I
think then when you come into the NCAA Tournament and you're playing the best
of the best, I mean, we feel like we play the best of the best night in and
night out in our conference.  
  
I think it's a confidence thing, but I think it's also just feeling like we're
really prepared for anything.  
  
Q. Going back to when Coach first started recruiting you and you were
part of one of the first classes, you've now started 216 combined games,
scored almost 3,000 combined points. What was the buy-in like then to join the
program and try to change where the program was at that stage to where it is
now? Any interesting stories as far as that goes in?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I know personally Coach Flo really sold it to me as being
her first recruiting class to set the foundation for Auburn and where she
wants to take this program. You could have went to the schools that already
have big names attached to that school, and I just wanted to come here and do
exactly what we're doing, help change this program around and set the
foundation and the culture of this program of being an NCAA team, and I think
that's exactly what we did. We believed in her, we believed in the program, we
believed in what she wanted to do, and that's really sold me to come to
Auburn, and now I think it's expected.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, and I think it's interesting you use the word buy-in
because that's what I think we've all done. We committed to Auburn, and when
we committed to Coach Flo it was very clear to us that we committed to a
program and we committed to a culture and a style of play, and we weren't
going to come here and be a bunch of individual players. If you've watched us
play at all, you know we don't have superstars, we don't have people going out
and scoring 30 points a game, but we play together and we all contribute and
we play our role and we do what we do, and I think that's why we're
successful.  
  
Q. How would you describe the defense you play and how disruptive it can
be to your opponents?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Probably the word that you just said, disruptive. You
know, it's disruptive. It's relentless. It's pressure, pressure, pressure,
trap, trap, trap, and that's pretty much what we do. A lot of times people see
it as just -- we just run around the floor trapping the ball. We actually have
so many defensive goes out of our pressure defense, you know, whether it's a
certain number that we want on the shot clock once a team comes over half
court. It's not just the steals, it's not just forcing the turnovers. And then
you look into the time and preparation that teams have to put in to prepare
for us. The girls don't understand that, but as a coaching staff we understand
that.  
  
It's a lot -- we have a lot of defensive goes out of our pressure defense.  
  
Q. Are there coaches that you studied earlier to pick up this style of
play, people that influenced you?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, I actually started coaching at Georgetown, so
watching John Thompson, Jr., and the pressure that he applied to teams and the
way he just wreaked havoc, as well as the coach at Arkansas. Actually it's
funny, I just watched this clip the other day of 40 Minutes of Hell, you know,
just watching that type of defense, and it's always been a way that I wanted
to play. When I first got my first head coaching job, I couldn't play that
way. You kind of have to go with what you have. But then into my head coaching
job at Georgetown, we changed probably going into my fifth year. It was just
like, this just isn't working. I'm trying to teach a 2-3 zone; I'm reading
books on 2-3 Zone For Dummies. It just wasn't something that I was used to
doing.  
  
At the end of the day, you say, you know what, just go with what you know, and
we had our kids to buy into it. And for young kids, once they see success,
then it becomes a little easier because it's tough, we practice hard, just
like Katie and Brandy said, we practice hard. It's a lot of conditioning
involved in it. So it's really something that not only do you have to buy
into, you have to believe it, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have lost nine out of 12; do you worry that your team
is coming in here completely with no momentum, or did the last 10 days of
having a break do something for you?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: You know, I think we look at those losses, and it
wasn't really anything that was bad. You know, we just -- a lot of times we
couldn't score, but we're still doing everything that we needed to do. The
majority of those games I believe we lost by six points or less, so it's like
we're right there.  
  
At this point, and I think Brandy probably said it the best, you can't go back
and live in the past. We've got a new opportunity. This is a new season. We
have to continue to do what we do and realize that it's a whole new season
right now. We can't look at what happened before because then you start to
question yourself and second-guess yourself. This is a whole new season. It's
the NCAA Tournament. Everybody at this point is 0-0.  
  
Q. I know a lot of coaches at this stage kind of turn inwardly to make
sure that they have their base and their fundamentals all squared away. You do
have four common opponents over the course of the year with K-State and Tulane
and Indiana and Virginia Tech. Have you spent a lot of time, a little time on
comparing your games with those teams versus NC State's games with those
teams?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Not really. I mean, I think we're two very different
teams, so it would be crazy to compare my team to an NC State team when we're
two very different teams. We've watched those games, but I think you really
look more at what you've done lately, especially in the ACC. We've watched
them. We've taken note. But I wouldn't say that it's a huge comparison to see
what they did versus what we did.  
  
Q. Is there a team that NC State emulates in the SEC from what you've
seen?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I think they're a little mixture of both. Their
defense reminds us a lot of Missouri. It's very much scout report oriented as
well as very good shooters. I mean, you can put five scorers on the floor at
any time, and then the athleticism compares to a lot of teams in the SEC. So
it's kind of -- I can't say it's really one opponent in particular. It's kind
of a combination of some.  
  
Q. Katie said that even the teams in the bottom of your conference are
really good. Can you say how the SEC as a whole has prepared you for this
tournament?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Oh, yeah. I mean, it'll be a fight to the end because
I think the SEC is one of the best conferences in the country. I think we're
the top. It's 14 teams, and from top to bottom on any given night, anybody can
be beat, and especially when you talk about going and playing on the road.
It's one of the toughest conferences that we're in, and that's really why we
get so many teams into the NCAA Tournament, because it's a very tough
conference, and we've got really, really good players. When we're trying to
choose the top players at the end of the season, it's tough because it's a lot
of players to choose from. You're trying to just pick -- I think it's eight on
the first and eight on the second. That's really not enough for the number of
players that we have in this conference.  
  
Q. You mentioned Nolan and 40 Minutes of Hell. Seems like back at that
time a lot of teams played that style and not so many anymore. Do you know
why? Do you ever discuss that with coaches?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I haven't really. I think it's a type of mindset.
You've got to get tough kids. You've got to get tough players. I think the
game has changed to allow us to play the way both Coach Richardson and Coach
Thompson were allowed to play back then. There wasn't as many fouls called
back then as there are now. So a lot of teams probably see that, as well.  
  
Q. Is it tougher on the road? Nolan used to sometimes stop pressing on
the road because you do get more fouls --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No, we get called fouls at home, so no, it doesn't
really matter. No, we're never going to stop doing what we're doing, no matter
whether it's home, on the road, neutral site. We do what we do.  
  
Q. Just talk about the three seniors that really made up your first full
recruiting class and what they've meant to the foundation of the program.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, both K.T., as we call it, because we have a
K.D., also, and then Brandy, they've just been three seniors that came into a
program that wasn't that great when they decided to come here. But they bought
into how we wanted to play. They bought into the future of our program. They
bought into understanding the culture that needed to be changed and the work
ethic that needed to be done to get to that level that we wanted to be, which
is right here playing in the NCAA Tournament, and for them to go back to back,
it really speaks to them as leaders and as players and understanding that not
only did we do what we wanted, what we said we wanted to do, but we also
brought some people along the way, as well.  
  
Q. There's a player on your team who I think the previous coaching staff
from NC State took at look at with Jessica Jones --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: There's two of them. They're a set of twins.  
  
Q. Focusing on just her specifically, you brought up fouls, NC State has
a foul-prone player in Chelsea Nelson, and you clearly have a foul-prone
player in Jones --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No (chuckling).  
  
Q. First off, what kind of plays give her difficulty in terms of fouls?
What is she not doing as well as what you would like, and then when she's off
the floor, how does that change the way that you guys are able to play your
defense?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if it's one play in particular that
causes her to foul. Jess will foul any play. She's just that type of
aggressive player.  
  
Honestly, just to even have Jessica there, it's no big secret, we're not a
huge team, so then when she does get in foul trouble, then her twin comes
right back in, and her twin hacks, also, so between the both of them, they
have 10 fouls to give, which is great when you think about how we play. It's
not really any particular thing that she does to get in foul trouble, and then
bringing Jaz in, her sister -- actually bringing Jaz in at the 5 actually
makes it a little quicker and a little more athletic. They're twins, but
they're very different in their play, different positions. We kind of ask Jaz
to play backup at the 5, but she's really our 3 player.  
  
Q. Flournoy is not a very common name --  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: And it's not spelled right, also.  
  
Q. Are you related to Harry Flournoy in any way?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: From the movie?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yes, he's my cousin. No, I don't know. I tell
everybody that. I don't know. First of all, let's start with this: I married
into that name, okay. I am Williams, the first one. But it's not very common
at all. I do think he's somewhere related down the line, but if you know my
husband, he tells a lot of stories, so I can't really get the true story out
of that. But it is a very uncommon name, and there's not many out there, and
it's usually spelled know and we get Flourey, Fauntleroy one time, which is
why I just go with Coach Flo.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Sandra Rushing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30739)

### [Maggie Proffitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30742)

### [Brianna Mullins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30741)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. You get the distinction of playing the host team on their host floor.
What do you expect that to be like with the crowd against you and stuff in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, we're just excited to be here. It's been a pretty
long season, but it's been a very rewarding season, too. Playing on the home
court, I feel like we're just going to have to come out focused and ready to
execute our game plan. Like any other gym, any other court, we're just going
to have to come out and play basketball just like we've done the rest of the
season.  
  
Q. Maggie, you guys played in the NCAA Tournament last year; how can
that benefit you this time?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think it's definitely going to be beneficial to us.
Kind of going back to Bri's question, we played Louisville on their home court
last year with a bunch of their fans. That was a fun experience, and I felt
like maybe we were a little kind of nervous last year, but since we've been
there, coming into this year we kind of know what to expect, and maybe we can
come out and play better than we did last year.  
  
Q. If I remember, you guys were leading that game in the second quarter.
Does that give you not hope but a thought that you can go here, you can go
anywhere and win?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, I think that definitely gives us some confidence. Coach
always tells us, last year we got too shot happy against Louisville. Maybe
like I said if we can come in a little more relaxed and just play our game and
try to execute on offense and get stops on defense and see where we are at
halftime and then maybe be able to come out better in the second half than we
did last year.  
  
Q. Looking up and down the roster, Texas has a lot of size on you; how
do you deal with that? How do you play against that kind of stuff?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, as far as the size, I feel like my teammates and I,
we can play with anybody. I feel like we have the confidence to go out and
just play the game that we've been playing all season.  
  
Q. Brianna, what challenges does playing against somebody that's four to
five inches taller than you, what are the challenges for you?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: I mean, they're bigger, like you just said. I'm sure they may
be a little stronger, maybe a little quicker. But regardless of all that, I
feel like my teammates and I have the heart to come out and just play
basketball.  
  
Q. Do you feel like it's a David versus Goliath, you go in there and
want to take down the big man, the host school, coming into a game like
this?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I'd say, yeah, definitely. Probably last year nobody heard of
the Sugar Bears. Nobody knew who they were, and we got picked to play
Louisville, and there's probably still people out there who have no idea who
we are now, and they all know who we are coming to play Texas, and obviously
Texas in the Big 12, they're a big school, obviously the bigger conference,
like Bri said, bigger, faster, but that's not going to stop us from come out
and playing basketball and just giving it all that we have.  
  
Q. Maggie, they've got a lot of good players, but any particular players
that you really have to focus on? I know, for example, Brooke is a great
three-point shooter, but any one or two players that you have to shut down?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I would definitely say Brooke McCarty. She's one that we're
really focusing on. Even all their bigs inside, like we're undersized, but I
know KJ is going to come out and she's going to play like she's 6'5", too,
isn't though she isn't her size. We've just really got to stop, like you said,
Brooke from just being able to shoot the three whenever she wants, and if we
can stop some of their other quicker guards from getting to the rim and just
be able to really stop the post from just shooting over the top, then I think
we'll have a good shot.  
  
Q. How different is your program now than when you first arrived as
freshmen?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: It's extremely different. We were the first group to ever
even come to the NCAA Tournament. We were the first group to win the regular
season and the conference tournament, so we're a group of firsts, and I feel
like we had a big part of where our program stands today.  
  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: I'll just agree with Bri. I feel like we were Coach Rushing's
first true recruiting class coming in, and I want to say there was -- how many
of us, seven freshmen? And we always joke me and Bri and Raquel Logan were the
three that made it all four years. We've just really grown so much together,
and I feel like that shows on the court with how well we play together. We're
just excited. You never know what can happen. It's kind of bittersweet being
our senior year, but we're just ready to go give it all we have.  
  
Q. I was asking the players, Texas's size, they've got a lot on you up
and down the roster. How do you neutralize that, play against that sort of
size?  
SANDRA RUSHING: That's a good question. I can guarantee you we're not going to
grow 12 inches by tomorrow, okay. But Texas is Texas, and Karen has done a
great job, and they're loaded with talent, and we're just excited about having
the opportunity to play the caliber team of Texas, and being back here at the
NCAA.  
  
My players have played extremely hard this year, worked hard, showed a lot of
pride, and I'm just proud of them. But that's a good question. You know, I'm
hoping that Texas has a bad game, but I can promise you, we're going to go in
and we're going to fight it and we're going to try to do a couple things to
disrupt them, and I don't know if we can disrupt them, but I just want my
players to go out and not be scared and not be intimidated. I heard you ask
them about the crowd, and I know there's going to be a great crowd, and it's
going to be a great atmosphere to play in front of.  
  
Q. Going off of your comments there, what are the challenges that come
with playing Texas, not just the height and the size and all that stuff, but
the fact that you're playing them on their home court and they don't have to
travel anywhere, you guys are out of your element, what are the challenges
that come with that?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, also with that, a lot of teams are having to do that.
That's why you want to host it, and Texas is hosting it, and somebody has to
play Texas, and it's us.  
  
But you know, again, it's going to be exciting. I want us to play on the big,
big stage, and we're having the opportunity to play on the big, big stage.
Especially I'm happy for my seniors. I think you heard Bri and Maggie talk
about the first -- this was my first recruiting class that's getting ready to
graduate, and they've been able to go back-to-back. I'm really proud of them,
but I'm also, on the other hand, excited that my young kids, the ones that are
going to be returning next year, they get to experience this. Nothing takes
the place of experience, and you can always bring this up: Remember, win. And
this is what we want to do every year to continue to get back to the NCAA and
have an opportunity to win a game in the NCAA.  
  
Q. Last year here in the NCAAs you played Louisville, actually had the
lead in the second quarter. How much does that game -- is that relevant at all
for your players that are back, to come into this game here?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I think it helps. Last year we were nervous, really
nervous, and I'm sure we're going to be nervous tomorrow. But that just goes
along with the game. But we had the chance to experience that last year, and
it's something we talked about all season long, about getting back to the NCAA
and wanting to experience this again.  
  
Like I said, I'm sure there will be some nerves tomorrow, but I just want to
go out and let's play hard, let's compete, and this is great exposure for us,
our program, our university, and just have an opportunity to play on the big
stage on national television and everybody is watching and seeing. Of course
we want to go in and represent the Southland very well.  
  
Q. Maggie was saying nobody knew who the Sugar Bears were last year.
Maybe they still don't. You said it's a great opportunity for your program.
For the folks in Austin, who are the Sugar Bears? What are the Sugar Bears all
about?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I think we've got the best mascot in the country, all
right, and I get asked that all the time, the Sugar Bears. Somebody asked me
where did it come from, and I said, it's just because we're sweet, Sugar
Bears.  
  
We're a program that really does the right thing. Our kids graduate. They work
hard. They represent the community and our University well. They're gaining a
whole lot of experience on and off the floor. I've got a great group of young
ladies that, like I said, I'm really proud of, and just to watch them
experience this and go through this really -- it warms your heart as a coach
because you keep telling them hard work is going to pay off, and they're
seeing the end result. It keeps them hungry to go back and want more.  
  
Q. I was asking your players the difference now in your program compared
to the first time -- I didn't know you had seven freshmen at the time. The
biggest difference with your program now as opposed to --  
SANDRA RUSHING: I didn't know I had seven, either, sorry. I was just thinking
-- I had to think back. Sorry, go ahead.  
  
Q. The biggest difference between their freshman year and their senior
year with your program.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Maturity. Absolutely, maturity. When you have freshmen coming
in, of course they're superstars, and they're used to playing and shooting a
lot, and I emphasize defense, and they bought in. That's the thing, you've got
to have your players buy in if you're going to be successful. I've been very
fortunate that this senior group has bought in, and Maggie and Bri, they have
a very special chemistry on the floor, and that has come over time by them
coming in and having to play.  
  
They've been starting since their freshman year, and that just -- that says a
lot about this program and where we started and then we've been able to bring
people in to help contribute and help get us where we are.  
  
Q. Will this be the first time that you guys have been on national TV
this year?  
SANDRA RUSHING: This year? Yeah, this year. CBS Sports, this year. But last
year, of course --  
  
Q. Is that relevant when you're recruiting players, hey, we were on
ESPN?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Absolutely, that's a selling tool, yes, absolutely.  
  
Q. You had the A &M game on SEC Network.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Oh, yes, we did.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

### [Dominique Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32680)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. What is the difference between the team that beat all these top-15
teams and the team that lost to Wake and Carolina?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: You said what's the difference?  
  
Q. Yeah, as far as the way you play.  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, I feel like the losses, we just weren't making shots
and executing properly how we did when we were beating the top-15 teams, and
that's definitely something we have to come out and do because either you win
or you go home. You can't make that many mistakes.  
  
Q. Miah, your coach has talked about he was a little disappointed the
fact that you guys had to go on the road, there were I guess five teams in the
ACC that lost in the first round; you're here 1,200 miles away. What's the
team attitude about that? What kind of attitude do you bring in here as a team
on the road?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, right now there's nothing we can do about it. The
committee has already selected where we are supposed to play, so right now we
just have to take it one game at a time. We can't worry about that we're not
playing at home or we're not playing close to home. We're here to win, so
wherever we were going to play or if we were playing at home, I mean, it
doesn't matter now because we're here now, so we just have to focus on what we
do best and just come out ready to play tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. You said you're not worried about it. Has it been a rallying point or
is there sort of a chip on the players' shoulders like we'll show them kind of
thing, on the seeding and other things?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, we've had a chip on our shoulder since the beginning of
the year because we didn't make the NCAA Tournament last year. But we knew
what we had to do. We knew we had to come out and play every game like it was
our last game, and I feel like that's what we did this season. The wins that
we got this year, I feel like they were pretty good wins, but I mean, like I
said, the committee has already made a decision. There's nothing we can do
about it right now.  
  
Q. Dominique, what do you like about this team to be able to come on the
road out here? To be able to come to Austin where you could have to
potentially beat a host team on their home court, what do you like about this
team's ability to come out here and do that?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, for one we showed that we can beat teams on the road.
When we beat Florida State, nobody thought we could do that and we shocked a
lot of people, and we beat other teams on the road, too, other than Florida
State. I'm just comfortable with our team. If we come out and just execute and
make shots, then we have a good chance.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you're aware of it, you come into the middle of the
South By Southwest music festival, which is kind of a big deal here. There
have been times in the past where coaches kind of let their players walk
around and kind of take it in, the music scene that Austin is known for. Have
you talked to Coach about all that, about what you want to do off the court?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: I didn't know that was going on. I don't think we knew that
was happening here.  
  
MIAH SPENCER: Yeah. Sounds fun, though.  
  
Q. Dom, correct my timeline if I'm incorrect. The last time NC State
went to the tournament you didn't travel with the team because it was a
transfer year?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Yes.  
  
Q. So how validating is it for you to in your last year be at the NCAA
Tournament, which was your goal when you transferred to NC State, and how
difficult was it to be left behind in your transfer year?  
DOMINIQUE WILSON: Well, it was difficult being left behind because for one I
couldn't play, and they went to LA. I was kind of mad about that. But right
now I'm just happy to be here. Like you said, one of my goals was to be in the
NCAA Tournament, which we did, and now I just want us to go on a run and just
make history for our program.  
  
Q. Miah, you mentioned the chip on the shoulder from not making the
tournament last year; what was that conversation like in the off-season, and
what was kind of the feeling like when the selection was announced that you
guys were in?  
MIAH SPENCER: Well, after the season, you know, it was hurtful because I feel
like we had a pretty decent season last year. But we had four returning
starters, and we were all seniors, so we knew what we had to do, from the
preseason to the summer. We knew that we had to work hard to accomplish the
goals that we wanted to accomplish this year, and Coach Moore just told us
like we have all the right pieces. We have everything that we need to win big
games. I mean, that just showed -- but I'm just excited to be here. It's my
last year. Like I said, we have four seniors that start, so we all know what
it takes, and we know that we can't take anything for granted right now, just
one game at a time, win or go home, and I just know that we're all excited and
just ready to play.  
  
Q. What is the difference between the team to you that's beating top-15
teams and the team that lost to Wake and Carolina?  
WES MOORE: Well, first of all, Wake and Carolina aren't bad, either. ACC is
tough top to bottom. Every game you've got to be sharp and playing well. I
think part of it is shooting the ball well. You have days where maybe you
don't shoot it as well, and I think that's important for us. We need to -- we
shoot the three quite a bit, so we need to be knocking shots down to be at our
best. But sometimes, again, in the grind of the season, maybe you don't have
quite the energy or whatever. It's just one of those days, a couple of those
games where people shot the ball extremely well against us that day, both of
those games that was the case.  
  
But I think we're still the same team. The seasons ebb and flow and you have
peaks and valleys, and you hope that you're peaking right now. You hope you
get momentum and play your best ball in March.  
  
Q. Immediately after the selection you seemed a little disappointed to
get the No. 6 seed and be sent 1,200 miles away from home. What are your
thoughts on that today, and have you talked to your team about that? Is that a
rallying point for you guys?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, you know, at this point it doesn't matter. You move on, and
we're excited about playing, excited about the opportunity, and whoever you
play this time of year is going to be very good. Obviously Auburn from the
SEC, very talented team, very athletic team, press you. One of my coaches came
right after the bracket was up said, we're talking about them pressing so
much, and he said, well, again, at least they have to score to get in the
press. After about five minutes of watching film, we realized that wasn't the
case. They press on the jump ball. They press on missed free throws.  
  
It does present some -- their style of play is a little unusual, and pressing,
falling back into zone, trapping out of the zone, we're going to have to make
good decisions with the ball, we're going to have to shoot the ball well,
those sort of things. But like I said, really, the seeding at this point, it's
a matter of, like I said earlier, hopefully you play your best basketball now
and get hot and get on a roll.  
  
Q. Have you seen anything in terms of that kind of defensive style?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, we've probably seen a few teams similar to it, but it is
unusual. That's been our main point of emphasis on handling the press, having
a variety of ways to attack it, so you have a backup plan if something is not
working. And then like I said, in their zone, 1-2-2 and they'll trap you a
lot, especially when you first get across half court.  
  
We're going to have to make good decisions with the ball and make sure when we
do get those open looks -- that's the thing, when you trap, somebody is open,
so hopefully we can find that open person and then we can knock down those
shots.  
  
Q. Auburn's style, is it something you saw maybe more in the '90s than
what you do today?  
WES MOORE: Oh, Lord, I don't know. I can't remember last week at my age. Not
necessarily. Like I said, Syracuse plays a similar style of basketball and
against them in the first half we really shot the ball well, and second half
we didn't. Again, those are going to be important factors. I just think, like
I said, there's certain teams that maybe do try to have their own style, and
Auburn is one of those. They've done a great job with it, and again,
fortunately we at least have had a few days to prepare. It would be a little
bit tougher if you had one of those 24-hour turnarounds or one day to prepare,
so it is good that we've had a few days.  
  
Q. You have four senior starters; how did that not making the NCAA
Tournament last season weigh on them during this season?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, it was very disappointing. We were 10-6 in the league last
year and won 20 games, and now this year 10-6 in the league, got a 4 seed and
hosting. It's sometimes hard to understand exactly how all these decisions are
made. But yeah, I think we've talked about that quite a bit through the off-
season last year, through the preseason this year, and I think we've tried to
use that as motivation. Last year they said we didn't have enough top-50 wins,
and this year I know we had four top-15 wins right off the top of my head.  
  
I think they took it to heart and have done a great job. Again, that's the
core of our team, those four seniors have been great leaders, great mentors to
the younger players, on the court, off the court, in the community, every way
you could imagine they have been unbelievable ambassadors for NC State and for
our program. I'm excited, too, that they're going to be playing on this stage
their senior year and get the opportunity after not getting it last year.  
  
Q. I asked Dom this a little bit earlier. Last time NC State went to the
NCAA Tournament, we head to LA and she's left behind during her transfer year.
Has she exceeded expectations over her three years of being on the court with
NC State? Did you see her as 1,100-, 1,200-point scorer for you when she
finally got on the court?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, I don't really think in those terms. I will say this:
Dom has shown unbelievable improvement over the last year, just her shot
selection, so from an offensive standpoint she's been a lot more productive,
and then on the other end of the floor we're asking a lot of her in that we're
having her usually guard the other team's best scorer. She's having to play
both ends of the floor for 40 minutes, not a ton of players out there nowadays
that can do that, you know? So very proud of her maturity and where she is
going as a player, and that's obviously a big reason we're here now.  
  
Again, very proud of Dom and where she's come from even a year ago.  
  
Q. At the Christmas break did you foresee a 6 seed?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, I don't look at it that way. It was a rough time. We
lost a couple of games November, December, after having a double-digit lead in
the fourth period in both of those games. Christmas break came at a great
time, and I've had some people question how long of a break we take at
Christmas. We usually give them at least five days off, five or six days away
from it, and it was without a doubt a big benefit this year because we came
back, fresh start, right out of the chute, beat Notre Dame at home, beat
Florida State on the road, and again, that's kind of what gave us the momentum
to reach the point we're at now.  
  
No, it was hard to envision at the time, no doubt. It was a pretty low time,
and that goes back to what I said earlier. The season is a lot of peaks and
valleys and how you handle adversity, how you handle setbacks, and this team
has overcome a lot of that. Proud of the way they responded.  
  
Q. Is there a catalyst of change from that point that you can put your
thumb on?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, I don't know. You know, from a basketball standpoint, we were
really trying to stress taking care of the basketball. When you're playing
Notre Dame and Florida State, you turn the ball over, it usually leads to a
bucket at the other end, and that's similar to what we've got with Auburn.
We're going to have to take care of the basketball because that's what they
feed off of. Some little things like that.  
  
But you know, I just think, again, I think they came back refreshed, a fresh
start, so to speak, and that's kind of what we have now. Hopefully we have
that same kind of result.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Brianna Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28430)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Q. Do they remind you of anybody you've already played and what are the
challenges you're facing against them?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think we've seen a team such as theirs, like similar style
of play last year in our first round game and I think that we're prepared to
play them and we've watched a lot of film on them to prepare, and I think that
any challenges that we're facing that we're not ready for, we're going to
prepare for that today on the practice court.  
  
Q. Kelsey, some early losses, 19-game win streak, and I think four
losses in the last six. Where is this team right now? Do you feel like you
have any momentum heading into the postseason?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, I think for the past week or so, we've just been
talking about how this is just a new slate for us and it's a new season, and
everyone is starting off and when you lose a game, you're out, so everyone is
on the same playing field.  
  
And so even though we did have some late losses towards the end of the season,
I think we spent the last week really preparing and fixing some things that
needed to be fixed, and so I think that that prepared us going into tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys are familiar to this routine, such a long gap between the
conference tournament and the NCAA Tournament. How did the team handle that
downtime? What did you do to prepare and stay sharp, and also rest and
relax?  
KELSEY LANG: I think the team handled that pretty well. We have four
upperclassmen that have been through this for a couple years now, so we were
able to tell the younger ones about how this goes and everything. The couple
days that we had off, or we had between the tournament and now, we used to
prepare. We used it to refocus and get back on the court and get back to being
us.  
  
Q. What Chris (ph) was just asked, over this extended time off, I know
the goal was to get back to the form that you guys were in during your 19-game
winning streak. How close do you think you got?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think we spent a lot of time preparing and preparation for
the NCAA Tournament and I think those days that we were able to regroup and
refocus and get back to our style of play, I think these days that we had to
prepare were very vital and they were very good for our team.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just overall, what is this time of year like for a player?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, this tournament, where you're playing one game, you're
guaranteed one game; you lose, you're out, is definitely different from the
entire rest of the season where you know you have guaranteed games left.  
  
And so I think especially for this team, having so many young players and just
players who haven't experienced this yet, the upperclassmen really had to get
that point across to them that once you lose, you're out, and you go into the
off-season -- for us, we're done. I think it was important to get the
underclassmen to understand how important taking every single moment is. When
we were able in the middle of the season to take each Game 1 game at a time is
when we were playing our best. I think if we can get back to that, we'll be
good.  
  
Q. Is there a sense that maybe at some point, some of those younger
players kind of lost that perspective with the late losses? As things were
going so well, things got confused?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think our entire team wasn't taking one game at a time any
more, and getting back to that is extremely important, especially right now in
this tournament. And so practice over the past, you know, week and a half has
really just been about taking each drill one drill at a time, and each
possession, you just give all you can on that one possession and so I think
that can -- if that can carry over to the game, then that will be great for
us.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I don't think it's any secret why the two of you are up here,
the two seniors. This is your last go-around, regardless of what happens. What
are the emotions like for you as a senior going into your final NCAA
Tournament?  
KELSEY LANG: You know, watching the selection show on Monday night was kind of
-- it really I think hit me then that this is the last time I would watch a
Selection Show, and see where we were going, and you know, who our opponent
was going to be and so for me, just especially taking that one moment at a
time, and just enjoying each moment I have with this team, and I love spending
time with them and I think that that goes for everyone on the team.  
  
We like being around each other. We love playing with each other. And so just
really enjoying each moment that we have, you know, one game at a time, is
really important for us.  
  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: Kelsey pretty much covered it all. It's very exciting for both
of us. I think she covered it by just saying we're trying to stay in the
moment and take advantage of every opportunity that we have with this team, so
we're excited to get to play.  
  
Q. Two years ago, Sweet 16 last year, there's a progression there. Can
you talk about your goals? Start with Bri.  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think coming here to Texas, ultimately our goal has always
been to get to the Final Four, and our goals have not changed since.  
  
Each year we have progressed and I think that just shows that this program is
headed in the right direction and I think Coach and the coaching staff and the
girls have done a great job of buying in and following the game plan and
everything. So I think that we're definitely headed in the right direction.  
  
KELSEY LANG: Yeah, going off what Bri said, I think especially for us, too,
when we were recruited here, we wanted to get Texas back on the national
scale.  
  
And so our freshman year, being able to make the tournament again, and then
each year progress further in the tournament, that was definitely a goal of
ours, and like Bri said, it's still a goal to keep continuing to go further.  
  
I think everyone on our team, especially the underclassmen, understands that
is our expectation and our goal is to continue to go further within the
tournament.  
  
Q. Bri, how much pride do you guys take in the fact that you guys are
leaving the program in a better state than it was when you got here?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I think that we can say that we definitely accomplished one of
the goals that we had coming into this program, and I think that Coach has
covered it by saying that this is going to be our legacy when we leave here
and knowing we were a big part of that and we were a part of it, it's just
amazing to think about; that we were actually at contribution here and we're
going to have something that everyone can remember us by.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just looking at the roster, you guys would seem to have a
significant size advantage over your first-round opponent. Talk about that and
how you hope to be able to exploit that?  
KELSEY LANG: Yeah, you know, we definitely saw on film the past few days, I
mean, obviously just looking at the roster, you do have a size advantage and
so we have been talking about how we definitely need to throw it inside and we
need to expect double teams and we need to expect to have to kick it out, our
guards cutting off of us.  
  
We just need really to focus on what the coaches have been telling us, which
is we do have a size advantage and we're going to need to be able to throw it
inside and kick it back out in order to be successful in this game.  
  
Q. Did people toward the end of the season adjust their defenses to your
personnel? What can you do to counter them?  
KAREN ASTON: I think that we saw about every defense we could possibly see,
and I wouldn't say that it was towards the end of the season. I mean, you play
each other twice in the league, and the first time, the first time we saw
K-State, for example, and Iowa State both, they manned Brooke.  
  
So I wouldn't say that anything Iowa State did to us the second time when we
lost was any different. We just didn't play as good. And they played better.
So sometimes you have to give credit to opponents when they play better than
you do. And as now, I think our players have talked about, we've tried to use
this week that we've had off to sort of reenergize our batteries a little bit.
I think that down the stretch, we just didn't play as good of basketball for a
few reasons, and they would all be deemed as excuses because that's what they
are. We just didn't play as good of basketball, period. It wasn't anything
that we saw different. I actually think we did some better things against some
of the junk that we saw late in the year, as opposed to when we saw it the
first time. Some of the games, the ball just didn't go in and some things
didn't happen for us that happened at other times in the year.  
  
Q. How do you feel like this team is responding to that re-energizing
period?  
KAREN ASTON: I think they have been good. It was hard to get a few of them to
sort of get out of the disappointment, because we have good kids and we have
kids who really want to do well and expect a lot out of themselves and expect
a lot out of our team, including their coach. And so there was this first
moment of a few days of disappointment and probably being mad. A lot of things
combined, a lot of emotions that we needed to sort of work through.  
  
We worked through those and I think the period of time was long enough to get
through those and get through the mad and get through the part that we needed
to to get back to, we're excited to be in the tournament, and it's a new
season and to get re-energized. So it was probably just enough time. I'm not
sure a couple of days would have been good, so we were fortunate in some ways
that we had enough time to kind of sink a little bit and then comeback up.  
  
Q. You mentioned all the positives that come with the big gap between
the end of the conference tournament and the start of this tournament. Any
negatives that come with that that you have to overcome?  
KAREN ASTON: No, I really can't think of any negatives, at all. It was just
one of those periods of time -- I mean, last year, I would have worried that
we were kind of on an up swing. I think any time you can get, in particular, I
say this because of the grind of the Big 12, I think any time that you can let
them breathe a little bit is probably a good thing, and I mean, it all boils
down to the fact that it is a one-game season at this point, and do teams
really want to keep playing. And sometimes that's what some of this boils down
to when you get into tournament play: Are you ready for this to be over; are
you tired of the grind of it, or do you have a little bit more left in you.  
  
I think our team definitely has that. Speak to the break; I think what it was
probably good for was the young kids that it's been a long season for.  
  
Q. I know you're modest by nature, but how much does it mean to you to
be in the Final Four for the Coach of the Year honors?  
KAREN ASTON: I think any time that you're recognized as a player or a coach,
that it's a reflection of everyone that's involved in what you're trying to
get accomplished. So I would say that I'm proud just from the standpoint that
it's a reflection on our players and our staff. I mean, everybody does a great
job every day, and it's a privilege to be acknowledged. It's humbling to be
acknowledged, for sure.  
  
Q. Brianna and Kelsey were talking about how the program is in a better
state now than it was when they were freshmen, and before they were freshmen,
that was the one year you didn't go. How proud are you of their effort to help
lead this team back into an elite program?  
KAREN ASTON: As I said, we talked a lot about this on senior day, and it is
fun to watch as now I've been here long enough, I've seen players come in as
freshmen and leave, and you get to see the impact and you get to see the
maturity and what they have turned into as young women and what this
university does for student athletes here at Texas. It's understated what I
think our university does to grow up people and grow people into what I deem
as leaders in society and what they will be able to do in their next so-called
life.  
  
So as much as I'm proud of what they have done on the court, and I am, really
proud of how they have gotten Texas back into a place that we need to be in,
but I'm also probably more proud of how much they have grown up as young
women.  
  
Q. Part of getting Texas back each year is making a run in the NCAA
tournament; do you talk about that?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, obviously it's one of our goals, and it should be. It
should be at Texas. And we talked about it early in the year, the hashtag, all
that stuff, is part of what our ultimate goal is for this season.  
  
But I will say that part of this process and this last week or ten days, to
try to get our team back to the competitive level that we were at for quite
some time, was to really start talking about the one day at a time thing,
because that approach worked with this particular team. Just to talk about
what are we doing in this moment, how can we be the best we can be in this
moment, in this game. We don't care what's ahead. Let's just talk about today,
and for whatever reason, I think this particular team is better when they stay
in the moment.  
  
So we haven't talked about anything but Central Arkansas.  
  
Q. Are there certain things, when you get into a game, signal that you
know, all right, we're playing well --  
KAREN ASTON: You know, it's funny that you say that, because I was sort of
thinking about the games. You do reflect back on the year when you have to
some time to do that and you think about games that you felt really good.  
  
I think that the old saying, that guards, most teams go as their guards go; I
would probably say that I feel strongly about that with this particular team.
And it's not necessarily whether Brooke is making shots or Aerial is making
shots or Lashann is making plays. It's how our guards play and when our guards
are full of energy and they are really on task defensively, and they are
really pushing the ball and they seem very connected, there's an energy in the
building. There's an energy on the bench. There's an energy with our team. And
sometimes guards don't have it. Sometimes players don't have it. And sometimes
coaches don't have it.  
  
But when -- that feel comes from our guards, that I think we're a better
basketball team, if that answers your question.  
  
Q. Kelsey mentioned to us a little bit ago that upperclassmen had to
grind into the lower freshmens' heads that it's a one-and-done tournament. Do
you feel they have really embraced that in-moment feeling, and going into
this, how do you think they are going to perform under the NCAA pressure of
one-and-done?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, you never know what under pressure they are going to do.
They are a question mark a day most of the time. But I will say that if I
based it on, which I usually do, base everything on what our preparation looks
like, then I would say that they have sort of taken another step of maturity.
That's really important. They are talented players. Our young players are very
talented and I would include the sophomores in that because they just didn't
get enough minutes last year to really understand all of this.  
  
But I do think that the last few days, I've seen them kind of -- they seem
like they are, I don't want to say reenergized all the time because that's not
necessarily -- they just seem refocused. That's a better word. They lost their
focus a little bit, maybe from fatigue of the season, overwhelmed by whatever;
sometimes just being a freshman is overwhelming for most of them, but it does
seem like they are refocused right now.  
  
Q. Situations sometimes where two or three of your players, the other
team doesn't really guard them. They are daring them to shoot. What are they
supposed to do in those situation if the clock is not running out?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that's -- the statement about the clock running out
does make a considerable difference. But where I think we get bogged down
sometimes is when we don't move the basketball. It's not necessarily who is
shooting it and who is not shooting and who is open and who is not open. It's
when we don't move it, and the last couple of games, we got stagnant
offensively and we stopped -- the ball kind of got stuck. And I thought we did
a better job at K-State, which was our last conference game. I thought we made
some changes and we did some things that were very positive.  
  
And I mean, it was a different game against West Virginia, so I hate to say we
didn't carry it over, because West Virginia just outplayed us. I mean, we
didn't play great. Shots didn't go in but they played really good and they
played really good in the whole tournament. You kind of have to give the
credit to them in that situation and not beat your kids down and say, oh,
well, we were terrible. We got out played for sure but they out played
everybody in the tournament. So the sense of urgency, we didn't have, so I was
more interested in getting back home and finding a sense of urgency that we
don't go to Oklahoma City with, rather than worry about who was shooting.  
  
Q. In trying to refocus that, do you have a special speech? Do you
change up routine? Do you give them extra time off or drill down harder? How
do you as a coach approach that?  
KAREN ASTON: It was the week before spring break, and at Texas, going to class
and being a student is pretty important, so I had planned on that regardless,
so that they could catch up a little bit academically before spring break. So
I would say the only thing we probably, or I did maybe differently, was the
practices that we had kind of in between were, for a lack of better words, my
patience wasn't very good in those practices. We kind of got back to some
things that I felt like we were getting away from.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 75, Tennessee - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then questions for the players.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, just disappointed for our kids. Great group, great bunch
of young ladies to work with, be around. We'll never get this group back
again, obviously, and I'm going to miss Jordan and we'll miss Schaquilla.  
  
Q. Mercedes, it looks like particularly in the first half Tennessee was
really struggling to get the ball to you. What was Louisville doing that
impacted that?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Honestly, I think they were just kind of playing a poke and
packed-in defense, which looks like five players are in the paint but really
they're just trying to make you shoot jump shots from the outside and get
tough looks, which, really, they did a good job of that. It was tough to get
me the ball early.  
  
Q. Both of you are juniors, and you'll be coming back next year. Knowing
that you'll come back having another shot getting to the pinnacle of all of
this, how bitter is this one to lose?  
JAIME NARED: It's frustrating any game you lose. It's the end of our season,
so there's nothing we can do about it now. I think we're going to get in the
gym and get ready for next season.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, just off what she's saying. It's definitely something
that we're going to need to learn from, but we'll just take this feeling that
we have right now and use it for motivation next season.  
  
Q. For both Mercedes and Jaime, I guess, I think at one point in the
fourth quarter there were 15 straight missed field goals. How can you explain
that, if you can?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I mean, it's tough. You know, you never know coming into a
game if you're going to hit shots or not. But when you're not hitting shots,
you're usually supposed to fall back on your defense, and we weren't getting
stops on the defensive end and then not making shots on the offensive end. It
just wasn't adding up.  
  
Just we're going to need to fall back on defense when we're not hitting shots
and rely on that from the git-go.  
  
Q. Jaime, what made Asia Durr so difficult to guard?  
JAIME NARED: She's a crafty point guard. She's a lefty. I mean, we knew that.
We didn't do a good job forcing her right. But she can shoot, she can drive,
and I think we didn't do a good job of stopping her. But when she wasn't
hitting, then Moore started hitting. So I think just all around we didn't do a
great job of stopping them on defense.  
  
Q. Jaime, 28 points tonight, 9 of 18 shooting. Was there anything in
particular that you were feeling early on, or was it basically just the
defense presenting the opportunities to you instead of to DeShields and
Mercedes?  
JAIME NARED: I think just being aggressive from the git-go. I think we got a
few transition points. I think that was huge in this game because we knew that
was an area we could attack and we've been good at the whole season. So I
think just making open shots. My team just did a great job of finding me, and
that's a credit to my teammates.  
  
Q. Jaime, Mercedes kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier. Was it
anything in their defense that they did to you that caused you to shoot poorer
than usual tonight, and especially in that fourth quarter? And it seemed that
they pretty much wanted to take the game away from Diamond, didn't want to let
her get the ball, but she struggled a little bit shooting?  
JAIME NARED: I think we got open looks, I think we did. I think we got open
looks. But what we've done in the season was offensive rebound. We had one
person crashing for a lot of the game, so I think when you're missing shots
and you're giving yourself at least a second opportunity by offensive
rebounding, and we didn't do that. I think just when we're missing shots,
falling back on our defense, we didn't get stops, we weren't crashing. It's a
lot of things. I don't think -- I think it was a lot of what we could have
controlled that could have helped ourselves better at.  
  
But Louisville is a great team, great defensive team. We knew that. We knew
they were going to help on Mercedes, and we didn't take advantage.  
  
Q. When fouls started to slow down and the game started in the third and
fourth quarter, is that what you guys think caused a lot of the scoring
droughts, or was it something else?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: No, I don't think the fouls are what caused it. We just
weren't getting good looks at basket, and we should have been driving and
trying to draw fouls on them, and we just weren't doing that.  
  
Q. Jaime, did you get tired in the fourth quarter? You didn't look like
you were getting any lift on your jumpshot late.  
JAIME NARED: No, I think I was just -- I wasn't making shots. I wasn't getting
to the basket like I was before in the game. So I wasn't tired. I was just
missing shots. And we weren't getting stops so.  
  
Q. A team like Louisville that has three really strong players that are
All-ACC caliber, how difficult is that to defend knowing that while Hines-
Allen and Durr have been hot lately, Mariya just was on fire tonight,
especially from the outside?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I honestly think it's definitely difficult because if one
time on an off night the other two can step up at any point, and in a lot of
games they're all three on point. Defensively, it's just about locking in and
trying your best to stop all three of them.  
  
Q. Coach, there were a couple spans there, one in the first half and I
think one in the second half also, where you had some long shooting droughts.
What do you attribute that to? Was it more fatigue on your team's end or more
Louisville's defense?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I thought we got good looks, we just missed shots. We
missed a lot around the basket and just didn't make plays. I thought we got
good position to get some looks and just didn't finish it.  
  
Q. Holly, Mercedes commented on this inability maybe not to get her the
ball enough. Did Louisville do anything different? I didn't realize they were
dropping that many people back.  
COACH WARLICK: I don't -- you know, it's a physical game, and there were times
we couldn't get her the ball and times we could. You know, she made some and
she missed some. We didn't make plays. You've got to make plays. You've got to
make plays down the stretch, and we didn't do that. Jaime's right. We'd miss,
and we didn't have a lot of people going to the boards as we usually do. So it
just -- fourth quarter, obviously, we couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- Mercedes mentioned the failure to get some
stops early in the fourth quarter, maybe that would have helped the offense on
the other end. There was a 7-0 run they went on and then a 5-0 run quick?  
COACH WARLICK: Sure. Yeah, if you get stops, it pretty much helps you win the
basketball game, and we couldn't get stops. So, yeah, they made great plays,
and we had no answer for them. We fouled -- a foul was called in the fourth
quarter that we normally don't do. So it's just a combination of a lot of
things.  
  
Q. Coach, Mariya was 31% from three coming in, today she's five for
five. Did you want her taking those shots or were you just not happy with the
way they were guarded?  
COACH WARLICK: She was outstanding today. Five for five. I thought their
three-point shooting separated them from us. She was outstanding. We knew how
she could play, I mean, and we just let her get loose.  
  
Q. Coach, throughout the game the score was fairly close, but in the
fourth quarter, obviously, it got away. Do you feel like your girls were a
little tight as Louisville started to pull away, trying to force the issue and
why they made missed shots?  
COACH WARLICK: No, I don't think we were tight. Again, I thought we got good
looks, we just didn't make plays. You all know. You've got to make plays. We
have kids that have made plays throughout the year, and we just couldn't get
it done in the fourth quarter.  
  
I thought we got them to turn it over. We got lay-ups, we cut it, and then,
again, we didn't get stops. Then we'd come down and we missed a five-foot
jumper. So just a little bit of a combination of a lot of things for us down
in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Holly, Diamond was coming off a great game against Dayton the other
day. She just never really got it going today. Anything you attribute that
to?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, she's just a great competitor, and sometimes I think
in Diamond's mind she's got to do everything. She didn't have her best game.
She's gotten us through some tight jams, she's played exceptionally well, and
you look at her stats, and it just kind of wasn't her night tonight. So she's
got to play and she doesn't have to be her best, she just needed to step up
and do some things, and, you know, it wasn't a typical night for Diamond
DeShields.  
  
Q. At some point the page does turn. What is the message for the
offseason with the incoming recruiting class that you have, which is ranked, I
believe, No. 1?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we want these young ladies coming in to grasp ahold of
our culture. When we had the opportunity to get four new kids in here, it's
going to help us as far as our bench play. You know, these kids know what
they're getting into. I mean, it is Tennessee, and you've got to be on your
"A" game every game.  
  
So I think for us we go back, we teach these freshmen what it needs to -- to
play hard, being disciplined, and we've got to have some people step up and be
just solid on the leadership end of it and be consistent and give these
freshmen an opportunity to grow. Because they're going to play. They're going
to play, and they're going to play a lot.  
  
So I welcome it. I love what our practices are going to be. They're going to
be extremely competitive, and we're going to bring this -- we're going to make
sure this Lady Vols program is intact, and we're going to be as competitive as
we can, because we've got the kids now to be competitive.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 75, Tennessee - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH WALZ: First, just want to congratulate Tennessee on a great season. It
was a great basketball game. I thought it was up-and-down the floor at times
and impressive shots were made by both teams.  
  
I thought our crowd was great. It was just a really, really exciting college
basketball game. I'd also like to thank again Tom and Christine and everybody
with the University of Louisville, our athletic department, the Yum! Center,
all the volunteers for putting on such a first-class event. This is not
possible without all of them. I'm quite aware of that. We don't take it for
granted, so I just wanted to make sure I said thank you to all of them.  
  
Q. What was your mindset going into the fourth quarter, and can you
describe some of those plays where you got the big threes?  
MARIYA MOORE: My mindset was we've come so far, we can't give up now. And I
need to do whatever I could to make sure my team pushed through. So not only
was it trying to hit big shots, but it was also making sure that when they
made mistakes, just let them know it was okay and to keep going.  
  
Q. Asia, what did you see in Mariya? It seemed like you were looking for
her there late?  
ASIA DURR: I saw that she was very confident. Basically what she just said.
She didn't want to lose, and I think that she showed that when she came up
clutch with those two threes in a row. I was just so hyped. I'm so excited,
and I'm proud of my team as well. I think we fought hard. This is a great
game, and our fans are so amazing. I'm just so happy to be here as well.  
  
Q. Asia, you and Mariya were responsible for 14 straight points in a row
there. Did you have any idea that you two were going to be the keys to start
the fourth quarter?  
ASIA DURR: I had no idea. I was just trying to focus on stop, score, stop.
Because I know for us to score as a team, we have to get stops first. That's
what we did as a team. We came up with some huge stops, and I was just so
happy to see those stops that took place.  
  
Q. Myisha, what was it like for you matching up with Diamond? Because it
seemed like in the beginning, you guys were giving each other a little bit of
trouble, and your game really opened up in the second half.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, she's a great player. Projected to go high in the
draft. It's just basically trying to keep her in front of me. And I know I
have my teammates' help in the back. If she beat me, I knew my teammates would
be there to help, and I would have their back.  
  
So it was just a team effort, though. But just trying to keep her in front
because she's such a great player and she's so fast. Her pull-up jumper was
probably the best in the country. So it was trying to keep her in front and
knowing that my teammates would have my back, too.  
  
Q. Asia, it was a tight game throughout, but you guys were -- you guys
held a slight advantage for most. What was the message from Coach when
Tennessee did go on that run and took a five-point lead?  
ASIA DURR: Well, coming into this game we knew it was going to be a game of
runs. So that's what Coach Walz stressed to us way before the game even
started. He told us: It's going to be a game of runs, but we have to get stops
first. And I think we got like three stops in a row, I think, and that was
huge because then we came down and scored as well. So we just had to get
stops.  
  
Q. Mariya, after I think the fourth of your five three-pointers, you
made a gesture that looked like you were putting pistols in a holster. Was
that an accurate description? If so, what was the message you were sending?  
MARIYA MOORE: I'm going to be honest, I --  
  
COACH WALZ: She was feeling pretty good. After our last five games she was 1
for 21 from the three-point line, so she could have done a cartwheel for all I
cared.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: I was so happy because Coach always stresses how we need to get
in the gym. And so after the ACC Tournament I've been in the gym as much as I
can, so to finally see the hard work paying off, I was just so happy.  
  
I knew before the game I was like, hey, Mariya, if we do this, don't
celebrate. Get back on defense. So I don't even know what happened, really.
I'm going to have to look at the replays, but it just came out.  
  
Q. Asia, in the first quarter, I think, first, second quarter you had
like nine points and you had that rush stretch, and you seemed kind of
frustrated there. It seemed like it just took one basket to kind of get it out
of you. If you could just go back to that point and feel like you were
pressing and maybe that was part of it?  
ASIA DURR: I think the most important thing for me is to stay patient. Coach
Sam told me a few times slow down. I think I was playing way too fast. And
once I finally calmed down, I finally started to see the ball go in, and that
was good. But I think it all started on the defensive end getting stops first,
because that's what gets us going.  
  
Q. Tennessee has never lost a second-round game. I think the number is
28-0 coming in. So what's that say about not only the level of competition,
but the accomplishment of beating them?  
MARIYA MOORE: Well, this is the first time we're hearing of that. Regardless
if they had lost or hadn't lost, we just came to play our game. It's a huge
accomplishment. All these second-round games have been very competitive, so we
weren't expecting ours to be any different. But I'm happy our team was able to
pull through.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Like she said, it's the first time we've heard of that, so
thanks. But it's March Madness and anything can happen. They came and played
their best game of basketball, and we also did. So, I mean, two great teams
just going at it, anything can happen.  
  
We're lucky enough to get the win in front of our fans because last year we
weren't able to accomplish that goal. But just knowing this year we were able
to do it in front of an amazing crowd. The crowd was loud. When we were down,
they were still with us, even when we were up, they were still with us.  
  
So, I mean, just the fact that we were able to get this win not only for
ourselves and for our confidence going into our next game, but for our fans as
well.  
  
Q. Mariya, after the game was over, you were obviously celebratory, like
everybody else. You were also in a ton of pain. What's it like, those two
things going on at once?  
MARIYA MOORE: It's just a hard lesson I have to learn because our nutritionist
preaches to me all the time and our trainer that I need to drink more often.
And when I'm in the heat of the moment --  
  
COACH WALZ: That's water. That's water. Just want to make sure we clarify that
now.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: Drink water, water, drink water. When I'm in the heat of the
moment, all I'm really focused on is the next play instead of my body. So I
was in pain, but it was my fault. Water.  
  
Q. Myisha, you touched upon this about getting back to the Sweet
Sixteen. I know it's not a given every year, but how appreciative are you all
of this after missing out last year and coming so close last year?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, my freshman year was the first time we made it to
the Sweet Sixteen, and we had seniors on the team. You know, you just play for
your seniors once it gets to the end, because you know this could be their
last game. You don't want to see them go home heartbroken.  
  
But getting back to the Sweet Sixteen gives everyone else confidence. We know
Coach Walz and our staff will give us a great game plan going into this game.
We've just got to stick with it and stay pushing and get to the Elite Eight
next.  
  
Q. How long will you enjoy this win before you start thinking about that
Sweet Sixteen game in Oklahoma City?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Today and tonight.  
  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I would say the same thing. I think the next game is Friday.
Yeah, I'm not sure who we play. But we need to be prepared for that game
because it's going to be huge. I mean, it's one game here. We can't get too up
about this game. We have to stay right at the right point. So we've just got
to keep our game plan going.  
  
Q. Myisha, it seemed every time you had the ball in your hands in the
fourth quarter, you had a smile on your face, whether you were taking the
rebound or ripping the lay-up. Were you aware of how close you were to
clinching?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, every rebound I pulled down, I was just like, we're
one step closer. That was just a mindset. If you get the stop, you're one step
closer to getting to the Sweet Sixteen. We get a stop, and we're one step
closer.  
  
So every time I was able to get up there and get a rebound, because they're
great rebounders, they're top in the country in rebounds, so every time I was
able to get one in the fourth quarter, it was just like, yeah, we're one step
closer. Get the ball up to one of our guards, and let's go work on the
offensive side. It's just like one step closer. That's my whole mindset going
in to the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked yesterday about the importance of your bench, in
particular Ciera. How well do you think she played in her minutes, and how big
was her role in limiting the Lady Vols' inside game tonight?  
COACH WALZ: I thought our bench was fantastic, right down the line. Ciera did
a great job of buddying up in the post on Mercedes, which we need to keep her
as far out from the basket as we could. She made a big-time hoop for us. She
hit a big-time basket when we needed a bucket. So I was really proud of her. I
thought Briahanna Jackson came in and gave us a lift and did some good things
for us. Sam Fuehring hit two big shots there in the first half.  
  
You know, it was a team effort. I'll tell you, Sydney Zambrotta is one that
you look at the stat sheet and you're not even going to see that she did much
except for pick up two fouls, but she picked up a huge charge. Then all I care
about is plus-minus. At the end of the day, I look at when they're in the
game, what did we do as a team? And I'm really looking forward to seeing what
she did in her six minutes, because I'm willing to bet you we're probably a
plus-six or plus-eight in the six minutes that she was in the game.  
  
Because it puts another shooter on the floor, which then helped spread the
floor, which is what we needed to do, because things were getting a little
clogged up and jammed up, and they were backing off our non-shooters. But she
did a really nice job of coming in there and staying composed and doing what
we needed her to do.  
  
Q. Coach, we just saw a video of you coming into the locker room for the
first time after the game. What was that moment like?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, it was great. You know, it's exciting to see these kids and as
excited as they are. I demand a lot from them, because I just don't know any
other way to do it. It takes hard work. If you want to be great at something,
you've got to put the time in, the effort in, and the work. I hold them
accountable to that.  
  
So I know what we've gone through. I know how hard they've worked. To see the
celebration, the excitement, the smiles on their face is what makes this job
as fun as it is and makes everything worthwhile.  
  
Q. In the first three quarters, it seemed every time you'd get a little
separation, Jaime Nared would come in and nail something on you. She had quite
the game this evening.  
COACH WALZ: She's a big-time player. Nared, Russell, Reynolds, DeShields, you
just go through the list, they're all big-time players. We lost her a few
times at the three-point line, which I can't even make an excuse for because
it was just bad. She made some tough shots too.  
  
But it's like I try to tell them, we started the game with some breakdowns, so
she got some open looks. She knocks down two in a row, and all of a sudden
she's got confidence. You can't do that against good players.  
  
What I did think we did well with her was forcing her at times to turn the
ball over. I thought we then got some pressure on her and we were able to
create some turnovers.  
  
Q. How did you keep Mariya encouraged with a game like this? Her NCAA
Tournament games hadn't exactly been great.  
COACH WALZ: They've been bad.  
  
Q. Yeah, okay. I was being kind.  
COACH WALZ: We keep things real around here.  
  
Q. Okay, in particular the three-point shooting, how do you keep a
player like that encouraged when they struggle like that?  
COACH WALZ: As we keep telling them, shooters shoot. What I did is I told her
after we came back from the ACC Tournament, I'm like, Mariya, if you trust me
with anything, when you shoot, follow your shot. Just run after it. Shoot it
and go after it.  
  
The same thing I told Antonita Slaughter four years ago, if you go back and
look at the way she played for the NCAA Tournament. As we like to say, she
couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. Antonita was just throwing a brick. It
was awful. I finally told her, Antonita, when you shoot it, just go run after
it and get it. I told Mariya the same thing.  
  
What that does for some of these kids is now you stay with your shot. Instead
of falling back, you get balanced. I just said, keep following it. I was
really proud of her, because every one she took tonight, she stayed with. She
didn't release it and get back. She kept going with her shot. And we made some
big ones. She made some big ones. It was a great ballgame for her, and I
thought she rebounded the ball extremely well, too, especially at the
offensive end.  
  
Q. Pretty evenly matched game for the most part. Both teams kind of had
some scoring droughts, had some struggles. What do you think it was that
really set you guys apart?  
COACH WALZ: I thought we executed extremely well. When I go back and look at
this game, I think we may have called three timeouts or four timeouts, three
of them I think for sure on baseline out of bounds where we got tangled up, we
called timeout, and I think we scored off every single baseline out of bounds
play that we had.  
  
What makes this game fun for me is there are two or three that we just drew up
in the timeout that we hadn't run before. Because you get a feel of how
they're guarding you and what we're going to do. As a coach, that's what makes
it fun. But you've got to have players that can sit there for two minutes or
30 seconds, see it, and then go out and execute it. And we did. We made big-
time baskets at crunch time when we needed them.  
  
Q. How important was it to kind of break through this level and get to
the Sweet Sixteen and for these young players to experience what they're about
to experience?  
COACH WALZ: I think it was an important step for especially Mariya, Myisha.
And Myisha said it perfect, her freshman year we get to the Sweet Sixteen, but
like I always told Mariya and Myisha, all they had to do was score. I had Bria
Smith out there guarding two people at one time because Mariya wouldn't guard
anybody. Shawnta Dyer's out there guarding Myisha's man too. All they had to
worry about was scoring.  
  
Now they've got to do a little bit of all. I was really proud of them. I mean,
Myisha, and I'll show her on film, this was probably one of the best games
she's played since she's been here because she stayed engaged. She missed some
shots, she didn't make things, but she kept rebounding, kept defending. And
normally she'll check out on me for three or four minutes, and she did not do
that tonight. That's her next step in the evolution of her game.  
  
Q. Coach, going back now to Oklahoma City and potentially facing the
same team you did back there in 2013, what kind of memories does that bring
back? What do you need to do to replicate that magic that you guys had the
last time you were there?  
COACH WALZ: Well, four years ago it was a special run that we put together.
You know, Shawny is not going to come back and play, Antonita is not. So we're
going with this group. It's a whole new team, it's a new year. Sure, it's
going to be fun for us as a coaching staff and Cortnee Walton because Cortnee
was a part of that team to walk into that arena. You know, just kind of put a
smile on your face, going, boy, we did some pretty special things here four
years ago.  
  
But you can't really look back at the game and take anything from it.
Everybody has pretty much moved on from their team, from our team. It's just
going to be a great ballgame whoever we would play.  
  
Q. Holly was a little reluctant to give you guys credit for the
defensive effort you put up. She said there were a number of factors that
contributed to their loss. So looking at it from your side of the fence, what
is the one big thing that you think contributed to you guys winning and them
losing?  
COACH WALZ: We scored more points. That's really what it comes down to. To me,
it doesn't bother me if somebody doesn't say we did this good, we did that
good. At the end of the day, we've just got to figure out a way to score more
points, and we did that tonight. I've never seen a game, for the 20 years I've
been doing it, 2-0. So we figured out a way to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Like I said, I thought we executed. I thought our execution was off the chart
at times. I thought we did a great job on our baseline out of bounds defense.
We came up with two steals and then forced them into some bad shots where
we're getting lay-ups on ours. That's what we take pride in. We take a lot of
pride in how we sit there and go through and execute. It was fun to watch.  
  
Q. I'll try not to get you in trouble on this, so I'll ask it this way:
When one team gets 18 out of 20 of their free throw attempts, what do you say
to your kids to keep them focused?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it was poor coaching. It was poor coaching. I've got to do a
better job of figuring out a way to get our kids to the free-throw line.
That's all it is. I'm just bad at what I do when it comes to that. Okay. I
thought we did some really nice things of driving the ball to the basket. I
thought we attacked, but I've got to do a better job of teaching them how to
get fouled. So that's what it comes down to. It's all on me.  
  
Q. This question's for Lola. Lola, how do you think Dad did tonight?  
LOLA WALZ: Good.  
  
Q. Is he the best coach you know?  
LOLA WALZ: Yes.  
  
Q. Thank you, Lola.  
COACH WALZ: Did you cheer hard tonight?  
  
LOLA WALZ: Yes.  
  
COACH WALZ: Who did you cheer for? Tell him who you cheered for.  
  
LOLA WALZ: Mariya and Myisha and Asia.  
  
COACH WALZ: All right. Thank you, everybody. And I really appreciate the media
coming out here. We just really, really appreciate it. Thanks so much.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Diamond and Mercedes, and then Coach. Questions
for the Lady Vols.  
  
Q. Diamond, you and Durr are both from the Atlanta area. Just a reminder
how many good players come out of there. How do you think that impacted your
game and helped you develop, just playing against really good competition in
the Atlanta area?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Well, it's all I know. Being from a state where we have
very talented basketball players, you kind of know what you're getting into
when you sign up to play basketball. You're going to play against All-
Americans, top talent in the country always.  
  
So Asia's always been younger than me, so I've never really had any
competitions against her. Yeah, I was probably just older and she was probably
just younger. I don't even really remember. Maybe once. But, still, you have
those other players.  
  
Q. You guys have had some good wins over No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in this
tournament this season. But is there any one game that's a win or loss that
stands out to you that you guys played your best?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I wouldn't pick just one. I think all of those wins were
huge for us. Just how we played reflected our game a lot. Just all of those
games from start to finish we played hard for 40 minutes. We were all focused
and our effort was on 100%, and I think that's what we're going to need from
tomorrow night.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, same. The games we win, we always do what we're
supposed to do. It's like when we do what we're supposed to do, we win. When
we don't, we lose, and it's always a disappointment.  
  
But in the games that we win, you know, we just do what we're supposed to do,
and the game is just easy and everyone's having fun. Like I can't say that any
one stands out more than the other.  
  
Q. Diamond, do you like playing against teams like Louisville which kind
of play a similar style to you guys -- up-tempo, aggressive defense, just keep
the ball moving, really push it in transition?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: I wouldn't say I have any preference for like a style of
team. I know it will be a good opportunity for us on both ends of the court.
They have some athletes, and I know it will be an up-tempo style of game.  
  
So, I mean, we're always looking forward to having the test of your abilities
against somebody with similar abilities.  
  
Q. Mercedes, when you look at Louisville, is there any one thing that
stands out to you that will be hard to defend or to adjust to?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I just think from top to bottom they're an overall good
team. They have guards that can penetrate and kick. They have a couple good
shooters on that team and some pretty good rebounders. We've got the same on
our team, so I think it will be a great matchup.  
  
Q. Diamond, the one time you're here in Louisville playing here, your
dad is actually in Arizona. How do you feel about him not being here and kind
of missing this game?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: It's kind of normal, you know? We're like usually like two
trains crossing in the night sometimes. Literally, he'll be in the city, and
then the day he's leaving, I'm coming in. Or like my brother, it's the same
way. We never really count on seeing each other play live as much as we just
try to catch the games on television or something. I'm not upset about it. I
know he's working doing what he wants to do, and I'm happy for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Holly, Asia is one of the best players in the country. Just address
the challenges that she'll present for you defensively?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I've watched Asia since she was a young kid. She just has
the complete package. She's a terrific shooter, terrific three-point shooter,
can get her shot off at any time, is a penetrator. I think the best thing Asia
Durr does is she's a great passer. A great passer. So I think she's a complete
package, and she's going to be a difficult defend for us.  
  
Q. When Diamond had a really efficient game, you talked about how
efficient she was in that game. Is it hard sometimes for her? I mean, not to
force things, because with the offense not functioning well, you almost kind
of need her to force things. Is that kind of a fine line?  
COACH WARLICK: It is. I think Diamond is an extremely competitive young lady,
and sometimes I think she thinks she has to do everything by herself. When
things may not be going right for us, she feels like she's got to step up and
do more. I think Diamond's really efficient when she plays within our team and
our concepts.  
  
Again, I think Diamond's one of the best players. She's one of the best
passers for us as well. I think Diamond, she stays in our game plan and works
with our team, we're really, really good. But, again, she's a competitor, and
sometimes she feels like she thinks she has to take the game over.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about consistency issues this season. Do
you think that you guys are in a place mentally now where that won't be an
issue going forward?  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. I think we came back from the SEC Tournament and
really dialed into the two weeks we had to prepare. I thought the prep for
yesterday's game was probably the best we've had in a long time. Just focused,
dialed in, and I had that same feeling last night when we got back and this
morning.  
  
So I think we're in a good place. I think we understand that we've all got to
be on the same page. And as Diamond says, we've got to come up with a game
plan and we've got to stick to it. I keep telling them sometimes don't make
things up. And when we make things up, we're not a very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Holly, you've had so many great players in the program. I guess you
think of Holdsclaw, Catchings, Parker, Bridgette Gordon. Talent-wise, is
DeShields kind of in that same class, or is that saying too much?  
COACH WARLICK: No, I think Diamond is a talent in that class. I think God has
blessed Diamond with a lot of talent. She's worked at her skillset. I think
she can do things that Catchings did. She can do things that Holdsclaw did.
But she could learn from them as well.  
  
I think Diamond is a better rebounder than she is right now. She can rebound
more. But I think she has the skillset to get a shot off when she wants to.
She has a skillset to be a great defender like Tamika Catchings. So I think
she's got so many different attributes from everybody else that we put her in
that class.  
  
Q. I just asked the players this as well, but is there any game from
this season that you think sticks out to you as the way you want your team to
play?  
COACH WARLICK: Gosh, I think they've all come at times when it seems like we
have struggled before. Probably my game I keep going back to is Mississippi
State, and we're playing in front of 15,000 people and we're just playing.
It's just a great feel. We're playing together, we're moving the ball. The
ball's not stuck in our hands. Different people are stepping up, hitting
shots. We're getting great stops on the defensive end.  
  
Again, and it all boils down to: Are you dialed in? Are you focused? And they
were spot on that game. So if I could bottle that game, regardless of who
we're playing, it would be awesome.  
  
Q. When you're in a man, would Reynolds figure to guard Durr?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, it depends on what lineup. They've used so many different
lineups. They can go small. They can go more guard oriented. I think we're
going to have to guard Durr with a variety of people. I think Jordan's going
to have to do it. I think Diamond's going to have to do it. I think Meme
Jackson's going to have to come in and be solid on her. So I don't know if we
can keep one player on her and be successful. I think we're going to have to
move people around and give it a shot.  
  
Q. This program has a really established postseason history. But Jeff
Walz has made that a tradition here at Louisville as well. When you're going
up against a team and a coach you know also has a lot of NCAA experience, I
mean, does that make the matchup all the more exciting?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think it's exciting when you have two teams, as Diamond
said, are similar. I think they play hard, they're well coached. You're in the
NCAA tournament and you're trying to advance. So I think that will bring some
excitement as well.  
  
It's here. They had a great crowd yesterday. So I think both styles are apt to
bring excitement, because we're both up and down. We're athletic, we can
rebound, shoot the threes.  
  
So, as we're similar teams, we may go inside more than they do, but they
stretch the floor out and have players that can face up. So I would think this
game would be really fun to watch.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the Louisville student-athletes, and then
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, you and DeShields are from the same area. I'm just wondering if
you maybe played against her in AAU ball, and whether you did or not, have you
seen her play, and what are your impressions of her as a player?  
ASIA DURR: She's a great player. I've never played against her. I think we had
a chance to in travel ball, but it never happened. She's very talented. She's
a well-coached player as well. I think she's projected to be the first round
draft pick, so that she's -- she's a great player.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. Just yesterday when you guys were sitting
out there watching that game against Dayton, what are some of the key things
that you noticed? Was there anything you noticed that changed what your
previous impression had been of them? Myisha first?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, they're a great team. They get up and down the court
really well. They have good guard play, and they defend. It's going to be a
hard-fought game that's going to go down to the wire. We just have to play
hard for 40 minutes.  
  
ASIA DURR: I'm going to go off of what she just said. They're a scrappy team
as well. They play hard. They trap a lot too. What I saw with them is that
when they get stops, they love to run, so we have to be careful of that. We
have to be cautious of that, too, and we have to be aware.  
  
Q. Asia, over the course of the season, really two seasons, have you
pretty much faced every kind of defense? Is there kind of a normal as to how
teams try to defend you?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I would say I've seen all kinds of things. I've seen a box
and one. I've seen teams that played us a triangle two as well.  
  
So I think we just all have to be on the same page as well. It's not about me.
It's about the whole team. I think we have to be on point for tomorrow's game
because they're a great team. It's going to take the whole team and not just
me.  
  
Q. Getting back, you mentioned the trapping defense that Tennessee did.
Both of you guys did that very successfully yesterday, it really disrupted the
opponents. Do you kind of envision a game where both teams are getting after
it with pressure defense tomorrow night?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Of course, we're both aggressive teams. We like to get out
in transition. And the way you get out in transition is pressuring your
defender. Both teams do that very well. So I think you're going to see a lot
of trapping.  
  
On our part, you're going to see a lot of mad dogs so we can get out in
transition, because that's how we like to run. I wouldn't expect anything less
from them as well, because they feed off their defense, and that's how they
play.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing as her. We both do those things well. We
trap the ball well. We're both a scrappy team, so it's going to be a great
game. We're all excited for it as well to see how this goes.  
  
Q. Tennessee's had some wins over teams like Notre Dame and South
Carolina that you guys kind of struggled against. When you look at how they
played against those teams, what are you thinking, and does that affect at all
how you're going into this game?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it's the same thing that I've been saying. They're a
great team. Very talented. They have a great coach as well. So we're going to
get their best shot. We're going to get everybody's best shot, because this is
the tournament. Nobody wants to go home, so that's what it's all up to now.  
  
Q. Is this the sort of game you really look forward to when you come to
a school like this? The way this thing lines up, this could be a Sweet 16 or
even an Elite Eight game, but here it is in the second round.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, I know it's not just for me, but for everyone. This
is why we came here, to play in front of the amazing fans that we have.
Tennessee has amazing fans.  
  
So, I mean, this is why we came here, to play the top of the top and to get to
a Final Four. What better way to do that than here at home and to play a tough
team. Because once you get past this team, you have another tough team and
another tough team. So, I mean, it's setting us up for success because we're
going to be able to play our game. Tennessee's such a great team, they're
going to help us get better if we're able to get past them.  
  
Q. Jeff, just looking at your roster, it's a travel-cade, got players
from all over. Did you recruit nationally as soon as you got here? Is that
kind of how it's gone after you've been here awhile and built up a successful
record?  
COACH WALZ: We've always tried to start here in our city, our state,
surrounding states, and then work our way out. We've had a lot of success in
California and some different places. We're now down in Texas.  
  
Really, when it comes to recruiting, you're trying to find the players who are
also interested in you, not just ones you want. Because there's a list of the
ones that I want that weren't interested in me. So we go out there and we
watch a lot of kids play and try to get that feel of, okay, she has genuine
interest in our program, our university, our academics, and then you proceed
from them. We like it that we have players from all over, but we do have our
state taken care of with some very talented players, and we're excited with
that also.  
  
Q. Tennessee has their marquee wins over Stanford, Kentucky, Notre Dame,
but then they have a couple unexpected losses to teams like Alabama. What do
you make of that?  
COACH WALZ: I don't make anything of it. That doesn't even cross my mind.
We're playing a team tomorrow that's beaten two No. 1 seeds, two No. 2 seeds.
They're as talented as anyone in this tournament. It's tournament time.
Everybody's going to give it their best shot. There is no overlooking anyone.
Because if you don't take care of tomorrow, there is no next game.  
  
So I'm expecting them to play at the highest level that they can possibly
play, and we're going to have to do the same thing. I'm expecting a great
ballgame. There is no doubt that this could be one of the better, if not best,
second-round games that has presented itself.  
  
Q. The last couple years you've been able to host a lot of home
tournament games. Tomorrow night, Monday night at 6:30 against the Lady Vols,
what kind of atmosphere do you expect from your fans?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we're very fortunate, very pleased that it was a 6:30 tip
time, especially in women's basketball, because we get a lot of families and
seniors that come out to support us. And a 9:00 tip time is hard. So we're
really excited about the 6:30 tip.  
  
We'd love to see us get between 8- to 10,000 in here for Monday night. You
know, we're at 5,400, I believe, for yesterday's games, but I'm challenging
our fans, challenging our city, to see if we can't get 8- to 10,000 out here
for Monday night's game, because it's going to be a great basketball game.  
  
I had a college teammate of mine that came down from northern Kentucky. It was
the first game that he had seen us play. And, actually, I believe the first
women's game he had seen in some years. And he just commented to me afterwards
he was just so impressed with how athletic and talented the girls were. And I
told him: Our biggest challenge, I think, in women's basketball is to get
people to come out one time. Get them to come out one time to see what these
young women can do, and normally people are impressed, they're surprised, and
normally you get them to come back.  
  
The great thing about it, I know he brought down his boy who is in the sixth
grade and his buddy is in the sixth grade, and they want to come back down
tomorrow night. Now it's convincing Dad to bring them back down.  
  
But when you get the kids hooked, it's hard for parents to say no.  
  
So we've got to continue to do our job as coaches and go out there and promote
our programs and make sure that our fans are able to feel a part of it.  
  
I think that's the other big thing in our game. You've got to go out and make
sure that your fans feel that they're a part of your program, not just
cheering for it. And that's one of the reasons we sign autographs after every
home game, win or lose. Wins are easy. A loss, your true character comes out.
And I tell our kids that every time. You've got to be able to take that. You
get beat, it's tough, no one likes to lose, but you've got to be able to flip
that switch and go sign some autographs and put that smile on your face. I
truly believe your true character comes out in situations like that.  
  
So it's something we have to do. I'm hoping Monday night we can get 8- to
10,000 in this place.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little about the challenge that DeShields presents
for defense, also what Asia brings to your offense and your overall team?  
COACH WALZ: Well, you know, DeShields, I'm hoping she thinks the game starts
at 9:30. She's so explosive. She's got an unbelievable pull-up jumpshot,
extremely quick, pushes the ball in transition as fast as any player I've seen
on film. Rises up over top of people.  
  
I thought in yesterday's game -- I read the quotes from Dayton's Coach Shauna,
and I thought she was exactly right. I thought they defended her well on a few
occasions, she just rose up over top of them and shot it. There's not much you
can do about that.  
  
So she presents some problems. You know, their post game, I thought their post
game was very good yesterday. So they have a lot of people on the floor that
can score. You've got to make sure that you're prepared. At times you're going
to have to guard too. You're going to have to look like you're guarding two
people at one time because that's how good they can be. You can't stand and
watch. So it's going to present some challenges, but one our kids are excited
about.  
  
Asia has been playing with a lot of confidence the last month and a half, and
I'm really excited for her. She's really been efficient, which is important.
She scored 26 or 27 in yesterday's game, but only took 16 shots. When you can
do that, then you're really starting to get something accomplished out there.  
  
But we're going to need our bench to step up. We're going to need everybody to
contribute. It might not be 16 or 18 points, but we're going to need to make
open shots.  
  
Q. Asia and Myisha both describe Tennessee as scrappy. What kind of
challenges does that present when you face a team that's scrappy like that?  
COACH WALZ: Well, they hustle. That's one thing about them. I watched them in
yesterday's game, the ball's going out of bounds, it looks like it's just
going to bounce out, and they fly after it, throw it back inbounds and it
turns into a lay-up.  
  
You know, they're on the ground after 50-50 balls, which is something that
we've talked about this entire year. If you want a chance to keep advancing in
postseason, you've got to win the 50-50 balls. That's something I think both
teams take a lot of pride in and something we're going to have to really put a
lot of emphasis in for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You just alluded to your bench. How important do you feel your depth
has to be in tomorrow's game?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think it's going to be important for us. We play games
where Asia's played 40 minutes, Myisha's played 39 minutes, Mariya's played 40
minutes, yes. But when we get the performance like we got out of Jazmine Jones
yesterday, it helps, because now all of a sudden, you're putting a different
dynamic on the floor with her athleticism, her ability to rise up over people
and shoot.  
  
I thought Sam Fuehring did some good things in yesterday's game. Ciera
Johnson's going to be important in tomorrow night's game because of their
size. We're going to need our bench prepared to play. We're going to need our
bench ready when their name is called to go out there and perform.  
  
This time of year, you don't have three minutes to get loose. You know, when
you go out there, you've got to make a difference from the start. It might not
mean you score, but you've got to be able to defend. You've got to be able to
rebound. You can't be like: Coach, I just need a few more minutes. I'm
starting to get a sweat going. That has to be taken care of before you get in
the game.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Tennessee - 66, Dayton - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes?  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you. Thank you. Just loved our effort tonight. I thought
Dayton was just -- they're an outstanding basketball team. They challenged us
in every aspect of the game. Had a great year, but I loved our focus. I loved
our energy, and I loved our resilience. So I can't say enough about this team
and what they did tonight.  
  
Q. Diamond, were you ill there late in the game? You went off the court,
and then came back and never went back in the game. Are you okay?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yes, I'm fine. Just had to handle a little situation, but
I'm all good now.  
  
Q. Diamond, I had the pleasure of covering your dad in the majors, your
brother when he played for Lexington Legends. What have you learned from them
about being on the big stage that helped you with this game and the big games
that are coming down the road for you?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Just to attack the moment. When you're on the big stage,
you can't shy away from that. I've seen my brother in Cooperstown and on
numerous big stages. I've seen my dad play on numerous big stages. Just that
competitiveness runs in our family. So just never to shy away from it, attack
it, and be who you are, no matter where you're playing.  
  
Q. Diamond, you now have 1,000 points as a Lady Vol. How does that feel?
That's what Twitter says, at least.  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: I mean, points are -- I mean, points are what I do. I'd be
more excited for like an assist record or a steals record or rebounding or
something like that. My point is like I never really got too high about points
because that's what my team expects me to give each and every night. That's my
job. So had it been like 1,000 rebounds, I'd have been like, what? That's
crazy. But I'm happy. This is what I came here to do and be a contributor, so
it's nice to be rewarded.  
  
Q. This is for both players. Dayton came in as one of the top teams in
the country in field goal defense. What were you able to do, especially there
in the second half, to really kind of overcome the defense that they put on
you guys, especially after that second quarter where you guys only made 4 of
16 shots?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think just from the start, us attacking them in transition
really helped us out with easy buckets. On the offensive end we were really
moving the ball well and getting good cuts and getting good looks at the
basket.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, just to piggyback off what Mercedes said, but we were
also taking care of the basketball. So we were utilizing the possessions that
we had, and we were able to get good open shots, and we were hitting those
shots.  
  
Q. Holly talked about the effort and energy of this team tonight. But
that 14-point lead did get away from you. Do you have a sense yet of why this
team at times kind of finds the challenging way to do things, I guess?  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: No, I don't. That's been a question we've been trying to
answer all year, really. But you can't expect a team like Dayton to just give
up. They're here for a reason. So you can look at it and say we gave up the
lead, but on the other side they fought back.  
  
They're a hard-working team, a well-coached team. And they weren't going to
let us just run the score up on them. They kept playing hard and came back at
us when we did go on our run. So credit to them for not giving up.  
  
Q. Mercedes and Diamond, Dayton kind of wrote this off as a bad day at
the office where they missed shots they normally make. But did you feel like
from watching them on tape and then playing the game that you were doing
things that affected them offensively and got them out of their comfort zone,
maybe?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I definitely think our defensive pressure was huge tonight.
We had three keys for Dayton. It was guarding the three-point line, playing
defense without fouling, and boxing out. And, honestly, I think we did a
pretty good job of all three all night.  
  
DIAMOND DESHIELDS: Yeah, they got a few open looks, especially in the second
quarter when they made their run and tied the game back up. But we were just
pressuring them. I'm sure it's unlike anything they've seen all year. Yeah,
they missed a couple open shots, but the majority of the time we were in their
space and taking away their three-point opportunity.  
  
Q. When coaches look at a bad game, a bad shooting game, is there a
tendency to blame it on your own team as opposed to giving the opposing
defense credit?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you know, I do think they missed some shots that they
would normally hit. I thought our defense affected them. I'm sure our defense
wore them down a little bit.  
  
I mean, our goal was to pressure the ball. It was to deny one pass away, we
didn't want any high post catches, and if they did, it was away from the
basket. So I think at times we made them work to get good looks.  
  
And they missed -- fourth quarter they missed open shots, and I think it was
the pace of the game, our pressure, and it wears you down a little bit. That's
what we wanted to do. That's what we wanted to do. I agree with her. I think,
too, it has something to do with our pressure as well.  
  
Q. Even with that early lead getting away, you felt like this was a full
40-minute effort? And if so, how often have you seen that this season?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought it was a great effort. I can't say enough about -- I
thought Schaquilla Nunn was outstanding. We don't win the game if she doesn't
get 15 rebounds and she shoots 6 for 10. She just competed. Because we were
getting good looks, and then that second quarter the shots weren't falling,
and I just thought -- then Jamie Nared got into foul trouble. So I thought
Schaquilla was just absolutely huge.  
  
Obviously, Diamond, we went to her. We're going to go to her. Mercedes kind of
stepped up in the third and fourth quarter, but I also want to give credit to
Jordan. She didn't shoot the ball well, but she led our basketball team, and I
thought we gave great effort for 40 minutes.  
  
Second quarter, they got a little hot. We didn't do what we needed to do as
far as switching and attacking the ball. But overall, really, really pleased
with people stepping up and staying consistent.  
  
Q. What is it that Dayton brought as an opponent that you didn't really
expect or wasn't prepared for that could help you as you move through the
tournament here?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I tell you what they did, they're a great three-point
shooting team, and at times it's given us fits throughout the year. I thought
for the most part we took away their looks to get three-point shots. They're a
great rebounding team, and that was one of our big points, is don't get
outrebounded.  
  
So they're a team that at times has been our weakness, giving up offensive
rebounds, giving up three-point shots, giving up drives to the basket. So they
challenged us in every aspect of the game. And that's what makes a good team.
Shoots the three. Can penetrate, rebounds. This is a tough team to guard, it's
a tough team to defend, and it's a tough team to win against.  
  
Q. I think with today's win you guys are now like 29-1 in first-round
games in the NCAA Tournament. Obviously you guys are one of the more if not
the most historic program in women's basketball. What is it about just being
able to be that dominant and being in the tournament every year, and not just
be in the tournament every year, but advance and move on?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, you all know we've had such a rich tradition of women's
basketball, and it started with Coach Summitt, and it's up to this team and
our coaches to continue that culture.  
  
At times the last couple of years we hadn't been at our best. But it seems
like in tournament times, these kids rise up and they accept the challenge.
And it is a culture. It's what they come to Tennessee for, is to play an NCAA
Tournament and compete for championships. So if I can just get them to act
like the tournament's all year round, I'd be in business (laughing).  
  
But I've said all along, they're kids that work hard. They work hard. But we
let things get in the way sometimes during the game.  
  
All in all, I will say this: This last two weeks they've been the most focused
that I've seen them pretty much all year. They've been tuned in, focused and
asking a lot of questions, meaningful questions. So I'm just was pleased with
how they played and how they finished the game. It's a product of how we've
been practicing.  
  
Q. When you say that you let things get in the way during games at
times, do you mean physically or mentally with this game?  
COACH WARLICK: I think both. I think mentally we check out sometimes. We have
in the past. I think we're in really good shape. I think sometimes we don't
box out, and that's a physical part of the game.  
  
It just goes down to just the game, when we're clicking on all cylinders and
everybody's doing their part -- tonight I ask them: You've just got to bring
me your best. Just bring me your best. And I thought they did that tonight.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 82, Chattanooga - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to have Coach with an opening statement, and then
we'll have questions for the student-athletes for a few minutes coach,
congratulations.  
  
COACH WALZ: Thank you. I'd like to start off by first congratulating Coach
Foster and Chattanooga on a great season. They do a good job with that
program.  
  
We knew it was going to be a tough ballgame throughout. We were able to pull
away there towards the end, but it was never a game I felt really comfortable,
especially with the way they shoot the three. But really, really pleased.
Looking forward to have the opportunity to play on Monday night and see what
we can do.  
  
Q. Asia, you had a fairly good game out there today. Your teammates were
really finding you in some great spots, weren't they?  
ASIA DURR: They did, yes. Ra, she had a great game. She had ten assists. They
just did a great job of finding me on the court. And Coach Walz called a few
plays for me as well, and I was able to knock the shot down.  
  
Q. Jaz, you've had maybe two of your best games this year against the
same team, Chattanooga. Would you like to play them maybe four or five times
next year?  
JAZMINE JONES: Chattanooga's a really good team. I was just doing what Coach
was asking me to do all the time. It just so happened that I had a good game.  
  
Q. If all three players would comment about this. You all shot 60% from
the field, and if I can get my stat sheet up here, I think you had 28 assists
on 36 baskets in an NCAA game. That's hard to do. Talk about that. Was
everybody sharing the ball, getting the ball? What was it today? Asia first,
please.  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it starts in practice. Each day we have to get up a
certain amount of shots, and that's where it starts. It doesn't start in the
game. It starts in practice.  
  
Coach Walz says you can't just come in the gym and just shoot during practice.
You have to get more shots than that. It definitely showed. Our bench, how
many points did they have? We had 23 bench points or something like that, and
that was really good. So our hard work is paying off.  
  
Q. Myisha?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Just to go off Asia, when we passed the ball, we were a
great team. When we got in transition, we were a great team, and that's what
we were able to do. Getting rebounds and pushing the ball up the court and
running. We're just a great transition team. So that helped a lot.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: Yeah, just to piggyback off what they said, when we passed the
ball, we passed the ball extremely well tonight, and we were sharing it well.
What Coach says: Don't stand around and watch. Move when you don't have the
basketball. We got easy lay-ups, and it was great.  
  
Q. Jazmine, you said you were just doing what Coach asked you to do.
What is it he asks you to do, and how hard is it over the course of a full
season is it for you to keep doing that all the time?  
JAZMINE JONES: Name them all (laughing). Well, he always asks me to go hard.
He always asks me to go hard, be a player. Don't be a robot. And that's what I
did tonight. Him telling me that every day, it gets stuck in my head so I
can't lose it. So if I actually listen to him like I did tonight, good things
happen. Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, when Jaz is doing those things, how much different does it make
you as a team because of her athleticism and opening things up for the rest of
you?  
ASIA DURR: It makes us a hugely different team because she can do more than
just shoot. She can crash, she can defend, she's getting better at that too.
You know, she's just a great player, and she's finally showing that. We've
believed in her since day one. Like she said during practice, Coach Walz stays
after her at all times because he knows what she can do for us. And that's
what she did.  
  
Q. Myisha, you all had -- points in the paint were 46 points in the
paint. Their coach says, well, if you give up the points in the paint, do you
sacrifice the outside and vice versa? They had seven blocks against you the
first time. Only had one tonight. Was that the result of you just running your
offense? What was it?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No. In practice leading up to this game we knew that she
had seven blocks against us, so we were worried about that. It's basically
just going up strong every time. Not really being afraid, but just knowing
that she's there because she's capable of blocking shots. She leads the
country in blocked shots. So we knew that going into the game. We just have to
go up strong and finish through contact. We did that today with 46 points in
the paint.  
  
Q. This is for anybody. 14 players got some minutes today. Was fatigue
an issue today looking into Monday? Were maybe minutes a concern?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: For our team? No, everyone's capable of playing. I think
Coach Walz has a game plan, and just getting everyone in. Because you never
know who you're going to need in this tournament. So just getting them ready
for any game at any moment. So just having all these different players and
trying to find the right ones to be out there so we could run the game, I
think that was like the biggest thing. Coach Walz and the coaching staff
having a game plan, and knowing who needs to step in at the game to have the
right five out on the court.  
  
Q. Myisha, they started off really hot from three, and they were leading
you by one point. I think you guys had a 13-0 run there in the first quarter.
Were you starting to get worried the way the game was starting? What kind of
caused that regroup?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, like we said, they're a great team, so everyone team's
going to have a run. It's just how you react to it. If we want to make a run
in the NCAA Tournament, we need to know that teams are going to make runs, but
it's how we react to those runs. So we held our composure. Our mad dog was
really working. We were playing aggressive and able to get stops in that. And
that led us to getting transition buckets.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the difference between Chattanooga as opposed to when
you played them last time? What did they present one game versus this one?  
COACH WALZ: We knew they were very patient. We were trying to get the game a
little bit faster. So even at the start when they were scoring, I felt it was
still a good tempo. Like we wanted to get up more shots. We wanted to get it
to be a little faster game. So by doing that, you're going to give up easy
baskets.  
  
I thought we got the tempo where we wanted it. To score 82 points on that
ballclub is not easy to do. I told them before the game started in the locker
room, you know, it was probably going to be a 55- to 56-shot game for us. And
it ended up being 59. Normally we're trying to get into a game where we're
getting 70 in the possessions.  
  
So we knew they were going to be very patient. So we thought we were doing a
good job defensively on them. But give them credit because they did shoot the
ball well from the three-point line which caused some problems.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same questions I asked the players about the 28
assists on 36 baskets. Is that good enough for you?  
COACH WALZ: No, it's great. We passed the ball well and made open shots. It's
no secret. We found each other open with wide-open looks, and that's what you
have to do. If you want to continue to advance, you've got to be able to take
open shots. It's not the contested shots, the tough ones, it's the open ones.
I was very pleased with how unselfish we were with the ball, how quickly we
moved it at times and we're willing to make the extra pass.  
  
Q. Was that what you wanted from Jazmine, and when she's on, how
different does that make your team?  
COACH WALZ: Jaz and her athleticism and ability to do things with the
basketball, it's one of the reasons we had recruited her. She's young. She has
a lot to learn still. But she's going to continue to get better. For us to
continue to move on, we're going to have to have Jaz, Kylee, Ciera, players
come off the bench and give us some numbers.  
  
And that's what happened tonight. I feel pretty confident right now with what
we're going to get from Myisha and Asia tonight. I thought Mariya played well
tonight. But she struggled the past month. She goes two of three from the
three-point line, which was encouraging to see. We're going to need to
continue having solid bench play.  
  
Q. Jeff, what kind of read have you had from this team over the season?
Have the bumps been where you thought they'd be?  
COACH WALZ: It's been a good year. We're sitting here 28-7. We've kind of
stayed around the Top 10, top 12 the entire year. But we've had some ballgames
that were right there. N.C. State here at home goes to overtime, we lose. It's
a five-point game at Florida State, you know? And we lose. Duke, a three
(indiscernible). So we've had a lot of -- Maryland here at home is a six-point
game.  
  
We've had a lot of ballgames that we have to be able to close out. That's
going to be the test from here on out because no matter who we play on Monday
night, I expect it to be a great basketball game and one that's going to go
down to the wire.  
  
You know, when you're playing for a chance to go to the Sweet Sixteen, you
know, nobody's going to go out there and not give 100% effort.  
  
I'm just really going to be excited about how hard we come out and play,
because you have to win every 50-50 ball. You've got to be the one who comes
up with the 50-50 balls. I actually thought Chattanooga started the game doing
that. One of the highlights to me on Chattanooga was the end of the first
half.  
  
And I pointed it out to my players. When they took the shot and their two kids
went up after that offensive rebound and knocked each other on the floor, they
went after the ball. I pointed that out to our kids, that's how we have to go
after it. I thought we did that in the second half.  
  
Q. Your assist to turnover ratio was obviously great. The number of
points you got off the assists was obviously great. But two things have to
happen. Your players have to be able to see that they have players open to get
the ball to and do it quickly. Are you surprised that that happened today? Is
that the type of effort you'll need in that next game coming up?  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yeah, we're going to need that same effort on Monday night.
You know, I'm not really surprised. We've actually been playing much better
the past month. Shooting percentage has been up. We've been getting the ball
moving. Instead of holding it and occupying the ball, we're getting it out of
our hands quicker. So now your teammates open. We're making somebody flying at
us. Now we put it on the ground and it's a one-two pull up, an open shot. The
longer you hold the ball, the worst things that are going to happen.  
  
So we have been preaching to them, get it moving, get it moving. And we had a
week to work on it. That two-week break between the ACC Tournament and the
NCAA Tournament, we had a solid week to work on half court execution,
transition game, which it paid off for us today.  
  
Q. Whoever you play, I know you don't get a choice, but you've got
history. In the next round last year, DePaul knocked you off, and the year
before, Dayton. Will you use that as any kind of, hey, look, this is a time
the last couple years this has been a bugaboo for us?  
COACH WALZ: Our kids know. Last year was a second-round game. The year before
that was a Sweet Sixteen game. At this point in time, everybody you play is
good. It's new teams. It's a new year. Our ones that got beat last year by
DePaul, it hurt. They understand that. But you can't look back and worry about
that and think, oh, my gosh. I don't want that to happen again. You've got to
go out and play and play as hard as you can for 40 minutes and see what
happens.  
  
Our kids are in a good place right now. They've competed today, which I was
really excited about. We've just got to continue to get better.  
  
Q. Everyone's kind of doing something different tonight. You had Asia
knocking it down from outside. You had Myisha on the board, Mariya with the
assist, Jazmine in transition. Are those the strengths that you think you
should be playing to from now on, or is there something else you think this
team can bring out?  
COACH WALZ: No, that's what we have to do. I thought everybody played to their
strengths. I thought Kylee did some good things for us. Kylee can run the
floor. She catches it in transition. She's able to finish. Just constantly
working on her, getting more aggressive and more physical.  
  
I thought Sam Fuehring did some good things for us too. It was a team effort.
And then when you're getting the team like Chattanooga that's going for guards
a lot, that's why we had to go with four guards. I thought Briahanna Jackson
being back was a big help for us. It gave us more depth, which is what we
need. She ends up with five assists and a turnover and six boards. I was
really pleased with what she was able to bring. I thought Taylor Johnson gave
us nine solid minutes. So we have to have that play from our team.  
  
Q. Between Tennessee and Dayton, who is one player you know you'll have
to stop going into the next round?  
COACH WALZ: All of them. Both teams have very talented players. I mean, it's a
group of kids that play hard, that know how to play. It's going to be a
challenge, one that we're excited about. It's always nice to have the
opportunity to play the next ballgame.  
  
Q. Obviously you aren't going to argue with ten assists and two
turnovers. Are you comfortable she's in a place mentally where if she needs to
look for her shot, she will?  
COACH WALZ: I am. I think her making those two shots were a big relief for
her. Seeing the ball go in was really important. I thought today she really
did a nice job. She didn't force up any shots and she was able to find her
teammates open. That's what we need. Now it might present itself on Monday
that she has to take more shots. But I thought today she didn't force anything
and did a great job of finding her teammates.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Tennessee - 66, Dayton - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Green, can you give us an opening statement, and then
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH GREEN: I mean, I'm really proud of our effort and really proud of how we
came out. It's just one of those games I felt like nothing, nothing could go
in. A lot of the shots that we normally make, and we got some good looks and
they weren't going, you shoot 20% from three, and that's not us. We rely on
those.  
  
And even with that, it was still we were still in the game. We were still
battling. I was really, really happy with our defense and the job that we did
on the people that we were concerned about. Obviously, DeShields had a great
game, but she's an unbelievable player. We had contested shots that she made
great plays, and you've got to give her credit for that.  
  
You've got to give Tennessee credit. Whenever we made a run, they came back
and made a run as well. You know, they're a tough team.  
  
But I'm really proud of our toughness and how we played defensively. And we
made runs. We kept pushing. We got it tied up at the half after being down,
and that's a testament to our players and their toughness and their belief and
their togetherness, which they've shown all year. So really happy with that.  
  
I feel for our seniors. They've done an unbelievable job here, and I've been
with them as an assistant coach and now had the privilege to coach them as a
head coach for a year. They're just unbelievable. They've set the tone. I just
can't thank them enough for everything that they've instilled into this
program and what they've given. They've made three NCAA Tournaments, and
Kelley's made four. Just really proud of them.  
  
Q. Saicha, as far as coming into the tournament, Tennessee had some size
with them, most notably with Russell and also Nunn. How did that compare with
what you faced in regular season play in non-conference play?  
SAICHA GRANT-ALLEN: Well, we definitely don't have a 6'6" girl in the A-10, so
it was a bit of a drastic change in terms of size. But our game plan didn't
change. We tried to get into the paint so Russell couldn't really foul because
she's such a significant player to that team. So we tried to get inside and
use our length too. The we're a tall team. So the game plan didn't change, but
it's definitely a difference.  
  
Q. Jenna, your coach talked about it just wasn't your day shooting
overall. But did Tennessee's athleticism and quickness on the perimeter maybe
get you guys out of your comfort zone, did you think?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I mean, yeah, it did at first, and that's why we came out to
such a slow start. But like she said, in the second quarter, we went on a
pretty big run. So I think we let the game come to us a little more after the
first quarter, and we just needed to calm down.  
  
Q. Saicha, you had come in on Russell early. Is she the best center that
you played against, do you think?  
SAICHA GRANT-ALLEN: I'm not sure the best. We've had Jonquel Jones before in
the A-10, she's also good. But she was definitely a really good player, so.  
  
Q. I think at one point your team was 1 of 16, and you kind of refer to
that in your opening remarks. When you have a team struggle like that, is
there anything you tell them or anything you talk to them about during the
timeouts or after the first quarter? And how did you see your team respond
after that? What was it that really kind of helped them get back in the
game?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, I thought we came out a little timid. That's all you talk
about all week is attacking them and being confident. We shot the ball the
last shootaround, and yesterday we shot the ball extremely well here.  
  
I just thought we were timid. So we didn't have a great start. So I just kept
telling them, yeah, we were 1 for 16, but I'm not going to tell them to stop
shooting. I'm telling them to shoot, shoot, shoot. Still yelling at Kelley to
shoot, because I thought she passed up some open jumpshots. If you're a scorer
and you're a shooter and you shoot like we shoot, you keep shooting.  
  
We wanted to get the ball inside some, and I thought we were successful. When
our bigs attacked them at times, we got lay-ups. Our guards got to the paint.
That was a big goal for us, is paint touches. We got to the rim. We couldn't
finish lay-ups either.  
  
So I think you have to give some credit to Tennessee. Their length does --
even though they alter some stuff and we haven't seen a 6'6" kid in a couple
months since Texas A&M when we faced Hillsman. Even in the back of your mind,
she tried to alter some. I think that was there.  
  
But I thought we got open looks. Our stuff was working. We were getting the
looks we wanted, we just couldn't hit them. In the past games we'd hit some of
those corner threes or hit one of those kickouts, and that would give us a lot
of momentum, and they just didn't go today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Jordan's performance today
coming off the bench? Career high 7 points, and kind of what change that made
when she went down in the third quarter?  
COACH GREEN: She was great. I thought all of our young kids were great. I
thought our bench was awesome. We talk all the time about when you come in,
you bring energy, and you add fuel to our fire. I was so happy with them.
Jayla came in and was fearless. That's what I love about her.  
  
I think sometimes when you're a senior, or even Jenna, they press because they
want it so bad, they wanted to win so bad, and sometimes you get timid. I
thought Kelley kind of did that today.  
  
So that's where sometimes the freshmen, they don't know any better. They come
in and they shoot. Jayla was a spark for us. Jordan was huge defensively,
hitting shots. And I think that was really good. I told them after the game,
after I addressed the seniors, I talked to them, because we made that run with
freshmen on the floor. I don't even know if there was a senior on the floor
during that run because Kelley was in foul trouble and Jenna was out, Lauren
was at the point. So I think that taking this and growing from this
experience, that's going to be something we can go towards next year and that
they have a taste of it and they know they can play with the best.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple times you mentioned the word "timid." Are you
surprised that the ballclub came out being timid, and knowing that you
probably prepared them for this moment and this big stage? Were you
surprised?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, the last two games in the A-10 tournament, we've had some
slow starts the first quarter. Obviously, I mean, I thought our start was
going to be really, really key today in how we came out. We've been known to
make runs and come back, and that's exactly what we did today. The exact same
pattern as our last two games in the tournament.  
  
But all we talked about was being aggressive, attacking them. Again, I think,
and I knew that initial wave of Tennessee's man-to-man when they're really up
and they're pressed in, and especially that first five minutes they were going
to really get into us. It's one thing to talk about it. It's one thing to have
your practice players do it, and it's another thing to actually feel it on the
big stage.  
  
It happens. It happens. But I was really proud of how we came back. We settled
in, we calmed down, and we made a lot of good plays and used their
aggressiveness to our advantage, too, with some back door, easy lay-ups, and
they executed well the stuff that we drew up.  
  
Q. After you guys took the lead briefly in the third quarter, it was a
close game, two-point game. DeShields hit about three field goals kind of off
the dribble over defenders. Was that just kind of a great player stepping up
in that situation?  
COACH GREEN: She's a great player, and great players make plays. A couple of
them, and I'll have to watch it on film, but a couple of them I thought we did
everything we could. I thought we had a high hand. She elevates so high.
Players make plays, and she did. I'll have to look at it a little bit closer.
But you've got to credit her. I thought our defense was good. I thought we
contested the way we wanted to contest it. She rises up high, and she made
plays.  
  
Q. You've got a senior class you're not going to see for a while, if
ever. What do you say to those girls as they move up from under your wings?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, you look at Kelley, who has been here five years and been
to three NCAA Tournaments, an Elite Eight, won two conference championships,
an A-10 Tournament championship. I could go on and on. Defensive Player of the
Year. She's done so much here and been a rock for us. She's done it on both
ends of the floor. Played 40 minutes a game a lot of times and just will run
through a wall for you.  
  
What she's done for this program is -- you can't even put into wording.
Saicha, the same thing. She's played a lot of minutes in big moments. Macioce
hasn't played as much, but so important to our team, every single day is there
and works. And Andi, again, big-time moments through a lot of different games.  
  
I just told them -- I thanked them. They took me in as an assistant, and
coming here as a head coach under the timing that we came and from the
beginning, they completely bought in. They did everything that I asked of them
and our staff asked of them. And they really led and made sure the younger
guys were doing that. I just told them: I love you guys. I'm going to miss you
like crazy. Thank you for everything.  
  
They'll be around. I mean, it's a family, and they'll be around.

### [Queen Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33157)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 82, Chattanooga - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH FOSTER: Tough game. Questions.  
  
Q. Jim, it felt like every time you threw a punch, whether it be late
first half, early third quarter, they responded.  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah, that's what very good teams do. We have to have a score-
stop mentality. I thought we had a lot of good looks, but their mentality to
come right back at us, you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that. A
score and a stop is not how you play the game. Not score, let them score,
score, let them score. Especially when you've got to cut it to four. Just pull
your shorts up and work that much harder on defense.  
  
Q. This is for the players. If each of you will comment on the question
that was asked to Coach Foster. Every time y'all made a run, you got it to
four, and they'd punch back at you. Is there anything that they'd do or
anything that y'all wouldn't do? Why could they always answer? Jasmine,
Chelsea then Queen?  
JASMINE JOYNER: Just like Coach said, they're a very good team, a very
athletic team. Sometimes it was our mistakes that would make them get a good
look or a good score. So like Coach said, that's what good teams do.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I definitely agree, that's what good teams do, and
they just completed it. They had the all-around game.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: I think it goes back to simple basketball, you know? We made
simple mistakes that they capitalized off of, and those are the mistakes you
can't make against big teams like this.  
  
Q. Chelsey, I'll ask you, because you were one of the primary ball
handlers against Louisville's pressure. Did you feel like once you were able
to get the ball across half court, you felt pretty good about the shots you
were able to get? Because you were getting open shots when you all were
beating the press.  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I think we got good shots. Sometimes threes don't fall
all the time, so you have to work around that somehow, someway. So throughout
the game, I thought we got pretty good shots.  
  
Q. Louisville shot 61% for the game, and it seemed they were able to get
the ball where they wanted. Was it their athleticism, their quickness, being
maybe a little bigger than you? If players would address that. It just seems
they were able to get the ball where they wanted, when they wanted.  
JASMINE JOYNER: Like I just said, they were more athletic, quick, and they
were just a very good team.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, they're a talented team, like she said, basically.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: And, again, I think they just capitalized off of our mistakes.
If somebody didn't close out, they went around us. If they couldn't get open,
they found a gap. That's what good players do. That's what pretty good teams
do.  
  
Q. Queen, how much more difficult is it to have to go through this loss
as opposed to the loss you had last year in Lexington's Regional?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I mean, it's very difficult because you're almost there, but
you're never there, you know? I mean, every time we go through this, it breaks
my heart. But every time I try to take the positive out of it, try to take
every positive thing that I can that can make me a better person and a better
player. That's what you have to do when you have stuff like this, when stuff
like this happens.  
  
Q. What is the positive you take from here that you took from last year
that could have helped you now?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I think last year I was tentative, so I said this year there is
nothing to be scared of. They're just like us. That is something that I harped
on. That's something that wore on me and in my heart.  
  
Q. Asia Durr obviously was getting a lot of shots inside and outside.
Did you guys have a specific game plan to defend her, and if so, how was she
able to kind of get around that?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Asia's just a really good player. She just knows how to get
to spots, no matter how you play her. If you go under screens, she knows how
to step back. If you go over, she knows how to drive and kick. She's just a
really good player. That's what good players do, and I wouldn't expect nothing
less from her.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me, I think she's a pretty good player, too, but she was a
better player tonight, because they did a wonderful job finding her and making
sure she got the ball.  
  
Q. Jasmine, Chelsey, kind of the same question that was asked of Queen
about taking a positive away or relating a loss in a tournament game. Again,
how do you balance that, and can you now?  
JASMINE JOYNER: Well, last year I got in foul trouble; this year I didn't. So
I felt like that was very good. And I felt like the tough schedule that the
team played this year is going to make them tougher next year. They've got a
big group of freshmen coming in, but these girls are going to make them tough,
going to make them better.  
  
Like I said, I can't wait to see what next year's going to bring them. But
Lakelyn, she experienced her first NCAA game, and Coach Foster has to tell her
you've got to change your speed. I feel like she's going to get in the gym. So
once she keeps continuing that beautiful shot and now she changes speed, she's
going to be unstoppable.  
  
Q. This is for Queen and Jasmine. You both are seniors. What do you see
in your future, and what do you tell the players here that you're leaving
behind as they go and look forward to next year?  
JASMINE JOYNER: My future, only God can tell me. I don't know what's going to
happen. I don't know. I'm going to put it in God's hands. And I'm going to
keep encouraging the girls.  
  
Like I just said, they're going to have a good team. I mean, it's going to be
five new girls coming in, but we've still got Chelsey, we've still got
Lakelyn, Ary, Kei. Going to have a big senior group like we had this year.  
  
So like I said, they won't be new to playing any tough teams like they did
this year. So, I mean, nothing but the best. Go out there and give it your
all. But you never know when it's your last game.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me, I'm giving everything to God as well. I don't know what
my future will hold. But as far as the message that I would give the team is
never get content. Because when you get content, something is just taken away
from you. Whether you're high, whether you're low, whether you're this caliber
type of player, or whether you're doing this, never get content. Because at
any time, at any point, it could be taken away.  
  
Q. Jim, the first time you played them, I know you got beat up here. It
seemed like the first time, y'all had seven blocks against them the first
time. I think you had one girl that had six. Today you only had one block. Was
it anything that they did or anything that you didn't do to offset that?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, we played them a little bit differently. Our issue was --
dilemma was the three. I think they got us from the back side in the lane. I
don't think they were playing three bigs at that time. I think they were
playing three guards. And I think that's a big difference relative to who we
are. I think we match up better with guards, obviously.  
  
So their change in the lineup, I think, was productive relative to the amount
of paint points they took.  
  
Q. Jim, they say (indiscernible) money makes no money. You guys put
quite a bit of threes, you had some good looks, but just couldn't get them
knocked down, but yet you kept trying. Was there any thought of backing away
from shooting those threes and perhaps getting the shots closer in the first
quarter?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, you are who you are. We'll keep working, but mid-range
shots aren't nearly as productive, and we did get to the line a little bit
when we did put the ball on the floor.  
  
As Jas alluded to, I think we've got a freshman, we've got a couple kids,
changing speeds, changing tempo is a big deal as you evolve and become a
better player. And I think that's something that you'll see players working on
in the gym. I think that will help make them a little more successful if not a
lot more successful.  
  
Q. Jim, you've had a message. On previous tournament losses I know
toughness was a message, I believe, for a while. Is there a message you want
to leave with today?  
COACH FOSTER: Get better. Your opportunity to get better is between now and
the first time you get together next year. That's how you do it. We do have a
very talented class coming in. We'll have -- our best success has been when we
have three point guards on the floor, and we'll have that opportunity next
year as we've got a couple of really good ones coming in. We've got some good
ones already in the program. So that will make us better.  
  
We're going to have an overseas opportunity or over-border opportunity next
summer. I think that will help us with this group. The rules allow freshmen,
once they've started school, and they'll start in July, to participate in that
and partake in it.  
  
So I like our youngsters, and I like some of these players coming in a lot. As
Lakelyn showed this year, a freshman can come in and have an impact right away
and be an essential part of who you are right away. And I think the
competition in the gym is going to be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about you guys kept getting close, but it was the
transition that they ran on you guys and the interior passing. Was there any
answer to that?  
COACH FOSTER: If you have one, let me know. Transition, yeah. We made the
adjustment there. But, again the anticipation of sliding out to the perimeter
and cheating in the direction of the perimeter and giving them opportunities
closer to the basket, if you make that mistake five or six times in the game
and they take advantage of it five or six times, you need to adjust to things
like that.  
  
I thought we lost the integrity of what we did defensively probably in about
10 to 15 possessions. We didn't need to. It wasn't something they were doing.
It was something we were doing. That needs to be tightened up for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, you're in this thing leading 8 to 5. They go on a 15-0 run.
What were they doing to y'all after you addressed that run?  
COACH FOSTER: All of the above. Just what I talked about. Scoring in the seam,
scoring around the basket, in-paint points. You look at the stat sheet, it
tells you all you need to know.  
  
Q. You said yesterday, Coach, being aware of Louisville as a team that
has a couple star players and a lot of role players. Jazmine Jones was a
really big deal for them tonight. Had she been on your radar before?  
COACH FOSTER: Role players evolve in a lot of different ways during the course
of a game and what starts to happen in a game. That's why they are role
players. If you look at Durr's numbers across the board, and then you look at
Moore, okay, Moore made a decision. She took three shots, but she had ten
assists.  
  
An immature player might be upset that they only have three shots and try to
force and take advantage of opportunities. She made an adjustment in how she
was playing, and obviously she must like the Jones kid because I'm sure she
had several finishes on passes from Moore. The so her decision to pass the
ball, I think, to be a playmaker, made a big difference.  
  
Q. What are you saying to your seniors? It's time for them to move on.
How proud are you of them?  
COACH FOSTER: I spoke seniors afterwards. They know how I feel.  
  
Q. Anything you want to share with us in terms of what you shared with
them or what you said to them?  
COACH FOSTER: No.  
  
Q. How hard is it going to be to see them leave you?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they're good kids. I give Queen all the credit in the
world. We made a change late in the season, had her come off the bench, and
she wasn't a big person. She could have been a pouter. But she was sort of an
energy for us.  
  
Jas has had to do yeoman's work for four years. We're not a big team, and she
has to do a lot of extra things. Moses plays real hard, real hard, and does
good things. And Sydney had a job to do, and she did a very good job of doing
it. When we needed her, she was there. But I'm not going to tell you what I
told them.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. I realize you're all emerged in the tournament right now, but you
don't have much time before this draft, this WNBA draft. Have you had any time
in the season to weigh the pros and cons of turning pro early?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Personally, that's not something I'm worried about at the
moment. I'm just worried about the tournament at the time. That's something
I'll think about after the season.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: It's definitely a decision that's looming over both of our
heads. But like Mercedes said, it's not something we put too much thought
into. We're committed to being here in Louisville with Coach Warlick, and the
rest of our teammates and currently where we are in Louisville right now, and
focused on Dayton. That's all I'm thinking about.  
  
Q. You talk about Dayton. Do you want to go into preparation for that?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: From watching film, they're definitely a solid team. They've
won their conference championship. They've got some pretty good shooters on
their team. They have good posts that can score around the basket, and step
out and shoot the threes. So just all around, they've got good scorers. Then
on the defensive end, they really get after you.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, I mean, most important thing for us is just to
respect all of our opponents here. Being in this tournament, there's no team
here that can't be beat. So that's the first thing for us. The year we've had
has been full of lots of ups and downs. We don't want to repeat that cycle. We
want to stay on top of our game and get to a good place so that we can compete
deep in the tournament. But they're a great team, just like Mercedes said, and
we understand that and respect that. We've prepared for that.  
  
Q. Mercedes, do you like playing against taller post players, or would
you prefer to be shooting over somebody that's five or six inches shorter than
you are?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, I would say I enjoy playing against shot blockers. I
know Dayton has a couple of posts, 6'5", 6'3" that like to block shots, and I
think that's always a fun, challenging game.  
  
Q. Diamond, you talk about competing and playing this time of the year.
The whole season culminates with this, right? So all that hard work, I mean,
is this the fun part? Is it all fun? Are there times when it's not fun?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I mean, when you lose, you know, it's not fun when you
lose. But, yeah, this is why you come to college. This is why you play. This
is why we're all here for March, to compete for that trophy. So, yeah, it's a
lot of fun just being here with you guys and with each other, and all the fans
that come on the road with us and support us. This is definitely a fun time
for us.  
  
Q. Mercedes, your take on it?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, same what she said.  
  
Q. Diamond, you've been playing in the SEC regular season and
tournament, you're really familiar with those teams. They're familiar with
you. Do you kind of like going into playing a team that doesn't know that much
about you and how you play?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, I mean, you hope that they don't know a lot about
you, but I mean, they wouldn't be here if they came into games that
unprepared. I'm sure they've scouted us and know our personnel very well. Like
we said, it's all about respect moving forward. We respect their players. We
respect their coaching staff. They may not have seen us before, but they know
what we're capable of and they know what we've got and likewise. We know what
they're capable of, we know what they've got. Not overlooking anything or
anybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of an unusual start to the season with a coaching change right
before the season. As a coach, can you relate to the challenge that presented
where you would come in with the season just very close at hand and not much
time for preparation? Can you relate to that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, absolutely. I knew Jim real well, and it is a challenge.
It's a challenge, but it's something that I think that anybody would look
forward to to run their own program. So as you feel a little nervous about
taking over, you're also excited. I think that's the same situation that I
went through. And I know Coach Green has done a great job and got an
opportunity, and has really stepped up and taken advantage of it.  
  
Q. Looking not at the coach but at their players now, who stands out to
you? Who could give you fits?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, they're very well-coached. Their guards can shoot the
three and also penetrate so that, as a team, poses a difficult assignment for
anyone defensively. They're a great rebounding team, so I just think they've
covered all aspects of a winning team.  
  
They're smart, they're intelligent. They run a system, and they do it very
well. So it will be a challenge for us to limit their threes. Keep them in
front of us. Keep them off the boards. Just all those things that make a
competitive basketball team, and I think that's what Dayton is.  
  
Q. Is there any team you played during the regular season or the SEC
Tournament that reminds you of Dayton's similarities in size or style of
play?  
COACH WARLICK: Maybe Missouri. A little bit of Missouri. Except maybe not take
their bigs out so far away from the basket. But I think they're patient. I
think they shoot the three ball like Missouri. Probably I think that would be
the team that comes to mind right now.  
  
Q. Do teams now -- I realize similarities in size, style of play, but
when you're playing a team now, do you pretty much know how they're going to
play you defensively? That they've looked at the film and they see what your
strengths and weaknesses are?  
COACH WARLICK: I think so. I think coaches do their homework. I think we watch
a lot of tape, lot of film, and see how they've guarded certain teams a
certain way. I think there can be a tendency that you put in something new or
do something different because it's postseason. But it boils down to players
making plays and understanding what you want, what your coach wants. So I
don't expect them to do a lot of things different. We're not going to do a lot
of things different.  
  
We've tweaked a couple things on you are offense, on our defense. We're going
to go with what's successful for us, and I'm sure Dayton would concur as well.
There is a reason why they're here and we're here. But your players got to
make plays. We tell them to make plays, and the ball's in their court by the
time the game starts.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first, and then we'll excuse
them. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Myisha, how has the week of practice gone since the ACC Tournament?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We've been doing two-a-days, just going hard, in the
afternoon we scrimmage, and morning practice we just go over our plays. It's
been fun.  
  
Q. Prepared for Chattanooga?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yes. Our coaches do a good job of getting us ready and
knowing the scout and just overall what they're going to be doing. We went
over Chattanooga a lot yesterday, and I feel like we're really prepared.  
  
Q. Asia, question about Chattanooga. You played them earlier in the
year. Is that the same Chattanooga team that you all played then, or how do
you think they are today?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I definitely think that they're going to be a much better
team. They're a well-coached team as well, so we know that we're going to get
their best shot, so we have to be ready for that.  
  
Q. Do you have any preference on who you play in the second game?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, we've just got to worry about the first one first, and
then get that win. After that, it really doesn't matter. We want to play both
teams, but we know we can't, so we just worry about the first one first.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing as her. We have to take it game-by-game.
We can't overlook any team. It's going to be a great game. I'm just so excited
for it. This is what we came here for. So we've just got to be on top of it.  
  
Q. Asia, the advantage of being able to play at home and to know that
you're going to have this home crowd here, I know that's a positive. But do
you guys have to talk about you can't be too comfortable, especially being a
higher seed and being comfortable at home?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Oh, that's true. We see so many teams where there are
upsets, so we have to be ready. Our fans are great. Just to be able to play,
hopefully, two games at home, that is huge. I feel like we have the best fans
in the country, so I'm excited.  
  
ASIA DURR: She handled that question. She handled that one.  
  
Q. Coach Walz has instructed me that you win the game by scoring the
most points. What are some of the other things that y'all be looking to do
against Chattanooga to win the game? Offensively, defensively?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, they have a great post player, so we have to box
out. She had, I think, seven blocks against us, so we have to be careful of
that. And we have to get stops.  
  
The staff has just the whole year: Stop, score, stop. So that's what we have
to do at this time.  
  
ASIA DURR: Just going off of that one, not turn over the ball and getting out
in transition. So I think getting the stop, score, stop, not turn over the
ball, and getting out in transition will help us score a lot of points.  
  
Q. Last year you guys didn't have any seniors. You weren't going to lose
anyone. This year you've got Cortnee and Taylor and B.J., who this is their
last tournament. Does that change how you guys approach things? What have
their emotions been like leading into this?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Towards the middle of the season they started emphasizing
more that, hey, this is our last go-around. We all need to get more focused.
You don't get another shot at this.  
  
But we take pride in that we have three seniors on this team, and we have to
give it our best shot. We can't be lazy and hope for next year because they're
not going to be here next year.  
  
And they're a big part of this team with leadership -- Cortnee with
rebounding, B.J. with handling the ball, and Taylor with her ball pressure.
So, I mean, they're a big part of this team. We know that this is their last
one; in any given moment that could be the end of their season. So we're just
trying to give it our all and just play hard for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Walz, please.  
  
Q. Is B.J. back, is she playing? Do you expect to use her?  
COACH WALZ: Yes, I sure do. She practiced this past week. She looks good. She
feels fine. It's been about a month that she's not been on the court. So it's
not something that she'll go out there and play 35 minutes. But she does feel
good, so we do have her in the rotation, which will help us. So, yeah, I do
expect her to play.  
  
Q. Looking at the four regions, just on paper it looks like you're in
the toughest region by far. Your thoughts on that.  
COACH WALZ: Every coach is going to say that our region is the toughest. If
this was a 16-team tournament where you played everybody once, then I would
probably agree with you and say, yeah, golly, look at all these teams you have
to play. You've got Oklahoma, you've got DePaul, Washington, you could go
through the list.  
  
We just have to worry about the game at hand. Then, if we can take care of
business, then you've got to play a winner of two teams, and you keep moving
forward.  
  
So somebody's going to eliminate somebody else.  
  
Every region has very good teams in it, so it's not one region's better than
the other or anything like that. You've just got to worry about what's in
front of you.  
  
Q. Are you surprised at all that Virginia did not get in and California
did get in the tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I was really hoping Virginia would get in, for sure. Being from
the league, I thought they really started to play some very good basketball
towards the end of the season. A big win against Florida State at home. 7 and
9 in our league, I thought, was pretty impressive.  
  
It used to be 10, 12 years ago your goal was to finish .500. Well, that's when
everybody played everybody twice. Well, now with the unbalanced schedule,
Virginia plays us twice. We're picked second in the league preseason, you
know?  
  
So I think who you play within your league in the unbalanced schedule does
affect what your conference season is going to be, your conference record.  
  
So I'm not in that room. I'm not one of those deciding who makes the
tournament and who does not. I would have loved to have seen Virginia in it,
because I think they are playing some very good basketball right now.  
  
I wish all of our teams in our league, the ones that are in the NCAA
Tournament and in the NIT, the best of luck.  
  
Q. How have these two teams changed since they first played back in
November?  
COACH WALZ: Well, there's a lot more experience from both groups. We've had a
good two and a half months of really trying to put some things together
offensively, defensively. The kids getting to know each other. You learn as
the year goes on who does what well.  
  
I think that's one thing Chattanooga's really improved on. They're very
disciplined in what they're doing. They're focused. They know who is supposed
to get shots from where. Offensively I think they've improved.  
  
Defensively, I think they've been solid the entire year, personally, when I go
back and watch them on film. As the players said, they've got the leading shot
blocker in the country. Does a fantastic job of erasing any mistakes their
guards might have. If someone drives by them, they know she's back there to
help take care of things.  
  
But it's going to be a great game. I think both of our games here will be
fantastic tomorrow. I think you've got four teams that are very well-coached,
playing very good basketball right now, and that's what the tournament's all
about.  
  
Q. You said at the beginning of the season that you thought this team
maybe has the most talent of any team you've had. Does that still hold true,
or is there anything they need to do in this tournament to prove that to
you?  
COACH WALZ: I still say that from top to bottom. What we have to do is take
care of the basketball. That's been our Achilles heel the past month. If we
don't get that solved, it's going to be some problems for us. We turned the
ball over 18 times against Notre Dame in the ACC semis, and it's a six-point
game with four minutes to go.  
  
That's what I'm trying to explain to our players. We're shooting ourselves in
the foot. We're not giving ourselves a chance because we're throwing it to the
other team. That's the one area that we really have to improve on. The
rebounding is going to be important for us.  
  
But I like our chances. I like this group. I think they're in a good spot
right now, but we're going to need to have players step up. If you want to
advance in this tournament, you've got to play your best. You can't have an
off night and expect to win.  
  
So that's the challenge that's put in front of all these young women. Not just
on our team, but everybody that's in this. You really start to find out who
can handle the pressure, because now every shot matters. Every shot you take
matters. The ones that put the time in in the off-season, after practice,
before practice, where it just becomes routine, are the ones that normally
rise to the top. You can't fake it.  
  
That's one thing about this, when it comes tournament time, you can't fake it
because there is no next game. So every shot has got a little pressure on it,
which is a good thing.  
  
Q. You've had outstanding play from the freshmen at times. Little bit
about Kylee Shook. She's come on lately and done some good things for you.  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, she's been playing with a lot of confidence. We've inserted
her in the lineup at the four spot, moved Myisha to the three when B.J. went
down. It gives us another scorer, which has been good for us. Because B.J.
does a lot of great things defensively when she passes the ball, teams were
backing off of her.  
  
Then we had her and Cortnee on the floor at the same time. Really, we had two
that weren't, per se, scorers out there. And now Kylee on the floor, teams
have to respect her to shoot the three.  
  
So we're going to have a little different rotation now with B.J. back too.
When I had B.J. on the floor, I might be able to move Kylee to the five,
Myisha to the four, and still have four scorers on the floor, which is
something I think you have to do at this time of year if you want to advance
and continue playing.  
  
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out today. I'd like to thank Tom Gerich
and Christine Herring (phonetics) for helping and allowing us to host,
everybody from our university that is giving their time to come down and make
this such a special event, not just for our team, but for the other three
teams that are here. It's what you play the entire season for.  
  
I appreciate it, because you guys all go out of your way to make sure these
student-athletes are really -- they feel special. And the amount of work these
women put in for their seasons, not just for our team but their own respective
teams, it's a wonderful event.  
  
I'd just like to make sure I say thank you to everyone, including Jackie with
the NCAA that comes down here several times. She's been a part of it now with
us. It's just done first class, and that's one thing I can always say about
the University of Louisville when we do things. It's done first class. But
it's the people that make it so special. Thank you.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Shauna Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33175)

### [Jenna Burdette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33176)

### [JaVonna Layfield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33177)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the Flyers?  
  
Q. JaVonna, for you personally, the excitement, I've seen your team pop
up on the screen, but then finding out that you're going to Louisville, here,
your hometown. Just talk about that feeling and what that experience is going
to be like tomorrow with family and friends?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: It's an amazing feeling because what are the odds, you know?
I'm really excited for the family aspect because it will be the first time a
lot of people get to see me play. I just think it's going to be a really cool
thing. It's going to be a great atmosphere in general. I'm pretty excited.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, how many people are we talking about?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Well, I know 16 certified tickets from the student-athlete
passes, but my mom bought about ten tickets. Probably maybe like 30-plus.  
  
Q. Jenna, this team has already won a regular season and a tournament
championship. How do you guys stay hungry and motivated going into yet another
postseason experience?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I don't know. I think we're just always motivated because we
just have a fire in us that just keeps wanting to win. We talked about our
goals at the beginning of the season, which two of them were to win the
regular season, the tournament title, and we had a goal for this postseason.
Now we're here, and we have to make it happen.  
  
Q. Jenna, you were a freshman when they went to the Elite Eight and
played every minute. What would you say is the biggest difference in your game
between the Elite Eight run and where you are now?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I'd say I'm a lot less nervous. I just have a better feel for
things. My freshman year I was a little bit of a mess, kind of. So I've calmed
down a lot and just let the game come to me instead of worrying too much. I'd
say that's the biggest difference.  
  
Q. What advice have you kind of passed on to the girls that weren't on
that tournament team heading into this weekend?  
JENNA BURDETTE: Just that this feeling only comes once in a lifetime. We're
lucky, JaVonna and I, to get to be here twice. So just not to take anything
for granted because you never know if you're ever going to come back.  
  
Q. With the schedule that you guys have played, is it getting to the
point where it's easier now to kind of just view Tennessee as another team
compared to looking at the history of Tennessee, having played UConn and
playing Stanford last year and some of the teams you guys have played; that
you just look at these guys as another opponent now?  
JENNA BURDETTE: Yeah, we do. I think it helps us with the way our coaches
prepare us, too, because they prepare us the same way going into every game no
matter who we're playing. I think that's the mindset we have to have coming
into this game.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah, I would have to agree. The schedule that we did, the
schedule has prepared us as far as the preparation and what we do before every
game. So we just have to go out there and execute.  
  
Q. When you guys turned out 3 and 6, did you think you'd win 19 of the
next 22 games and win an A-10 title and be sitting here? Was there a moment in
the season that you were like -- everything kind of clicked and you were like,
wow?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah.  
  
JENNA BURDETTE: Yes.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Yeah, I would say when we had that week break from traveling
and right before we went down to Florida, I'd say the A&M game is when we were
like, all right, this is what we needed. This is who we are. We've got it.
From that point on, it was like: We're here. We're not going anywhere anytime
soon.  
  
Q. Jenna, you've played a lot of basketball. He mentioned being a part
of that Elite Eight run as a starter, freshman, sophomore year. This year you
have to deal with that injury. You're out quite a few games in February. What
was that experience like being on the bench? And more importantly, coming back
against St. Louis and then to the Atlantic 10 tournament? Was there something
that you maybe thought of or maybe something that changed from just your time
on the pine?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I don't think anything really changed. It was kind of a wake-
up call because I had never been injured before. So it made me think about
like I can do this rep a little harder because I might not be able to do the
next rep. I'd say it was a wake-up call that anything can happen.  
  
Q. JaVonna, with your ability to bring energy to the game, outside of a
lot of people think of scoring as how many points somebody had, you're able to
put the ball in the basket. But for you now as also a member of that Elite
Eight run, from a leadership standpoint, where do you feel like your game has
sort of come from your freshman year to where we are here now as a junior?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: So I feel like I (indiscernible) since my freshman year
because I was a mess too. I've gained a lot of confidence that I didn't have
before. I feel like my work ethic has grown and I've found ways to get the job
done other than, you know, if I didn't have confidence in scoring or
something, it was like, all right, you've got to bring it on defense, then my
defense would create my offense, or, all right, get this stop, dive on the
floor for the ball.  
  
Just working hard in all aspects of the game, even if somewhere on the
spectrum I'm falling short, just continue to give all my effort. I think I've
gotten better at that throughout the year.  
  
Q. You guys had that terrific win against Texas A &M, and a lot of
people saw that as the turning point. Was there another game in conference, or
maybe it was not even a game, to where you had that long winning streak, it
was like the ball rolling down the hill from a momentum standpoint? Is there
another point in the season where you felt really good about where you were
going, and having that idea that this is a championship-caliber team?  
JENNA BURDETTE: I would say it was off the court. We had a big team meeting
and we got to know each other on a personal level, and I think that helped us
grow together on the court, just seeing what we've all been through. I really
think that helped us to be where we are right now.  
  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: I definitely agree with that. Our closeness off the court
has helped with our chemistry on it.  
  
Q. Do you have the watch party set up for the UD men's game tonight?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: We'll watch them, sure.  
  
JENNA BURDETTE: We'll watch them.  
  
Q. Either one of you, I wanted to know what the team's perception is of
Tennessee. You look at their resumé, and they've got some really big wins, but
also some really bad losses. What is your perception of the opponents you're
facing?  
JAVONNA LAYFIELD: Well, we just go into it, and first we focus on what we can
do in order to win the game. But they're just another team. I mean, they're a
great team, you know, but can't get too caught up in how many wins they have,
how many losses they had. You just have to focus on yourself, go in and
execute your game plan and whatever we have to do in order to win the game.  
  
So they're a great team. At the end of the day, it's what we have to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Green.  
  
Q. Coach Green, you were on staff two years ago with the team when they
went to Regional semifinals -- I mean Regional finals, excuse me. Can you take
anything from that experience with this team into coming into the tournament
this year? I guess it's a two-part question. How are you feeling as first-year
head coach of this team going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, definitely I learned so much in those three years of making
the NCAA Tournament as an assistant, and obviously the run that we had in
2015. You learn just how we approached each game, how our prep was.  
  
But, again, like J and Jenna said, our preparation has been the same. We're
not going to change how we prepare, how we do things or really anything just
because you're in the NCAA Tournament now.  
  
I think that's something we did a really good job of on our run. Whether it
was UConn, Louisville, Kentucky or Iowa State that we played, our preparation
or mindset was the same.  
  
That was number one, to focus on Dayton and what do we have to do. Because at
the end of the day, it's about us and our execution. I think that was
something really big.  
  
I think you can sometimes get caught up in when you're in these tournaments
and, oh, it's Tennessee; oh, it's UConn. Yeah, they're great teams. Every team
you play this time of year is a great team. But you want to approach it with
the same mindset so your players aren't thinking "It's UConn" or "Oh, we're
playing Tennessee." That's really -- and, again, our schedule has helped
prepare them for that as well. So I learned a ton.  
  
To answer your second part, it's kind of funny because it doesn't feel that
different. It really hasn't felt that different all year. Yeah, I'm the head
coach now, but I'm really just in-the-moment type of person, so how do we
approach it, what is my mindset going into practice, what's our mindset going
into the game, how do we prepare, do we have everything that we need to have
done. So that's my mindset. I'm not thinking big picture, like, oh, we're in
the NCAA Tournament. I don't think that way. I'm just really focused on our
players and our preparation and are we going to be ready to go tomorrow at 4
p.m.  
  
Q. You guys have the one common opponent in Texas A &M. What is it from
watching A&M film when they played Tennessee and you guys played Tennessee?
What sort of things do you take away that is a positive for you and maybe not
so much of a positive for you?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, we're different than Texas A&M as well. So they play kind
of a different style than we play. But I think we can say, I think from our
players' perspective, it kind of helps, like we beat Texas A&M and they beat
Tennessee. Even though at the end of the day that doesn't matter.  
  
From the players' perspective, you can maybe look at it that way. As a
coaching staff, obviously, Tennessee has a lot of weapons. There's a lot of
things that we have to be really, really sharp on tomorrow to put us in a
position to win the basketball game.  
  
But just from a rebounding perspective, and Texas A&M does a really good job
with that, and that's something we've prided ourself on, is defending and
rebounding. I think we play a much faster pace than A&M plays. But the
emphasis of our defense, the emphasis of our rebounding, that's something that
they'd really do a great job of. We've really tried to take down that persona
as well.  
  
So I think that's a similarity. If we can do that and get out and run,
hopefully we'll get some easy transition baskets that can help us.  
  
Q. Do you think the depth of your team may be a key factor in this game?
Will you continue to push that tempo throughout with being able to go to your
bench?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, I think that's key. When you look at Tennessee and the
players that they have, you have to use your strength and try to get any
advantage that you can against a great team like they are.  
  
So, obviously, it's something we've done all year, and something we pride
ourselves in is our pace and our depth and trying to wear people down. Pushing
the pace no matter what. Make or miss, we're trying to push it. We're getting
up the floor and trying to score in six seconds or less.  
  
So that's what we do. That's who we are. That's not going to change. Hopefully
we can use that to our advantage and wear them down. But that's a tall task.
So we've got to be on our game. In order to run, you need the basketball, so
that's where the rebounding part is the biggest key, I think, to this game.  
  
Q. We've talked this year about the fact that JaVonna just brings a ton
of energy to the floor every time she steps on the floor. How much has her
progress and her emergence with how she's played this year, how much has
really kind of fed you guys? Talk a little about her contribution.  
COACH GREEN: J's huge for us. She's one person. I'm all about just the energy
and the intensity and digging down and defending and rebounding and doing all
the little things. That's what we preach. That's what I really want out of our
players, to have that pride and that passion and play with that heart.  
  
So she's kind of a kid that I love how she plays. You could look at a stat
sheet after the game, and you may not see this padded stats, but she does so
much for us. She's our glue. She keeps us -- she does all the dirty work. She
has to be out on the floor.  
  
If you look at her -- I don't know how many minutes she even averages, but
there are certain games that I don't like to have her off the floor just
because of that. She's also someone that I trust. She'll run through a wall
for you. She'll do anything for you. I think her confidence has grown so much.  
  
She's the type of kid I'll say: Ja, you need to pick it up. We need to go get
some offensive rebounds. And she'll literally go in the next however many
possessions and get three offensive boards. I wish she'd do that from the
start and I didn't have to yell at her to do it. But she does it. She's that
type of a player. I love that about her.  
  
Q. Talking about Jenna's injury in February, your team was also trying
to win an Atlantic 10 regular season championship, and you did fairly well
without your point guard. But were you able to see sort of what she brings to
the table in the Atlantic 10 Tournament? For your squad, though, did you learn
something about your unit without your starting point guard?  
COACH GREEN: Most definitely. Because when Jenna -- when our trainer came in
and told me that Jenna was hurt, your mind just is like, okay, this is our
starting point guard that's been the starting point guard at Dayton since our
freshman year. Played every minute. She missed one game her freshman year when
she had a broken nose. The kid's tough as nails. She didn't want to stop that
game. And she played with a mask the rest of the game.  
  
Losing her, you just lose so much. So as any coach would be, you're a little
concerned. We don't have necessarily a true point guard as our back-up. So I
learned so much. Our team, they're such a team.  
  
What I tell them is our strength is our strength because we're so together.
One person is having a bad day, well, someone else will pick it up. You can
see that throughout our games. We've had someone different off the bench
always have a good game. I give so much credit to Lauren and to Kelley that
stepped up, especially Lauren, and started at the point guard for that span
of, what, five games.  
  
We had tough games in there. To be able to go out and sustain and win games
with not having a so-called true point, and losing, really, the motor behind
everyone and your leader out on the floor, that's a testament to our players
and their togetherness.  
  
No one ever felt sorry for anyone, and it was never like, oh, what are we
going to do? Is this what we're doing? Is this how we're playing? We do what
we do. We do what we do and go out there and get it done.  
  
I think they really rallied around it and they played for her. In hindsight, I
think it made us better. It gave a lot more people confidence and more
minutes, and I think we're better because of that. You saw in the A-10
Tournament, I thought we played our best basketball of the season. Everyone
was really, really together, just really knowing their roles and accepting
them and doing them at a high level.  
  
Q. With really not having a big go-to scorer like those two were, does
that make this team -- does it make this team that much tougher to guard,
different look?  
COACH GREEN: I think we're a different look than we have been all year, and I
think that's why you saw early on we were running some of the same action and
offenses that we ran and what I ran when I was here as an assistant.  
  
But after learning our personnel, and that's where the timing was a little bit
harder when I got the job, because I didn't have that time to really evaluate
and say, okay, this is what we should run. After seeing that and then the
girls talk about that 11-day span where we kind of called our new season, and
we're 19-3 since then, is when we changed our offense.  
  
I think our offense fits our personnel a lot better. We don't have an Andrea
Hoover, we don't have an Ally Malott where if you need a basket they're going
to break you down or Ally can go inside out.  
  
We have our bigs, and they don't shoot threes. We have guards that are good
coming off screens and coming off staggers to shoot. So we put them in a
position to have the most success. And that was by what we're running now.  
  
So in a way, you could look at it that, oh, you don't have your star players,
but we've also had a lot of success as a true team and not knowing who is
going to pick it up. But we also have our staples. Jennifer, that's our
staple. Saicha's been a staple, J's been a staple in her own regard. And you
have Kelley Austria who at the end of the day has been one of the best players
to ever play at Dayton. If she wants to score, she can score whenever she
wants to. She just sometimes needs to be encouraged a little bit to shoot,
where you don't have to tell Andrea Hoover to shoot that much. Kelley, I'm
still telling her every day: Shoot it, shoot it, be aggressive.  
  
So I think we're different, but I think still you've got to pick your poison
with how you guard us. We hit shots, and we have a chance to compete with
anyone.  
  
Q. With coming in late and getting rolling right into the season and
everything, what kind of a whirlwind it's been, have you had a chance to take
a breath and go "wow" at everything you guys have accomplished in the season
so far? I mean, is it still kind of middle-of-the-cycle type of thing?  
COACH GREEN: It's kind of middle of the like what do I have next, like grind
mentality. Having the time off after the A-10 Tournament, we haven't played
now in, what, almost two weeks. I told the team to really enjoy it and to take
it in, because that's something. To win the A-10 regular season and to win the
A-10 Conference Tournament, it has not been done at Dayton.  
  
We've done a lot of really good things in this program in the past. There's
been great players, great coaches that have built this into what this program
is, but no one has ever done that. I think that's -- I wanted them to truly
understand what they did and to truly be proud and enjoy it. Because sometimes
it's all: Well, we've got to do this next or we've got to do that next. I
really want them to enjoy this.  
  
This is not something -- maybe for your Tennessees and your UConns and whoever
of the world, this is every year they want to be in the Final Four, in the
Elite Eight. It's special to be in this tournament. It's not a right. It's a
privilege to be here, and they earned it. I mean, they worked hard for it. And
they went through a lot of adversity this year that a lot of people don't
know, from personal stuff to team. They've been through so much.  
  
So I told them: Enjoy this thing. Enjoy every second of it. We'll get back to
work. I sometimes maybe should take my own advice and enjoy it a little bit
more. But I've really been on the grind mentality. I think after the season is
when myself and our staff, they can step back and say, man, we did a lot this
year when a lot of people didn't expect us to do that. People kind of, I
think, have not given us, you know -- I don't want to say respect, but maybe
they didn't think that we could do this. So I'm really proud of our team.
Really, really proud of our team.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fact that it's been sort of a whirlwind. But you
were involved in this program throughout a lot of wins, NCAA Tournament trips.
Then you spent a year at Northwestern. Is there something in particular that
you've been able to take away from your experience at Northwestern that you've
been able to bring here to Dayton?  
COACH GREEN: Yeah, that's a good question. I think, number one, to appreciate
what we have at Dayton and how Dayton does stuff. Just the high level of
commitment they have to women's basketball too. I'm not saying that because of
Northwestern. Absolutely great administration. I absolutely loved my time at
Northwestern. But just the fans and the support, it's really, really special.
It's a really, really special place to come out and play in front of 2,500 to
3,000 people every night. Not everywhere, I know -- Louisville does well, and
a lot of the Power Fives do well, but that's special to have that.  
  
So I really appreciated just the tradition that we have here. And I think
that's the biggest thing. Just really you kind of -- we didn't make the
tournament last year at Northwestern, and Dayton didn't either. But that was
something that you go there three years in a row and you kind of get used to
it and you think, oh, you're just supposed to be here. You don't have that for
a year, and you're like -- you want it. You get that taste. Especially after
the Elite Eight, you want to be back there. Once you get in, you never know
what happens.  
  
So I think that's just appreciating it and the opportunity to be here. I also
learned from a great coach in Coach McKeown who has won over 600-some games
and has been to the NCAA Tournament a lot of times. I've learned a ton from a
veteran coach that helped me a lot.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Jasmine Joyner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33155)

### [Chelsey Shumpert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33156)

### [Queen Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33157)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsey, since you're kind of close to home here, are you going to
have friends or family coming out tomorrow?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yes, ma'am. I'm going to have a lot of family that travelled
from Ohio, Kentucky of course and a few from (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Does that make you more excited, more nervous?  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: No, I played in my hometown earlier this season. So, no.  
  
Q. Jasmine, what do you remember from playing Louisville earlier this
year in November?  
JASMINE JOYNER: I know they're a long team, very athletic, very quick. So we
had problems with our press breakers the first time, but we've been working on
it since then. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Same question for Queen.  
QUEEN ALFORD: Louisville is the type of team that wants to speed up the game,
and I think this game we have to definitely slow down and see the floor very
clear. That will make a huge difference in the outcome.  
  
Q. For any of you, I'll have each of you answer having played here
before, and having Louisville have the home court advantage, and having played
here before and knowing how tough it is, is that changing how you guys are
approaching the game at all?  
JASMINE JOYNER: We're just approaching the game how we'd normally approach the
game. I mean, nothing different. Like I said, we've matured from last time,
became tougher. So we just worked on little things that we were just going
through from the last game. But we're just going to approach it like any other
game.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, basically what she said. I mean, it's tough for
playing away rather than home court. But if we keep on playing how we know how
to play, I think we'll get it.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: For me personally, I don't think it has anything to do with us
playing Louisville the first time. It has everything to do with who we played
in our non-conference schedule that's going to prepare us for this moment.  
  
Q. What are some of the best examples of teams you played this season
and how you want to play?  
QUEEN ALFORD: I want to say UConn. UConn is a team you can look at, you can
pick from, and you can get better with just looking at and just playing
against. I think that was one of the best teams that we played.  
  
Q. We'll go down the line again -- Jasmine, Chelsey, Queen, if you could
talk about playing in the NCAA Tournament this time of year and how it's a
special way to close out a season?  
JASMINE JOYNER: It's a blessing to be able to be here again. I've been here
every four years, so that's a really good blessing. It's my senior year, so I
don't want to take advantage of it, so, like I said, we've been working hard
in the gym just trying to make an appearance in the NCAA and maybe go to the
second round. So like I said, we've been working hard, and being here is a big
blessing.  
  
CHELSEY SHUMPERT: Yeah, I've been here -- this is my fourth year as well. You
know, we're just driving to go to the second round and have a different
outcome and different mentality than we've had in the past.  
  
QUEEN ALFORD: I agree with them. I think it's a huge blessing and an honor to
be here and to be in this position again. Here we are, 365 days later. We have
the same opportunity. I think it's an honor to be given another chance to do
something different.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Coach, defense for you has been pretty solid all year. Are you trying
to change your approach at all going into the tournament? Are you just going
to stay with what's been working?  
COACH FOSTER: We'll just be who we are, who we've become more so.  
  
Q. Coach, do you mind sharing some of your thoughts about this match-up
again, and when you look back to November at that all --  
COACH FOSTER: As little as possible. We weren't a very good basketball team
when we played here. We played three games here. We were in the process. We
had a point guard who had never been a point guard, and then she got injured,
actually in the Louisville game, and missed a couple games.  
  
Then sort of felt -- my analogy was we were in the spin cycle of a washing
machine, and we couldn't practice because we had games it seemed like every
other day, and we were playing sort of the cream of the crop.  
  
So when that cycle stopped, and we hit the bottom of the machine, we started
to become a pretty good basketball team. We figured out who we were, and the
point guard started to behave like one, like she'd done it for a lot of years,
instead of half a year, and the freshmen played with a lot of confidence. The
upperclassmen figured stuff out. So we got to be a pretty good basketball
team.  
  
Q. Has there been a single factor in that? Has there been something
that's been the biggest difference maker in your eyes?  
COACH FOSTER: I just think it's the resilience and toughness of the players
starting to evolve. Because, you know, we scheduled -- we opened the season at
Rutgers, and then we had Florida and Indiana, and then the schedule got tough.
We played Connecticut and Notre Dame and Louisville and Green Bay and Florida
Gulf Coast. We played a very ambitious schedule.  
  
I think the players learned quickly we're not as good as we need to be. We
need to get better. They walked into this gym with that mentality. It's
amazing what can start to happen when players want to be coached and want to
come in the gym and work hard.  
  
Q. What does Louisville do well, and how are you going to defend that?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they have two dominant players and a bunch of role
players. And the role players accept their roles, and the dominant players
like their dominance. So we've got to guard them accordingly.  
  
Q. They were very complimentary on your defense when they were in here
for the press conference. The shot blocking in particular they remember. I
think you had seven or one player had seven. Talk about your defense?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, I think we're an eclectic defensive team. We change on the
fly. We sometimes go into a game with a game plan and five or six minutes into
the game decide we're going in another direction based upon how that team is
choosing to attack us. We've become versatile enough to do that.  
  
So we have some thoughts and ideas going into the game, but we are very
willing to change them relative to how they're going to come after us.  
  
Quite frankly, we need to take care of the ball. We didn't do that here. Did
we guard them here? I don't think we were very good with the ball. And we've
become a lot better with it.  
  
Q. Jasmine and her shot blocking, is that something with her size and
her arms?  
COACH FOSTER: No, I don't think -- if it were that easy, there would be a lot
of shot blockers. First of all, I think you need to be extremely disciplined.
Secondly, I think you need a group of referees that understand.  
  
I remember -- I've been around a long time, and Dee Kantner, who is one of our
best officials, was doing a game at Vanderbilt at that time. I had a 6'10"
player, and it seemed she would get in foul trouble, and I remember Dee
standing there next to me one day, because that's where we were at Vanderbilt,
and I sort of informed her that women can and should be allowed to block
shots.  
  
So I ran into Dee a couple years later, and she said: You know, your comment
to me, I would go in the mirror before games and I would look in the mirror
before the game as I was warming up and say "Women can block shots. Women can
block shots."  
  
So just letting you know we've got a woman that can block shots. She's pretty
good at it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Quinnipiac - 85, Miami - 78  
  
COACH MEIER: That was just a great performance by Quinnipiac. I mean, just
phenomenal. The assisted field goals, I don't even know, what, 24-for-28,
percentages, but that was the one thing I was concerned about, and the one
thing we tried to disrupt. And, boy, did they find and hit. They found and
hit. And it wasn't lack of effort.  
  
On a couple of occasions perhaps lack of discipline, overexcited. But it still
takes incredible composure to hit it. I mean, we were scrambling them up and
they just stayed a very calm mind.  
  
Maybe if I watch the film I'm going to be really, really, really upset. I'm
very sad. Because I love my team so much I'm sad, because the community showed
up for us and the university stepped up for us, and I feel bad.  
  
I really wanted us to say thank you. And I'm just going to say thank you and I
don't think that we did a whole heck of a lot horribly. They just were really
special tonight. And I'm not surprised by it. But if we hadn't played as hard
as we did and have special performances, too, it could have been embarrassing.  
  
They were very, very special tonight. And at the handshake line I told Tricia,
she was being so classy and I said, go celebrate, my God, go celebrate with
your team. I appreciate the handshake but what a moment for you and what a
moment for them. And they're going to have a lot of people on their bandwagon
if they continue to play like that because that was really special.  
  
And then I'm going to try to talk about my seniors but I'm not going to get
through it because they're just awesome. So maybe I'll text y'all how I really
feel about them. But great careers. And special , special people.  
  
They carried the banner, and they did everything I needed from them. So I love
them and we're going to be in each other's lives forever. And this isn't the
end of our journey together, but it's the last time I got the honor and
pleasure to coach them. And that hurts a lot, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jessica, it seemed like every time you guys, like when Mot hit those
two free throws and it's a one-point game and they go hit a 3, there's so many
times in the game you guys closed in, and they just seemed to hit those shots.
What was that like emotionally for you guys? I mean, for the fans, it was a
roller coaster. What was it like for you guys?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think we were missing a lot of poise, like Coach mentioned.
So just for shooters to be open -- the coaches do a heck of a job on the
scouting report, and we know who the shooters are. We know who we have to
identify in transition, and who to look for, and who make sure doesn't get an
open look or open catch.  
  
For the shooters to be wide open with a late contested defender flying out at
them, I just think we were missing a lot of poise. But emotionally the game
moved so fast, they get a quick hit and we gotta make a quick run. So they
started off really well. They started off really hot, and we knew it could
either go two ways -- they'll cool down or they'll keep hitting. And they just
kept hitting. And like I said, we continued to let them keep getting open.  
  
Q. Jessica, with this team they have balanced scoring, nobody scores
more than 10.6 points. Did that make it tougher to defend them knowing they
didn't have one go-to score?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think that was a positive for us because we know how our
team defense can just bother a lot of people. So we knew nobody could take a
second off on any defensive possession. So, no, it didn't bother us.  
  
It didn't make it harder, but they're a really solid team from top to bottom
of the roster. So everybody plays their role really well, and they had another
great run tonight.  
  
Q. Jessica, how much energy got expended? It never got away, but you
guys were playing uphill it seemed like the whole time. Did that just wear you
guys down a bit too much, do you think?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I mean, it's a horrible position to be in. I think we were
down 13 at one point. And then we had to crawl our way back and fight our way
back. And then from there on, like, you still got a whole other half. We
brought it into two and then we still had a whole other quarter.  
  
But, I mean, there's been times where we've been up and there's been times
when we've been down, and tonight was another time we were down. And we were
looking forward to coming back making a big-time win. But it just didn't
happen like that.  
  
Q. Key, I know Jessica just talked a little bit about it, but what was
it like every time you guys pulled within one, every time you made a run, they
answered, usually with a 3. How frustrating was that from your perspective?  
KEYONA HAYES: It was a little frustrating. We were a little frustrated, but I
mean we kept pushing. We kept trying. We know what we're capable of and what
they're capable of. And we thought that we could do better.  
  
Q. Could both of you, as seniors, just talk about what went through your
minds at the very end there? I saw Jessica you were down on the ground, I'm
not sure where you were. But what were you feeling thinking about in those
final moments after the buzzer?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I just honestly didn't think this would be the last time I get
to play for Katie Meier.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Me too.  
  
JESSICA THOMAS: Disappointed just because I know how much we wanted it. Just
wanted, as seniors, we wanted to take this program somewhere it's never been.
So when that buzzer went off, and you try to fight to the end, but when that
buzzer went off, I really didn't see this conversation I'm having with you all
right now happening.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Like she said, I wasn't prepared for this either. I thought we
were -- we didn't overlook them but we thought we were going to go further
than what we did. And I wasn't expecting to have this conversation with you
guys either. And it's frustrating. It's hard, and it's like today is the last
time we'll ever wear a Miami jersey.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Meier.  
  
Q. The spurt at the end of the half when you got it from 13 to seven,
how vital did you think that was and what sort of boost --  
COACH MEIER: I thought Jessica was real special there in that stretch. And
there were some really, really special plays by some really, really special
players throughout the course of that game. When it came down to it, I think
they answered that huge 3 by Martucci, I think it was. That was a heck of an
answer.  
  
But even when she made it, it wasn't like, so. We still thought, okay, four-
point game. We had gone through all the scenarios. I don't think we were ever
deflated until that last foul and whatever, with the intentional. That was the
only time, I think, we just thought, well, we might be out of time here. But
it wasn't like we were playing a soft zone. I mean, they were really sharp,
really, really sharp.  
  
We did make some personnel mistakes, but not 100. I mean, you make one and
they find it and it's three points. And the quality of their passing, they're
right in the shooting pocket. So you can't be a second late. It's not like
they go and get the ball and bring it into their shooting pocket. They're on
time, on target with their passing game, and they were tonight. They were what
I saw on film. And they had tremendous poise.  
  
I'll tell you, they are -- that team tonight was very, very good and would
have beaten a lot of people. And we played well and got beat.  
  
Q. Katie, can you talk about the pressure defense? You had, the press,
and maybe something that you -- I know you don't look ahead, but you had
studied them in the time between games. You got some turnovers but also maybe
led to some open shots. Can you talk about your thought process behind that?  
COACH MEIER: Well, I think as Tim referenced, we were playing uphill. And so
we had a couple of different presses there. It wasn't the same one. We were
trying to do some schemes. And, you know, there were a couple of times we got
real excited because it worked and then we were down one and then we overran
something that -- we know better.  
  
But you know, they also were very balanced. And the pressure, then when we sat
back in our man and just let them isolate us, they were scoring on that, too.
So it was a certain point I was just thinking, let's just make sure we answer
because it could have gotten away from a lot of teams if they didn't --
Jessica had a career high tonight.  
  
This game could have gotten away from a lot of teams to combat 14 3s. Like I
said, we weren't sitting in the 2-3 zone saying, we dare you. We were
challenging their shots, too, and they were making them.  
  
To overcome that and still have a chance to win it or be within one on a
performance like that, I think, I'm disappointed but I gotta tell you, that
that's one of the -- that is really a lot of points to try to combat.  
  
Q. What's it say about the depth of women's basketball that -- sometimes
people say there isn't the depth, but this is a 12 seed that knocked off
Marquette and you guys? What does it say about the growth of the game and some
of the teams that people don't know much about?  
COACH MEIER: I think you're seeing it, like I said on Saturday, you're seeing
it on the women's side now, too, that you're starting to see on the men's side
-- you get a group that's real connected. They're veteran. They're well
coached. And they have a style that they are committed to and they don't waver
from it.  
  
And you're starting to see that pop up on the women's side too. So I guess it
says that, stylistically, you can win a lot of different ways in women's
basketball. And that's good, that's good for the sport, because I thought they
were two amazing styles. That had to be a wonderful game to watch on TV. I
mean, it was not boring. It was really a big-time basketball game.  
  
I just want to say, again, thank you for the administration and the community
and all the support we got, because I'll never forget that. It really meant a
lot. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 20, 2017

  

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Morgan Manz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33164)

### [Adily Martucci](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33165)

### [Aryn McClure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33270)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Quinnipiac - 85, Miami - 78  
  
COACH FABBRI: Good opening quarter for the Bobcats into halftime with a solid
lead. Miami made a great charge and almost an instant replay of the opening-
round game against Marquette. Just a great game. Great game I'm sure to watch,
one that we're thrilled obviously to win and move on to the Sweet 16.  
  
Can't say enough great things about Coach Katie Meier and her Miami team. But
I'm just so proud of our Bobcats and the way they battled and the way that
they again responded in the most difficult of situations on their home court,
not to lose the lead and make big plays again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, seemed like every time they either went on a mini run or
seemed poised to go on a run, you guys countered. And you were responsible
personally for a lot of those 3-pointers. And were you just feeling it
tonight, basically? Is it as simple as that?  
MORGAN MANZ: Yeah, I mean, my teammates and coaches, they all have the utmost
confidence in -- more confidence than I do in my shots. I just did what my
coaches have been asking me to do for the last four years, and that was just
shoot it. And I just let it fly because we had nothing to lose.  
  
Q. In the last 48 hours-plus, we've seen this team take, build up double
digits leads, time and time again the other team make a serious run. You never
relinquished a lead in either game. For each of the players, what's that been
like for you guys to withstand the onslaught of an attempted comeback that you
thwarted on two occasions?  
ARYN MCCLURE: Grit. Yeah, that's pretty much it. On both games, teams came
back, cut the lead kind of short. But we stayed focused and we knew our end
goal, and we just maintained our lead. And we end up being successful.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: Just to bounce off Aryn, I think we, in times that they weren't
going our way, we stayed together as a team and we really just fought it out.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's nothing that we haven't seen all year. And that's why we
are the team that we are, because of this whole season. And it has shaped us
into the players that we are today, the toughness that we have is incredible.  
  
I am so proud of my team. I'm so proud of my team because of how tough they
are.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you talk about your shot and the evolution of it? The
stroke seems obviously to work beautifully, like a long stroke, maybe like a
long follow-through. Could you talk about your evolution of your shot and as a
career night? And how long it took you to get here, the work that you put in?
Just talk about your shooting, please.  
MORGAN MANZ: I've always been a shooter growing up. My coaches always, all the
time, keep shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting. And honestly I feel like I
haven't hit a 3 in a very long time, the last couple of games. Even today in
shoot-around, I was missing, and Coach is, like, just keep shooting, just keep
shooting.  
  
And the one thing I focused on today was getting it higher than I usually do,
because when I do miss, I have a very flat shot. So my goal was the more arc
and obviously it helped.  
  
Q. Morgan, I know the thinking all season was get to the tournament, win
a game, see what happens. Now that it's over and you've won these two, how
realistic, really, was this for you guys when you saw the bracket, knowing
that you would have to beat two major conference teams to get out of -- to get
to Stockton? How realistic did you really think it was?  
MORGAN MANZ: I think we just came in here with a lot of confidence. I have
confidence in all of our players and our coaching staff. They prepare us well
for each game. And we didn't look at the team name on their shirts. It was we
were going to play Quinnipiac basketball, and we were going to do what we can.
And if we had to adjust, we had to adjust.  
  
And, I think, I mean, I am at a loss of words that we're at a Sweet 16, but I
couldn't be more proud of our team and what we've accomplished.  
  
Q. Adily, Morgan hit a lot of 3s, but the one you hit with less than a
minute left, the one-point game, you take us through that shot? And how did
you -- did it feel good coming out of your hands?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I honestly didn't know it was going in. I was definitely
hoping for the best. But once I saw it release my hand, I kind of knew it was.
And obviously I got excited afterwards. But yeah, it was just amazing that it
went in, and I was obviously very, very pumped about it.  
  
Q. Last night you're outside of your hotel. It's close to one in the
morning. And it's the second time in the last couple of weeks that it's
happened. Did you ever think that it was maybe a good luck charm?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Some of our teammates are saying that. It was actually funny.
We were just making a joke of it because it did happen during the MAAC
Tournament. We had a fire alarm and we were all outside waiting to get back
in. So we were like, hey, this happened before. Deja vu basically. So, yeah,
we were joking about that. But it panned out the way it did.  
  
Q. For all three of you, I know you're a confident team; you've won,
what, 29 games now. But are you feeling more confident now given what you've
accomplished here and going forward now to face South Carolina?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. I think every game that we win we build more
confidence. It's kind of hard not to.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: Yeah, I have to agree with Addy. I think we have a lot of
confidence right now, and we're just going to take the next game like the next
game.  
  
ARYN MCCLURE: Yeah, the goal at the beginning of the season was to make it to
the Sweet 16. Now we made it, so why not keep going.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's honestly addicting. It really is. Something about this
tournament, you just want more and more and more. And we're going to try to
get some more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously this game is beyond great for the program, for you and the
players. Can you also look at it as being good for the sport itself, women's
basketball, with the parity we talked about yesterday, and a 12 beating a 4
and all that kind of stuff?  
COACH FABBRI: I think anytime you can get a new name moving forward in a
bracket creates an excitement. And that's really, ultimately, what the March
Madness is about, right, when you have those upsets and what everyone looks
forward to. And the buzz that it has created and what it's become -- the
excitement. And that's what everyone looks forward to. And we're happy to do
our part in creating the March Madness and move it forward.  
  
But definitely, again, I think we flew under the radar getting into the
tournament. And I just saw the teams in our pod and really liked our
opportunities down here. So this team was very confident coming into the
tournament, coming down here to see our opponents and made the most of real
opportunities down here this weekend.  
  
Q. You're supposed to be a hockey school. And you kind of shot some
holes in that one over the last three days. I know you're not going to be on
campus for long, but what do you think the reaction is going to be when you
get back up there?  
COACH FABBRI: I think it is going to be over-the-moon thrilled. The outpouring
of support that we have received while we've been down here has been like none
other that I've ever witnessed.  
  
And I know that when we get back to campus and what's going on back there, the
buzz, the buzz up there has been incredible. So we're excited to get back and
see everybody.  
  
So they love their women's basketball. I mean, us going down to the
tournament. They already expected us to win. You know, our fans expect us to
win. So that was almost like no surprise to them. They were excited to see
what happened tonight.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, when Katie was in here, she said in the handshake
line you were trying to keep it so together. And she had to say to you, please
go enjoy this, please go celebrate. In that immediacy, what was that moment
like for you?  
COACH FABBRI: Be professional. Be professional. Be professional. Go down the
line. Shake the hands, congratulate them on a good season. Obviously there's a
disappointment. But do the right thing, and then get into the locker room with
your team, and then that's where you have your moment with your team.  
  
Q. In the beginning of the third quarter, your team picked up a couple
of fouls real quick and you had Adily and Jen on the bench with four. How do
you make sure your team doesn't get discouraged and stays disciplined?  
COACH FABBRI: It's what we've done -- I think we sound redundant, as a broken
record. Again, this team has epitomized a true team. I'm up here because I
have head coach. But I have an incredible staff. It's a team.  
  
I have to remind everybody, we didn't have a player named on the first-team
All-MAAC because on any given night, I think the debate that hurts us is,
you'll talk to coaches in the league, that it was a different player on a
different night that had a big game.  
  
And for those who are not as familiar with the program, you see that tonight.
Jen was great at first, had the hot hand. Then Morgan had the hot hand. And
then you had the mainstays that always chip in and do it. But we do it
together on defense. And it's whoever is going to get the ball and put the
ball in the basket.  
  
The team is so unselfish -- we ultimately epitomize what a team is. They can't
take away two or three people and beat us. And that's why we win a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a very good passing team. You had 24 assists today.
What did you think early on, maybe it might have been first minute or two,
Miami goes into a press, pretty much full court -- did you think that played
into your hands? What were you thinking?  
COACH FABBRI: Well, that's a tendency of theirs to do. I thought they came at
it a little harder. I think they saw some things on film that they thought
they might be able to do and have some success. But it does allow us to get
out. And go once we took a deep breath against the press, it allowed us to get
out in transition and really score and get us going offensively in transition
for some good looks and open up a nice lead.  
  
Q. Coach, you started the Gold Rush four or five years ago, and that
kind of propelled you guys on to the mid-major scene. Have you ever thought
about the irony, that you've gotten to your goal and you didn't use that these
two games?  
COACH FABBRI: No, because we've played players all year long that were in a
position to make the play when we needed it the most. And Morgan is a perfect
example of get the ball, look at the rim and take and make the shot. So I
think it's developing players who are comfortable to be in a position to get
the ball to make the play.  
  
We got out on the 5 and 5, and still had its benefits even tonight, because
it's everybody else who has the ball in their hand, like, we don't turn the
ball over. It's not just two people who are touching the ball. It's everybody
touching the ball.  
  
You saw us multiple times adjusting what we were doing with the pressure --
bringing the ball up the floor and how versatile we are. And, again, it's just
having kids that have experience that put them in positions that -- we've run
things through these two people. We run things through everybody. But we know
who we want to have the ball when it's going to be on the line.  
  
But it's them being confident to go out when it counts the most in situations
when people are in foul trouble, to go make plays. And that's what you saw in
two games, when we were managing foul trouble.  
  
And we were out there with four forwards and a guard. And I was, like, going,
okay you be the 2, you be the 3. And I couldn't keep it straight, and everyone
else is trying to keep it straight. That's why we're good because we have that
versatility and we play a lot of players.  
  
Q. How surprised were you when you turned the corner in the locker room
and got that shower from your team?  
COACH FABBRI: I saw it on the monitor. I was hot. I got cooled down, so I was
happy to get it.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate any trouble keeping your kids in the moment? I mean
Sweet 16, it's a lofty, wonderful place, of course. But do you guys expect any
problem keeping their minds on what's coming Saturday and not really much more
than that?  
COACH FABBRI: Ladies?  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We're focused and ready to go.  
  
COACH FABBRI: We are going to enjoy this. And then we will get focused and get
down to work and stay in our routine with what we've done all year long and
get prepared to see South Carolina.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH MEIER: Well, we've been busy. We've been busy sense you last saw me. And
the kids, I think they're well rested, but the coaching staff has been
grinding it out. It's a heck of a challenge. We had not looked ahead to either
opponent. So from the minute that buzzer sounded, we moved on; and Quinnipiac
is very good. Of course, they're extremely well coached. They have great
mental discipline. They have great balance in terms of the who, where, when
and why is very well done. It's very, very well done.  
  
The players just got their first look at them, but you gotta really see a full
game to understand how unselfish they are and how impressive they are in
sharing the basketball and just taking whatever matchup or whatever shot is
the best shot for them. So it's a very, very tough matchup for us. But of
course it is. I mean there's 32 teams left, and we're one of them, and nothing
is going to be easy.  
  
So we're excited. We are definitely realistic. We're not too high, we're not
too low. We're not considering this some, oh, we're so happy that there was an
upset and we play -- no. No, no, no. We watched that game and a very, very
good team beat a very, very good team, and one of them we were going to play
if we were fortunate enough to beat a very, very good team. And so there's
extra excitement or energy or anything. We're still in business mode. And we
gotta fix some mistakes from last night in a very short amount of time.  
  
But we made some big-time plays. We had a lot of pressure on us and we made
some big-time plays when it mattered. And you don't know who's going to do it.
The other team does not know who on Miami is going to be -- you know, make
those plays, and I think that makes us pretty special, too.  
  
Q. Laura, when you looked at yesterday, just what did they take away
from the perimeter game, because it seemed like -- obviously everyone knows 1
for 14 from three, but it just didn't seem like a lot of those looks were real
clean either. What did they take away and how much are you expecting maybe a
bounceback from the outside tomorrow?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I think Florida Gulf Coast did a great job on their scouting
report. They know who were our shooters. They pressured us. So I think they
did a great job, but you know, we know what we are. We know -- you know, our
shooters keep shooting. So it's not that we are discouraged or whatever by
yesterday's game, because I think we were 1 for 14 and we still won the game.
So you know, that shows our balance; if we can't score from outside, we score
from inside. So you know, and tomorrow we'll just keep shooting, because you
know, shooters shoot.  
  
Q. Key, yesterday you guys had a nice lead, Quinnipiac had a nice lead.
Both of you guys had to weather those late pushes. How much do you think that
was just composure coming into play for both of you guys that you were able to
weather what you did in Gulf Coast and what they did in Marquette?  
KEYONA HAYES: Can you ask the question again, please?  
  
Q. Just how much do you think it was composure that helped you guys kind
of hang on when Florida Gulf Coast made their run and the experience of having
been there? Quinnipiac had the same thing. They had a nice lead against
Marquette. It got away from them. They still managed to hang on. So how much
do you think composure came into play for both of you guys yesterday?  
KEYONA HAYES: I think a lot of composure was there. We were up and we let a
big lead go, and I just think that, you know, we kind of relaxed, and maybe
they relaxed as well, and then it's like, okay, let's -- we don't want to
lose. No one wants to be out. So I think we all -- like them and us just were
like, okay, take it a play at a time. We were up. So we know what to do to get
back to do what we have to do to win the game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, I don't know how much you've seen of
Quinnipiac this year or if you've seen the film from yesterday or if you've
watched film on them. If you have, what do you know about them and what kind
of challenges they might present?  
EMESE HOF: We watched the third quarter yesterday before our own game, and
they were just a really energetic team. They were really unselfish, like
everything that was going on. They had a really good game yesterday. We just
got out of the film room and we saw some more breakdown. They're a good team,
but we are too, so we'll be ready for them.  
  
Q. Emese, when you came here, how much did you dream about moments like
what's coming tomorrow night, a chance on your own floor to go to the Sweet
16? I guess how much of a lure, I guess, was that for you when you decided to
come here?  
EMESE HOF: Like for me, back home those are not terms you heard about. It's
not even like real touchable. I've never been in the United States before I
went on any of my visits here. So to be able to, yeah, live that American
dream almost, it's great. And it's just fantastic to get an opportunity like
that.  
  
Q. You do know what those terms mean now?  
EMESE HOF: I definitely do. (Laughs.)  
  
Q. Katie, can you just sort of give us a tick tock as to what the last
18 hours have kind of been like, and was there any sleep involved for you last
night?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. It took me a while to come down from that game. I think I
really, really tried to keep it together, so when it's over -- my heart rate
was fine during the game. It's amazing when you watch it again, then I know
how everyone else felt that was texting me the thousand texts, because I was
like, what's the big deal? It's the next play, and then you watch it and
you're like, oh, my God. That was really something.  
  
So it took me a while to come down from that. But the staff, we gathered at
the hotel at about 8:30 and started our work. So we didn't stay here. We got
away, because I knew it might take me a little bit, and got back to the hotel.
I just thought all eyes on Quinnipiac, really focused. We met again this
morning. You know, about four films I've watched between the game and now, and
I'm comfortable with it. I think we're in good shape.  
  
But it's not a time for sleep. I'm sleeping so that I don't snap on you all.
(Laughs). The sleep is so that I remain human. But it's not the priority. As
long as I keep my wits about myself and my staff, we're all on the same page,
the priority is preparation right now.  
  
Q. Kate, the 9:00 start, does that give you -- were you happy with it,
just maybe them getting some extra rest or is it the whole think about it all
day before you get on the court?  
COACH MEIER: Right. We're going to do the same routine for a 7:00 game. We're
just going to bounce it back a couple of hours. And you know, I don't know,
whatever gets a crowd here. I really, really hope that our crowd can come.  
  
I don't think if we're looking for that to knock us off track, then we're not
the team I thought we were. We're going to be highly focused. We're very clear
that we don't think we played our best basketball game yesterday, and we still
haven't played that perfect game. But it's coming, and we have won in one
thousand different ways, and we're going to have to find a way to win
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Laura, like Emese said, they were just terms to her, things like
Sweet 16. How aware were you of what the NCAA tournament was and all that goes
with it before you came over here?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, I've been prolonging it for a couple of years now. They
actually show March Madness on TV back home, so that's awesome.  
  
But you know, it's just really special to host, first of all. And I'm just
really grateful that we have a chance to play another 40 minutes here in front
of our own fans, and we're just trying to take it one game at a time. I mean
Sweet 16 is close now, but you know, the only thing we have at the end of the
day is 40 more minutes of basketball. So yeah. But we're ready.  
  
Q. Key, Katie and talked about this the other day, just having the
vision that this program has at this moment. You signed on when this wasn't --
you know, when this was what the goal was. Has it played out the way you've
envisioned, and again, what would it mean just to have it be that moment
tomorrow for you as one of the seniors on this team?  
KEYONA HAYES: As in winning tomorrow? It'll be great. I mean we've never made
it to the Sweet 16. Growing up for everybody, it's a dream to continue to go
up and be in the Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four. That's what every basketball
player dreams of. It'll be amazing for us to reach Sweet 16, and go further.  
  
But like Laura said, it's one step at a time, one game at a time.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just give us your breakdown of what you've seen from
Quinnipiac on film or in person, what challenges they present?  
COACH MEIER: I mean that's the thing. That's what we talked about in the
locker room. There's no thing out there. There's no, whatever, Sweet 16 thing
out there that we're going after. We've got a heck of an opponent. And they
are -- they don't fear anyone. Tricia and I spent some time together in
Portugal this summer watching her kid, my three, and I was impressed by her
confidence. You know, they're very confident. They don't back down for anyone,
and they have a chip on their shoulder. They feel like they're an underrated
mid major. They are an underrated mid major. I mean they're major as far as
I'm concerned. And so they don't have to worry about us disrespecting them
because that's not going to happen. They're awfully good, and they've been
good; and she's been a heck of a coach for a long time, and she knows what
she's doing. So that's where we're at.  
  
Q. What was in Portugal?  
COACH MEIER: It was the European championship. Laura and Emese and Serena were
there. And Tricia was there with Paula Strautmane. She's playing from Latvia.  
  
Q. Katie, you look at them, and to kind of touch on Tricia again a
little bit, too. Carly Fabbri, is she the prototypical coach on the floor?  
COACH MEIER: Yes. It is a mini me out there. It really is. She's really smart,
knows what to do with the ball. Completely just the moxie that Tricia has you
see in her daughter, too. So they're fueled. They are fueled by a belief that
is pretty special. And this isn't some fairytale for them. They completely
expect to be here and they completely expected to beat Marquette. And I knew
that. I knew that when I saw the brackets come out.  
  
Q. 12:55, obviously. There were some other really good games, UConn and
Baylor did what they did, but are you seeing that gap from 1 to 64 start to
condense maybe a little bit more?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. And I think stylistically it's really something to -- and I
think that that's -- you see it on the men's side a ton, and now you see it on
the women's side, that you make certain choices in recruiting. I'm not -- the
power conferences, that's not my term, but that's how I can just relate it to
you, that they're going to recruit in a certain way and then other certain
conferences recruit a totally different way, and then you gotta meet up in a
really important thing.  
  
We've spent two months not playing against a certain style, and then poof,
your first couple of rounds here it comes. And you see it on the men's side,
too. They have a hard time, the bigs get neutralized a little bit. And that's
what I thought Gulf Coast tried to do to us. They tried to neutralize our
bigs, saying we have this style that you haven't seen because we see a lot of
these kind of bodies in the ACC, and then you come into this moment, and I
just think it takes a real maturity to sort of reinvent your defensive schemes
and then to figure out how to make sure that we got our way, that we got our
bigs in the paint where we need them.  
  
And Quinnipiac and Gulf Coast are just so established, they're just such
established programs that they go out of conference and they play against our
style a lot more than we play against their style. That's what they do in the
nonconference. And we went and played Ohio State, and Kentucky and St. John's,
we didn't play that style so much. So that was a real task and it's a task
again for Monday and maybe that's something we keep in mind scheduling moving
forward.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Jen Fay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33235)

### [Adily Martucci](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33165)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the 12th seeded Quinnipiac Bobcats the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference champions and they defeated Marquette, 68-65. We have
Coach Tricia Fabbri, Carly Fabbri, Adily Martucci and Jen Fay up here.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: Yesterday was certainly an exciting day for our team, our
alumni, our fans and the university. It was a great day. Once we were able to
relax and enjoy a little bit we certainly buckled down and got to work on our
next opponent once we found out that it was going to be Miami. Our focus and
attention has been on Miami since last night. Today we woke up ready, all
ready to film and scout and prepare for the Hurricanes tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jen, you said you have done film and scout already, right? Obviously,
they exploited inside yesterday and you guys had some success in the paint as
well. How important do you see that battle being tomorrow?  
JEN FAY: Yeah, I think they're a very different team than Marquette. They're
more physical and obviously bigger. We've played against a lot of teams that
been bigger than us throughout the season, so we're going to use our speed and
try and run the floor and I think that will help us.  
  
Q. Your stated goal at the start of the season you wanted to win an NCAA
Tournament game make history that way. Now that you've done that do you have
to guard against any let-down, not being as amped for tomorrow, or do you
think that will not be an issue?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We're amped for this game tomorrow, there is no let-up. At the
very least we wanted one win and tomorrow is another day to make more history.
That's what it is.  
  
Q. Carly, what's it like playing for your mom?  
CARLY FABBRI: It's been a great experience. I think the opportunity for us to
have made history together is really awesome. Not a lot of people can say they
have, A, won game in the tournament; and, B, done it playing for their mom. So
that's really cool. I think she has kept it very professional, coach and
player on the court, off the court obviously it's a bit of a different
relationship than everybody else has. An awesome experience and trying to keep
it going tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, Miami does make some threes, they didn't show it yesterday
obviously but they can shoot threes. Their guards were kept in check all game.
Do you sort of expect more of a bounce-back from them tomorrow? When you saw
their tapes, what jumped out about their guard play?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I expect them to come out with everything. We're just ready to
defend whatever they're going to throw out at us. We expect the best game from
the guards probably that they'll every play.  
  
Q. For Jen, you guys obviously pulled off an upset yesterday and Florida
Gulf Coast gave Miami a scare. Do you see more parity in the women's game?  
JEN FAY: I think it's awesome because night in and night out any team can beat
anybody and that showed. So Florida Gulf Coast is a great team and it was a
close game and it was a lot of fun.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like when you woke up this morning? Did you have
to pinch yourself and say, hey, we're going to play Monday night for a chance
to play in the Sweet 16?  
CARLY FABBRI: I think we all knew this was an attainable goal. Obviously,
still waking up in Miami is an amazing, but I think we have the opportunity to
get to the Sweet 16. But as much as it may seem "dream-like" it's a real on
that we can attain. We are enjoying the experience but also having the
mentality that this is a business trip for us.  
  
Q. How do you balance focusing on yourselves rather than the opponent?
Which takes precedence?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: All season long we have been focusing on ourselves. All that
matters is us being our best all the time. That's the reason I think we've
been so successful is not really worry being our opponent. Knowing our scout
but definitely focusing on being the best version of us every day.  
  
Q. You probably got a sense this was coming. What's it like coaching
Carly? What's that experience been like for you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: It's been -- I've been so fortunate to have coached as long as
I have and have had so many incredible young ladies come through the doors at
Quinnipiac. Having your own daughter share in that experience has just added
to really putting the cherry on top for me.  
  
I sit up here with Jen Fay, Adily Martucci and Carly Fabbri and every lady
that's down here with me and for 22 years that I have coached has been a part
of this experience and has helped us achieve what we have achieved this
weekend. Every single one of those young ladies, it's been a privilege to
coach.  
  
But to share this moment with your daughter is pretty awesome. But to share it
with Adily and Jen and this team it's history. It's hard to put into words.
It's certainly -- it's really, really nice.  
  
Q. Late last night we find out that it's a 9:00 start. What is the
challenge of that? Do you want them to get extra rest, thinking about it all
day? How do you manage those where you've got to wait all day to play this
game?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Great question. First of all, it was actually really exciting
because to me Monday night at 9:00 kinda seems like it's the big Monday!
Certainly prime time and where we want to be. Two, the time and the start with
it being a long day, look at the weather in Miami, not a bad spot to be.  
  
The third component, the rest, is really, really important with the pace,
physicality of the game yesterday and at the point where you are in the season
the time, the recovery, and the ability to relax right now with the quick
turn-around, even with the press conference, the film and the scout, I think
that's all key. So I don't think we're going to mind the 9:00 start at all. I
think that time is going to help us.  
  
Q. Ally tweeted congratulations to you guys after the game yesterday.
I'm sure there were others from the MAAC as well. What's that mean that you
spent four months trying to smash each other's heads in yesterday but what was
the response from the MAAC?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Honestly, I have barely touched my phone and looking with
everybody reaching out, but from the administration, the administrators of the
MAAC and my colleagues in the MAAC, the support that we received was
overwhelming from everybody on the thread and really that is what I have found
to be truly unique in my experience at coaching in the MAAC is the comradery
among the coaches and that is what I truly value coaching in the MAAC was the
tweet and from everybody reaching out.  
  
From the mid-major perspective how they were all like, go in and represent us
well, feeling that burden and what we talk about, you know, that upset, that
5-12, the respect, the mid-major shouldering that and winning. The pride that
they all had. I was so pleased and was just so proud to represent and see how
excited they were for us. Getting that win and championing that cause for all
of them. It was awesome.  
  
Q. UConn won by 60 and Baylor won by 20. There were good games here. Are
you seeing that gap toward the top getting closed?  
TRICIA FABBRI: We saw that last year in the women's Final Four. I believe
there are continued, elite programs, and they remain elite. You're starting to
see, again, I mentioned from the women's Final Four last year, you're start to
go see now maybe programs from five to ten, 11, 12, you're seeing Texas, more
programs starting to bubble up, and starting to take that mantle.  
  
You're start to go see more upsets and you're certainly starting to see that
now with the 5-12. Unfortunately, we were looking at another 5-12 game late
last night that almost happened in another close one. It's happening. It's
starting -- the pendulum is starting to slowly happen and the more we can see
the results in this tournament as it's slowly starting to shift, the better
it's going to be.  
  
Q. Trisha, you shared a special moment with your President, John Lahey.
Can you share what he told you after the game and what he shared with your
team in the locker room?  
TRICIA FABBRI: President Lahey and his wife Judy were here yesterday at the
game and he will be here tomorrow night. Just joy! I don't think -- he always
hoped just like us making this a reality. He's been the biggest advocate for
our university being at its best. What his vision was for this university, the
building of York Hill and the arena, Quinnipiac being on the national stage.  
  
It came to fruition seeing his women's basketball team win a game in the NCAA
Tournament. It was his plan. We talked about it, our goals and aspirations
about winning games in the tournament. He has talked about this plan going
forward and he felt like we did, sharing in the joy of attaining that goal and
he was so pleased, so happy; and sharing in that moment with the President in
our locker room. He was emotional and he was just joyful in sharing that
moment with this team and he couldn't have been any happier. It was awesome.  
  
Q. What do you see from Miami, what challenges they present and
obviously they will be the home team with the partisan crowd tomorrow night?  
TRISHA FABBRI: Look, they're a great team, extremely well-coached. They want
to play fast. They have two great lead guards. They've got size. They have
depth. They changed their defenses. We're going to have our hands full on a
home court that has great crowd, but this is why you play this game this time
of year. We're 1 of a field of 32. I firmly believe that our experience going
out to Vegas, seeing three games in three days, playing a New Mexico State
team that gave Stanford all they could handle. Us playing and beating Long
Beach State that we know went wire-to-wire against Oregon State, and seeing
Oregon State, all those different style of games in three days has completely
compared us for the weekend that we're having. I fully expect that we are
going to be prepared. We are going to be ready for the moment again with
Miami. It's not going to make it easier. They're talented. They play so hard.
They play really well. We certainly have our work cut out for us. We're going
to be ready to play, have a plan, go out and execute and certainly leave it
all out on the floor for 40-plus minutes because we know it's this game,
tomorrow night, that's standing between us and a Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That will conclude the press conference.

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Haley Laughter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33240)

### [Taylor Gradinjan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33241)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida Gulf Coast University head coach Karl
Smesko and student-athletes Haley Laughter and Taylor Gradinjan.  
  
COACH SMESKO: Obviously a very disappointing ending. We came here with the
idea that we were going to win and advance. The first half we didn't play
particularly well or shoot it. We were a little rattled early.  
  
It was a little, it was my fault it took a little long to make an adjustment
versus their 1-3-1. I thought we did a better job against that later in the
half and in the second half. But I couldn't be more proud of the way our kids
fought back.  
  
We started off shooting it really poor, but we just hung around and then when
we start playing when we're capable of playing it was a game to literally the
last second.  
  
I'm really proud of our team, really disappointed that we don't get a chance
to play again, because I like the way we're competing right now. And this is
the heartbreak in March, and hopefully everybody can at least see how
competitive our team is and how hard they're willing to work and how much
fight they have in them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes only.  
  
Q. Taylor, on the last play, on the defensive end where you stood in for
the charge, no call, what was your perspective on the play?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: It's disappointing. But that's what the refs thought it was,
and you gotta deal with it. We had another chance to bring it down on the
other end, and we just didn't accelerate from what we had. So nothing we could
do about it. It sucks, but it was a good play by their post move and you gotta
deal with it.  
  
Q. Haley, it seemed as though you guys were just waiting for that one
spurt, and then it finally came, maybe on the five-point play, late in the
third or something like that. How were you able to keep confidence up when
nothing was falling for so long for you guys?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: We came in at halftime and we kind of regrouped, and we told
each other we're only down, I don't remember how many, we were down six at
halftime. And we're right in this game, guys. We just gotta keep going, our
shots are going to fall. We just really kept telling each other one more stop,
one more stop. And if we could get that one stop then it will start going our
way on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Taylor, you seemed to be struggling a little bit from behind the arc,
then you hit the big 3 to tie the game with less than 10 seconds to go. Was it
something that Karl was telling you or your teammates were telling you to keep
shooting the ball?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: Absolutely. That's all I hear from Karl and my teammates is
keep shooting, and if I don't shoot it when I'm open I get in trouble. But, I
mean, they're going to fall. I did start out a little rough and I knew that,
but I knew if I got to my finish they would fall at some point.  
  
Q. Ladies, is the emotion more the pride in how well you guys played or
the disappointment in getting that close at the end and having two very
questionable calls not go your way and maybe not having a chance to keep
playing?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: I mean, obviously we were frustrated with how the game ended,
but we can't really base the game off those last two calls. We just needed to
make a couple more plays in the first half, say, when we weren't attacking as
much.  
  
I think we have been playing really well towards the end of the season and we
finally hit our peak. I think that's just the most disappointing part is to
have to see it end now.  
  
Q. Haley, throughout the season you guys typically hit a lot more 3s,
your percentage was a lot higher other than this game. Uncharacteristically,
you hit a lot less, as a team, a lot less 3s, but even though you took the
same amount that you take. What do you attest it to? Was it defense or
nerves?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: We were getting open shots. That wasn't the problem. I just
think the first half, especially, it was just more nerves. We just needed to
calm down and relax and get to our finish. I think ultimately that was it.
Because we were getting open and getting the shots, just calm down.  
  
Q. Whenever you guys average 9.7 3s made per game and then go 2-for-19
in a half, how frustrating is it considering that's a big part of your
offense?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: That's frustrating but as a shooter you have to have the
shooter mentality. You're a shooter, it's going to fall. Just keep shooting.  
  
Q. What did Coach have to say to you afterward about the level of play,
obviously, but just dealing with the disappointment?  
HALEY LAUGHTER: He said he was proud of us and that we did really well and
that it's a disappointment that we couldn't move on when we're doing so well
at this point in the season. But I mean he was just encouraging about all of
it. He basically said what he started off with in here except maybe a little
more personal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Have you gotten a chance to review either of the last two plays
before you came in?  
COACH SMESKO: No, just what I saw on the floor.  
  
Q. I know you were arguing pretty vehemently for the charge call. What
did you see on the last play down at your end?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm the best person to ask,
because obviously I have my perspective, and it's not necessarily objective.
So we'll have to -- usually I watch the game on the way home. But I may wait a
couple of days. That's if -- my assistants will want to see it right away and
make a judgment.  
  
But we were in a position to win the game. It was a tight game. I don't think
you can ever blame a call for one call or two calls, because there's a
thousand plays within a game. So it was a well-officiated game with the little
bit of a controversial ending.  
  
Q. Karl, seeing you emotional occasionally after seasons end in tough
ways. Is that the same sentiment here? Is that all of it? Or is it partly the
way that it ended make it even harder to accept?  
COACH SMESKO: The way it ended makes it tougher, for sure. But you never want
any season to end. And for me I was okay, maybe a little irritated, when I
went into the locker room. But then when you see all the kids that worked so
hard for so long and they're all crying, you don't have a heart if it doesn't
get to you.  
  
Q. You said in the first half that it took you a little longer to adjust
to the 1-3-1 than it possibly should have. What were you doing in the second
half that made the offense click a little better?  
COACH SMESKO: We were having a kid behind the zone be more active, cutting
into gaps. And then where we placed our shooters based on how they were
playing, you know, they kind of sagged off our non-shooters to take away our
shooters in the 1-3-1, so we had to move where they were.  
  
And it took like four or five minutes of that 1-3-1 and you saw we had a
number of turnovers right in a row until we made the adjustment. So that was
something that I wish we would have -- that's something that we have in our
arsenal and we should have went to it a little bit quicker.  
  
Q. To play for you guys always has to require a level of resolve to go
up against bigger teams all the time. As much as they were struggling with the
shots and as physical as Miami is, where would you equate the degree of
resolve the girls showed today with what you've seen with your program?  
COACH SMESKO: This team has fought as hard as any I've had today. To be behind
against a top-20 team on the road and you could see a little bit of
frustration on our kids' faces when shots weren't falling. To come back from
that and realize that they were capable of coming back and capable of winning
the game and essentially taking it to the end against a great team. So I got
no calms with our competitiveness or how we responded to adversity. I'm very
proud of our players.  
  
Q. Going against taller players, two drives in a row there in the
fourth, China went right at their 6'3 " player. Could you talk about her
mentality, how she just showed no fear going against somebody that much bigger
than her?  
COACH SMESKO: We thought China had the best matchup at the end of the game. We
kept going to it and creating space, having her drive the shooter's gap. And
then we had some cuts just in case she was cut off, so she'd have somebody to
pass it to.  
  
But give her a lot of credit. Early in the game she maybe forced a couple of
shots and then at the end of the game she got to the rim. She absorbed
contact. We were hoping maybe to get some and-ones on those situations.  
  
But to finish over a kid of that size and the way China used her body to
create an angle to shoot, it was really impressive.  
  
Q. You've seen them both, obviously. What do you think Trish can do
against Miami on Monday night?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I'm not surprised Quinnipiac moved on at all. We've played
them three straight years, and I know Marquette is really good. Won the Big
East. But Quinnipiac is a really good team with really good players and
they're not that quite as big a mismatch inside as we were today.  
  
They're big kids, they're strong and physical and they can score. So I expect
Quinnipiac to play really well. They'll still be underdogs playing here in
this arena, and Miami's a great team. But it's good to see a mid-major do so
well.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Keyona Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30368)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Miami - 62, Florida Gulf Coast - 60  
  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I don't think that was the beautiful offensive display that
both coaches in the crowd probably wasn't expecting, but there were a lot of
veteran plays down the stretch, so congratulations to Gulf Coast. I thought
they played tough when they started getting hot from the three there. That was
their true identity, so their second half performance from the three is more
indicative of who they are, and we know that. So when they started getting
comfortable, that's why they're so good. That's why they have so many wins on
the year, and that's why they were in this tournament at our place. We had to
counter that with our inside game, and that was not a surprise. That we knew
coming in.  
  
But I think in the first half when they were cold from the three and we broke
the rhythm a little bit, give us some credit for that, but we should have
taken -- we had a nice lead there that we kind of lost our focus and let slip.
So then when it comes down to it, you know, one big three and then they're --
they hit them in bunches, and they did. A couple mistakes late game for us,
but we're still alive, and we are very excited for the crowd that showed up
for us, and we're excited to have an exciting game for them, and we're excited
to continue to play.  
  
We are going to take it, and we're going to move on and we're going to get
ready for our next game on Monday.  
  
Q. Keyona, your last play, obviously not the last play of the game, you
kind of cut across, you post-up, and then just sort of take us through were
you just thinking you were going to overpower Taylor or did you know that --
did you know she was there? What was your thinking when you took the entry
pass?  
KEYONA HAYES: I felt her. I knew she was there. But she's a lot smaller than I
am, so I just took my time and laid the ball up.  
  
Q. Jessica, what does this mean big picture for you guys? Like Coach
said, it wasn't offensively pretty at times, but to grind and then to have the
lead most of the night and then lose it twice in the final two minutes and
survive, what does that mean about where this team is toughness wise right
now?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think we're definitely mentally tough. It came down to
making veteran plays at the end, and I'll keep saying it, I think I've been
saying it from the beginning of the season, but we executed when we needed to.
We had a few gutsy plays where a few mishaps and stuff like that, but as far
as this team, I think we just had the will to win. We had the will to win, and
didn't want to take no for an answer.  
  
I mean, it just came down to being sharp every play, every possession, and
just controlling the game.  
  
Q. What were you guys thinking when Motley went out toward the end
there?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I knew we had a 20-second delay because of the substitution,
but it was kind of weird, I was like, Mot fouled out? But when she stepped
out, we knew what we had to do. People knew they had to step up, and I think
that's what's so special about this team is we know our roles and we know what
we've got to do when certain people aren't on the floor. I mean, it was a
tough loss, but at the same time, I think we knew we definitely had to make
sure we executed this game and finished it off strong for her.  
  
Q. Keyona, back to that play where you posted up, that blocked charge is
always a difficult thing. Do you feel there was any dispute or controversy on
that play, whether it was a block or whether it was an offensive foul or
not?  
KEYONA HAYES: I mean, it's the NCAA Tournament, and it's the last like couple
of seconds of the game, and I'm just happy the refs let us play. It was a good
no-call.  
  
Q. Jessica, just your thoughts on Monday's game?  
JESSICA THOMAS: As far as what?  
  
Q. You have another chance to keep going.  
JESSICA THOMAS: I think as a team we're definitely excited and we're happy to
survive and advance. We've got another tough opponent in front of us coming up
on Monday, got to lock and load again, be mentally prepared, lock into the
game plan. I know our coaches and the staff, they'll get us right. They'll get
us prepared. Just looking forward to having another opportunity to play some
more basketball, especially as seniors.  
  
Q. The three-point play with 49 seconds left, that looked like you sort
of made something out of nothing, and then whoever cut baseline with 16 left,
I forget who that was, who you found on that pass, are you comfortable with
just having the ball in your hands in the last minute of a game, because you
had to make two very big plays that have kind of been forgotten about already
because of the way it all ended.  
EMESE HOF: I think I am like comfortable with the ball, and yeah. I didn't
even think about it, I think. They doubled key haze, so Key-key was wide open.
It was even a pretty sloppy pass. I have to admit that. But she got it, and
yeah, we made it work as a team.  
  
Q. Emese, going into Monday you're going to have a much better match-up
on the inside. I don't think it's going to be as easy. Not that it was easy,
but you definitely had a few mismatches there. What have you guys done to
prepare for that, for the bigs?  
EMESE HOF: Just like catching the ball high and keeping it high to throw it,
basically make lay-ups. But it's going to be different Monday, and personally
I'm happy about that. But we'll be fine. We're just going to make it work.
Anyway, we have a lot of people we can rely on, and we'll get there.  
  
Q. If you knew three hours ago you were going to shoot 1 for 14 from
three and Mot was going to have four, you would not have probably envisioned
that you'd be playing on Monday is my guess?  
KATIE MEIER: Exactly, no. But that's something about this team. I don't even
think last year we could have handled that. I'm pretty sure we couldn't have.
And yet we've been in -- we've had a lot of just -- this journey has been full
of adversity, and it's been full of gut checks, and it's been full of that's a
surprise. I'll tell you, Mot is as sharp as she's been all season. She's been
great as we prepared.  
  
You know, and it's not -- I mean, you ask how do we feel when she fouled out.
That wasn't this huge moment for us. It just wasn't. Okay, so we got Laura, we
got Key-key, and we're just going to keep going.  
  
I think that was crucial, our composure. We just were coaching every
possession, every second. We didn't get too big into, oh, my gosh, it's a
close game. We expected that, and then it was just a matter of -- I said in
the press conference, the preview press conference we had in here that the
coaches are going to have to coach very well within the game because these
teams are too good to let you go to your identity, and that's going to win the
game. The teams are too smart. Every call they called -- every call we called,
they knew. The scouting was great. So yeah, you have to do something
different. You're going to have to reinvent yourself in the middle of the
game, and we did. We went inside quite a bit, and I thought that was crucial
for us.  
  
Q. When you have a game like this, when you have two posts that are like
head and shoulders taller than anybody who's going to be guarding them,
there's going to be a lot of contact, a lot of people on the floor. How much
are you concerned going into a game like that that any time there's bodies on
the floor, there's a natural reaction to blow a whistle. Were you worried that
going to your strength might backfire on you a little bit?  
KATIE MEIER: Right, well, I told you the game would be can we play our bigs.
Are they going to try to foul them out with their drawing charge action, and
then are we going to be able to defend. They had China Dow going downhill and
I thought Hof did a pretty good job, but at the end there, they got a lay-up
on us and a couple fouls on Emese that she was walling up. That was the whole
game, and we knew that. But on that last play, I'll have to look at it for
Hayes, but she was very balanced. She was very balanced, and we had practiced
balance and pivots and whatever, and we had practiced that because we knew how
they would go, and she was pretty deep near the basket, too, so I felt good
about it, and we absolutely were going into her with Thomas. The whole play
was action to go Thomas to Hayes. We were going to go with our seniors.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you spoke to the degree of rally that they brought
to you guys and if in any way a game never comes down to the last two calls if
you guys feel in any way -- what's your perspective on the end game, two no-
calls, I guess, that you guys were the beneficiaries of, the final basket for
you guys for the win --  
KATIE MEIER: I think I'm getting your perspective. I'm sorry, but it sounds
like I'm getting your perspective.  
  
Q. Do you feel fortunate at all that with what FGCU brought at you guys
that you're able to get out of this one with a win?  
KATIE MEIER: I feel great about the win. I feel great about the crowd. I feel
great about the environment that we had. We executed down the stretch, and
they executed down the stretch. They got -- I feel great. I did compliment
them when you weren't in here. I thought they did a great job and they did a
great job of hitting big shots, and they found their identity in the second
half. Yeah, they had a great season, and they deserved every win that they
have.  
  
Q. There is commentary on TV about two no-calls at the end, the game-
winning basket and their inbound on the final play, that commentary that
either or both could have been called as fouls.  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I think throughout the game, whatever segment you want to
pick, you can always do that.  
  
Q. With 8.6 seconds left in the game, tied 60-60, I saw Laura in the
time-out, very vocal. Can you share with us what she was saying or what you
guys were talking about?  
KATIE MEIER: She's just a great natural leader. She's been in a ton of big
moments, world championships, European championships, and ever since she's
always been playing above her age group, so the first time I saw her, I was
the U-19 national team coach and she was 16 years old screaming in her huddle
yelling at these 20-year olds. She's just amazing. She was very clear. She had
specific questions for me and wanted to make sure she communicated them to the
team. You know, she wasn't playing great. She had some turnovers that really
hurt us, but late-game stuff, she's in control and real great command.  
  
Q. You know when a team is up all day and then you lose it in the last
two minutes, you know that 99 percent of teams probably don't win that game on
empirical evidence, but you know what I mean. What's it say about where you
guys are that you weren't having flashbacks to last year.  
KATIE MEIER: That's the thing. You know, I mean, I'm not trying to give myself
credit by any stretch of the imagination, but like you have to be prepared. I
mean, these teams are great, and we were -- we got away with a lot in the
first half in terms of they got a bunch of threes off and they weren't making
them, and so it wasn't like I sat there and said, they're just going to
continue to miss all game. You have to have some -- one of the hardest things
about being a coach is you have to run through a lot of scenarios prior to the
game, and it's hard on you because you have to run through some negative
scenarios, too, just so that you're prepared, so that you have a script and
you go through them and you know them. So as you're in moments, and then they
pop up, you've got to be prepared for them.  
  
You know, clearly Davenport shouldn't have pinched off the shooter in the
corner to give them that shot. We talked about it, it was clearly what we did,
and I yelled at her in the locker room but I wasn't going to waste the time
yelling at her that then, right? That's just not smart. So we coach the next
play, and then we got to the locker room and we had a conversation, and Erykah
is the greatest kid in the world, but those are things that as a coach you
just -- there was still time on the clock and we had something we had to do.
We were all very -- just very, very, I thought, composed and calm.  
  
Q. Do you almost feel like the pressure is off a little bit? Now you've
got kids that know what this feeling is like? There had to be pressure being
at home. It's an advantage, sure, but it comes with additional pressure. Do
you almost feel like you're going to get more of what you've been kind of all
season Monday?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, we didn't play our best basketball game of the year, and
you want to. I mean, you want to in the NCAA, wherever it is. And I think that
the crowd certainly -- I thought our crowd was so positive, so excited. They
were -- I got a thousand texts already people are mad at me because they were
going to -- their heart rate was up. But I thought that our crowd, the energy
was great, and our players had this true belief, and yeah, I'm just -- we're
going to keep -- great on the glass, and I'm glad you mentioned Emese Hof
because basically the way they were playing, she turned into a point guard.
She turned into a point guard tonight, and I ran everything through Emese, and
I said at halftime, we're going through Hof because of the way Gulf Coast was
playing us, Hof was making a ton of big time decisions for us, and I thought
she did a fantastic job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenge you have Monday at Quinnipiac both
in terms of their team and also the quick turnaround from a scouting
standpoint and also for the kids' legs and all that.  
KATIE MEIER: Right. I have never, ever looked ahead. I never have done it in
my profession. We just played three games in a row in the ACC Tournament. I
had no idea -- came out of the press conference, and my staff is tremendous.
They're so talented. I didn't have a particular opinion whether it was going
to be Marquette, who we were going to be playing. I was so locked in, I stayed
with the team in the hotel and came over on the bus with them instead of
watching that game. I only watched a little bit of it. But we can adapt. We
have a very, very great IQ on this team, just a tremendous IQ, and they're
going to want my plan, and they're going to want it pretty quick, and I'm
going to want my plan for my assistant coaches and they're going to give it to
me pretty quick, and we're going to be ready. But the team can really take it
and we can reinvent ourselves. But I never thought in a million years, like
Tim said, you're 1 for 14 from the three and you come out with a victory, and
we need three-pointers. I mean, we do. They're a team that kind of dares you
to shoot over them. So if you'd have told me that before, I wouldn't have been
prepared for that, but I promise, we'll get there. We'll get where we need to
be for Monday, and just the crowd is going to be huge, and I hope everybody
can really get out in the community and give us that advantage again.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: First I want to give a lot of credit to Quinnipiac.
They played fantastic, very confident. And they came out with a lot of fight
the first half. I also want to give a lot of credit to my players and my staff
for how far we've come. I'm really, really proud of our whole entire program.
We've come a long way in three years and I'm glad we've got to have this
experience here at the NCAA tournament, because we've worked really hard for
it. We know we're just getting started. We talked about in the locker room we
have to remember this pain. We have to remember what this feels like and use
it for motivation.  
  
Q. You were a big part of the come back, what was the mindset after
being down 19 to rally the team back?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: We're a team that just keeps fighting. We've been down
before, this isn't the first time we've been down at half. So we just said we
need to leave it all on the floor. And I think we rallied together. I wish we
could have played a little stronger the first half and had the same fight in
the first half we did in the second half.  
  
Q. Natisha, on the last shot, it just looked like it was dead center.
What was the view you had, and did you think it was good when you let it go?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, coach threw up the play for me to hit the three to tie
the game. When I shot it it looked good. It was halfway down. I guess it
wasn't supposed to go in, I guess.  
  
Q. What was it like to play on a stage like this?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel like honestly it was a blessing to even make it here,
to even play on this stage. I feel like we learned a lot of lessons on this
stage. Honestly, I wouldn't trade any of them.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would say the same thing, making it here is a great
accomplishment. We came a long way from last year to this year. I'm just
already ready for next year and looking forward to it.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Like they said, it's a blessing to even get here. But we're
not satisfied. We'll be back next year and better and stronger.  
  
Q. Natisha, you said you'd never heard of Quinnipiac before this game.
Now after playing them, what can you say about them, and their mentality a
Mid-Major to come in and knock off a Big East champion?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Quinnipiac is a great team. I give them all the credit. They
played hard. They had a great first half. They had a great everything. They
played with a lot of fight. I give them all the credit and I wish them best of
luck in the tournament.  
  
Q. Natisha, can you go over, I think about 18, 20 seconds left the
blocked shot. Did you feel her there or what happened on that play?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I just tried to create space and it wasn't there, it was a
forced shot.  
  
Q. Is this game sort of a microcosm of maybe the first three years? Such
a hill to get over and you could see it coming, see it coming, just sort of
ran out of time? And how nice is it to already hear your kids talking about
what this is going to mean going forward to you guys?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean definitely. I think you could see they were
nervous to start this game. I think everybody in the building knew it. We just
tried to keep them confident. We try to get them to calm down little bit.
Obviously I feel like if we had more time we would have came out on top.
Unfortunately you only get 40 minutes.  
  
But the fact that they're hungry and the fact that they want to learn from
this, as proud as I am of them, I didn't want to go in that locker room and
say congratulations, we made it, because I really do believe that there's a
phenomenal amount of potential in that room. And we are just really getting
started. And I want them to know that this is a step and we should be proud of
where we came, but we got to think of ourselves as an elite program. And
that's what I want them to do. And that's how we've got to think. We've got to
learn from this.  
  
You're right, the last three years have been a lot of ups and downs. To be
here is amazing, but in our mind I think we all thought we deserve to be here,
and we wanted to still be playing.  
  
Q. It seemed like Erika was a big part of your offensive game plan, what
did you see in that matchup?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: They do a great job of packing the paint. And they
front a lot. We knew Erika was going to be able to use her athleticism and
strength down low. Obviously she had a great game. I think sometimes we forced
it to her in the first hatch. And I think that was kind of jitters and
whatnot. I give a lot of credit to Erika's fight. And the way she attacks that
rebound, she's relentless, she's really hard to guard.  
  
Q. Quinnipiac seemed to do a good job in the first half of controlling
the pace, and slowing everything down. Did you tell your team anything at
halftime about controlling the pace and speeding the game up?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: Definitely. We tried to make as many adjustments as
we possibly could there at halftime. And I think our players did a great job
of focusing and kind of honing in on that second half of listening. Obviously
they did a great job of packing the paint and really keying in on our leading
scorers. Like I said, I give them a lot of credit. And we've got to learn from
it.  
  
Q. What do you think changed for your guys in the fourth quarter to
enable you of being three to tie that game?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: We started playing the way we always do. And that's
fast and that's frantic and that's getting up in full court pressure. That was
the game plan to start the game. Obviously to start out in our press, and we
just didn't have the energy and the fight we did in that fourth quarter.
Nothing different.  
  
The biggest key that I see, though, is our points in the paint. We had 34 in
the paint. And our whole defensive game plan was to pack the paint and not let
them in there, and we did not do a great job of doing that tonight.  
  
Q. McKayla went three for four on three pointers, I want to know why she
wasn't able to good get more shots off. And I don't think you had her down at
the end when you were hunting that three pointer to tie. If you could talk
about that?  
HEAD COACH CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think McKayla was open quite a bit and our
guards missed her, to be honest. She scores a lot off from behinds and a lot
off open windows and drift passes. And I think we missed her a lot. That play
that we drew up and we run it all the time and Natisha, I'll give that look
again. And I can't tell you how many times Natisha has made that shot in
practice. We use McKayla as a decoy and we run her off. And we've made that
shot several times in practice, and I definitely won't second-guess that

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Tricia Fabbri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33163)

### [Paula Strautmane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33234)

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: When we won the MAAC Championship close to two weeks
ago I told my young ladies to enjoy the moment, because you never know. We
worked very hard to win that title. But I also said, don't be satisfied. We
weren't finished yet.  
  
And then today we came down here to win a game and advance into Monday and our
goal was to play to win Monday. It's a goal that we started last year when we
left for summer and we continued just to move forward with our mission. And
here we are getting ready to play in the field of 32 come Monday night.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you had the great first half. You're up 19.
You go to the third quarter. What's the feeling on the bench, the huddle, the
floor, while they're chipping away at the lead? You had to stay positive
during the fourth quarter?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. We knew -- they're a great team. And we knew that
was going to be a tough battle. And teams usually come back. We just knew that
we had to stay strong. We had to stay gritty, mentally tough. And that's
actually our identity. That's how we identify ourselves is very gritty, just
the perseverance with this team is amazing. It makes me so proud. They're a
great team and we knew it was going to be a tough battle.  
  
JEN FAY: Having a really good start helped us kind of get a lead and get a
feel for the game. That helped us boost our confidence in the beginning.  
  
Q. (INAUDIBLE.)  
JEN FAY: We've been in that position before when we were up a lot. We just had
to stay relaxed, stay poised and we got the job done.  
  
Q. I think you guys know this question is coming, but Natisha Niedeman
said she'd never heard of Quinnipiac before today. What's the message to her
and Marquette now?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: They know who we are. I think everyone knows who we are now.  
  
JEN FAY: Yeah. I think everyone knows who we are now at this point.  
  
Q. Adily, you had arguably one of the biggest plays at the end of the
game with that big block. What was going through your mind when you saw her go
up for the three and just making sure that you saved your season?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Allazia is a great player, I knew that she didn't get any
three point shots up. She shoots the ball really well. Really, when it came
down to it, I just knew that I had to be in her stuff. And my hands had to be
up, because we knew she was going to watch it. She's a play maker. Basically
just shading her left hand with my right hand and hoping that that was a block
and it ended up being one.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when the last second shot goes up, what's
going through your mind? What's going through your mind there?  
JEN FAY: I thought we deserved to win, so I was just crossing my fingers that
it wasn't going to go in.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It was a great shot. We're glad it didn't go in.  
  
JEN FAY: Yeah.  
  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Welcome to March Madness.  
  
Q. You had fouls to give, obviously in that last possession. Did you
think about using them at all?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: No, because I think there was 2.6 seconds left and
it was a catch and shoot. And we had defended very well all night. I trusted
our defense, defending the three-point line on that shot.  
  
Q. Finally, that shot, it was the perfect line. How good was your look
at it and did you think it was down?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: It was great and it was in and it was out and walked
right down the line and shook the coach's hand.  
  
Q. It seemed like through a lot of the second half when you did need a
big basket or a big steal, Jen came up with. Talk about her play overall?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Incredible. It's not the first time I've seen a
performance by her in that nature. She had it against Temple, and completely
talented player offensively, great IQ, and you got to wit firsthand on the big
stage just how good she is, you saw incredible spin dribble. The ability to
pull a three-point shot. When we need her the most she's been really great all
season long. And she just wanted the ball all game long. She didn't shy away
from the shot, whether she missed it or it went down, she wanted it. And she
made incredible plays for us all evening. And we needed that. And she
delivered.  
  
Q. With everyone looking at Quinnipiac now. You're in the round of 32.
You're one win from the Sweet 16 with a lot of national attention. What do you
have to say to the rest of the nation that is looking at, hey, Quinnipiac I've
never heard of them before?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: This team deserves the recognition. I think we
really flew unjustly under the radar going into the tournament. There was the
sexy matchup with Marquette and Miami looming in the game Monday night. And
the only way that was going to change that was a win here today. And we took
care of business, just like we have not only this year -- well, in a big way
-- but what we've done over the course of the last five years, getting into
the tournament the last three of the five years. We did. We handled our
business. And that's what we had to do to get the real attention that this
program and in particular this team deserves. I saw the 81-69 pick, as well.
And not only nationally, but this team has been so good all year long in tough
spots, and there wasn't a tougher spot with a team like Marquette, how they
come at you offensively, and not only did they make their push in the run, but
we not only defended in the biggest spots but had the right answer in the
clutch spots. And that's what this team has done all season long.  
  
Q. People are going to talk about the run at the end. But how critical
was it to go into the half on a run of your own? After 10 or 12 in a row for
them in the second quarter, you getting it back to double figures, how
important was that?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: Not only that, we were dealing with foul trouble. We
had Jen Fay on the bench with two fouls. I had Aryn McClure, I had Paula
Strautmane on the bench with two fouls, managing all that with two fouls going
into the locker room, I believe it was 43-30 and closing out the half the way
we did. Credit to this team and my coaches.  
  
Q. You were saying on the radio that throughout the MAAC Conference
tournament, falling behind earlier, rally to win, three times. Today you
jumped out to a seriously 16 point lead, shot almost 60 percent from the field
in the first half. That had to be super important to be the hunted not the
Hunter as the game progressed?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: It was certainly something that the coaching staff
talked about, with us flying so far under the radar going into the match, who
was definitely wearing the bulls eye on the back in this game. We were
breathing a little easier and we just knew we had a great team, a great
preparation. And to be honest with you, our shoot around this morning was the
best it's ever been. The laser focus. The ready to go. And my AD said we're
going to be hard to beat today. That's on the record at a text at 9:30th
morning on the bus back.  
  
Q. What does the step stool signify for this team?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: That's been a number of symbolic pieces that we've
done, February into going up to the MAAC tournament. And now for this program
that we talked about last summer was taking the next step. And it was the step
stool with two steps, and that's what we came here to do, take the next step.
And that's what we've started every practice with, when we get into our
circle, just a message and a real focus on the purpose. And it's right in
front of us and it's been really good for us, very rewarding of why we're
doing it, front and center. And we took one step today.  
  
Q. You opened with FGCU, obviously it's going to be 90 minutes anyway,
but does it matter who you get Monday night?  
HEAD COACH TRICIA FABBRI: We're going to play who we're going to play. But
Florida Golf Coast, FGCU, we've had a great rivalry going back three years,
and we were able to get them the first game in the season. They beat us the
two previous seasons and great games. So obviously his team was young and he's
done a great job all season long, so I'm anxious to go watch.

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Jordin Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33183)

### [China Dow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33185)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH SMESKO: We're excited to represent the Atlantic Sun Conference in the
NCAA tournament. We know that we have a great competitor to go up against, in
Miami. They're an excellent time, very well coached. Good at every position.
So we have our work cut out for us, but we're excited for the opportunity, and
we're preparing to give our best effort.  
  
Q. Taylor, how much momentum are you hoping to carry over from winning
the way you did in the title game, having to rally and all that?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, I hope so. It's always good to go in with a lot of
energy and momentum, so if we could remember what it feels to win like that
and carry it over to tomorrow's game, we need to come out with energy and
bring it the entire game, and hopefully we get the outcome we want.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, the 2 and 5 or whatever it was at the start is
obviously not something that you all are used to over there. How difficult was
it to believe that this was going to be a process and that there was still a
lot of basketball to be played? How difficult was it to not get too down just
based on the early results of the season?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I don't know. We were still learning in the beginning of the
season. We had a brand new team, and we were still trying to come together. So
it was a struggle in the beginning just to come together and start playing
well together and learn each other's abilities. So we knew that was going to
happen, so it didn't really get us down, but we had to keep fighting through
it. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so good now is that we
fought throughout the season because we knew we had to keep improving if we
wanted to make big things happen.  
  
Q. Jordan, not to give away any secrets or anything, but what have you
guys seen looking at Miami and what can you say about the kind of challenge
that they'll be tomorrow?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, like Coach said, they're a great team. I think one of
the biggest advantages for us is our preparation. Coach is one of the best in
the country in that aspect, and I think the team is really embracing that. And
if we can go out there and just execute our game plan, I think, yeah, we'll be
in a good position.  
  
Q. Ladies, how does it feel to be closer to it for China, and Jordan?  
CHINA DOW: It feels good. You know, I came here my freshmen year, but it feels
good to be here with this team because everybody was doubting us. But I think
it feels great. I think it's going to be fun. We just gotta enjoy the moment.  
  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah. No. I'm so excited. Yeah, it's been a dream for me
like ever since I was a little kid to play in a NCAA tournament. So I'm really
excited for us to have an opportunity to compete at this level.  
  
Q. How is your shoulder?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, no. It's feeling good actually, so yeah, I've been
doing some rehab on it and everything this week. So it's feeling good today.  
  
Q. Popped it back in? Was that accurate? What happened?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, yeah, it just like -- yeah, it popped out and then it
popped back in on its own. So it's not like a full dislocation, but yeah, it's
all good.  
  
Q. Ever happen before?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, it has happened before, so I like knew the feeling and
everything. So I just had to like get the strength back. It's like really weak
right when it happens.  
  
Q. Taylor, what advice have you had for teammates whom this is their
first NCAA tournament game?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, just coming in, being excited and still being able
to control that excitement. We're here for a reason. We do have a game plan to
follow. We can't slip up, because we're playing a good team, and basically
just sticking to what we know and not letting the excitement get to them?  
  
Q. Karl, I recall over in Naples -- or I'm sorry, over in?  
KARL SMESKO: Germain.  
  
Q. Thank you. I'm sorry. It's been a long day. I remember we talked when
you were 2 and 5, too, and you knew it was going to be a process, but was
there something that you could point to that said, okay, this is where we're
starting to get it? Was there a point or was it just like a natural
progression?  
COACH SMESKO: Yeah, it was pretty slow and incremental. I think one of the
reasons and maybe the biggest reason we were able to make progress during the
year is we have a great staff, the assistant coaches. And we had so many new
players, and they needed a lot of talking to and getting on board with how we
do things. And our assistants did a great job of getting people back into the
program and how we do things and the attitude that you need to have.  
  
And that with, you know, we have leadership with Jordy and Taylor. But we
definitely needed the assistants' help to get people progressing and just
having the attitude that, yeah, this isn't where we want to be as a program,
and the only way to change that is to get a little bit better each day and
have a good attitude about it and pull this together.  
  
I can remember when we were 2 and 5, you know, we talked about it. And I told
them, hey, I've never been 2 and 5 as a coach, so this is new for me, too. So
the only thing I know to do is to go back to work and compete at it and try to
help you as best I can and hopefully you guys will have the same attitude.  
  
Q. Going through that adversity, going through having a chance to host
and then losing the finale at home and all that and having to go into a place
and deal with more adversity. How much did what you went through in November
ultimately help you last weekend?  
COACH SMESKO: It's tough to say. You would think that it did. Our players and
our fans are very close, and our fans are also very honest to them, where at
the beginning of the year, you know, they would have to hear that you're not
playing like FGCU.  
  
This isn't what we're used to seeing. So to overcome that and to start feeling
confident in the way we were playing, and then, you know, to have a setback
and be able to respond well to it -- I thought we were all really disappointed
when we lost our last home game so we wouldn't be able to host. But I did
think there was a feeling within our locker room that everybody in there
thought we could still win the tournament if we had the right attitude. So it
was pretty comparable to having the right attitude after a slow start. So I
think it definitely helped us.  
  
Q. Finally, I'm sorry to filibuster, but you're the only team of the
four that's sort of on a quote-unquote normal schedule. You played a few days
ago. Everybody else has been off 11, 12, 13, 14 days. One, do you like that
for the women's tournament, how that seems to be so common? And two, is there
any advantage in being closer to a normal routine than the teams that have
been sitting around for a couple of weeks?  
COACH SMESKO: You know, we've done both, and you may think one is an advantage
over the other, but I'm not sure that you could really prove it. Like when we
had -- I think the year we played St. Bonaventure, I think we had two weeks
that time. I would have to check to make sure. But you get a chance to take a
couple days off, and then you get to really hit fundamentals for a week and
then you can get to the preparation, and I enjoy that. I think the players
enjoy just getting back out there and playing another game.  
  
So I'm not sure one's an advantage over the other. I think you could have
arguments either way.  
  
Q. For any of the three players, there's a degree of athleticism all
over the floor for Miami that's about as good -- I guess maybe as you guys
have seen, including their interior players. Just how do you approach that and
how do you address that?  
CHINA DOW: I mean, honestly, I think when we was in the tournament we got a
little taste of athleticism playing Ohio State and stuff. And I think we'll be
fine as long as we go with what Coach tells us to do. As long as we do
everything we need to do, I think we'll be fine.  
  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: I think our defense is going to be huge, little things in
that area, and yeah, boxing out. So I think that'll kind of help combatting
that athleticism a little bit. Just doing the little things that Coach has
been preaching all year.  
  
Q. This is kind of for any of the players. Does it ever get tiring?
Maybe that's the wrong word. But you -- the program gets so much notoriety for
threes. It's the hashtag, all that. But there's obviously much more to the
system. It's not like you're coming down and jacking five 3s a game. Is it a
little bit frustrating or do you think maybe it's a little bit of a
misunderstanding that that's all this program is five out, just going to shoot
it, first one to touch it is just going to jack it up? Have you ever found
that to be disappointing or frustrating in any way?  
TAYLOR GRADINJAN: I mean, I don't find it disappointing. I think it's more our
fans thinking we're really good three-point shooters. And it is something we
do, and we always work on it, and we take pride in how our shooting percentage
is, but no, it doesn't limit us to just our three-point shots. And we know as
players very well that that's not all we do. We're taught very detailed,
complex stuff day by day, and we don't take disrespect people that say raining
threes or anything like that. We just know that's what they understand about
us.  
  
Q. Karl, you have a smile on your face evaluating Taylor's answer there
to some degree. Do you want to give us a critique of perspective?  
COACH SMESKO: I think she's doing excellent. I think they've all been doing a
very good job up here.  
  
Q. You seemed pleased with her perspective.  
COACH SMESKO: It just -- she understands how we play. She's been here the
longest. So she has a very good understanding of how we play basketball at
FGCU, and I thought she did a good job saying -- hey, she knows there's more
to it than threes, but she doesn't get offended if somebody wants to emphasize
the threes, especially, I mean, Taylor is pretty good at threes.  
  
Q. Taylor and China, I think you're both back next season. So to Jordin,
just can you talk about this one and only opportunity for you?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, I mean it's been an incredible experience so far. I
couldn't have asked for a better way to go out. And yeah, just have the
opportunity to be coached by one of the best coaches in the country and play
for such great teammates and everything, it really has been an awesome
experience.  
  
Q. Karl, do coaches call you in the summer and ask you to kind of
explain the system? I mean you can't look at one or two games and figure it
out.  
COACH SMESKO: You know, I mean we get called by coaches from time to time,
particularly at the college level, who want to better understand what we're
doing. And I have sat down with coaches before. It's not something I really
like to do. But when I think about it in terms of I like learning from other
people. So it's only fair to take some time to help teach other coaches as
well.  
  
But we have a style that you have to be really committed to, so it's not
something, like we will sprinkle in some things from what we see from others,
but our style isn't something that you could really sprinkle in. You've gotta
be committed to it and teach it every day or it just isn't going to work for
you. And I think sometimes when we go over it with people, they're like, wow,
that's really good. I don't know that I want to invest that much into making
that exactly who we are.  
  
Q. I'm guessing you're okay with that?  
COACH SMESKO: Yeah?  
  
Q. China or Jordin, we've asked the men recently about the university-
wide success athletically and the baseball team is just having a tear right
now, and the men were talking about you guys. This is the first year both
basketball teams are in the tournament the same year. Can either of the newer
ladies on the floor I guess offer your perspective on -- maybe Jordin just
because it's one year in -- what it's like seeing that, being within that?  
JORDIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, I mean it's awesome to be a part of a whole athletic
program that has so many great programs within it. And yeah, it's great for
the school also, you know, having so many teams doing so well, and I think it
kind of brings the teams together, with all the teams doing well, it kind of
helps our support also from students and everything.  
  
CHINA DOW: Yeah, it's fun. And all of our fans appreciate it too because all
fans go to every game. But I think it's fun. It's enjoyable on campus to liven
up a little bit and do what we gotta do. It's sports.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
COACH MEIER: Well, it's nice to be able to thank my own people for putting on
such a great tournament so far. I'm really impressed. It really does have an
NCAA feel to it. Just a big-time athletic department. A bunch of people have
been putting in a lot of work, and we see it. And we really appreciate it and
we just want to make sure we say thanks. It's great. Looks great, feels great.
Big-time basketball is going to occur and we're really happy to be a part of
it. That's number one.  
  
Number two, this is just great. It's just awesome. We're thrilled. We know
it's a big moment. We all came to Miami because we wanted pressure, and we
wanted big moments. And here it is. We've never shied away from the goal of
having a third tournament here this year. Very first meeting we talked about
it.  
  
We actually had the -- some friends in the conference office at ACC and some
RPI people analyze our schedule the year before and say swap out one or two
games whether we won or not and would that have put us in a top 15 or 16 RPI.
And it turned out that the Syracuse game at home last year that we lost, had
we won that, and perhaps maybe beaten Notre Dame in the tournament -- there
was just one or two games that we could have turned and would have gotten us
there.  
  
That's how I opened our first meeting this year with the team was this is a
goal of ours. Like, let's get there. But that was November. So now it's March,
and we're here. So our next goal is to do something really special, and that's
to win. Anytime you can get any type of win in the NCAA tournament, I don't
care where it is and I don't care who it's against, but anytime you have an
opportunity to compete in the NCAA tournament, it's awesome. But we want to
get a win.  
  
Q. Mot, what's this buildup been like the last few days since knowing
you're going to host, obviously, and it is a different feel. It's home but
it's not home, but it is home. What has the buildup been like, even with the
guys not here and school on break. Do you notice the electricity? Do you
notice there's more of a buzz this week than usual?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Yes. Not having school we're basically here all day. And we
know the stakes are high and it's a big tournament, and just to be hosting it,
we're blessed just to be hosting it.  
  
But I woke up this morning with a little bit more pep in my step knowing this
game will be tomorrow. I came in the gym and just seeing how great everybody
has done with the signs and just security, and just everything here. It's a
little bit more livelier here.  
  
And I think we're excited. I could just see it in everybody's faces. We're
just ready to go. We haven't played in a little over a week, I think and just
to play against somebody other than the practice squad in such a big stage is
just exciting. And I think we're ready. We've been watching a lot of film and
just critiquing our last games, and I think we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. Mot brought it up, it has been a while since you guys have played a
game, and it feels like an eternity. What are you kind of expecting when you
step on that floor tomorrow even though there is all this buzz and excitement,
it is about basketball. Will there be any rust or are you worried about
anything like that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: No. I don't think so. I think we're well prepared, the
coaching staff and practice squad have done a great job of getting us prepared
for this first game and this first round. I just think we're ready to go, like
she said. It's a feeling of urgency, honestly. It's been a little over a week,
a long bye week. We're just ready to go, ready to get going and playing.  
  
Q. Laura, they're a team that obviously they use great spacing. Any team
that runs that system would have to and we don't know how prolific they are
from three. What are the things that jump out that you guys are going to have
to really keep an eye on defensively to try to disrupt them as best you can
against that system?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, we watched a lot of film, and I gotta say Florida Gulf
Coast is a great team. As she said, they have a great spacing on offense. And
they all can shoot. Even their post players, their five, they can shoot. They
move very well without the ball. They set a lot of off-ball screens, so we
gotta be low in our stance. Everybody gotta defend everybody. We might switch.
You never know.  
  
So yeah, they are a pretty good team, but I think we are a pretty good
defensive team as well, so we just gotta lock down and get ready for their
movement.  
  
Q. Mot, you guys were the favorite last year in your opening-round game.
Obviously things didn't go the way we wanted them to. How much have you all
even thought about that at all or just making sure it doesn't appear again
because you know what it feels like to have an underdog coming after you?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I honestly haven't thought about it. It's a new year. It's a
new feel to the season. But just knowing that every game might be your last,
you just play with a little bit more sense of urgency.  
  
As far as thinking about last year, I think that's long gone. We have our
minds set to something bigger, and we're just focused on making sure we pursue
that. So I think we just have a better vision of what we want to accomplish,
and I think we're ready just to get the ball up in the air and just get going.  
  
Q. Tim Reynolds of the Orange Bowl Committee?  
COACH MEIER: (Laughs).  
  
Q. I'll give you a minute. It's been like a month and a half since you
played a game. How much does that concern you?  
COACH MEIER: I'm not concerned. We just -- there are times where our
conference just think about game after game after game against ranked
opponents and how much pressure we had on us to finish strong and to do
something special in the tournament.  
  
We were very, very honest about our position. They get RPI updates all year.
So we knew. I mean there was a point in the season where you know, I think we
were a little down because of our standings in the conference, and I'm like,
guys, look at your body. Don't worry about it. It was a schedule that had us
playing away on most of the ranked teams' courts. And we had done a really,
really special job.  
  
But that ACC tournament we played our guts out. We really played hard. And so
I wasn't sad to have a couple of days of rest to sort of regroup and get their
legs back underneath them because it was that third game where the shots --
you can't say that we were fresh. We weren't. And we need to hit when we're
fresh.  
  
So I'm really excited. It's been a minute since I've seen these guys fresh. It
has been a minute. And I'm happy. I mean, I'm excited. I cannot -- it's like
Christmas Eve and I cannot wait to open up that present that's sitting under
-- I cannot wait, because when they're fresh, we're good.  
  
Q. Scale of one to ten, Mot, how fired up is she?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Oh, a 20 (laughs).  
  
Q. Coach, with the balance that they have, knowing obviously you gotta
defend all five positions all the way out to the arc, do you still, even
knowing that, though, pay any greater notice to any -- they've had so many
different players step forward with some 20-point games and occasionally
30-point games. Does that give you any different kind of worry knowing that
you have to be prepared for one of their players to get hot the way some of
them can?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. I don't think it's any extra special worry. I respect their
talent, and I think they have great isolation sets and great mentality. But, I
mean, a balanced team.  
  
I think we're one, too, and I think you got both coaches trying to -- we're
going to have to coach really well in the game, because you can't just say,
well, they're all about this and Miami is just all about that. I mean, it's
just not true. So throughout the rosters up and down both teams, what matchup
is going to work? I don't think either one of us can go into the game knowing
for sure who's going to be on who and what's going to work. But I think that
both teams will give the ball to whoever is hot. There's no selfish player on
either team.  
  
Q. Laura, we asked coach this the other day, but those two players that
are sitting right next to you, how much have they meant to this program and
helping bring you guys along to where you are here today, the two ladies up
there on the dais with you?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: We thought a lot about this, but they are just two great
players. They're great people. And you know, they've brought us here. So yeah,
I'm really proud of them, and we just -- we all want to go far for them. It's
their last go around, so yeah, we're just trying to do it for them a little
bit, too, yeah.  
  
Q. How does your game day philosophy change in a game 7? I mean, it is a
game 7 atmosphere. They're all game 7s from here on out obviously. Is it
something that do you find you're doing things a bit differently when you get
to the tournament or do you try not to?  
COACH MEIER: You know, I sort of have a philosophy and I'm pretty clear when
I'm hiring and recruiting. If you're blessed to have 35 game days, if you're
blessed to have that many or more, it comes down to, what, 70 hours of your
whole entire year that you should be pretty awesome. You should be great. And
I'm going to be the best version of myself in those 70 hours, because they
deserve that from me. And in order to stay in that, I have exactly the same
routine every game day for as many years as I have coached.  
  
You do have to have a few more special situations probably ready because every
opponent is going to be so great from here on out and you want your kids very
comfortable and familiar with what calls you're going to make. You don't want
to surprise anybody. Sure, that might be one adjustment, but that doesn't
change on game day. That's more in preparation.  
  
Q. Just between the press conference that you guys had on --  
COACH MEIER: I thought you were going to say just between me and you.  
  
Q. Just between us, what's the secret game plan (laughs)? Between the
last press conference on Tuesday and Wednesday and the preparation from the
film, anything else that you can share that maybe you didn't expect that
jumped out at you at all in any way?  
COACH MEIER: That actually is a just-between-you-and-me question. You're not
going to catch me on that one.  
  
Tons of respect. Tons of respect. Their system is what they are and their
players make it work, and they do a great job. So it's complicated. And I
think that you see their conference and you know how they've just been so
great in their conference, and so you watch their conference films, because
it's just like watching us.  
  
You're going to watch Florida State's games for Miami because we play each
other three times a year. So you get a lot of information from seeing what
their conference is trying to do to them.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Lynn Bria? Did you call her at all for any tips?  
COACH MEIER: Lynn Bria?  
  
Q. Or North Florida?  
COACH MEIER: No, they're going to protect their conference?  
  
Q. Is that protocol?  
COACH MEIER: That's pretty standard.  
  
Q. Jessica, how important are the first five minutes going to be? Just
the start really in general. You know it's going to be hopefully anyway for
you guys I would think it's going to be a pretty exciting atmosphere. There
should be some people there. Is it critical to just get a jump early and sort
of dictate the flow instead of having it dictated under you?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Definitely, especially on the home floor. Our main focus this
season has just been about starting the game off right. We're probably one of
the most complex teams where we have different starting lineups, different
games, different weeks or whatever. So we take pride in the starting lineup to
make sure that we start off right, set the tone early and get everybody else
going because they know we set the tone.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay.

KATIE MEIER: Well, it's nice to be able to thank my own people for putting on
such a great tournament so far. I'm really impressed. It really does have an
NCAA feel to it. Just a big-time athletic department, a bunch of people have
been putting in a lot of work. We see it, and we really appreciate it, and we
just want to make sure we say thanks, because it looks great, feels great.
Big-time basketball is going to occur in this building this weekend, and we're
just really, really happy to be a part of it. So that's number one.  
  
And then number two, this is just great. It's just awesome. We're thrilled. We
know it's a big moment. We all came to Miami because we wanted pressure, and
we wanted big moments, and here it is. I mean, we never shied away from the
goal of having a third tournament here this year. The very first meeting we
talked about it. We actually had the -- some friends in the conference office,
the ACC, and some RPI people analyze our schedule the year before and say,
well, swap out one or two games, whether we won or not, and would that have
put us in a top 15 or 16 RPI, and it turned out that the Syracuse game at home
last year that we lost, had we won that, and perhaps maybe beaten Notre Dame
in the tournament, there was just one or two games that we could have turned
and gotten us there. That's how I opened our first meeting this year with the
team was, this is a goal of ours, like let's get there, all right.  
  
But that was November. So now it's March, and we're here. So our next goal is
to do something really special, and that's to win. Any time you can get any
type of win in the NCAA Tournament, I don't care where it is and who care who
it's against, any time you have an opportunity to compete in the NCAA
Tournament, it's awesome, but we want to get a win.  
  
Q. What's this buildup been like the last few days knowing you're going
to host, and it is a different feel, it's home, but it's not home, but it is
home. What has the buildup been like, and even with the guys not here, with
school on break, do you notice the electricity, do you notice more of a buzz
about this team than usual this week?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Yes, I mean, not having school, we're basically here all day,
and we know the stakes are high. It's a big tournament, and just to be hosting
it, we're blessed just to be hosting it. But I woke up this morning with a
little bit more pep in my step knowing this game will be tomorrow. I came to
the gym and just seeing how great everybody has done with the signs and just
security and just everything here is just -- it's a little bit more livelier
here. I think we're excited. I could just see it in everybody's faces. We're
just ready to go. I haven't played in a little over a week, I think, and just
to play against somebody other than the practice squad in such a big stage is
just exciting, and I think we're ready. We've been watching a lot of film and
just critiquing our last games, and I think we're just ready to go.  
  
Q. It has been a while since you guys have played a game, and it feels
like an eternity. What are you kind of expecting when you step on that floor
tomorrow even though there is all this buzz and this excitement, it is about
basketball, and will there be any rust? Are you worried about anything like
that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: No, I don't think so. I think we're well-prepared, the
coaching staff and practice squad, they've done a great job of getting us
prepared for this first game and the first round. I just think we're ready to
go, like she said. It's just a feeling of urgency, honestly. It's been a
little over a week, a long bye week. We're just ready to go, ready to get
going and playing.  
  
Q. Laura, they're a team that obviously they use great spacing. Any team
that runs that system would have to, and we all know how prolific they are
from three. What are the things that jump out that you're going to really have
to keep an eye on defensively to try to disrupt them as best you can against
that system?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Well, we watched a little film, and I've got to say Florida
Gulf Coast is a great team. As you said, they have a great spacing on offense,
and you know they all can shoot. Even their post players, their five, they can
shoot. They move very well without the ball. They set a lot of off-ball
screens. You know, so we've got to be low in our stance, and everybody got to
defend everybody. We might switch. You never know. So yeah, they're a pretty
good team, but I think we are a pretty good defensive team, also, so we've
just got to lock down and get ready for their movement.  
  
Q. Mot, you guys were the favorite last year in your opening-round game.
Obviously things didn't go the way you wanted them to. How much have you all
even thought about that at all, or just making sure it doesn't happen again
because you know what it feels like to have an underdog coming after you?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I honestly haven't thought about it. It's a new year. It's a
new feel to the season. But just knowing that every game might be your last,
you just play with a little bit more sense of urgency. But as far as thinking
about last year, I think that's long gone. We have our minds set to something
bigger, and we're just focused on making sure we pursue that.  
  
I think we just have a better vision of what we want to accomplish, and I
think we're ready just to get the ball up in the air and just get going.  
  
Q. It's been like a month and a half since you played a game; how much
does that concern you?  
KATIE MEIER: I'm not concerned. There are times where our conference -- just
think about game after game after game against ranked opponents and how much
pressure we had on us to finish strong and to do something special in the
tournament. We were very, very honest about our position. They'd get RPI
updates all year, so we knew. I mean, there was a point in the season where I
think we were a little down because our standings in the conference, and I'm
like, guys, look at your body of work, don't worry about it. It was a schedule
that had us playing away on most of the ranked teams' courts, and we had done
a really special job, but that ACC Tournament, we played our guts out. We
really played hard. So I wasn't sad to have a couple days of rest and sort of
regroup and get their legs back underneath them because that third game, the
shots that -- you can't say that we were fresh. We weren't. And we need to hit
when we're fresh, so I'm really excited.  
  
It's been a minute since I've seen these guys fresh. It has been a minute, and
I'm happy. I'm excited. I cannot -- it is like Christmas Eve, and I cannot
wait to open up that present that's sitting under the tree. I cannot wait,
because when they're fresh, we're good.  
  
Q. How fired up is she, Mot, scale of 1 to 10?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Oh, 20.  
  
Q. Coach, with the balance that they have, knowing obviously you've got
to defend all five positions all the way out to the arc, do you still even
knowing that, though, pay any greater notice to any -- they've had so many
different players step forward with some 20-point games and occasionally
30-point games. Does that give you any kind of different worry knowing that
you have to be prepared for one of their players to get hot the way some of
them can?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I don't think that's any extra special worry. I mean, I
respect their talent, and I think they have great isolation sets and a great
mentality. But I mean, a balanced team, I think we're one, too, and I think
you've got both coaches trying to -- we're going to have to coach really well
in the game because you can't just say, well, they're all about this, and
Miami is just all about that. I mean, it's just not true. So throughout the
rosters up and down both teams, what match-up is going to work, I don't think
either one of us can go into the game knowing for sure who's going to be on
who and what's going to work.  
  
But I think that both teams will give the ball to whoever is hot. There's no
selfish player on either team.  
  
Q. Laura, we asked coach this the other day, but those two players that
are sitting right next to you, how much have they meant to this program and
helping bring you guys along to where you are here today, the two ladies up
there on the dais with you?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I mean, we talked a lot about this, but they're just two
great players. They're great people, and you know, they've brought us here. So
yeah, I'm really proud of them, and we just all want to go far for them. You
know, it's their last go-around. So yeah, we're just trying to do it for them
a little bit, too, yeah.  
  
Q. How does your game day philosophy change in a Game 7? They're all
Game 7s from here on out, obviously. Do you find that you're doing things a
bit differently when you get to the tournament, or do you try not to?  
KATIE MEIER: You know, I sort of have a philosophy, and I'm pretty clear when
I'm hiring and when I'm recruiting, if you're blessed to have 35 game days, if
you're blessed to have that many, or more, it comes down to, what, 70 hours of
your whole entire year that you should be pretty awesome. You should be great.
And I'm going to be the best version of myself in those 70 hours because they
deserve that from me, and in order to stay in that, I have exactly the same
routine every game day for as many years as I have coached.  
  
Do you have to have a few more special situations probably ready because every
opponent is going to be so great from here on out and there's going to be --
you want your kids very comfortable and familiar with what calls you're going
to make. You don't want to surprise anybody. Sure, that might be one
adjustment, but that doesn't change on game day, that's more in preparation.  
  
Q. Just between the press conference that you guys had on Tuesday or
Wednesday and the further preparation and the film, anything else that you can
share that maybe you didn't expect that jumped out at you at all in any way?  
KATIE MEIER: That actually is a just between you and me question. You're not
going to catch me on that one. Their system is what they are, and their
players make it work, and they do a great job. It's complicated, and I think
that you see their conference and you know how they've just been so great in
their conference, and so you watch their conference foes because it's just
like watching us. You're going to want to watch Florida State's games for
Miami because we play each other three times a year. You get a lot of
information from seeing what their conference is trying to do to them.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Lynn? Did you call her at all for any tips?  
KATIE MEIER: No, they're going to protect their conference.  
  
Q. Is that protocol?  
KATIE MEIER: That's pretty standard.  
  
Q. Yes, Jessica, how important are the first five minutes going to be,
or just the start really in general? You know it's going to be hopefully a
pretty exciting atmosphere, there should be some people there. Is it critical
to just get a jump early and dictate the flow instead of having it dictated
under you?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Yeah, especially on the home floor. Our main focus this season
has just been about starting the game off right. We're probably one of the
most complex teams where we have different starting lineups, different games,
different weeks, whatever. You know, we take pride in the starting lineup to
make sure we start off right, set the tone early, and get everybody else going
because we know we set the tone.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Erika Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33153)

### [Natisha Heideman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33154)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're start with opening comments from Coach Kieger. Then we'll
open it up to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH KIEGER: First of all, I think we're very excited to be here. We're very
excited to be in our first NCAA Tournament with this group. Obviously it's a
lot warmer than it was in Milwaukee. So we're excited about that.  
  
I think our team is very thrilled to represent the Big East in this NCAA
Tournament. And I'm just really happy for our players that they get to
experience this.  
  
We've had a motto for about the last two months now to make the NCAA
Tournament for our lone senior, Michaela Yentz, and the fact we were able to
do it and celebrate this round because she's never been there. I think it's
going to be really special, and I think our girls are really excited about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Allazia Blockton, Erika Davenport and Natisha Heideman.
Questions.  
  
Q. Erika, the momentum that you all are carrying into this, just was
there a trigger over these last eight games that helped you guys find this
next gear? Or was this just the culmination of just steady progress kind of
throughout the course of the season?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel it was steady progress. I feel like we always had it,
just, like, the season, I feel like we got better, and it was just steady
progress of all the momentum going through the season.  
  
Q. From what you've seen on film with Quinnipiac, what kind of
challenges do you think they present for you tomorrow?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Quinnipiac is a very good team. They're very disciplined and
skilled. I think the challenge we might face is that they're a good rebounding
team and we're pretty small, so keeping them off the glass will be a key part
of winning the game. And I think we'll do a really good job of that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You're obviously a team that when you can get out and run when you
can put up a lot of points, you tend to do it in hurry in bunches. Quinnipiac
is a team that I think it seems like they're best with a pace much slower than
what you guys like to get out. How critical will it be the first few minutes
to set a tone and get that pace at that level where you guys are most
comfortable?  
NATISHA HEIDEMAN: We're going to set the tone in the first five minutes of the
game. Our whole game plan is to just play fast. That's what we've been doing
all season, and that's what we'll continue to do throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. Sometimes it's strange because women's tournaments you haven't played
in a while. Sometimes the men they go from Sunday, they get right into it on
Thursday in some cases how has this time helped you and how are you worried
are you about maybe some rust building up from the Big East Tournament until
Saturday?  
ERIKA DAVENPORT: I feel that we have great trainers that help us to be
energized and just making our body feel well. I feel like this time period has
really helped us (indiscernible) and to get rest and do what we need to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kieger.  
  
Q. This is a bit of a homecoming for you. Is this the first time you've
been back here since you've been at Marquette, and what's it like coming back
here?  
COACH KIEGER: Our team actually played an FIU tournament last year, so they've
been back here. I've been back here. We practiced here, last year before that
tournament. So that was kind of good for them to get down here and for me to
kind of be back in the practice gym.  
  
So it's very unique. It's very weird. I'm enjoying it, obviously, being back
here and seeing all familiar faces. But like I told the team yesterday, for
us, this is a business trip. It's not spring break. We're not coming down to
Miami to have some fun. This is our first NCAA Tournament as a group and we're
going to enjoy it, and we're going to have a lot of fun, but we also want to
get to work.  
  
Q. You look at the roster and it's just so young. And is this maybe even
a little bit ahead of schedule for what you envisioned what was maybe like the
most likely path for this program?  
COACH KIEGER: When this group of sophomores came in, we knew they had a lot of
talent, and it was just a matter of time and when we were going to get to
where we wanted to go. Obviously last year was a lot of learning experience.
They played significant minutes.  
  
So I don't really consider this group sophomores in terms of the amount of
minutes that they've logged. And our goal all season long was to get to the
NCAA Tournament. So for us I don't think it was a shock. I think for others it
might have been, but this was our goal from the moment we lost against Seton
Hall in the Big East Tournament last year until now.  
  
Q. You touched on the homecoming aspect, but what was the emotion like
when you just saw who was in this pod with you guys and you realized who would
be on the floor in the game after yours?  
COACH KIEGER: I was actually writing when our name popped up and all of a
sudden the team started screaming. So I looked up and I saw the 5 seed and I
saw Coral Gables, and my first thought was, one, we're a 5 seed, and, two,
we're playing in Coral Gables and that Miami was hosting. So congratulations
to them; they deserve it.  
  
And then obviously then, we're coming back here to where I coached. So it's a
lot of emotions. Can't really put it into words, but more so I'm just really
excited for our team to have, one, won the Big East and then, two, to
experience what it is to be in a NCAA Tournament.  
  
I've really talked all season long that I really want them to experience this.
I remember as a player, I remember what it's like as a coach, to be here and
for them to experience this and really get rewarded for their hard work, I'm
just really proud of them.  
  
Q. What stands out defensively when you look at them?  
COACH KIEGER: They're very disciplined, as we talked about prior. They like to
pack the paint. They play personnel very well. So I think we've got to be
aware of them, face guarding our leading scorers and just changing things up.  
  
They run a buzz defense. They're very well coached. For us we've got to, as
Natisha said, play our pace, make sure we're playing Marquette basketball and
don't let their defensive tendencies dictate what we're doing.  
  
Q. The follow-up was how has what you would define as Marquette
basketball kind of evolved over your three years?  
COACH KIEGER: Well, I think when I got the job at Marquette, I knew the style
that I wanted to play, and I knew we wanted to be up tempo. I knew it was
going to take a while for them to get to the pace we want to play and
understand the system that we're trying to create.  
  
I think our offense has evolved in the last three years, and as a group we're
figuring it out. And I think when you see us play now versus last year, even
we know each other better. We know what I'm looking for better. They're making
reads and they're reacting versus just being robots. And I think that's when
we're very hard to guard is -- we're unpredictable. And we're very hard to
scout.  
  
When you watch us play, I would not want to be an assistant coach for another
team because: What are they running? Sometimes I don't even know what we're
running but they do a fantastic job of reading and playing off each other, and
I think that's one thing that where we really evolved last year is eliminating
our dribbles and our passing has improved drastically. That's the biggest
thing I'm proud of in the year from last year to this year, is the way we're
sharing the ball; it's phenomenal.  
  
Q. Carolyn, Quinnipiac, this is their third NCAA Tournament appearance
in the last five years. They feel that they've been to the stage; they're
ready for the upset. How do you make sure that your team doesn't fall victim
to the 5-12 upset?  
COACH KIEGER: For us, once the NCAA Tournament starts, I don't look at seeds.
You have one job. And that's to beat the opponent next to you.  
  
And everybody is good if you make it to the NCAA Tournament. Everybody is
capable of beating the person that they're playing every single night.  
  
So for us, we've been just focussing on one game at a time. We did it for the
Big East Tournament. We weren't looking ahead. We were just going to play
Marquette basketball. And really we're evolving as a defensive team.  
  
And I think that's one thing, that you look at the beginning of the year to
now, we're starting to learn how to pack the paint. We're starting to learn
how to play to other players' tendencies.  
  
So for us, we've watched film on Quinnipiac for the last four days, and I
think our players are really focused. And they're going to make sure that
they're locked in defensively as well as offensively.

_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the 12th seed, Quinnipiac. We're joined by Coach
Tricia Fabbri, Carly Fabbri, Adily Martucci and Morgan Manz. And what we'll do
is we'll open it up with opening remarks from Coach.  
  
COACH FABBRI: Good afternoon. We're excited to be back in the Big Dance. We're
excited to be in Miami. We're looking forward to a great game with Marquette.
They've had an incredible season. Big East champions.  
  
But we're really looking forward to an opportunity that we've worked extremely
hard for, earned, and to be back here a third time in five years. We've got
incredible experience. It's a great opportunity, and we're just really excited
to make the most of an opportunity that we have, again, worked really hard for
all year long.  
  
And this is a moment that I don't feel is too big for this team. And, again,
we're looking forward to the weekend, the competition tomorrow and the 40-plus
minutes against Marquette tomorrow.  
  
Q. Carly, it's been, like, two weeks since the MAAC final, I guess, and
there's been spring break, the storm. I don't know how much of it you ended up
getting or not. But just what has this all been like to go from the three
games in three days in Albany to three days of hurry up and wait for
tomorrow?  
CARLY FABBRI: For sure, in any tournament three games in three days, it is a
lot. But we felt good coming out of the MAAC Tournament, obviously having won
it.  
  
We got, I think, two days off, and then we went right back to practice and
refocused. But when we found out on Monday who we were going to play, you
know, we were really excited, kind of finally putting a name to a face.  
  
But I think those days off, they helped us recover from a grueling tournament
up in Albany. But we're happy to be back in tournament play. Happy to be in a
warmer place in Miami. But definitely it was a long too weeks, but it helped
us refocus for sure.  
  
Q. I believe you won 10 games (indiscernible). Can you talk about how
much confidence the team has here coming in? Is the confidence pretty sky high
(indiscernible) accomplishing things this weekend?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Absolutely. After our little slump, the ten games straight has
been really big for us and definitely grown our confidence levels. And since
then we've just had a huge belief in each other and in our coaches and that's
going to be huge come tomorrow.  
  
Q. When the seeding came out on Monday and Marquette was asked their
initial reactions about facing Quinnipiac, one of their guards said I've never
heard of it. What are your initial reactions to that, and how does that fuel
you?  
CARLY FABBRI: I think that it's nothing new to us. I think a lot of teams that
we do play from bigger conferences, they do have trouble pronouncing our name.
They don't really know where we're from, even though we have, you know, been a
major power for the past couple of years.  
  
But, I mean, if anything it's just an extra push. We're motivated as it is.
We've had this school since summer, we wanted to win our championship in the
league, which we did, and we want to win a game and the NCAA Tournament. But I
think we're just a little bit more focused on ourselves. I think if they don't
know who we are, they're going to know who we are tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, as a starter your team has been prone to slow starts.
Marquette just said a little while ago in their press conference they want to
start the game really well. They want to dictate pace of play, especially in
the first five minutes. How do you go about combatting that?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: We definitely want to do the same. I think because of our slow
starts, we need to really change that and start very hot on offense. And I
think the big thing about doing that is just staying confident in our own
shots.  
  
I know I am very confident in my teammates, and they're confident in me. But I
think for ourselves we just need to be confident in our own shots.  
  
Q. When you get to this game, when you talk as a team since summer, like
Carly said, to win the MAAC, get to the NCAA Tournament, when you accomplish
that, do you almost feel like, yeah, you're playing for yourselves, you're
playing for your school, of course. But do you feel you're almost representing
the MAAC, too -- in some way that you're carrying the MAAC flag a little bit
when you get into this environment as well?  
MORGAN MANZ: I definitely think it's an honor to represent the MAAC. There is
only one team that gets to be sent here. You have to win your conference.  
  
So being able to come here represent the MAAC in the best way we can, we're
going to go out there and hopefully we can do our best.  
  
Q. Trish, third time in five years with this team. In your mind, what
sets this squad apart from the two prior teams that you sent to the NCAAs?  
COACH FABBRI: That's a great question. Ultimately, I think that this team has
benefited from the experience of being in not only the tournament but having
won championships. They've been able to set a different expectation this year.
I also think that we benefited from getting into a championship game and not
winning and really having a focus and a clear vision of what they wanted for
this season.  
  
And they were unwavered in their goals and what they wanted to achieve. It was
a challenge. Every season is. And we faced our challenges. But how we
responded to our challenges has made this team very different than the teams
that we've had in the past.  
  
Nothing good's ever easy. I said it a million times. But how we responded to
losing three out of four the end of January into the beginning of February,
and now to win 10 straight, to get into this position, to earn the seed, to
see Marquette on this neutral court, to remain unwavered, to stand in those
challenges and to respond the way that we have all together has made this team
very different.  
  
I've said the word time and again we talked a lot about grit, resilience,
finding ways. We haven't gotten out to our best starts. That's been maybe just
who we are, but we have been resilient. There's no panic; there's poise in how
we find ways to win. And that's what I would expect from this team tomorrow,
regardless of the start.  
  
Q. The logistics of this week, (indiscernible) or something like that.
How difficult was all that to deal with from a logistics standpoint?  
COACH FABBRI: Honestly, it wasn't bad at all. Because my part-time job is
meteorologist. I really enjoy The Weather Channel. And so we were planning
ahead.  
  
And fortunately enough, after the Selection Show, with the weather coming and
even before that, we had the plan in effect that we went grocery shopping. We
had plenty of supplies on hand.  
  
And with finding out that we were playing on Saturday really did help us that
we were able to not practice on Tuesday. And the governor did close the roads
down.  
  
So there was no way -- there was a travel ban, we were not going to get on the
roads. And the players can tell you that they went in, they went grocery
shopping in the team room and everyone had their supplies for breakfast, lunch
and dinner.  
  
And everything was copacetic, and we were able to have very good prep days,
our practice and stay in a routine. And the best thing we knew we were coming
to Miami.  
  
Maybe they weren't going anywhere for spring break but we still were able to
get to Miami. So it was really a win-win for us.  
  
Q. I know it turned inland, but how much did you guys end up getting?  
COACH FABBRI: It was around 10 to 12 inches of snow and it was still pretty
icy the next day, but we fared pretty well.  
  
Q. There's three games really on their schedule that sort of jump -- the
three against DePaul. DePaul locked down everybody all year, and DePaul
averaged 100 in those three games. What's it about their ability to get out
and go that might concern you the most?  
COACH FABBRI: Yes, just because I studied up as much as I could and
ironically, I just had that championship game on that night watching them
play.  
  
The synergy that they have with the three players that played on the AAU team
together, you know, their connection, their ability to get out and find one
another, that's a big deal. That seems to obviously carried over and turned
into a short turnaround into this program that's really on the rise and
playing so well right now.  
  
But we have a game plan in place to defend what their strength is in their
transition. And it's not going to be easy, because they get out and they're
just talented players with a great coach that have found a great way to get
out and score and average 80 points. We certainly have our hands full with
them wanting to get out and play up and down. But with that said we like to go
up and down ourselves.  
  
So I like that pace. I think it's going to be an exciting basketball game for
40-plus minutes, however long it's going to take. I think it's going to be a
really good women's basketball game in the tournament which is what you want
to see. These are the elite teams in the 64, but they want to get out and run.
I think we have our challenges, but I think we also do have a plan that's in
place to hopefully try and slow that transition game down.  
  
Q. Coach, you sort of touched on this earlier, but just how much of an
advantage does your experience, the players who have been in the tournament
before and just the veteran players veteran leadership, will help you
tomorrow?  
COACH FABBRI: Again, reflecting back to the first time and the second time,
you get this excitement and happy to be here. And as the years go on, and your
goals and aspirations change for your program, and within the players. And now
it's a real opportunity for us, and it was talked about not only as the
coaches, but when you don't have to talk about it, coaches to your team and
players, when it's an expectation amongst your players and your team is
talking about what they want, makes our job a lot easier.  
  
So this is an expectation from them. They've worked extremely hard to get
here. This is the moment they want. I expect them to make the most of their
moment.  
  
Q. When you went 1-3 in that stretch, was there -- what changed? There's
all sorts of reasons, ball just bounces that way or whatever? Were there
meetings? Did you change things? What was the catalyst to go from that to
this?  
COACH FABBRI: There's a lot that goes into it. There's not just one thing.
There was certainly an injury to Brittany Johnson. We were playing five in and
five out. We adjusted to that. There was just a flip of the calendar to
February.  
  
There were some other symbolic things that we did as a team from within, that
if I believed made an impact on going back to the purpose of what we were
doing, why we were doing it. And maybe that's a question that the players want
to answer more than myself.  
  
CARLY FABBRI: I think we just kind of banded together, I think. Obviously we
didn't like to lose. And it was happening a little bit more frequently than we
were used to in past years.  
  
So I think we just banded together. We made some changes on the court, off the
court, and we just got back to Quinnipiac basketball, sharing the ball,
winning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 86, Cal - 46  
  
Q. Nina and Alexis, just talk about just your last home game and what it
meant to go out like this, just to have a performance like this in your last
game.  
NINA DAVIS: It was great. We wanted to come out, we just wanted to kind of do
like we did in our first game, come out strong and aggressive and just kind of
try to put them away early.  
  
As I say, it's a bittersweet thing. We wanted to just leave our mark here. Of
course you wanted to give the fans the exciting thing, and just wanted my last
game here to be a good one.  
  
Q. Talk about the fan reaction when all four of you got taken out at the
same time.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It really hit me once she said it was our last time going in
here. I don't know. We had a good year. Played hard, finished it the way we
were supposed to. Kristy, there were like six lead changes there early, and
y'all went on a nice run and then had another run there in the second quarter
where it went from like six points up to I think it was 35-16 maybe. Was that
your offense, or do you feel like it started on the defensive end?  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: I think we got going on the defensive end. Yeah, we stopped
kind of the big presence and kind of helped down and covered down, and we were
able to run off that, and we're really good on the run, especially with these
two on the wing. They can just create and do some athletic stuff. That's where
the momentum kind of changed, and we kind of just kept pushing forward.  
  
Q. Kristy, y'all assisted on about 80 percent of your makes. What did
you think of the ball movement, especially in the half court today?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, great. I think we played a good team game on offense. We
didn't settle for just regular shots. We kind of looked to find some good
shots, and yeah, we made them, so that was really great.  
  
Q. Kristy, there was the spurt, but there was also the two back to back
threes by Natalie, but the first one you come over to the right side and she
was there and you motion her over and a couple passes later she made it. Talk
about what that sequence did for you, the two threes. I guess you were telling
her to get open, right?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, Nat hit some key shots, and that was a huge momentum
shifter. I show she's been working hard on her threes, so it was great to kind
of find her, and she got herself open, and yeah, she hit them, which was
really exciting.  
  
Q. Nina, y'all go back to Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. You
lost to West Virginia there, you lost to Notre Dame there a couple years ago.
Does the arena matter at this point?  
NINA DAVIS: It doesn't. We've had losses there. We've shed plenty of tears
there, but we've also celebrated in confetti there, as well. We're not really
worried about the location where we're playing at, we're just worried about
our next opponent, which is Louisville, and just focused on us and what we
have to do to get to the next round.  
  
Q. Kim, talk about that stretch in the second quarter where y'all did
take over the and the fact that Natalie hit those two threes and it seemed
like the whole momentum of the game shifted at that point.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Natalie, she's comfortable now, and I think when Kalani got
in foul trouble, Cox, freshman, goes in, and was big. Beatrice played big.
Jones came in, and then Natalie. We shared the ball, Kristy did a tremendous
job of pushing the ball up the floor, but looking to the backside and finding
shooters, and when a shooter makes one, find her again and let her make
another one.  
  
Q. Kristy mentioned during that stretch that the defense stepped up. Was
there one particular area that help side rotation ball pressure that stood out
to you?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes, we want to hedge big on the on-ball screens. We didn't care
if that post player slipped the screen, so the help side that's guarding that
wing player over there, we made sure she came and helped. We didn't do that
very good in the conference tournament, in any of the games. So we were able
to come back and just work on us, just work on help side. You get caught up in
this game. Look, this game has changed. When they started shooting threes,
it's changed everything about your defense, and you get caught up in -- I got
mine, you take yours, make sure you have your girl, and I just can't play like
that. That's just not how I was taught the game.  
  
We just got back to being better help side defense, and I thought we took away
all their transition baskets. A team that's as athletic as they are, take away
their transition baskets.  
  
Q. Asia Thomas, I think she was the one that hit like five three-
pointers for her. Kristy was on her most of the game. Talk about the defense,
and what did they make, 3 out of 13 for the game; is that a good basketball
question?  
KIM MULKEY: That's a great question, and you even knew her name. Kristy was
assigned to guard her. We didn't want to help down ball side. When the minute
Anigwe turned, then you could hit from the backside. If you were ball side and
it was not Thomas, we covered down and we wanted them to make threes. We
didn't want them to penetrate and get in the paint and get us in foul trouble
all night, and she hit big shots against LSU. We knew that, but we were very
willing to give them the three-pointers tonight.  
  
Q. The ball movement, again, 28 assists tonight; how impressed were you
on that?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, very. I think sometimes -- there were spurts in that first
half where we dribbled too much in the same place waiting for on-ball screens
and they were trapping us, and I didn't like that. So I got out of our offense
where we were setting on ball screens and just do the high-low look with the
two bigs, and then Kalani got in foul trouble, so when you go small with Nina
she can't see in there to get the big the ball, so just spread the ball, just
move it, slip the screen, find the open player. Kristy does that as good as
anybody I've coached. She pushes it up the floor to the wing players and lets
those guys go find a post player in transition.  
  
I thought all of them were big tonight. I thought our depth has surfaced big
time in these two playoff games. We knew we had depth. We've seen it all year.
You've seen them play. But you don't know how they're going to produce in the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Tonight, while you don't ever want Kalani Brown to play two minutes in the
first quarter and sit, it may have been a blessing in disguise because it
allowed me to gain confidence in Cox, who went in immediately and defended a
tremendous athlete. Beatrice has all of last year's experience, and we didn't
miss a beat. And that's important for them and for me and for our team.  
  
Q. Obviously next is Oklahoma City. Talk about facing Louisville for the
third time in the Sweet 16 in nine years and just how different is that team
from ones you've faced in the past or if you know much about them yet?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I watched a little bit of their game with Tennessee prior to
our game. You know, the first time that we played Louisville, I thought they
had the better team. You know, Jessica Morrow tried to take us on her
shoulders that year, and we competed. We competed. And then we all know what
happened the year that we were supposed to win that third National
Championship when we had Griner and Odyssey and all those guys, and they were
good. They made, correct me if I'm wrong, if memory served me right, 16 out of
25 threes. Well, you can win every game if you do that. And for us to have
come back and even made it a close game and a shot to win it was miraculous
because they couldn't miss.  
  
But that's history. So now you go to this game, and they're a different team,
we're a different team. They have great players, we have great players.
They're well-coached. I don't know if we are or not, but we'll see. But we'll
compete. I think we have a size advantage, but really what does that mean at
this level? If you can play, you can play.  
  
Our size is young, and I think people tend to forget that. Our size -- and
Nina and KK are small, but our three bigs are a freshman and two sophomores,
and I just think the more they can get NCAA experience, the better they get,
and then maybe some day they'll win them a National Championship here.  
  
But two different -- three different times we've played -- this will be our
third time to play them, and we'll prepare tomorrow and Wednesday, and I think
leave Wednesday night and go to Oklahoma City.  
  
Q. Is Alexis -- her shot was off a couple times today. Is that a matter
maybe of not having that practice time during all this? Or is her knee still
bothering her?  
KIM MULKEY: No, her knee is fine. I asked her. When you get fatigued and
you're not running up and down the floor, sometimes you're short because of
your legs. But I thought she took good shots. I thought that she drove some to
show you that she can get in there. She got her shot blocked. But she gave us
20, 22 good minutes, and if you look at her stats, they're pretty good. She
gave us, what, six rebounds and eight points, five assists. She's good.

LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: First off, we want to thank you for being here and the
coverage, and I think it's a great sport of women's basketball, and for you
all to be here I think is really meaningful. I'd also like to thank the folks
at Baylor who have run this weekend. They're obviously used to hosting. They
do a great job, and the people from the -- the workers and people who checked
us in were not only on top of things but gracious and kind, and we appreciate
that.  
  
I want to congratulate Baylor. Kim gave me a baby gift at shoot-around today.
I thought that was really thoughtful. She said she has a place in her heart
for moms and coaching, and that's the kind of thing that women's basketball is
about.  
  
They have a darned good team. I know they have to go to Oklahoma City first,
but I think they have a great chance to be playing down the road here in
Dallas and a shot to win the National Championship, so it was a great
challenge for us.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. I think it was a huge step for us to get here,
and not just to prove to people that we belonged in the tournament, but more
taking a look forward, I think this is a group that can do some special
things, and we needed this experience. We needed to see that we could win a
game on this stage, and we also needed to be humbled and see what a No. 1 seed
looks like, because that's where we want to be.  
  
Especially appreciative of Courtney Range, without whom we would not have
gotten to this point, because there were some times in the year where it's
rocky, and I think her leadership helped us get here, and I think next year
when we're a better team and these young kids are playing deeper into the
dance, we'll be talking about Courtney's leadership at that point. So I just
wanted to say that.  
  
Q. Kristine, Kalani Brown picked up two quick fouls early in the game. I
think it was the first minute and 10 seconds. Did y'all sense that as an
opportunity with her on the bench?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Um, they have like six 6'4" players, so I just tried to play
them the same way, and if one went out, another one came in, took her spot and
played hard. Another one came in, played hard. So I just tried to do the same
thing. They all like played kind of the same.  
  
Q. As Coach just talked about, the experience of getting here and the
win and then tonight, talk about trying to put that -- I know it's a little
early, but put that in perspective looking ahead what that can do for this
young group and everybody coming back.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Wow. I wish I was celebrating going to the Sweet 16, but you
don't always get what you want. And so I personally am just going to work
really hard and take my team there next year. Last year we didn't even make it
here. It's just a step, a step -- we won the first round, lost in the second
round by 40 points to the No. 1 seed. Next year I really hope we can get to
the Sweet 16 and not be that 9 seed playing the 1 seed.  
  
I'm just going to work really hard to not feel this way ever again.  
  
Q. Courtney, for you as a senior this is your last game in the Cal
uniform. Talk a little bit about how that feels for you, and also Coach's
words about your leadership, helping to get Cal back on this stage.  
COURTNEY RANGE: I mean, it's a bittersweet feeling, you know. I mean, it
sucks, you wish you could be like Baylor celebrating, going on to the Sweet
16. But like Kristine said, her individually, she's going to work hard. I know
her, her work ethic. She's going to take the team, put it on her back, and
have them follow her and what she's doing, and she's going to make sure that
they don't feel this feeling anymore. Like she said, they're going to work
hard not to be a 9 seed. They're going to work to be that 1 seed to
potentially be hosting at Cal.  
  
Yeah, and me personally, I mean, four years, I mean, it's gone by -- I
wouldn't say fast. People say it goes by quick. I wouldn't say that. Yes, it
has its ups and downs. It was fun, and I mean, the group of girls throughout
my four years, I just love them all, and I'm happy that I chose Cal.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys shot 29 percent. I know as Kristine said, they've
got a lot of size, but what is it about Baylor's defense that makes it so
tough? Is it the length?  
COURTNEY RANGE: To me, yeah, just like Kristine said. One goes out, another
6'4" comes in, so we had our game plan, we tried to execute it the best we
could. Obviously today it wasn't in our favor, but like I said, if we get a --
if they get another shot at them again, they'll know what to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you played these guys three years ago I think it was; what's
different about this team? Is this a better team, I guess?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: That's a tough one to answer because they're both pretty
good. This is a truly unique team in women's college basketball with the waves
of post players coming in. And it's not like -- I mean, I don't know, maybe
you saw, our game plan early on was to really pack the paint. I tried to use
the West Virginia prototype, pack the paint, make them shoot jumpers; then you
look at the stats, and those kids shooting jumpers are 40 percent, 40 percent.
Oh, Natalie comes off the bench, 45 percent. It's not like they have a glaring
weakness.  
  
I think if Alexis Jones kind of gets back in her rhythm a little bit, I think
she's a first-round WNBA pick. If she's playing well and the post players and
the guard play, I mean, that team we played back then was pretty darned good,
to too, but this team is really, really special, and I think as people thought
from the beginning of the year, they're a legit national title contender. They
played Connecticut tough the first time. They're really good.  
  
Q. Once you guys hit your first three shots and had some good passing
and stuff, with Kalani on the bench, I know they said the depth that Baylor
has is tough, but did you see that as an opportunity?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, if you had told me that we would start the
game and we would get Kalani two quick fouls, I would have thought that's
favorable. I would have chosen that, but I wouldn't also have been like, okay,
now we're home free. You just know that their depth is a huge just weapon for
them.  
  
I thought the main thing was we struggled to score so much, which actually
didn't even allow us to try to do our defensive game plan. When you let them
get going in transition, that's when they're up scoring in the high 80s and
90s, so if we could have scored more I thought we could have set our defense
and maybe tried to at least bother them into some shots they weren't as
comfortable with, but once they get going in transition now, now it's tough to
get your doubles on the posts, it's tough to get a hand up on shooters, so I
think our inability to score consistently was trouble.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know your team would have liked to have been the seventh,
but it looks like the Pac-12 is going to send six teams to the Sweet 16. What
does that say about the challenge that you guys have but also just about how
strong this league was all year?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so Washington and UCLA both won? Great. You know, I
can't say I'm that surprised. Like I remember having a conversation with Mike
Neighbors, my buddy in the league, we talk about this stuff, about getting the
RPI and all that kind of stuff. We said early in the year, I don't know if we
have a Final Four team. I don't know if there's a legit top five team, but we
said we could get five or six in the Sweet 16, and maybe there is a Final Four
team or two, and I hope there will be.  
  
But I think it speaks to the depth of the league. I mean, we've said it -- it
sounds like lip service, but it's real. Our fifth place team took the SEC
champ to the wire last night. Our -- is it five? Five teams, yeah. And our
sixth place team tonight beat a top ACC team, with Duke -- did Duke come in
second or third? Really towards the top. So the depth of the league is no
joke, and I think we prepare each other for moments like this, and I'm super
happy for my colleagues and our Pac-12 brethren, and I think five Sweet 16
says a lot, and of course it makes every night in the league harder, right.
Going back the days when it was us and Stanford battling it out, only two
teams in the tournament, maybe my life was a little easier night to night, but
it doesn't make you better, and I think this is what's good for the league.
Glad to be part of it, and sure, we want to be one of the ones at the very,
very top next year.  
  
Q. Building on that, like the league is getting -- the Pac-12 is getting
so strong now; what are you going to do with your team to keep pace or even
catch up really?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, I think different things matter right now.
Like we used to be able to be young and talented and go win on the road in the
league even when we didn't play our best or something like that, and now the
league is so good that that's good for everybody. I mean, what I said to them
in there is the year prior to the Final Four year, we were an 8 seed. Again,
we finished second in the Pac-12 and we were an 8 seed at Notre Dame. We won
the first game, and we played Notre Dame tough. Played them tougher than this
outcome was. But I remember saying in that locker room, I think Muffet McGraw
had said, hey, that's a top-10 team next year, and I said, I want us to be
great next year not simply because we return everybody but because everybody
in this room is better than what they are now, and it was a very similar
message. We will definitely miss Courtney, but we have the majority of our
team coming back. We have some great kids coming in, and my challenge to them
is let's not just be better next year by default, because other people
graduate, but I want to be better because we've seen the bar and we want to
get to the top. We have competitors in there. They expected to come in here
and win. Not in any type of like unrealistic or -- but they're competitors.
Like they're going to come and say we want to beat this team. So now we have
to channel that into off-season workouts that get us to the point where we can
and get us to the point where we can be first in the Pac-12, and I don't have
a doubt that that's what's on the players' mind right now.  
  
Q. What did Kim get you today?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: It was one of those like carrier things, the things that you
wear when the baby is like 8 to 35 pounds. It was really cool. Yeah.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Kim Mulkey, Nina Davis and Kristy Wallace with us
today. Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Nina or Kristy, could you tell the break from the Big 12 until this
weekend, even during the week, had helped you guys a little bit, refresh you
physically and mentally?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure, rest is always great. It allowed players like Alexis
Jones come back and get her rhythm back and practice with us 100%. Around this
time of year rest is always great. We have seniors on this type of team and
any rest is always great. It showed yesterday.  
  
Q. Kristy, what did you like about y'all's defensive effort yesterday
and how do you carry that over to tomorrow?  
KRISTY WALLACE: It was good, I think that we emphasized that throughout the
week. Cal is an athletic team so we're going to need to be able to contain
them and stop dribble penetration.  
  
Q. Nina, obviously I know the focus for you is trying to get to the
Sweet 16, but talk about the fact that you'll be playing your last home game
here tomorrow night and the emotions that will go with that.  
NINA DAVIS: It's a bittersweet moment. Baylor has been great to me these past
four years, the fans, I'm definitely going to miss the opportunity to play at
the Ferrell Center in front of my fans and teammates and coaches, but I'm not
focused on that. I'm taking it day by day and game by game and I'm looking at
the big overall picture, and after we get there maybe the emotions will come
of how this is my last year.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Kristy Wallace's family is here from Australia, a side note for
you. A long trip with two little sisters, and of course Nina's family from
Memphis doesn't seen so far compared to that, but Kristy would never tell you
that.  
  
Q. How do you erase what happened last night and the fresh start? I know
you guys go from game-to-game, but how do you erase the performance last night
and move forward?  
NINA DAVIS: Simple, you erase it. It was a great game. It was a great showing.
I think everyone on the team scored. It allowed a lot of us to get rest and
the young players to get out there and get comfortable in their first NCAA
Tournament game. We're expected to win and we expected to win that game so you
move on from that. You just look forward to the next game. You don't look too
far ahead, and you don't look in the past.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: What she said. Just move on and take it game by game.  
  
Q. Kristy, we will ask you about your family being here. Like Kim said,
you didn't tell us the other day that they were coming. How special is it when
they're here? What's it like when they are here for you?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Very thankful that they got to make it up here to the
tournament. Yeah, very blessed to have my family here and very excited that
they get to watch a few games. It's a big effort and a big trip to make, so
I'm just thankful that they get to be here.  
  
Q. How long is the trip?  
KRISTY WALLACE: It's a 16-hour flight, so it's pretty brutal.  
  
Q. Nina and Kristy, what have you seen from Cal? Did you get to watch
the game last night? What have you seen from the Golden Bears?  
NINA DAVIS: They're a team full of a lot of athletes. They have five. They
have a great post player and they are going to come out aggressive and try to
take us off the dribble penetration. They're going to rebound hard and we have
to do a lot of boxing out and a lot of help defense. On the defensive end they
play man-to-man. So we have to do what they're doing to us and attack the
basket and come out hard like we did yesterday and play with a lot of energy.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Cal is an athletic team and we have to contain the dribble
penetration, like Nina said. They have a good post presence, so our bigs are
going to have their hands full dealing with that. Defense is a big key and
that is going to win us games, so we need to focus on them and stop them that
way.  
  
Q. Nina, you played them in 2014 here in the tournament. Do you remember
the difference between then and now? Have you seen them since then?  
NINA DAVIS: That was back in the day, my freshman year. They were a great
team. They came out and gave us a challenge. I think they had Brittany Boyd
and that crew. I don't think they have changed much. The faces have changed,
but they're going to attack. They're athletic. They crash the boards hard and
we know they don't want to go home, and this is the NCAA Tournament and
they're going to come out and try to pull off an upset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen film from Kristine Anigwe, their really
good forward?  
KIM MULKEY: Tremendous athleticism, leaps out of the gym, has great range,
runs the floor well. She's just an athlete. She didn't score a lot last night,
but we know that we've got to defend her. She gets to the foul line more than
anybody on their team, leading scorer. We have the size to match-up with her.
I think playing Cal versus LSU, it's a little bit more traditional for us
because of their size.  
  
If we had played LSU it would have been difficult, because they bring their
bigs outside the paint. So tremendous, tremendous athlete.  
  
Q. Kim, two years ago when you were hear you mentioned the 2017 Final
Four here two years ago and I know there was excitement about your team and
I'm not asking you about getting to the Final Four, but you two years ago were
excited about the prospects of what you had with this season with this team.
Talk about how this team has developed and has it lived up to what you hoped
for two years ago?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I can answer that based upon what they've done to this
point. If we don't make it to where certain people think we should be in a
Final Four I guess they're going to call it a failure. I don't do that
anymore. I'm blessed to have an elite program and coach elite basketball
players and there are a handful across the country that get to do the same
thing I get to do.  
  
You look at our record. The games we've lost were to good teams. Hopefully the
loss to West Virginia in some ways made us refocus and I just know that the
team that took the floor last night. It didn't matter who we played. That team
last night was as focused and as ready as they have been at any point this
year. It started in practice. You can say well maybe the loss made them.
Maybe. Whatever it was, I know that four seniors in that locker room realized
this is their last time to play on this floor. They realize this is their last
chance to get to a Final Four.  
  
When you are young, you don't want to disappoint your coach and you don't want
to disappoint your seniors. I thought the youth on that floor last night, the
three that came to the press conference with me, being so young, they were
poised. They were focused. They were determined to do their part.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit -- Kalani and Beatrice, obviously their
size gives them an advantage, but it's more than size. You have to have the
technique and you have to play. Talk about how you've seen them develop since
last year when they played in this tournament?  
KIM MULKEY: Last year, they both came in as freshmen and played immediately.
There is no substitute for experience. There is just no substitute for it.  
  
After that first year they realized, I did a lot of good things, but I've got
a long ways to go and it doesn't start when we start practice in October. It
starts in the summer when they're here for summer school and working with
strength and conditioning coach. I think kalani -- well, I don't think, I
know. Kalani is in great shape. She can play for longer periods. She is
moving. She took charge. She is running the floor. Who does that at 6'7"? She
wouldn't have done that a year ago.  
  
Beatrice is a rebounding machine. Beatrice can get to offensive rebounds as
good as any kids I've coached and one of the best I every coached, and one of
the best I have ever coached at offensive rebounding was Danielle Crockrom.
Beatrice has a knack for being around the ball. She wants to contribute, and
both of those young ladies have a lot of college basketball left in them, and
I'm just grateful they're on our team.  
  
Q. Are you having as much fun with this group as maybe you've had with
any team you've had?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes. You know, each team is different. Each team brings challenges
to the table. What this team has done is challenged me to stay on my toes
because we've got so many that can play. You usually can figure out your
rotation after about a month of practice.  
  
This team just has so much talent I can't do that. It's game-to-game. It's who
we play. It's who is playing good, and I can't ever relax because I'm always
trying to be conscious of who needs to be on the floor together for us to win
and for them to look good.  
  
The good things about this team -- I never have issues with them. I never have
school issues. I never have, you know, late-for-class issues, tardy for a
tutor issues.  
  
Some coaches may tell you across the sport that that isn't a good thing. You
need some of them that get in trouble every now and then so you can stay fired
up; but, no, it makes you want to stay in coaching longer when you don't have
off-the-court issues. They've just been a joy to coach and I would love
nothing more than to see those seniors lead this team to Dallas. But if it
doesn't happen, we will move on and prepare for the next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais is Asha Thomas, Kristine Anigwe and Courtney Range,
along with Coach Lindsay Gottlieb. Questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. Courtney, you have had the experience of playing here. How do you
explain to your teammates that have not had the experience about playing
against Baylor here?  
COURTNEY RANGE: To be honest, it's bigger than a Pac-12 tournament. You're
playing for a Championship. To keep it simple, just go out and do what we've
been doing all year and do it even better. The competition is going to get
harder. Come out and have fun and know that just like the Pac-12 Tournament
it's one and done. If we want to extend our season you gotta play how we all
know we can play and to continue to go far.  
  
Q. What do you think are the main challenges you will face against
Baylor?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: We're fully aware that they have size. They're athletic. They
have guard play. We're going to try to do our best to contain the post and
just put pressure on the guards. We've talked about it in film. We've talked
about it with each other, and I think we're very confident going into this
game.  
  
COURTNEY RANGE: Agreed.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Kristine, following up on that, you know what they're going to try to
do especially with Kalani Brown and the big girls inside. Talk about the
challenge that gives you and how much do you relish that opportunity? It's not
something you face every game anymore.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Pac-12 did a good job of preparing me. Oregon State has
really good post players. UCLA has really good post players, Washington. I'm
prepared. I've faced this before. We watched a lot of film again. I think
we're ready to go into this game. We had nothing to lose, everything to gain.
They're the No. 1 seed. They deserve that seed. We're going to do everything
we can to win.  
  
Q. What do you guys have to do better in this game to make it
competitive and pull out a win?  
ASHA THOMAS: I think we need to be sharper. I know we had a lot of turnovers.
Baylor is a great team. They're going to pressure us more, attack us even more
and try to limit us from our strengths. Definitely we need to be sharper, know
our options and continue what we need to do.  
  
Q. After a shooting game last night can you carry something over into
that?  
ASHA THOMAS: I don't want to stop. I don't want to stop. If they limit me from
my shooting I need to do other things, whether it is attacking the paint,
rebounding defensively. I have other things to do for my team.  
  
Q. Asha and Kristine, you guys both talked about how nervous you were
beginning of the game yesterday. So talk about how you're feeling now and do
you anticipate more nerves, less nerves as it comes to this game?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: More nerves, bigger game. We're in the second round. Not a
lot of teams can say that they have done that. This is my first time being in
the second round, because my first time being here. They have really good --
all the fans come out. All the people come out, their band. It's their house.
Their home court.  
  
We're just going to try to do everything we can to be calm and steady, so not
talk like -- be within ourselves, play within ourselves, know our strengths,
know what we are good at, not try to do too much. Just always be level-headed.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Again, I will be nervous. But my teammates will have my back and
I will have their back.  
  
COURTNEY RANGE: I want to say they don't play like they're nervous!  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I did.  
  
Q. I spoke to CJ West yesterday, and she said one of the things that you
guys did well was play possession-to-possession and not try to look ahead, get
too far ahead of yourselves and that you stay within the game. That's going to
be challenging with the crowd and everything else. Courtney, can you talk as a
senior how you intend to help mentally with the team playing in this game?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Starting off before the LSU game, the week of practice after
the Big 12 we were waiting to see what tournament we were in. We find out we
were in. We were playing LSU. That was our focus. LSU, then if we get to
Baylor we'll work on that. We played Saturday. We won that game. Now we're on
to the next one. No longer looking back. Now, we had a great film session
today. We feel prepared. We're going to go over it in practice and do what we
need to do.  
  
As far as what to say, I mean, to me I'm not the only voice. Everyone is
talking. We're at the time where everyone's voice is going to be heard.
Everyone usually has something good to say that's helpful for the team and
right now I believe that this team can too a lot of things. When we stay
composed and relax and not worry about, you know, what's next, what's next and
just taking care of each possession, I feel like we're going to go far. If we
do that, we're a team to beat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach Gottlieb?  
  
Q. Lindsay, you said last night you didn't have to watch much of Baylor
to know how good they were. Now that you've had a chance to absorb this team
and the team you're facing what are your thoughts?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I mean, they're really, really good. They're like a WNBA
team and I say that with a lot of respect for the WNBA. I watch WNBA. They
have pros on the floor. They're in sync with one another and they do a great
job. They're 30-3 in a tough league or whatever it is now, 31, not sure. They
don't have real weaknesses and they do a great job of playing to their
strengths. The inside game is unreal. They're bringing in the next big body
after the next big body and at the same time their guard play is good.  
  
Just digging into the film, obviously, they're as legit as I thought they
were. That being said, you can always -- that's what we do. We study film for
hours and hours and hours and you try to find things to take away, ways to
attack them and I've never been as excited to practice as I am today, because
why not? Why not take a shot at being able to make history or bring this team
in here and do something that's unexpected?  
  
They're supposed to win. They're supposed to go to the Final Four. They're a
legit National Championship contender, but we're going to come out here and
that's what the NCAA Tournament is about, try and play our best forty minutes.  
  
Q. One of the areas of concern is rebounding. They are huge and they
crash the boards. That's something your team has struggled with throughout the
season. Can you talk about that?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: They're plus-20 on the boards. They devastate people because
of the size and the aggressiveness. It's simple. We have to box out. We have
to limit them to one shot attempt, and are you going to do two hours of
rebounding drills in this practice today? No.  
  
But I think at this point you hope the players understand from the film and
can get it done. We will do some things positioning wise to put ourselves in a
position to succeed there, but you've gotta get that done. They're big. We
also have athleticism and we're capable of it, just need to make it a point of
emphasis.  
  
Q. Trying to put your best forty minutes on the court, and last night
you called it a survive-and-advance game, which it was for you guys. But what
do you tell your players that even when they're not playing their best they
were still able to pull it out and now you can kind of turn it up a notch?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, we talked yesterday before the game about using our
entire 30-something game body of work, our resume to our advantage. We have
been in a lot of situations. I think this team has shown a lot of resilience.
Maybe two months ago we don't win that game last night when LSU came back and
took a lead. I thought we did a good job of establishing ourselves early; but,
sure, we always feel we can be better and that's a good place to be.  
  
I do think we always feel like our best forty minutes of basketball is in
front of us. That's what we're going to try to do.  
  
Q. A lot of focus has been on the post players. But you said last night
they have really good guard play. Can you talk about that as well?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: You always look at what can you take away. If a team is so
devastating inside, maybe make 'em shoot from the outside. But then you have
Prince at 42%, and Wallace at 41% and Natalie off the bench at 43%, so it's
not like they have a glaring weakness. All my friends in the WNBA I've known
for months that Alexis Jones is a first-round pick if not a top-6 pick. So add
that to the mix. They're good all the way around. They really are, so they
have legit inside/outside.  
  
We have thoughts of what we have to do, but it's not like there is one glaring
weakness that you exploit, which is why they're a top-3 or whatever they are
team in the country. They have a lot of things they do well and not too many
things they do poorly. It's a legit challenge. They belong where they are and
we have to play really, really well. I think our players are excited to do
that.  
  
Like I said, this isn't business as usual for us. This is an opportunity, and
I think our players will take it with that kind of mentality.  
  
Q. When you were here three years ago you were coming off an unexpected
Final Four to some people. You said up here, we're trying to establish
something like what Baylor has got. Present time now, where do you think you
are in that? I know you guys weren't happy with missing the tournament last
year, but where do you think this foundation of this program is at?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: We want to be a top-10, top-20 team every year, so that then
you go to the Final Four and it's not a surprise. You have that kind of
culture and then you get the right pieces in the right places and then all of
the sudden you are a top-5, top-6.  
  
Kim and Bill have had this thing going for a while. We do think we're on that
track. This is a big step for this team this year to go 12-0 in nonconference
and to make the NCAA Tournament and then to win a game. We will have most of
our team coming back next year, so it's all part of a larger process.  
  
The goal is still to be one of those programs that's in the conversation when
you talk about UConn and Notre Dame and I think Baylor is at that level year-
in and year-out. I think the strength of the Pac-12 helps that, and we're
trying to capitalize on that. Stanford is in that realm, too. We want to be in
that realm. You have to beat some of those teams to do it and you have to
continually be on this stage and continue to advance further. Definitely
pleased with the success we have had, but hoping that the next five years are
even better. It would be nice to start that tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 119, Texas Southern - 30  
  
Q. Lauren, how much fun was that, because I don't know that you've shot
that many three-pointers all year.  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, that was a lot of fun, just because they were falling for me
and my teammates were getting the ball, and we were just really working
together and sharing the ball with each other.  
  
Q. Kalani, against a team that you have a serious size advantage
against, how important is it to take advantage of that?  
KALANI BROWN: It's very important to dominate the paint, especially when you
don't have a lot of height. I think that we did that, all of us did that.
Everybody came out ready and everybody came out and executed, and we were all
ready to play.  
  
Q. Beatrice, Lauren talked about the sharing of the ball. I just looked,
seven players had at least four assists. You two guys in particular shared it
a lot. Can you talk about the post-to-post passing?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just coming out there, and if somebody opened up they
should get the ball because they worked hard to get open, so just being able
to pass it to them and they had a good shot.  
  
Q. You guys set a record, largest margin of victory in an NCAA
Tournament game. Does that mean anything to you? Is it cool to have?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely it's an honor. We all worked hard. It was a team
effort. Everyone contributed. And I think we're excited about it. I'm excited
about it. I mean, not many teams do that.  
  
Q. Question regarding the pace of the game, so two-part question. The
pace of the game, how did you feel about the pace of the game, and how
important was it for the post players to be able to see each other, feed each
other, and just celebrate this victory today?  
LAUREN COX: I think that's one of the things we do really well is run the
floor, especially our posts. We are told to run free-throw line to free-throw
line, and when we get out there, that's what we're trying to do, and our
guards push it and get us the ball.  
  
Sorry what was the other question?  
  
Q. Passing.  
LAUREN COX: Oh, that's something we've been working on in practice. Every day
we go through a drill passing it to each other.  
  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just going out in practice every day, like just running
the floor and passing the post, like we do drills for it just to perfect it,
so just going out there and doing what we've been working on in practice.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Piggy-backing off what both of them said, it's something we've
been working on from day one. When you have shots like we have, it's got to be
dominant, and I think Coach Mulkey really focuses on that.  
  
As far as the pace of the game, the game plan was to rebound, and I thought we
did that very well today. Lauren got some transition buckets. We did
everything, executed today, basically.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey talks about staying focused, staying into the game. When
you all have situations like you had today where you get off to an early break
quick and the defense picks up and it all starts to roll over in waves, how do
you all keep focus in a situation like that and just steadily move forward and
not have a drop-off?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just going out and not looking at the scoreboard, and
thinking that the game is just 0-0 when you go out there.  
  
LAUREN COX: We just have to feed off each other. If one of us hits a shot,
even if we're up a lot, we just have to get excited and feed off each other's
energy.  
  
KALANI BROWN: And also leadership. Leadership has a tendency to keep us
focused in game situations. With them leading us, we're pretty much focused
the entire way.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday you were hoping your team came out and
played with the same fire and enthusiasm that Texas Southern was going to
have. Are you pleased with what you saw from your kids today?  
KIM MULKEY: Without a doubt. I thought the group that started the game was as
intense as they've been probably all year. I thought their intensity, I
thought their focus was just so much better than the last game, and then the
group that went in the game, all of them that went in the game, understood
you'll come out of the game if you don't get in passing lanes. You're going to
come out of the game if you allow people to go to the offensive boards, and I
just felt sitting here looking at some of these stats, we shot 78 percent in
the third quarter. I don't know if I've ever coached a team at Baylor that we
haven't been in quarters many years, but that's pretty remarkable.  
  
We did score a lot of points, but the thing I'm most proud of is how few
points we gave up, and I just thought that -- we had to foul on the three-
point shot, we fouled a couple jump shooters. You can't do that against teams
when it's a close game. But I just thought our defense was just so much
better, particularly help side.  
  
Q. Did you think going into the game that it would be this one-sided?  
KIM MULKEY: No. I don't ever think that. I know when I'm watching the film, I
have a tendency to think, okay, we can do certain things against a team that
we're getting ready to play, and I just thought that we did well with our
high-low stuff, and we've been emphasizing that a lot lately. I think the
misleading thing about this team is those three that were up here are pretty
big, and they're two sophomores and a freshman. They've got a lot of
basketball left in them. But guys, we're leading the country in three-point
field goal percentage. I don't even know that I knew that until it was said at
the press conference the other day. 40.6 percent from the three, so we've got
kids that can shoot it out there, and we don't shoot as much as others in the
country because if we do, I'm not a very good coach when you've got this kind
of size inside. But we've got a lot of balance.  
  
It was good to have Jones back today. I think she gave us valuable minutes,
and I wanted to get her off the floor, and I thought it really showed when she
had the ball in her hands how quickly she can get it down the floor.  
  
Q. Going back to your size for a second, I went back and looked at the
2012 team National Championship team. You had four players 6'2 " or bigger.
You've got six on this team.  
KIM MULKEY: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. Is this just the way the game is going, just that you guys have been
able to --  
KIM MULKEY: No, I don't. I think the game, if you look across the country, I
think it probably started with the Warriors. Everybody wants guards and
everybody wants to spread the floor. I was a guard. I know where my bread was
buttered. I got it to the big girls. Who in the country is going to turn down
size? So we run offensive things that are much different than a lot of people
who don't have our size.  
  
Now, does it make for a difficult match-up defensively? Sometimes it does. But
we've got to adjust. I'm not going to turn down 6'7", 6'4", 6'4". I'm just not
going to do that.  
  
Now, the 2012 team, you did have 6'2", 6'2", but then you had Brittney, so she
made up for a lot of that.  
  
Q. Talk about the contribution of your bench today. They got a lot of
minutes because of the situation. Were you happy, ecstatic, or just --  
KIM MULKEY: Well, our bench has been giving us that all year. I've said it
many times, I don't know that I really have a bench. I can only play five at a
time. I just thought that the work we've put in since the conference
championship -- tournament championship game, I think you saw it today. I
think you saw post players feeding each other better than they have all year.
I think you saw production from people immediately when they came in the game.
It's just been an emphasis to continue to work on your defense. Your offense
is fine, continue to work on your defense, and I think our help side defense
gets better and better, dribble penetration is always a concern because it's
just hard to guard anybody one-on-one in the game anymore, so you've got to
have that second and third defender, and we've got kids that can block shots.
I want them taking more charges. I just want them to play better team defense.  
  
Q. I was fortunate to be able to see both reactions at the selection on
Monday and was really pleased to see the focus for both teams. I mean, it
wasn't the big hooray, yeah, we're in. It's like, now we know who we're going
to play, let's go. Business as usual. Talk about that; was it the right vibe
that I was getting seeing both the reactions?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I wasn't in there, honestly. I had gone to my office and was
checking in on my son's baseball, and by the time I got back in there, they'd
already shot us on the TV. I saw the paper the next day and saw the reaction
of the seniors on the front row there, and they're happy. They're beautiful
girls, and yet at the same time those seniors are missing a Final Four, and
they want to get to a Final Four.  
  
Those seniors have sacrificed a lot. You've got Prince, who is -- I don't even
know how many surgeries she's been through. You've got Jones with the knee
who's back, you've got KK and Nina, whose roles have changed since they got
here, but are such team players and great kids that they just want to get to a
Final Four.  
  
So yes, they were excited. We never take it for granted. Fortunately or
unfortunately, however you want to view it, I guess people think it's not good
if you're just an Elite 8 team. But I know there are lots of schools in the
country that would trade places with us.  
  
But we set the bar here. In 2005, I said then, I'm not sure we can feed this
monster. Well, we're feeding it. Sometimes the stomach is not full and
sometimes it is. We're going to fight and claw until the very end, and let's
hope the bitter end is in Dallas, but if it's not, I know this, if it's not,
the team that beats us just had played better, and that's what I said about
West Virginia. They just played better. We never gave up. We fought hard.
Let's see what happens.  
  
Q. Just talk more about Alexis being able to be back on the floor today.
Were you happy with what you saw out of her output and everything?  
KIM MULKEY: Absolutely. Got her off the floor. She got 12, 15 minutes, I don't
remember, but that's enough. Heck, that's about all any of them got today.  
  
But I thought her -- with the ball in her hands from one end to the other, she
got down the floor quickly. Alexis has tremendous vision and can make passes a
lot of girls can't make, and her shot, I don't know that she took very many.
Let's see. How many did she take? Five? Two for five? That's fine. Alexis
Jones, really I didn't look at her and go, oh, wow, we're going to struggle
with her out there, or oh, she's not healthy. I felt good with her out there.
She picked up two quick fouls, which took her out of some minutes there early,
but she looked good to me.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 119, Texas Southern - 30  
  
Q. Joyce, as difficult as this outcome is, what do you guys take out of
this that you can move forward with and the experience of this game to move
forward?  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Well, there's really nothing that we can take out of it. We
did the best we could, which was to hold them accountable to their mistakes,
which we capitalized on towards the end. But I think we should have did
better.  
  
Q. Again, it was tough, but y'all played tough. What were you saying to
each other on the court? How were you keeping your spirits up throughout the
game?  
CHYNNA EWING: Well, we were just trying to keep each other uplifted even
thought we were down and just do the things that we normally do and talk to
each other and talk each other through it.  
  
Q. Obviously you're very emotional. Can you tell us what you're feeling
right now?  
CHYNNA EWING: Well, I feel like we were blessed to have this opportunity, but
I do wish we would have played better against them, and I think that we should
have -- like at the end we played very well, like defensively, and I feel like
we should have did that at the very beginning, and like the game would have
probably came out better.  
  
Q. Breasia, did you feel like the game, the pace of the game, was faster
than you would have expected?  
BREASIA McELRATH: A little faster, but no, I didn't think it was faster than
was to be expected. We've played with fast-paced teams before. It was just
they outscored us. Yeah, that's it. They outscored us.  
  
But we'll be ready next year. It won't be the last time you see Texas
Southern. We took this experience, and we're going to capitalize on it and get
better from it. That's basically it.  
  
Q. This team is young. This was an experience, a learning experience for
everybody involved. What will you all take back, not just playing the game but
all of it, the tournament itself, having your name called and being a part of
your group, being a first?  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Well, since the team is young, basically the key is growth.
We have a lot more learning to do, and this is just the beginning.  
  
CHYNNA EWING: And I feel like since we are young, we're going to learn stuff,
and as we get older, we're going to finally figure it out and figure out what
we need to do as a team in order to take the next step and to keep going and
to just build as a team.  
  
BREASIA McELRATH: For me it was tempo. I liked the passion of the game. I took
the experience on, playing at a high level, and I'm going to do that every
time. I'm going to give my all every time because this is where I want to be
next year, and you will see us next year.  
  
Q. We talked the other day about experience and teaching moments and
learning from your experiences. Just talk about today, not just coming up to
this point but just talk about this game today.  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: This game today was extremely competitive on the end of
Baylor. I want to take my hat off to them.  
  
I told our young ladies in the locker room a moment ago that you've probably
played a Final Four team for sure. Great in size, shoot the ball well, shot
the ball extremely well today. Some of that was us, but a lot of it was them
hitting shots early. They did.  
  
These young ladies have worked hard. They've worked really hard for me and for
our university, and today was about them growing -- they say growing,
experience, building, and we'll keep using those terms as we go in to
postseason play. We're kicking their butt. Remember, you want to grow, you
want to build, you want to get the experience so you can be back here and get
another taste of it in the future. Breasia said it with confidence twice:
We'll be back. And she showed me something different in her eyes with her
vocabulary, with her leadership on the court, whether things are going good or
bad, indifferent with her teammates, she's found a way to keep us in it, keep
us locked in, engaged, from the athlete side. So that was important for us.
That's important for us to have that. So I think that they took some steps
forward. Even in a loss like this, they took some steps forward as a team
today.  
  
Q. You talked the other day about being overwhelmed. It's hard not to
be. Was there a little bit of that, maybe particularly early in the game, of
being overwhelmed by maybe the size or whatever it was?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I'm sure they were. You know, they don't say certain
things, but I could see it in their eyes earlier on, but as the game went,
they realized, okay, I can get deflections here and there, and late in the
game, I saw that. I may have been when the second-string team came in, but I
saw them make some plays here and there defensively. I think the tempo is
different. I disagree with Breasia a little bit. The pace of the game is
definitely faster. In her mind maybe it's not, but it's definitely faster. So
you have to learn how to control tempo, control pace, and I had a hard time
trying to get control it from where I'm standing. I think that's something
we'll take back, being overwhelmed and learning how to stay composed, having
better composure to get attempts and looks and not have the ball come back so
fast in transition or a dunk inside so easy. So definitely a little bit of
them being overwhelmed, but eventually they settled down, and they will move
forward knowing what to expect, the expectation for being in the dance.  
  
Q. As the game was flowing and kind of getting away, what was your
thought process? What was your goal? Was it let's keep it under 100? Let's
keep it -- let's try and close the gap to this? What were you telling the
ladies?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I wanted them to actually take away something
defensively. Whether we scored or not defensively, I wanted us to be better.
Clearly we weren't, but down the stretch I saw us get a few deflections here
and there, which felt like they could do earlier on with some things that they
worked on. If someone is going to beat you, you can't let them beat you the
same way. It was just dumb down, dumb down, dumb down. Like eventually, press
up against her, push her out of bounds, do something. Don't hurt her, but be
more physical, be more aggressive. Use your weight room. So that was some of
the things I talked to them about.  
  
I know Nycolle Smith picked up a foul, and people probably wonder why am I
cheering. I'm cheering because she was trying to do what I asked her to do, to
be a little more physical. If you're a little more physical, maybe it'll wear
her down a little bit more. But as you know, Baylor has about six bigs. They
just run them in and out, so they're all pretty fresh, and they finish well
around the rim and they do their job. But that was my biggest thing. Just
sticking to the game plan and trying to take something away. If you can take
something away, what will it be? Let's take away this pass. Have they beat us
off the dribble from the high post yet? Nope. And I think hit one shot from
the high post late in the game, but they keep dumping inside, so either take
the pass away, or back up and help inside, things of that nature. And again,
we're undersized, so we're playing without Shamiya Brooks, who's been here
twice before today, but all in fairness, Kelena Morris probably played the
most minutes she's played this season today. She averaged maybe 2.1 minutes a
game, if that, Big Mo, and she had to play at least double-digit minutes
today.  
  
So overwhelmed? For a freshman who hasn't been in this situation before, and
the ball is being dunked over and over again? Yeah, a little bit. So they had
to adjust to her, too. Like even with our offensive sets with her being out
there. But again, it was a great time for her to have that because our future
is wrapped around her, so that was important.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Asha Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33253)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Cal - 55, LSU - 52  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: At the risk of sounding cliché, I felt like that was a
survive-and-advance moment for 40 minutes, and we are thrilled to have the
opportunity to play on Monday. It wasn't the prettiest, but I credit LSU for
that. That's what they do. They turn you over. We turned it over 20 times.
That's what they force teams into on average. It's why they were in this
tournament. It's why they won 20 games this year, so credit them.  
  
And while I don't think we were a masterpiece on offense, I could not be more
proud of our players' grittiness and toughness to pull it out when it wasn't
the easiest.  
  
These two young women sitting here, our sophomores, played a ton of minutes
their freshman year and were sitting home at this time, and all they've wanted
is to get this team into postseason and to advance, and for Kristine to have
the second half that she had after not having things be easy in the first half
shows her growth and shows why she's an All-American, and Asha just simply
came out and played 40 minutes, turned the ball over once and knocked down six
threes. Really proud of our team, excited to be playing on Monday, a lot of
credit to LSU, and I had contractions. That's how close the game was. Fun
night all around.  
  
Q. Asha, can you describe how you got open on that three that you hit in
the corner there late, and just how good did that feel going in?  
ASHA THOMAS: They were denying the ball -- Kristine had the ball. They were
pressuring her. They were denying Kayla, and they left me open, and I caught
the ball, knocked it down. I knew I could knock it down like I have before.
That was it.  
  
Q. Asha, just talk about, that's almost a perfect game, when the point
guard only has one turnover and scores as much as you did. Were you in the
athletic zone today?  
ASHA THOMAS: Let's just say I was nervous. This was my first time being in the
NCAA Tournament. I was nervous. You probably couldn't tell because I hide my
emotions. But I just embraced the moment. You know, you never know when you'll
get this chance again, take advantage of it. But like you said, the turnovers,
I hate turning the ball over. Point guard, you don't want to turn over the
ball, and when I just let my nervousness out, just played my game.  
  
Q. Kristine, what did they do that made it so tough for you in the first
half, and how did you pull it together to have that second half, but
particularly playing with four fouls at the end, how did you manage to hit
those free throws, make that big block? How did that happen?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, they had a really good game plan, and I give them a lot
of credit because they're super physical. I just tried to get used to it, so
you're just coming from playing like in a different conference; you have
different refs, different players. Never seen them play before; we never went
against them. Again, I was really nervous. I was like shaking before the game.
I just tried to do whatever I could to win, and I didn't want to go home, and
our whole team didn't want to go home. We just played with that mentality.  
  
Q. Asha, you talked about embracing the moment; is that kind of what was
also going through your head there at the end where there was that scramble
for the ball and you guys got the jump ball?  
ASHA THOMAS: Definitely. I know we had like a time-out left, but I just wanted
to get the ball, really just to get the ball, make sure we secured it, and
that's what happened.  
  
Q. Kristine, you had the block at the end, but it seemed like every time
LSU tried to do something you came up big. You made all seven of your free
throws, which ultimately ended up being huge. Talk about that and playing in
the moment.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, the first half, again, was a struggle for me, and I
wanted to win. I wanted to come here and win, and that's what we did. So the
second half I just tried to focus on other things, rebounding, blocking shots,
playing defense, being there for my team, bringing energy. So I just came with
this whole different mentality. I just wanted to win so bad, so I just tried
to do everything I could. I knew it was going to be tough scoring so I tried
to play really like in defense and talk to my teammates. Asha was hitting all
her shots, like again, you said she had about like a perfect game, and she
works on that shot. We all trust her to make that, so she came up really big
for us this game.  
  
Q. You were talking about being nervous at the beginning of the game,
but at the end you've had a lot of close games this year, and many didn't go
your way. How did that feel at the end and to come out with a win like that?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, again, we're used to -- like you said, we're used to
being in close games. I think we've done a good job closing out, like once the
season -- we're comfortable with each other and we know how to overcome
adversity, like close games, two-point games, three-point games, calling time-
outs, when to foul, who to foul, trying to get us in the perfect situation to
win. So again, we're used to making those big shots at the end, big shots, big
free throws, big defensive stops, so yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, when is the baby due, and will you have some stories to tell
later? You've had some dramatic finishes.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Seriously. The baby is due May 9th. That's what like science
says, but I'm like, whoo, more things like this, he could come any day.  
  
Lots of stories to tell. I mean, this has been such a special season because
of the link between my family stuff and my basketball family. I mean, Teasy
(ph) walked by and touches my belly. I think any time you go through pregnancy
for the first time, it's imagine it's like miraculous and really wonderful,
but to do it with a team, I feel so grateful for that.  
  
Patrick is in the stands over there. He always says when we're on the road,
like, he calls the baby "Point Guard." He says, How are you and Point Guard
doing? What did the girls say to Point Guard today? Just the whole thing is
around this. So it's just extra super special.  
  
Q. You heard what Kristine said about her second half. Talk about that;
she had some big moments in that second half for you guys with the free throws
and the block.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah. I mean, I can't really put it into words how proud of
her I am. Most people would look and say, 15-7 and five blocks in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a good game. We all know for Kristine, it wasn't her best
game all around. But we're with these young people in the locker room every
single day. I know what they struggle with. I know what their fears are. I
know what their strengths are, and to be able to look at her at halftime and
say, we're going into the locker room with the lead and just shake it off and
give us what you can give us. Give me everything in the second half, and to
see her do it was remarkable. On that last play with eight seconds left, I
looked at McKayla Cowling and said, the ball goes into Kristine's hands
because I knew she would get open and I knew she would make the free throws,
and I wouldn't have been able to say that if she was not mentally locked in
because it wasn't the easiest game for her.  
  
She had an incredible freshman and sophomore year, but the growth this year,
being able to handle pressures and adversity and all kinds of defenses, it's
been really something, and I'm looking forward to continuing that. But those
are the moments coaches love, when you just see kids rise to a different
level. Maybe fans and media don't know what they're going through, but I just
think she had a really big-time second half, and that was -- we needed every
minute of it.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Asha's game, her first tournament game, and
all season long and what she provided for you.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Unbelievable. I said to the team in the locker room there,
as a coach you figure out how to say what you need to say to each player. I'm
the most unfiltered with Asha Thomas. I can look at her and say, make a darned
shot, or stop turning it over. There's no filter because she can just -- she's
steady. She can handle anything.  
  
She shot the heck out of the ball in practice yesterday, and I was just kind
of going to the assistants, like Teasy, she's not missing, and so when the
first one went down today, I felt really good about that.  
  
But just similar, we threw her into the fire last year and she faced a lot of
pressure and she made a lot of shots early in the season and not as many late,
and to see her growth and come through in a big-time game, knock down shots,
it's not like she was wide open, it's not like these weren't under duress. I
mean, we got her off some flare screens. She had a quick release on a lot of
them. You don't always see the reverse. Kristine to AT for three, it's usually
AT to Kristine. But really, really big time. You can't win in the postseason
without good guard play, and today she stepped up and knocked down shots and
also didn't turn the ball over. It was pretty impressive.  
  
Q. The conference has changed. You all have done a lot of growth in the
last three to five years, but over the last two, there's no bottom feeders in
the conference anymore. Every game is competitive. What changed?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Well, first of all, I mean, pretty unreal that the PAC-12 is
7-0 in this first round. I'm really proud of all of our teams, and you said it
exactly right. What has changed is that I think schools across the conference
have made a commitment to women's basketball. I think coaches have gone out
and gotten the best players on the West Coast, more so to stay home, and
there's a lot of good players. I think people have gone and recruited great
players from other regions, as well, and people have hired great coaches, and
the players have embraced representing the west and making the PAC-12 great. I
think there's been smart scheduling, but smart scheduling can't do it alone.
You then have to then win those games. But I said it all week with all the
questions we got, there's no bad team in the conference. There's opportunities
for good wins all the time. We had a bunch of losses, but nine of them were to
the RPI top 35 and better. I mean, that's a luxury to be able to play those
teams all the time and face every kind of defense.  
  
I'm really happy to be part of the PAC-12. You know, who knows if a team will
go to the Final Four this year or two, they could, but if not, the depth and
strength, our teams 5 through 12 in our league, had 12 wins against the RPI
top 25 this year, and that's not even talking about the four really, really
super elite teams in the league.  
  
It's been a great to be part of it. There's a lot more losses in my world than
there were a couple years ago, but when we came here four years ago as a 7
seed, we were second in the PAC-12 at 13-5 and nobody else in the league got
in besides us and Stanford, and now we finished seventh in the league, so it's
a really good league, and we certainly wanted to be better, and we hope to get
back to the very top, but we also know we can be seventh in the league, come
in and win tournament games, and I think that speaks to the strength of the
PAC-12 top to bottom.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about playing Baylor next.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Oh, yeah, that. How many points did they have up tonight? I
went back to the locker room. 119? Was it a record? Yeah. So I didn't need to
watch that game to know that they're really good. They're really good. I'm
sitting up there looking at Odyssey and Griner, and we played when I was an
assistant at Cal we played Baylor with Sophia Young, who was -- not even
talking about now, but she was one of their first great All-Americans on the
National Championship team, and this year's team in a lot of ways might be the
most complete. They're huge, and they've got really good guard play to go with
the size. They're a No. 1 seed for a reason. They're a National Championship
contender for a reason, but there will not be a team more excited to play on
Monday night than us.  
  
I've said it the whole time, you can be excited to be here and still have a
focus and try and want to win the game, so we'll give them a game plan. We'll
watch a lot of film between now and then, the coaches, we'll get the players
locked in, and we see it as a great opportunity, but they're a heck of a team.
They have 31 wins now, I think, which is no fluke. They play an incredibly
tough schedule, and we'll have to give it our best shot on Monday night, but I
don't doubt the women in our locker room love a challenge, and that's what
it's going to be.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Alexis Hyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30323)

### [Raigyne Moncrief](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28352)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Cal - 55, LSU - 52  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: These two young ladies sitting up here, I can't express enough
how important they are to the success of the LSU program. Obviously we're
going to have Raigyne Moncrief next year, but Alexis Hyder is one of the
toughest, undersized, versatile post players in the game, and I'm proud to be
her coach, along with the exceptional player in Rina Hill, our other senior,
who is one of the hardest working players I've ever coached and been around.
Jasmine Rhodes, who's our other senior, who will be missed, with her
versatility to play the 4. We're an undersized team but a team with a big
heart, and I can't say enough about giving Cal the credit. They did what they
needed to do. I thought Thomas had an unbelievable night from the three-point
line, and we missed some of our defensive coverages, but the fight that we had
in us to really get them turned over 20 plus times, our ability to make stops
against a team that was taller than us, I commend our team for having the
heart and the fight.  
  
It's been a journey for us. A lot of ups and downs, but this group has been
pretty special. For us to turn the program around where we were last year and
to see them a year later, that's improvement, and we're going to build off of
that.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you just describe what you saw on that last play?  
ALEXIS HYDER: Which last play?  
  
Q. The lay-up that got blocked.  
ALEXIS HYDER: I saw the lane, and I wanted to make contact, which I thought I
did. It just didn't go our way. I wanted to get her in the air, and I thought
it was a good drive. There's things I thought I could have done differently,
but I was just trying to take the best shot for the team.  
  
Q. Alexis, how were you so effective against Kristine Anigwe?  
ALEXIS HYDER: I understand that I'm undersized, and I take advantage of that.
I understand that many 6'5" people do not want to guard around the perimeter.
They don't want to guard pick-and-pops, they don't want to guard off the
dribble, so taking advantage of that opened up the court, and that's why Ayana
Mitchell was great down the stretch and that's why Chloe and Rai were easily
getting to the lane, because we opened up the floor.  
  
Q. Raigyne, you and Chloe both kind of started off a little slow, and
then you stepped up. Kind of talk about that difference in the second half.  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: We got a lot of talk from the coaches and motivation from
our teammates, and they were just saying that we've been doing this all year,
and just play our game and relax, and I think we just came up there, we
started the game kind of really off, and we just started knocking down shots
and making plays, especially Chloe Jackson.  
  
Q. Was it something Cal was doing to start the game that threw you guys
off, or was it something for yourselves that threw you off?  
ALEXIS HYDER: I mean, like Coach said, they were a good team and came out
playing hard, but I think we could have came out better offensively, and our
shots weren't falling. They were just hot. Our shots weren't falling, their
shots were falling, and things didn't go our way. I don't think that it was
anything specific. We were getting the looks we've been getting all year, and
it just didn't go our way. The same screens we've been setting all year, we
got them, the same flares, we got all the screens and everything we wanted to
get the looks, we just couldn't knock them down early.  
  
Q. Coach, which home game and which road game that you saw that you all
won or lost that you saw coming down the stretch the team was growing and they
were headed in the right direction?  
NIKKI FARGAS: In our last game against Mississippi State in the SEC
tournament, I thought our team battled a very good basketball team, obviously
someone who's a No. 2 seed, potentially could have been a No. 1 seed, and I
thought we played extremely hard for about 36 minutes. The first time that we
played Mississippi State in January, they beat us pretty good, and to see the
improvement that we made in that short period of time, I felt really good
about our chances going into NCAA Tournament play.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of talked about those turnovers, and I know that was
the game plan going into this, to kind of negate their size advantage. Is
tonight what you had in mind there?  
NIKKI FARGAS: From a turnover standpoint, it definitely played to our favor to
turn them over 20 plus times. We didn't always convert like we had been in the
past off of those turnovers. I thought our offensive board play allowed us to
get some second and third looks, but again, late game, down the stretch, we've
got to make plays, and we can't -- things that we're going to get nailed out.
Every place that we missed, an and-one opportunity, we've got to go try to
score the ball, and I think this group is very well aware that they've got to
make their own breaks, and I think those are life lessons for them, that
you're going to have to make them in life, as well, when you leave here. It's
a 40-minute game, and the beginning of the game, I know you mentioned that, I
thought we missed our defensive coverage. Again, I'm going to highlight Thomas
for Cal. I thought she was huge in the play action.  
  
We had a lot of good looks. Moncrief -- if you would have told me Moncrief and
Jackson were going to go 0 for 13 in the first half, they hadn't done that all
season, and so that's just part of it, and the fight that they had, though, in
the second half, I'm really proud of this group.  
  
Q. What particular adjustments did you make at halftime going into the
second half?  
NIKKI FARGAS: We tried to extend our defense a little bit more, tried to
disrupt them in the backcourt, thought our pressure took some time off the
clock and delayed and disrupted them. I thought from a half-court defensive
standpoint, we really tried to apply more ball pressure and tried to disrupt
the ball handler so the ball couldn't see inside. We knew their size was going
to be an issue, so it's something that we've had to battle all year. But
moving forward, we've got size coming in, so hopefully we can still play that
sustained, aggressive style of play but have the size to combat the inside
play of some of the teams that we faced that were bigger than we were.  
  
Q. In that same vein, talking about next year, what is the next step for
this team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: You know, it's tough right now because you've got three seniors
that mean the world to me personally. I can't say enough about those three,
having had to just endure last year having six players and those three being
the three returning. You just want to keep playing basketball for them.  
  
But next year, the future of the LSU program is very good. We've got a great
class coming in. We return some experience. We also signed a young lady with
size, Raven Farley. We missed Faustine Aifuwa, our 6'5" kid. I think she
really would have made a difference had she not been out this season with a
knee injury. We'll get her back. So along with some really good guards, we are
going to still be athletic and quick on the perimeter, but we're going to be
bigger.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

### [Nina Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26576)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Alexis, how are you feeling, and how much are you looking forward to
getting back on the court?  
ALEXIS JONES: I'm feeling a lot better, and I'm excited to get back out there
on the court. It's me, Nina, it's KK and Prince's last go-around, and I'm just
happy and blessed that I'm able to come back and play again.  
  
Q. Alexis, what have you seen from Joyce Kennerson, and what's key to
slowing her down?  
ALEXIS JONES: The key is stopping her in transition, staying in front of her,
not letting her blow past us, and not get easy lay-ups to the rim.  
  
Q. Nina, every year you've gotten to play home games in the NCAA
Tournament. I know this never gets old for you guys, but talk about how
different it is for you this year.  
NINA DAVIS: I don't know if it's really different. I guess the only difference
is just knowing in the back of my mind that it's the last go-around. It's my
last two games in the Ferrell Center to play in front of these fans that have
been amazing the four years I've been here, so we just want to go out here and
play hard and get these two wins in front of them because we owe a lot of
credit to them. They travel all across the country, and they support us
whatever we do.  
  
Q. Alexis, obviously she says she feels good. Just talk about the
confidence you have that everything is good with her, and how your team has
responded without her in this last month or so.  
KIM MULKEY: We only lost one game without her, and I'm not sure if she was
playing we would have won that game anyway. West Virginia was just that good
that weekend. Alexis's knees have always been a problem for her. I haven't
noticed in the days that she's practiced since being cleared that she's any
different than she was before other than maybe a few more turnovers in
practice where she's hanging on the ball too long trying to make a spectacular
pass. But conditioning-wise, I think she's about the same. Shooting, she
looked to shoot the ball really good. I'm just happy she's back. I'm happy for
her personally, and she makes us even better.  
  
Q. What do you see on the defensive end with Texas Southern? I believe
they're top 30 in field goal percentage defense.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we're pretty good with our defense, as well. I don't know
where we are today. We've led the country a long time in field goal percentage
defense. Everybody is good when you reach the NCAA Tournament, and is this
their first trip, I think, so they're extremely excited. I would be. I
remember our first trip, and I anticipate it'll be a game where we will be
much bigger. We're much bigger than a lot of teams. But that also can create
problems because I'm sure they'll spread the floor on us, and our post will
have to guard smaller players. They like to run. Kennerson and I think it's
Palmer shoot a lot of threes. We see that a lot in our league, so we'll be
prepared. I hope we're as excited as they are because it doesn't get old.
We're very blessed at Baylor that women's basketball is a priority.  
  
Q. How much do you think Alexis is going to play? Will it be back to the
normal amount that she would have played before?  
KIM MULKEY: I would think so.  
  
Q. Will you work her in a little bit?  
KIM MULKEY: The game will dictate that. I would expect her to be good to go.
I'm not sure I'll start her, but she's good to go. There is no limits on how
many minutes. I think that will just be the flow of the game. She'll play both
point guard and 2, which helps Kristy, relieve Kristy some when she gets
tired. But she's good to go.  
  
Q. Playing at home, your first two games have kind of become a routine
around here, but I know it's something you guys don't ever take for granted,
but talk about how your teaming approaches that and how they've taken care of
business, and it sounds like you don't have to tell them anything different
about, hey, this is something more than just a regular game.  
KIM MULKEY: You don't have to tell them that. I'm assuming they understand
that it is a privilege to be selected to host the first and second round, but
that privilege came from what you did all year. They don't just give it to
you. I think it's also a blessing that Nina said it: We're in a part of the
country where women's basketball is valued, and people on fixed incomes,
people who have money, they make sure that they support these players, and it
does matter in women's basketball. Just I've always said, it does us no good
to put these things in arenas where TV shows no one in the stands, and I was
all for going back to first and second round games on the home courts.  
  
We're just really blessed that our fans support us, and we've been able to
continue recruiting good players to come here.  
  
Q. I know Kristy Wallace is your energizer bunny; she played a ton of
minutes in the Big 12 tournament. How much does it help she won't have to do
that going forward in the NCAA Tournament necessarily?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't think that it helps Kristy. Kristy could play all day. She
just has the body composition and makeup to where she never tires, and usually
the first place you see it in a guard if they get fatigued is the legs, their
shots start falling short. She's been on a roll hitting mid-range jumpers. It
doesn't probably affect her. Maybe me a little bit. It may be that you think
she needs a rest, but she really doesn't. She could play 40 minutes every
night.  
  
Q. Kim, obviously it's the first time in a long time you guys are going
to the NCAA Tournament coming off a loss. What did you want to see in your
team and how they respond?  
KIM MULKEY: I want to see them start out faster than they did against West
Virginia with a little more -- I've always believed that your teams take on
the personality of the coach, and to put it simple, I'm fiery. I'm passionate.
I pump my fist, and I want them to do that coming out of the gates, and I
didn't think we did that in the last game until the fourth quarter.  
  
Well, we've got to do it in the first quarter, so that's what I'd like to see
is them put four quarters together, and they've done that for the most part. I
mean, my gosh, we're 30-3. Look who we've lost to. But it would be fun to
watch them try to do every game these four, six, whatever we get to play, and
see how good we really are.  
  
Q. You're obviously no stranger to LSU; what's it like to kind of get to
host that program this week.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's interesting because Kramer playing there, I just left
there last weekend, and I saw Nikki Fargas in the head coaches' meeting, and I
was looking for my son, and I said, y'all didn't bring him?  
  
Growing up 30 minutes from LSU, I visited there as a player and then chose to
go to Louisiana Tech, which was four and a half hours north. All I ever knew
was LSU and Tulane. But I chose for basketball reasons at the time in the
early '80s, Louisiana Tech was the powerhouse, and yet who would have thought
many, many years later my child would be going to LSU seven hours away. But
it's been a blessing for him.  
  
I'm always going to be a Louisiana girl. I've told people that from day one,
and I don't care where I am, I'm Louisiana, and I always want to see Louisiana
schools do good.  
  
And because Kramer is there now, you have more of an interest because of being
around the school more watching him play and being in the stands than I did
when I was a player because I never went to Baton Rouge, I was always in north
Louisiana. I want to see him do good. If we meet Monday, I don't want to see
them do good.

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Johnetta Hayes-Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33158)

### [Nycolle Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33159)

### [Joyce Kennerson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33160)

### [Chynna Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33161)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Nycolle, obviously excitement about getting Texas Southern to an NCAA
Tournament, but talk about that and then having to come here and play Baylor
when you're looking around at everything going on around here.  
NYCOLLE SMITH: First off, I just want to say this is a great opportunity for
all of us. I think this is a place where we all strive to be. We've all wanted
to be here. I know I wanted to be here my entire life, and just coming to
Baylor, like I said, it's just a blessing. I'm taking it all in, embracing it
all, and just want to have fun.  
  
CHYNNA EWING: Like she said, it's a blessing, and I just feel like this is a
reward for the whole season, and to actually be here is a very good
opportunity for us, and I just feel like we've got to keep on working and more
will come.  
  
JOYCE KENNERSON: Like my teammate said, this is a very good opportunity for us
to showcase our talent against a great team.  
  
Q. Nycolle, do you have to put blinders on when it comes time because
clearly we're in this room and you see everything that Baylor has done and you
know their history, that they routinely play games here in the NCAA
Tournament, something that's not new to them while it's new to you guys.  
NYCOLLE SMITH: I believe whenever you step into -- we're obviously a team that
hasn't made it to the NCAA, and it is our first time. I believe we just have
to take it as if it's another team. The only thing that's different is just
the name. We come in and we know personnel, and we're going to come out and
we're going to execute to our best abilities.  
  
Q. Obviously the girls are excited to be here, and this is kind of a
culmination of what you guys have tried to do this season. Talk about how
they're handling it and this opportunity for them, and it seems like they've
obviously got the right mindset coming into it.  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: These ladies have been very fortunate this year. Our
team has, our university, to have this opportunity. I think they're taking it
in stride. I received many phone calls about their temperament, how they're
doing. It's like another game for them, and they're saying it, but they truly
mean it, this team plays fearless. Small, not big in numbers, but fearless all
the time, whether they're down or up, no matter who we're playing.  
  
So I'm excited for our university. I'm excited for our young ladies. I think
this is definitely another stepping stone for our team. They've made history.
They've done some great things this year.  
  
And the question that you asked was how do you feel walking in here and see
all this to the young ladies. You know, it can be overwhelming. I'm not sure
if they will say that, but it can be overwhelming. It's overwhelming, and it's
a great honor for them to be here, to have the opportunity to play a Baylor
team. We had a few teams in our conference play them this year, as well, but
to be here in the moment now is what we are looking forward for, getting on
the court tomorrow.  
  
Q. What challenges do these Baylor bigs present defensively?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: You know, Baylor is a very sound team. We know
offensively they're the second leading team in the country scoring-wise, but
defensively they're big. They have great size. They're long on the wings.
They're aggressive on the ball. They're big inside with Brown and a few
others. So we're definitely going to have to try to stretch the floor out a
little bit, play a little wider than we usually play, but at this point we are
who we are. We can't go in and like recreate the wheel at this point.  
  
We're just going to go in and play hard and stick to our game plan. I've told
them all year, no matter who they're playing, whatever game plan we put
together, you go with that game plan and you do everything you can; whatever
adjustment we made to make, we'll make. I don't care who it is in conference
we're playing, but they do, they respect all their opponents, they always
have, whether it's any team, up to this team that we're playing now. I think
they will definitely respect the fact that they're here and they're playing
against them.  
  
You never overlook anybody on either side of the ball, but defensively we're
going to definitely see a team that's going to rebound the ball defensively,
push it quick at us offensively, but we're going to have to be able to make
shots and not drive to the hole as much as we usually would, share the ball a
little bit more, have more assists in this game to have an opportunity against
that Baylor defense.  
  
Q. You mentioned clearly this team making some history for the school by
getting to this point. What is it about this team you think that's --
obviously you won the SWAC tournament to get the bid, but what is it about
this team you think that's made it special for you?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: This team is family. That's the biggest thing. I wanted
these young ladies to get here because they are a young group. We have one
senior. We were led by one senior who wasn't on this stage today, she's about
6'4", Shamiya Brooks. She's been to this dance now for the third time. She did
it twice with Prairie View A&M University and now she's here to do it with
Texas Southern University. So they're young. We're led by a sophomore point
guard who averages 20 points a game. Chynna Ewing is a freshman sitting here,
so hopefully four years from now she can look back and say, my freshman year
this is what we did. I didn't have a lot of words up here. And then year two,
year three, year four, look where I am now.  
  
It is a great family environment. It is extremely big for our university
because they are young and impressionable, and they're, again, taking it all
in. But I wanted these young ladies to have this moment because they are the
most family-knit team I've had in four years of being at Texas Southern
University.  
  
Q. What's it like going from the SWAC where you're one of the biggest
teams in the conference to now having players kind of tower over you like
you're going to see tomorrow?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I don't know yet. But whatever the challenges are, we'll
definitely make adjustments quickly if we have to. I don't think they see what
I see. They see another team. I see 6'6". I see 6'5". And as a player, I've
played against it, but I also stand 6'4". For my 5'2" \-- well, she's really
5'5", I'll give her 5'5" point guard, I don't think that she's going to make
an adjustment early. I think she's just going to play her game the way she
knows how and then see what happens.  
  
I don't ever want them to change what they're doing. I think they should
challenge everyone they play, challenge them. You never know, you may get to
the free-throw line. That's what we're hoping. We're hoping that we put
ourselves in position to slow the ball down, make some free throws here and
there.  
  
But I'm excited for them to see teams that are bigger than them so they can
know the flow of a game, what adjustments need to be made offensively to get
the opportunities we need to be on the board, to score big buckets here and
there and to make plays. I think it's a game of plays, and a team of 64,
that's what it's about, so we're excited. I'm excited for them to see it
finally and to coach it.  
  
Q. You mentioned the young team, and this being a young team, and you
obviously have a lot of them back next year. What is it you want them to get
out of this experience that will kind of set a foundation to keep moving
forward and keep moving the bar up for Texas Southern?  
JOHNETTA HAYES-PERRY: I think this sets the precedent for our future, for
sure, as far as recruiting but also for our players that are returning. Again,
we'll return everybody but one player going into next year. I want them to
enjoy the experience but learn from the experience, to have some growth, so
they can see how hard they have to work, you know, to get a piece of the big
dance every year, how hard you have to work to get here and to win here.  
  
You know, again, I respect all the teams that are in the tournament, and I
know they've all done a good job, but now they know they're getting a piece of
it to understand moving forward how much harder they're going to need to work.  
  
I expressed to them, I said, once we get past this, the hardest thing is to
come, which is postseason workouts because now what do we need to do to be
better to get here again, have an opportunity to get a piece of it, to win, to
really, truly feel good walking in the doors. I think they feel great right
now walking in, and they're going to feel great walking out winners,
hopefully, but the biggest thing is them having some carryover moving forward,
and that's what it's about. You know, and it's a great part of our daily is to
know that they are young and they'll get a chance to see it again and again
for a few years.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Mikayla Cowling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30340)

### [Courtney Range](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30430)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. I just want to ask the players, is there a sense of feeling fortunate
to be here because a lot of people wondered if you would, and because of that,
do you guys feel like you have something you want to prove, hey, we do deserve
to be here?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Well, I mean, first off, we're very grateful that we're in the
tournament, and any team would have wanted to have been there. Now that we are
and we are a 9 seed, we want to just come out and do the best that we can
starting tomorrow night.  
  
MIKAYLA COWLING: I agree.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Ditto.  
  
Q. Kristine, the height disparity with you and LSU is kind of going to
be on focus tomorrow night. Just what have you seen out of LSU and what are
you expecting from them in that regard?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, they're definitely going to compete. No one just wants
to go home. They want to stay here for as long as they can, so we're just
getting ready for them to compete and bring all they can, and we're just going
to try to do whatever we can to win.  
  
Q. Kristine, where have you seen the most improvement in your game
throughout the season?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Finishing, I guess, and just like relying on my teammates
more and knowing that like trust, so we all trust each other more, so I feel
like that's what really helped us become like a better team.  
  
Q. Courtney, you were part of the team that was here in Waco --  
COURTNEY RANGE: Yes.  
  
Q. What's different about this team than the team that was here, and how
is Cal different or the same since the last time we've seen you guys in
Waco?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Well, I mean, my freshman year we had Brittany Boyd and
Reshonda Gray. Those two together are like a good dynamic -- sorry. But this
year, since we're still a young team, yeah, we have every class, but like
personally, I feel like this team this year and from last year, because we had
all returners, we're a stronger team. Like Kristine said, we trust each other
more. We're relying on all 11 players that are playing each game, and to know
that we have each other's back, we know that we can go far, and like she said,
the trust thing is a big thing with our team, and yeah.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you kind of the same question I asked them. The
fortunate part, a lot of people were surprised in a way that you guys got in,
but talk about what they said and what you want to see from your girls now
that you are in and you've got a chance to prove, hey, we do deserve to be
here?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, to be honest, I walked in, I saw you sitting there,
and it was total déjà-vu from four years ago; I said, I remember Steven.  
  
We are very excited to be here, and kind of like Courtney said, I would
imagine all 64 teams are, and if there ever comes a point where I'm not, no
matter which team we are, then I shouldn't be sitting here. I think this is
the best time of year, and so I think our team can have a gratefulness and an
excitement to be here, and yet still a willingness to compete and to want to
win the game.  
  
You know, I don't think we need to prove that we belong in the tournament, but
we want to win the game. The interesting thing is when you're on the bubble,
it's a unique feeling. That said, if you looked at the numbers and you really
took what the committee said they were looking at, our 30-game résumé compared
very favorably with the other teams. I know people want to focus on our
conference record and all that kind of stuff, but I think our players are
always hungry to prove that they're good. I think they're always hungry to
prove that we can compete, and if there's extra motivation to do that, sure,
we'll use that. But the excitement to be in it, why not?  
  
Q. LSU isn't a team with a lot of size inside, but they're also not a
team that from the perimeter shoots a lot of threes or anything like that.
What do you kind of see their identity as?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think that Nikki and her staff have done an incredible job
of maximizing their strengths, which is the ability to turn you over. I mean,
you don't win eight games in the SEC and 20 games overall or whatever they won
with a little bit of a lack of size if you're not doing something to disrupt
the other team, and they're terrific at turning you over, flustering the
guards, not letting you get the ball to interior players, changing up
defenses, but really relying on that end of the floor, and then they create
match-up problems. At one point they shifted the lineup and they've gone
smaller, and I think that that was in a lot of ways useful for them because it
just creates match-up problems all over the floor.  
  
Q. How have you seen Kristine's game grow this season, and has it
surprised you or did you expect that to come?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think her college career thus far has been remarkable, and
so to sort of start out as strongly as she did the beginning of her freshman
year and still grow and improve is pretty impressive. You know, there was no
sophomore slump, so to speak. In fact, she's drawn more attention -- I think
her biggest growth has been in her ability to handle all situations, to be
able to take a loss or a difficult defense against her and turn that into a
positive outcome the next time-out. I think she's a better passer than she was
last year. I think she's a more efficient player than she was last year. She's
extended her range a little bit. You know, I think her rebounding numbers are
up a little bit.  
  
But mostly it's in the things we see in the locker room, the ability to
embrace this idea of being a leader and being a go-to player. I think as a
freshman you're just a talented freshman and you're kind of winging it with
your talent, and now she has an understanding of I want to get this team to
the next level and what do I have to do to do that. In all the ways that comes
with that, I think she's embraced that role.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I think each time your team has made the tournament, you
guys have won a first-round game, and you've got girls that have experienced
that. What is the key to winning a first-round game and to keep streaks like
that going?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Right. I mean, it's always about the scout and the match-up.
I think I have an excellent coaching staff, who the second that the bracket is
revealed after we got ourselves together and stopped jumping up and down, we
were watching film. I think it's the ability to turn around to scout very
quickly. I think the Pac-12 prepares you to face any type of competition.
You're always going to face someone good in the first round because it's the
NCAA Tournament. And then I think it's mindset. You have to be kind of players
refreshed and ready to go, and I think we try to give them the scout, put them
in the right mentality, and then we've got competitors out there who don't
want to go home, and they want to stay in this thing as long as we can. Maybe
that's the formula for success, but really it's a different thing each year
with each team.  
  
Q. LSU not playing in the tournament last year, is that something y'all
can use to your advantage, kind of an experience factor against them?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Well, we weren't, either. So I think it's a neat match-up in
that I think both teams were really, really hungry to get back to the level
that their programs expect. You know, the last time we faced LSU was in the
Sweet 16 up in Spokane, Washington, and I don't think there's players from
either team who have done that.  
  
So I think that all we're trying to do, like Kristine and Courtney and Kayla
said, is embrace the moment and be excited to be here because we weren't last
year, and at the same time, be competitive and hungry to win the game. I
imagine LSU is similar in that sense, but it's going to be, to me, a great
match-up. You couldn't have maybe two more evenly matched teams, different
styles but evenly matched in a lot of ways, and just really looking forward to
what our team can do on Saturday night.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. After sitting out last year, what's it like being here at Baylor and
being involved in this tournament again?  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: It's an amazing experience. We fell short last year, so just
to be here, just a blessing and a great opportunity to showcase your skills
and just a bigger stage.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: It's a blessing. Like she said, it's a bigger stage, so just
come out and play hard.  
  
ALEXIS HYDER: It's an amazing feeling to be rewarded for all the work that
we've put in. Falling short last year hurt us, and we were determined to make
it this year.  
  
Q. Kind of as the team's deep threat, how do you feel about this team
not shooting a ton of threes but that kind of being on your shoulders when you
need it?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I mean, I don't know. I mean, if it's there, just try and knock
it down, but I mean, if it's the pull-up or it's us taking it into the basket,
then that's what we're going to try and do.  
  
Q. Alexis, when you guys look at Cal, what do you see? They're a team
that some people were surprised they got in the NCAA Tournament because they
did struggle down the stretch, but what have you seen from them on film?  
ALEXIS HYDER: We saw that they have an inside presence and that we being
shorter, we're going to have to match their physicality and play defense as a
whole, not leaving anybody out by theirselves. We're going to play a strong
five defense against Cal and get out and run in transition.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question I asked Alexis. When you look at Cal,
clearly some people say, hey, what are they doing there, but what have you
seen of them, and similarly, you don't have to convince your players of that,
that they're a good team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, you know, I think the one thing you've got to see in Cal
is the leadership of Coach Gottlieb. She's done a fantastic job of maintaining
a competitive spirit, nature, culture at Cal, and although their conference
record isn't as strong as I'm sure she would like to have been as far as win-
loss column, the games that they've played in and the ones that they fell
short, they were in those games. They're a team that constantly has an
unbelievable post player inside, and that's something that we've kind of had
to address in the SEC play with all the bigs from Mercedes Russell to A'ja
Wilson. Just so many greats that we've had to compete against. So that
obviously has been an emphasis on the defensive end. But their guard play is
strong, as well. You've got young ladies that can shoot the three. You've got
kids that can play off the bounce. They've got a balanced attack. We're going
to have to really dial our defense up to another level, especially when you
get to NCAA play, and I think that's what Hyder was alluding to is that we've
got to play it like a unit, and once we establish that defensive stops, then
we want to transition and run the basketball. But they're, again, a balanced
team and well-coached.  
  
Q. Coach, you haven't seen a lot of PAC-12 teams since you've come over
to LSU. Is it a little fun for you to get to go back to your roots a little
bit and play another California team?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, my roots are SEC, but my first head coaching job was in
the Pac-10, now in the Pac-12, and so I have a great respect. I think you've
got a conference that has grown, and I've seen it grow over the past six
years. Although I've been away, I still watch. It's a conference that Stanford
with Vanderveer has always kind of dominated, and just to see other schools --
I had a chance to coach plumb, so to see what she's doing with USA Basketball,
so I keep a close eye on certain players that I've coached with USA
Basketball, so I've been watching the Pac-12. I like the fact, though, that we
are familiar with the style of play, but these guys aren't. They haven't
played a Pac-12 team, and I think this is another opportunity for them to have
a great experience, and we talked about that. Last year we were not here, and
for them to really take ownership of what happened last year with the injuries
and then have that focus to make sure that we were in NCAA play, I commend
these young ladies for doing that.  
  
Q. On the format of the NCAA, since we've gone back to these home
courts, what's it like? I know you're not playing Baylor, but you come into
this arena and this practice court, and as much black curtains as there are
there's still remnants of all the success Baylor has had. Do you like the way
this format is set and is it fair and is it a good thing for the NCAA to do?  
NIKKI FARGAS: I like the format. I like the fact that you're rewarding the
body of work that teams have done throughout the entire season. I think that's
something to give your team to strive for is to be in that 1 through 16, and
you then get to move on, but it gives you a chance for you to travel and get
on the road. For us it's an opportunity to play in front of a hostile
environment, if you will, especially if we continue on and win Saturday, then
you know Monday is going to be packed in here. And these are all experiences
that can help even the returning players to take with them for next season.  
  
So everything that you go through in life, and I tell our kids this all the
time, is to help make you better and stronger, and I think that's something
that playing on the road, again, recognize the people who have done a great
job.  
  
Q. I know everything is forward right now and looking to tomorrow, but
kind of looking back a little bit on this season after the disappointment last
year, what do you think of this team and the year in general getting to this
point?  
NIKKI FARGAS: We were definitely just stunned, if you will, coming out of last
season into this year. The season of last year really took a lot out of our
kids emotionally, physically, playing six players. So this past summer you
really had to be careful in giving them that quality time off, and then we're
dialing it back up again. You can't scout. You can't prepare. You can't
overlook injuries. It's just something that's part of the game more and more.
We've got two young ladies that basically had season-ending injuries again
this year. We're missing our leading scorer in Jenna Deemer. When you talk
about the three-point shot, she was someone that gave us that. And then we're
missing 6'5" Faustine Aifuwa, one of my freshmen who potentially could have
been a starter this year, so that gives you that size that we alluded to.  
  
So I look at this team and they've been resilient. They've been very grateful
that it's not six now, it's 10, it's 11. They appreciate the fact that they've
got a sub. And so the people who do sub, get to sub in, they appreciate that,
too, so there's just a different appreciation that I feel with this group, not
that they didn't before.  
  
This season has been a tough one for us in the sense of our non-conference
schedule. Played some really good opponents, played UConn, NC State, K-State,
so just really did a nice job in non-conference play. When you get in the SEC
you can look at the win-loss columns, but every game is a game. It is.  
  
Again, we can't say enough, because I told them, I said, last year I had them
fill out the bracket with -- we knew we didn't have a chance of getting our
name called, but they needed to know what that felt like. When they did that,
I think it sent a message to them throughout the entire summer that we wanted
to have our name called and have an opportunity to play and be in the hunt, if
you will, for a championship.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 67, Mississippi State - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll take a comment from Dawn, then questions for A'ja.  
  
COACH STALEY: Just want to give God the glory for allowing this to happen.
Really proud of our team, but also I want to make sure that we recognize the
Mississippi State Bulldogs for competing, for representing our conference
positively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for A'ja.  
  
Q. A'ja, I want to thank you for delivering your promised dance with the
band. What does it mean to help get your coach, who you've known forever, a
South Carolina native, her first national championship?  
A'JA WILSON: I really can't even put into words the feeling of how much it
meant to win this game for Coach. She's put in so much time, so much sweat,
just voiced her voice into us. Just prepping for times like this.  
  
I think she really helped our confidence, to get over this hump that we were
going through with adversity, stuff like that. It really means something
special to kind of bring this back home, especially for such a great person
like Coach Staley.  
  
Q. A'ja, the stretch at the end of the game, maybe when it got tight,
you had kind of a burst, a couple of big blocks, some points, was that a
mindset change for you, you were going to deliver this down the stretch? When
Alaina went out, what kind of conversation did you have with Coach Staley?  
COACH STALEY: The first question, honestly I just kind of knew I needed to
make an impact on the game. That's my biggest thing when I play, when I
compete, is how can I make my impact. That was just my mindset going in, is I
have to make an impact, whether it's a block, a score, yelling, bringing
energy. I have to make an impact one way.  
  
When Lai went down, it was tough. It was tough. Loosing a piece like Lai was
really tough. I think Coach just kind of said, We have to play through it.
We've all been hit with adversity, we have to work through it, play through
it. That's when I knew I had to step up and be more vocal to our newcomers,
just to the team.  
  
Q. A'ja, can you talk about first just your mindset to dominate tonight,
then it seemed like you guys as a team were in attack mode from the start.
Just talk about those two things.  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, I just kind of play my game and just stick within myself,
play my role, whether it's being dominant, being a good teammate. I try to
stay within my role and helping out my teammate as much as I can.  
  
I can't remember your second question.  
  
COACH STALEY: Welcome to my world (laughter).  
  
A'JA WILSON: That was just a timeout just now.  
  
That's our season, attacking in paint, paint dominance. We kept doing that,
and got the win.  
  
Q. A'ja, at the end of the game, you were very emotional as the clock
was ticking down. It took you a few seconds to go out on the floor and
celebrate. Can you talk about where all that emotion came from, what you were
thinking at that time.  
A'JA WILSON: Well, in October I lost my grandmother. I really kind of
dedicated this season to her. It was a very emotional time for me. My
teammates really rallied around me, helped me become a better person, a great
player. Just to have -- for us to face adversity like we did, for us to
overcome it, the doubters we had, just shake them off, honestly get this
national championship, hanging up a banner, getting this ring, it really meant
a lot to me.  
  
This team is just so special. I can't really put into words and explain to you
how special this team really is, on and off the court.  
  
For us to really just see smiling faces, just positive vibes, it really set me
into tears. I really couldn't hold them back.  
  
I mean, yeah, that was it.  
  
Q. A'ja, you've spoken about, and your game bears it out, you let the
game come to you, you do not force things. I'm wondering how in the moment you
go about making that happen. How hard it is, are there little things you tell
yourself? Even after Alaina was gone, how did you manage to let the game come
to you?  
A'JA WILSON: I just honestly think that's a pride thing, within myself, that I
just kind of say, You just got to take it all in stride, don't force stuff.
You got to trust your teammates in that way. I trust my teammates a lot. I
know the guards are going to hit shots, I know my other post players are going
to work and dive in when I need them to. It really comes from trust, letting
the game come to you. I can't put it into any other words.  
  
It was tough losing Lai. At the same time I have to step up in different ways.
I can't foul as much as I would or if I could. I can't do certain things. So I
think that really helped my game out, just playing smarter.  
  
Q. I saw you had a lot of success picking away at Mississippi State's
defense. What did you do to throw them off their game early?  
A'JA WILSON: Honestly I don't know. I think we just kind of took our time. We
really took our time with plays, really read the defense, see how they were
playing us. They were denying our wings. It was hard to get the ball in.  
  
I think we really found a way of just attacking the paint and getting it
inside.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, A'ja.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Dawn.  
  
Q. Dawn, you're only the second African-American women's coach to win a
title. Do you think, as what happened with John Thompson, that athletic
directors will now being more receptive hiring African-American women to coach
teams?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I don't know what athletic directors will think about. I
know that I'm not one that looks at race. Basketball has been faceless and
colorless and genderless. When I approached it, I grew up in a city which guys
allowed me to play and hone my skills as a basketball player.  
  
I think athletic directors need to hire what's best for them. If it's an
African-American male or female, then that's what they should hire. If it's
somebody else who they feel can take their program to the next level, it has
to be the best fit for them, not necessarily color-based.  
  
Q. Is that net ever going to come away from you, since you finally got
one? What does it mean to you, to have been to the Final Four a few times as a
player, to finally get the title?  
COACH STALEY: It means that, you know, I can check off one of the things that
has been a void in my career. It's one of two, you know, opportunities that I
saw women play when I was younger. National championship games and Olympics.
Those were the things that I held dear and near to me when I was growing up,
because those are the things that I wanted. That's what I saw. That's what I
was shooting for.  
  
When I couldn't get it done in college, I thought that was it. I never wanted
to be a coach. I never wanted to, you know, be sitting where I'm sitting. Dave
O'Brien, the late Dave O'Brien, the athletic director at Temple University,
saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. He asked me to come and be a
part of changing the program at Temple.  
  
From then on, I really can't see myself doing anything other than what I'm
doing, impacting the lives of young people, and also being able to check this
box off in my career. I'm really grateful and thankful that he made this
possible.  
  
Q. Dawn, with the trophy, it took you so long to get it, how long will
you hold it? How long will it be till you let your players take a turn with
it?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I'm going to enjoy it. It's something that I've been
coaching for 17 years now. I played college basketball, what, 25 to 28 years
ago. It took that long.  
  
But I also want people to know that just because something takes a long time,
I mean, you have to have patience, you have to persevere, stay with it. If
something is a goal of yours to accomplish, you don't give up on it.  
  
I never gave up on winning a national championship, no matter how hard it was,
no matter what it looked like. I'm just so happy that I get a chance to share
it with so many different people in my coaching, basketball family tree.
Coaches, former players, mentors, everybody, everybody.  
  
I do have to give a shout out, the other African-American woman that won a
national championship is Carolyn Peck. Carolyn Peck, a few years ago, when she
was commentating, she gave me a piece of her net, her national championship
net. She told me to keep it. I've had it in my wallet for years.  
  
She said, When you win your national championship, just return it.  
  
I'm going to have to pass a piece of my net on to somebody else so they can
share and hopefully accomplish something as big as this. I do have to give a
shout out to Carolyn Peck, and I will return her net, thankfully.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you convinced A'ja Wilson to come close to home and try to
accomplish this with you, how did you frame that for her? Did you promise her
this was going to happen? Did you think she could help you deliver it? What is
your satisfaction that a South Carolina kid helped deliver a title?  
COACH STALEY: With A'ja, no, I don't really make promises in recruiting.
Probably the only promise that I make is, I'm going to work you, I'm going to
do my best to try to make you a better person, then that will transition into
making you a better player.  
  
I just thought that A'ja Wilson needed a coach which could be patient with
her, 'cause she's different. She's different. She's not one that you can keep
pounding. She's one that needs to see it, needs it explained to her, and needs
someone to be real patient with her. If you're patient with her, you know,
this is what you get in return.  
  
Her parents did a great job of doing their due diligence, making sure that
South Carolina was ready for her, on all levels, from an academic standpoint,
from an athletic standpoint, from a social standpoint.  
  
Staying at home, there's a huge responsibility. It's taxing, because everybody
knows her. Everybody wants to stop and have conversation with her. We knew
that was going to take place.  
  
But when the tragedy like losing her grandmother occurred earlier this season,
if she was anywhere else, she would have probably been transferring back to
South Carolina.  
  
So I'm glad she chose to stay with us so we could share in that moment with
her and help her mend a little bit.  
  
But it was a great fit for our program. It was a great fit for her family. I'm
glad that we were able to cut down the nets. It was a great fit from a
basketball standpoint.  
  
Q. Coach, with being named the national team head coach, coupled with
the fact that some of your contemporaries are nearing the end of their
careers, how does it feel to be the new face of this sport?  
COACH STALEY: You know, basketball has been an incredible gift, you know, that
keeps on giving. I don't know why, but I do work hard at this. It is my
passion. It is my livelihood. It is something that brings me a great deal of
joy.  
  
It brings also challenges, as well. It keeps me engaged. I am forever grateful
for the opportunity to coach USA Basketball. For so many years, it is what
keeps me coming back, the culture of USA Basketball. It's what I desire for
every team that I'm a part of.  
  
You know, you're working together for one common goal. We work together at
South Carolina for this common goal of winning a national championship. The
way you do that is you try to do it the right way. Sometimes, you know, there
are bumps along the road and things don't work out the way you want them to
work out.  
  
You look back on the culture of excellence of a USA Basketball system, and you
just try to use that as an imprint on this level. I know we don't come close
to it on the collegiate level because it's a little different. But if you can
fall short of that, you're in the right ballpark.  
  
Q. Dawn, with Mississippi State being such a good defensive team, they
did struggle with cuts in isolation. Do you think that spoke to your offensive
strengths as a team? When you look at what you've accomplished as a coach, as
a player, you've pretty much done it all. You talked about checking those
boxes. What is the next box for you?  
COACH STALEY: Well, with Mississippi State, we've played them. This is our
third time playing them, so we know exactly the things that create edges for
us throughout the game.  
  
I just thought, you know, from an offensive standpoint we needed to attack the
paint. Yes, Mississippi State is a very good defensive team. They're also a
team that fouls a lot. We wanted to make sure that we put 'em back on their
heels, put them back in situations in which we were going to make the
officials make a call, whether it was a charge, whether it was a block,
whether it was a reach-in.  
  
We feel like, with any team, a good defensive team or not, if you're attacking
the paint, it's just a hard guard. Our players stuck to the game plan, you
know, executed the game plan to a T.  
  
Also I know we talk a lot about other teams being a good defensive team. But
South Carolina is a really good defensive team, a really good defensive team.
We hang our hat on that. I'm proud of our players. To hold Mississippi State
to 55 points, probably 20 points under their average in the tournament, goes
to show our commitment to that side of the basketball.  
  
I mean, I've been named the USA national team coach. The next one is to win a
gold medal in the 2020 Olympic Games.  
  
Q. I'd like to hear your comments, fans said you came to South Carolina
when it was only a few people in the gym. Now it's sellouts. We also heard the
story about someone dealing with cancer. How are you able to be there when
someone is fighting for their life and still be able to concentrate on your
job?  
COACH STALEY: The first one is, South Carolina is a place in which they love
their sports. They love the University of South Carolina. I mean, they love
winners.  
  
Obviously if you start winning, and they start believing in your program,
they're going to come. That's what took place. I'd like to think, you know, we
got an incredible marketing department - and we do - but you can market
women's basketball all you want, all you want. If people don't believe in the
product that's on the floor, they're not going to come.  
  
I just think our fans believe in the product. We make them feel a part of our
program. We talk to them. We invite them to our offices. We put on events just
for them. In return, you know, they become the No. 1 in attendance for the
past three years, which is unheard of in South Carolina, what people think of
as a football town.  
  
Our town is a sports town. They love their sports. Certainly the fans have
painted a picture of what a national champion looks like. I can't thank them
enough. I can't wait to get home to share this moment with them.  
  
Nikki McCray was diagnosed with cancer three years ago on I think a November
afternoon. When we knew what her diagnosis and her treatments were, you know,
we went to every single one of her chemo treatments. We did scouting reports,
we talked, we kept her mind occupied.  
  
With a disease like cancer, you have to stay occupied because it will consume
you in a way that will downward spiral to a place where it's hard to get out
of.  
  
Nikki is by far one of the strongest women I know. She never missed a day of
work until she had her surgery, then we forced her. She got out of surgery,
and she came to work. We all had a bet how quickly she would get back to work.  
  
When you have someone who has cancer, you wrap your arms around them. You
occupy their minds with, you know, something other than cancer.  
  
Nikki, you know, she's cancer-free. She's doing extremely well. God has His
hands wrapped around her. It's something that's what family does.  
  
Q. A couple years ago you spent two weeks overseas with President
Clinton on the foundation. Have you heard from him this week?  
COACH STALEY: His office did call to wish us good luck. Hopefully I'll get a
chance to talk to him. And the UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, did reach out and
text today. She's a proud South Carolinian.  
  
Q. Coach, we've talked a lot about A'ja. We've talked a lot about
Allisha. They both had double-digits in the game. I think the tone was set
tonight at the tip when Bianca picked up Morgan William at halfcourt. I asked
somebody yesterday, if you could tell us a little bit more about Bianca, how
she helped control this game without scoring or assisting, just from the
defensive end.  
COACH STALEY: The maturity of Bianca Cuevas(-Moore) is quite incredible. I'm
extremely proud of Bianca for accepting that role. Being a New Yorker, being
Bianca Cuevas, she likes to score the ball. She likes to throw a little sauce
out there when she has the ball in her hands.  
  
She committed to impacting the game by picking Morgan William up, making it
very difficult for her. She knew the game plan was to make it difficult for
Morgan to operate in areas in which she could control their team, whether it's
scoring, whether it's finding other teammates.  
  
I knew she was going to impact the game in this way from the moment we knew we
would play Mississippi State. She was great in practice yesterday. She was
great in shootaround. If you ask her a question about anything, her answer
was, I know the game plan, I got it.  
  
A lot of times when a player's that confident, you don't know if they're going
to be able to deliver. But I knew deep down Bianca Cuevas was going to come
through for us, and she did just that.  
  
So super proud of her. Super proud of her maturation process.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 67, Mississippi State - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer, then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, you know, really want to congratulate South Carolina.
Thought they really played well today. Again, we've had obviously some hard
times dealing with them, and today was no different. I want to congratulate
Dawn and her staff. Those kids played extremely hard.  
  
We got out-rebounded 13. We got out-scored in the paint, I think 13-6. Points
in the paint were 42-20. We don't usually win games when we don't win the
points in the paint battle.  
  
I thought they were really, really aggressive, did a really nice job attacking
us. We had a hard time with them off the bounce. Had some foul trouble early
with Bre and Dom, tried to weather that a little bit. But I don't think it
would have mattered. I think South Carolina really played extremely well.
Today just wasn't our best day.  
  
As I told the kids, you know, you pat 'em on the back, tell them, Good job.
They were the better team today. It takes nothing away from our 34-5 season.
As my athletic director reminded us, there were 347 teams today watching this
game. We were one of the two playing. Only one of them walked off that floor
the winner.  
  
I'm still waiting for the confetti to come down and be able to stand out there
and my kids being able to stay out there and win it. We didn't have any
confetti when we won the regional. Tonight we had to walk off the floor with
the confetti coming down. That will be something we'll look forward to.  
  
These three seniors are very, very special. Along with Chinwe (Okorie), they
believed in a vision five years ago really, when we recruited them. They've
been here four. When it wasn't easy to believe. Coach Harris and myself were
part of that original staff.  
  
These kids believed. They made it happen. We didn't get here by accident. We
came through a really tough regional. These kids deserve all the credit for
that.  
  
Today doesn't define us. It certainly doesn't define this team or this season.
They had one heck of a year. I just want these kids, especially those seniors,
to know how much I love 'em, appreciate 'em. They're always going to be
special in my heart, have a special place in my heart because of what they've
accomplished, for believing and trusting us.  
  
Their parents believed us, they trusted us, they had confidence in us. I'm
really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ketara and Bre, can you talk about what it's like to go against A'ja
(Wilson). In the post, she seemed to have a determination about her tonight.  
KETARA CHAPEL: A'ja is a great player. We've been dealing with her for three
years. She's tough. We had a hard time guarding her tonight. I don't know.
She's a really great player, so it's hard to try to match her intensity.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: Like she said, A'ja is a great player. I feel like tonight
she came out and was just determined to get the win for her team. She played
with energy that her team needed.  
  
Q. Dom, why do you think this team resonated so much with the
Mississippi State fan base this year?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I mean, I think every year that we've been here, it's
gotten better. I think we've been really good this year. So, I mean, the fans
just keep growing.  
  
It just started our freshmen year. Coach Schaefer has us up in the stands
hugging babies, kissing babies, hugging people. I think it's our family
atmosphere and how personable we are with our fans. I think it's just grown
every year.  
  
Q. Dom, in terms of what you accomplished, what do you think it says
that this team, without any McDonald's All-Americans, has gotten as far as
they have? Coach talked about he recruited you specifically for your
toughness. What do you think we learned about where the women's game is right
now?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think it means if you work hard, you can accomplish
things no matter the skill level. Sometimes talent doesn't work hard. When you
work hard without talent, you out-work the talent.  
  
If you put your mind to something, you'll get it done. You don't have to be
All-American. You don't have to be 6'7". Morgan, itty-bitty, she plays like
the biggest person on our team sometimes.  
  
A ranking, a skill level, doesn't define you. Hard work is what defines you.  
  
Q. Dom, aside from the early start and the late spurt there in the
fourth quarter, seemed like it was an uphill battle all the rest of the game.
What was it like to try to get into an offensive rhythm? It really seemed like
South Carolina made it difficult for you for long stretches.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Yeah, we were up 7-3 at the beginning. They made a run.
We weren't executing offensively.  
  
There's no way to put it. We just weren't executing offensively. We weren't
putting the ball in the basket and we weren't getting stops, which doesn't
have a good recipe.  
  
I think defense is a really big key for us, and we weren't playing well
defensively, which doesn't lead to points for us. I think it started
defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions now for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how difficult it was to guard them? It
seemed like from the tip, they were in attack mode and everything was going
straight to the rim.  
COACH SCHAEFER: They certainly were in attack mode. I'm going to take a lot of
the responsibility for our poor defensive play today. We really feed off
whoever's on the ball. I just didn't have a really good matchup on the ball
today. I think when you're soft on the ball, it's always been my philosophy,
if you got somebody soft on the ball, it's hard to get four behind you to play
really hard.  
  
I'm going to take the hit for that.  
  
You know, you've got matchup problems with them. They got big ol' guards out
there, 6'2" guards. We have a little bit of a size problem guarding them, not
to mention how quick and athletic they are.  
  
So, you know, part of our philosophy going into the game, how we were going to
guard a particular set, I think it really took some of our aggressiveness
away. I'm disappointed that it did. Felt like it was the best way to guard
that particular set. In the end, I think it created an atmosphere defensively
that is not a good recipe for us.  
  
Again, it's kind of like starting a game off in zone, then going to man. I'd
much rather start man and go zone. When you start zone, it's hard to get
somebody to get up and get after it in man after you've been standing around,
if that makes sense.  
  
Q. Vic, was that matchup piece why Morgan was on the bench late in the
game? What went into that decision?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Jazz(mun) (Holmes) was playing good today. Jazz played good
today. Morgan, she had some struggles early. Again, y'all, it's a long, hard
grind of a year, of a season. We got in so late Friday night. We've been
trying to almost play catch-up since then.  
  
I thought we had a couple kids today that just didn't quite have the energy
level that we needed. When you combine that with their energy level seemed to
be really good, I think that made for a bad recipe for our not being able to
handle dribble-penetration.  
  
Again, South Carolina's really good defensively. They seem to play really well
against us defensively. They did a good job again today. I mean, they play
really hard against us and do a great job. Today was no different.  
  
Q. To elaborate on your previous point about the defensive set. Was that
going under the screen, not going over it, or giving them too much space on
dribble-penetration?  
COACH SCHAEFER: The screen is set inside the scoring area. We do things
differently, depending on where the ball screen is. We didn't handle the ball
screen well today.  
  
Again, you know, they're really good. They get going downhill, boy, and it's
hard. If y'all noticed, we had probably six or seven block calls, where
typically we're getting charges on all those. Dom is taking 52, Morgan is
taking 51, vice versa.  
  
I think every one of them was right. Every one of them. We were just a half a
step slow today on every rotation. We just couldn't get there. That's the way
it is. Again, you give South Carolina all the credit because they really
attacked us.  
  
If you can ever get those first two charges in the first three, four minutes,
it slows all that down. We couldn't get there. Bre had two block charge calls
on her. Again, they're right. I mean, we're half a step late. We were half a
step late all day.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer, on Friday night after you took down UConn, the way
you took them down in overtime, one of the things that Geno talked about in
here was being a gracious loser. It's easy to smile, be up when you win. I
think the telltale sign, you'd agree, is how you behave when you lose. Can you
tell us a little bit, without giving us too much, what you had to say to your
team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. Yeah, you know, with my team, just the last minute, I
was coaching them the last minute, Hey, we're not going to probably win the
game, but we're going to win the last minute. We talked about that in the
huddle when there was 40-something seconds on the clock. We're in the kid
business. We're constantly coaching and teaching young people. At that moment
it's not about X's and O's. It's about trying to coach and teach them on how
to handle adverse situations.  
  
You go in that locker room, those four seniors, it's rough. I love those kids.
I love all of 'em in there like my own, but those four seniors are really,
really special.  
  
You tell 'em, Hey, not our day. Make sure you pat South Carolina on the back.
They played really well. It wasn't our best day. But it's not defining our
season. It doesn't define them as young women. It doesn't define them as
student-athletes. They've had a heck of a year, man. We've beaten two No. 1's
to get here. We played on the last day.  
  
Are we disappointed? Absolutely. We have three rows in there. The front row is
my seniors, the back row is my junior and sophomores and freshmen. I
challenged the second and third row, Okay, this is your team. You nine that
are now sitting here, we're good enough. I have a heck of a team coming back.
I got the 19th-ranked class in the country coming in.  
  
It's their team. It shouldn't matter who is coming in, even though we got a
heck of a group coming back. It's their time to go work and get better. Don't
let this moment -- don't minimize this moment. How you feel, remember it. Wrap
your arms around it. Use it as fuel.  
  
So you talk about those things. I mean, I let my seniors talk. It was real
emotional, you know. They've had the ride of a lifetime. Really for four
years, they've had a great career.  
  
They've won so many games, built a program that is the talk of the country.
They don't ask me to come speak about X's and O's. Used to. Now they want to
know how we got the seventh largest fan attendance in the country in
Starkville, Mississippi. That's what they want to know.  
  
That's good. That's good for the game. You saw my fans today. I feel horrible
for them. I hate to have to walk out there and see them. You know what,
there's probably going to be a thousand of them over in the Sheraton. We had
2,000 today sending them off. It's hard to look those people in the eye
because I feel like I let 'em down. Those people love my kids. So that's what
we talked about.  
  
Q. Vic, to jump off from that point, very few coaches would have played
Morgan William 23 minutes, taken Victoria Vivians out. How much of that played
a part in thinking, This is not just an end, this is a team that you're
bringing back next year, part of a larger process that extends beyond the end
of this game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, no question. I mean, Victoria didn't have a great day.
She was 4-16. Morgan, she had four assists, one turnover, was 2-6.  
  
Again, we're educating. This is an education process. I was trying to get 'em
going. Again, both ends of the floor is real important for us, for me as a
coach. I try to hold people accountable.  
  
If you looked at the stats, my two guards, all of 'em, we didn't have a very
good day. The best position I had was my three position. That was Dominique.
She went 5-10, you know.  
  
So my point guards combined went 5-11, but Jazz was 3-5. You can go down the
list, but you're right. For me, I'm a big-picture guy. Just kept coaching 'em,
trying to prod 'em, letting 'em know.  
  
Plus, when you got somebody maybe that seems like they're a little tired,
you're trying to give 'em a blow. You give somebody a blow. Next thing you
know, the person you're putting in is playing pretty good. Maybe you don't
want to take 'em out.  
  
Don't forget, Jazzmun Holmes had 14 points against DePaul. Morgan didn't play
a lot in that second half. I got a lot of confidence in that kid. She was
playing well today.  
  
Q. You talked earlier this season about getting more help for Victoria.
It really seemed like you were either trying to get her going or, I don't
know, get her to attack the basket a little bit more. Unfortunately, neither
of those things worked out. Were other players not stepping up, or was she
just the player you maybe had the most confidence in?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We cut it to 54-50. I don't know what the time was on the
clock. We had possession, if I'm not mistaken. Took two really bad shots. They
go down, then we come down, have an unforced turnover and leave it for them at
the top of the key and they go lay it in and it goes to 58-50.  
  
We had the game, cut it back, fought, fought, fought, got it back to 54-50,
had possession. Sometimes this group can get caught up in a moment. Again, I'm
sure, too, everyone who is watching us for the first or second time, they
think, Man, that's a really bad shot.  
  
Well, I've seen people make -- I've seen our kids make some of those shots
that people think may be really bad shots. In that moment, we probably could
have gotten a lot better shot. You could get that shot any time in the shot
clock. We had one broken play, then the other one we just went off and left
it. They took it and went and laid it in.  
  
That's kind of where the game got away from us. We had it to 54-50, had the
crowd going. We were right there. You know, again, maybe it took all we had to
get to that point and get it back after being down so bad. We didn't have
anything left. It just comes down at that point, you got to execute. We didn't
execute.  
  
But, you know, South Carolina, they have a habit of making it hard for you to
execute. Again, I said that about Connecticut. Because they're such a great
oiled machine offensively, nobody wants to talk about how good a defensive
team that team is. Same thing with South Carolina. Talk about A'ja Wilson,
Gray. Let me tell you something, those kids guard your butt. They're just hard
to handle.  
  
You know, it's just part of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I had a chance to talk to your former boss, Gary Blair. He
said defense is what you done. You followed what he did by going out in the
streets and getting people to believe in the program. Can you talk about where
you go from here? I also talked to D.J., Dionnah Jackson. Where do you go?
You've been on both sides of the field in this area?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, Dionnah actually came from George Mason. They played for
Oklahoma. She hasn't been there in a long time. Her and Carly have been a
great addition for me and Johnnie. Johnnie has been with me, we've been
together, we're like brother and sister. She's so much a part of what we do,
has made such an incredible impact in my life and on this team and our
program.  
  
Again, I wouldn't be here today if she said, Hey, I'm not coming. That's the
importance that Johnnie has in my life.  
  
But, you know, when you work with somebody for 15 years, like I did with Coach
Blair, to see how hard he worked at the marketing piece of getting out, you
know, speaking to 20 people, 50 people, 200 people, driving two hours in
Mississippi to towns I've never even heard of to talk to 25 people, 30 people.  
  
But you don't turn anybody down. My thing is, I always tell 'em, If you come
to one game, your life will be changed forever because now you won't miss
another one. You'll be living your life around when we play. That's happened.
Our fan base, I have people that come from the coast, comes in the weekend,
come Thursday, stay till Sunday when we have two games in a row. From Tupelo,
Memphis, then in between, Jackson.  
  
It's what makes it special. But you have to work at it. You know, you all
asked Dom about that. My answer is, our kids get all the credit because it's
how we play the game. I believe our fans, we have some tremendous, passionate,
loyal fans at Mississippi State. But I believe they appreciate the blue-
collar, the hard work, the toughness, stepping in front of a freight train,
taking a charge mentality, how hard we play. I think that's why they come
watch our kids play.  
  
It gets louder in the Hump when we take a charge than any three-pointer that
anybody could shoot. They have a real identity and a real appreciation for
kids that play hard. People love Dak, but they loved him first because he's
tough. He ain't running to the boundary, you know what I mean? He ain't a
quarterback taking a hook slide. He's going to run over your butt. So that's
why people I think really appreciated him and loved him so dearly.  
  
That's my kids. We ain't running to the boundary, you know. It's been a real
honor and a privilege to coach these seniors, this team. This team has
certainly challenged me. But it's been obviously extremely rewarding. Just
really humbled and honored to have had the opportunity at such a great
university with these great kids.  
  
Appreciate everybody being here today. I'm disappointed we didn't play better
for you. It wasn't that we didn't try. Again, you have to take your hats off
to South Carolina and Dawn Staley for a tremendous effort today.  
  
But we'll be back. Again, it's been a heck of a ride. I appreciate everybody
in here. It's been fun. Thank you for being here.  
  
All right, praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the podium now, Dawn Staley from South Carolina.
We will take questions for Coach right now.  
  
Q. Dawn, what did it mean to your program when A'ja (Wilson) decided to
commit to South Carolina? Could you maybe take us back through the recruitment
of her as the No. 1 player in the country, what it meant for you when she
picked you over some of the other big-dog programs.  
COACH STALEY: I think any time that you have the best player in the country in
your backyard, I think it brings credibility. I don't know if we'll ever get
another No. 1 player in the country, if she were not from our area.  
  
The amount of time that went into recruiting her, her family, it was quite
easy to do it because we had access to all of those people. They watched our
program grow from the ground up. We provided some things that other programs,
other top programs in the country, were providing to their top recruits.  
  
But it meant a great deal with an attendance standpoint, where our fans get a
chance to come and watch her grow up. She's a family person, so it gave her an
opportunity to play in front of her family.  
  
It also allowed us to branch out and recruit some other players nationally,
because if she's considering the University of South Carolina, other ones may
follow suit. Back then it wasn't a very popular thing to choose our school
because we hadn't been to the Final Four. I don't know if we won an SEC --
yeah, we won one at that point.  
  
It meant that she gave us a little credibility, to say that we're on the rise.  
  
Q. Coach, (SID) Diana's (Kowal) notes highlight the raised level of play
for Allisha (Gray), A'ja and Kaela (Davis). What did you talk to your players
about after Alaina (Coates) went out with injury, and how did you see their
production respond?  
COACH STALEY: I didn't necessarily talk to the three of them. I talked to our
team. When you have a player go down that has contributed in a way that Alaina
has contributed for us, it's a blow. You feel it from an emotional standpoint.
You have to take it, you know, head on, in that moment.  
  
We found out. We told our team. We just moved forward. It's much like, you
know, if a player gets injured during a practice. We immediately take the rest
of the team down the other end and we continue practicing. I'll go back over
and check on the injured player, but you can't show your players any sign of
weakness, or you're less confident in us moving forward.  
  
I think you just have to stay confident. I've always preached with our players
you can't get too high with the highs and too low with the lows. You have to
find a way to maintain. If you're maintaining, you can only go up. You can
only go up.  
  
I thought our players took our lead as far as our coaching staff, felt like we
had enough in the room to accomplish all of our goals, still with the injury.  
  
Q. Allisha Gray was big for you last night. Talk about what you need her
to do for you, what she does for you.  
COACH STALEY: Allisha Gray has been the most consistent probably of all of our
players. We call her the silent assassin. She doesn't say much. She lets her
play speak for itself. She's been doing that time and time again.  
  
She's never complained about what she gives up on a defensive end as far as
having to play much taller, stronger post players. She just does it. She just
goes about her job. She does it in a way that would make any coach proud.  
  
I wish I had two or three or four more Allisha Grays. If we did, I'd probably
feel a little more confident going into a national championship game
(smiling).  
  
Q. Dawn, Connecticut and Tennessee have won I think 19 titles between
them, and given women's basketball great visibility, legitimacy in a
groundbreaking way. What happened last night, do you think that's necessary
for the evolution of the game, with what Mississippi State did, to let other
teams know that it's possible on the biggest stage, that maybe we can do it,
too?  
COACH STALEY: Yeah, I think it's good for the game. It's good to shake it up a
little bit. I think more people are going to start watching it just because.  
  
What it does is it gives hope to all of us, all of us that are not in that
number of 19 national championships. We're just vying to get one. Hopefully we
can build off that.  
  
But certainly I think it breathes a light into women's basketball, knowing
that it's not the same old, same old, same old UConn. Although it's been an
incredible ride. It's been incredible to watch. It's been a beautiful thing to
watch.  
  
But it was great. I mean, it's great to know that somebody else is going to
win a national championship. It's not the same old, you know, Velcro. You just
take the Velcro off, stick Connecticut back up. It's different. It's a nice
little flavor to it.  
  
Q. Dawn, does it make it easier for you guys preparing for tomorrow that
it's an SEC battle, you played twice already? Your players already know them
well, it makes it easier than playing a team you haven't played as much?  
COACH STALEY: It does make it easier, you know, but you can't -- for what
Mississippi State has done over the past five games, you know, they're much
different than they were that sixth game in which we played them in the SEC
tournament championship.  
  
The intangible part of it is really hard to get our focus in on it. They're
playing at an all-time high. Morgan William is playing some of the best
basketball I've ever seen played in a player.  
  
You can't go into the game thinking you can just do the same old things. You
got to give her different looks. You got to make sure that she's not getting
hot and into a groove.  
  
But as far as player personnel, we know them. We know them extremely well.
Although you have to prepare for both of them, we are prepared for both of
them. We didn't have to prepare as much for an opponent we haven't seen all
season.  
  
Q. Dawn, you played Mississippi State twice, obviously played UConn as
well. I think the country was pretty surprised to see the result. Were you
surprised by what happened last night?  
COACH STALEY: I wasn't surprised because we've played them. I've watched UConn
over the past couple of years. I think Vic has the personnel to disrupt. He
did it in a way, over a 40-minute period, which is extremely hard to stay
engaged that long against a UConn team that is just a machine as far as what
they're able to do offensively.  
  
I just thought they had the bigs to give them a little trouble. They used
their bigs in the right way on both sides of the ball. I think UConn had a bad
day. Watching the game, Mississippi State had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you took over at South Carolina, Tennessee was still the
power of the SEC, and had been for decades. At that time did you have in your
mind, Hey, this is where I want to get to, to be that kind of power in the
league? Can you also talk about the fact that you and Mississippi State are
here in a national championship game, have kind of replaced, if you will, the
power structure in the SEC.  
COACH STALEY: Well, here's how it went for my coaching career. When I was at
Temple for eight years, we would get to the NCAA tournament, the first round,
possibly the second round. We've always, you know, lost in that first and
second round. That was really frustrating.  
  
I thought at that time, nine years ago, that we took Temple as far as we could
take it, with the players we could get, to recruit, to come to Temple. At
tournament time, we always got out-talented. We out-played people, but they
out-talented us.  
  
I, as a coach, wanted to be part of what's happening right now. I thought
making a coaching move to a bigger conference would allow our coaching staff
to live out some dreams that we wanted as coaches, and that's to win a
national championship.  
  
South Carolina opened up. I mean, it was two-fold. One, personally, my parents
are from South Carolina. They were born there. Then professionally, it's the
platform that we needed to compete and win for national championships.  
  
We don't know it's always going to work out that way, but I knew we had the
platform. I didn't know that A'ja Wilson was in our backyard. I didn't know
Aleighsa Welch was in our backyard. Nor did I know Tiffany Mitchell.  
  
But it all came together quite nicely in the fact that we had some of the top
players in the country in our state and in surrounding areas. It made this
dream come true a little bit quicker.  
  
So, you know, South Carolina, the SEC, allowed us to be in this position. For
two SEC teams to compete for a national championship, it's quite incredible.
Even just looking at Vic and what he's done with Mississippi State in just a
short period of time. I think a lot of people don't really understand what
goes into coaching young people these days. Some people don't understand what
young people have to do to realize their dreams.  
  
Sometimes you've got to make hard calls. Sometimes you've got to, you know,
gain by losing. All that happens. But it's these moments that make you forget
about those times and really appreciate the good times and what it took to get
here.  
  
Q. Coach Staley, the first question I had, last night as I was leaving I
saw you and some of the coaching staff walking by the Mississippi State locker
room. As a coach, what did you see in that locker room? I think a lot of
things your team is going through could be mirrored by Mississippi State.
Secondly, did you talk with Bianca (Cuevas-Moore) yet about the matchup at the
lead guard spot, some of the things she might need to do come Sunday night?  
COACH STALEY: We did walk by. I looked in the locker room, their locker room,
and I just saw them very, very happy for accomplishing something that most
people didn't think could get done.  
  
I actually wanted to get some eye contact from somebody just to say
congratulations, because you work so hard, you want to make sure that you give
credit where credit is due. I wanted to congratulate Vic. I did text him just
to congratulate him on winning.  
  
You know, I'm a dream merchant for young people. One of their dreams was to
come true. They're not my kids, but it's a dream that has been realized by
young people. I wanted to kind of get eye contact with them just to say
congratulations.  
  
I also wanted to let them have their moment.  
  
As far as the matchup, you know, with Morgan William, we had film today. We
talked a little bit about it. Bianca knows what she has to do. She has to
really stay engaged and make it difficult.  
  
Morgan William is going to make shots, she's going to make plays. It is how
she's making those plays. If we can decrease the amount of times that those
plays are easy plays, I think it works in our favor. But if she's in a groove
and she's playing as she's played over the past five games, it's going to be a
long night for us.  
  
Q. In Columbia, you really praised Kaela's efforts defensively, even
though they didn't have a great offensive game. She did a good job on
(Victoria) Vivians. With Allisha, with (Doniyah) Cliney, with Kaela, it seems
like you have a lot of good matchups. How do you like your matchups in terms
of trying to make things difficult for not only Victoria or Morgan, but
several of their position players?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, we feel good about our matchups. I think, you know, what
you have to kind of plan for, and you don't want to plan for, but you do, is
foul trouble. If A'ja Wilson gets herself in a little foul trouble, that
hurts. But we've been there before, but not against a team as big as
Mississippi State. We've got to find a way to keep A'ja on the floor.  
  
Everybody else I think puts us in a position, you know, to match up fairly
well. It's when you take A'ja Wilson out of the equation, you're left with a
freshman post player with Kiki Harrigan. That's probably too big of a stage
for us to rely on her to play heavy minutes. But everybody else, I think we
got enough to match up fairly well with them.  
  
Q. You've watched Teaira McGowan the last two years. Talk about what
you've seen in the progression of her game.  
COACH STALEY: I actually had the opportunity to work with her with USA
Basketball. She was on our U-18 team. To see her three years ago versus today,
and every time I see her, I marvel. I tell her she looks great. She's playing
well. I mean, they've done a tremendous job just from her physique. She's
strong mentally. She's playing with a high level of confidence. She's becoming
somewhat of a go-to player down there in the paint. She's delivering for them.  
  
I'm very happy. I'm very happy that she's taken a lot more seriously, because
she'll have a long, fruitful career playing basketball.  
  
Q. When you got to Temple, as much as you talked about South Carolina,
it was actually instant success, which was a big story for someone who never
coached with a program that hadn't won in a decade. Took a little longer at
South Carolina. Do you remember at one point a couple of things happened that
you looked at each other and said, We're on the way?  
COACH STALEY: Well, probably during the Candice Dupree era, after her freshman
year.  
  
You mean at South Carolina?  
  
Q. South Carolina.  
COACH STALEY: At South Carolina.  
  
Hmm, I would say when we signed Aleighsa Welch is when things seemed to take
off, not just from a basketball perspective, but just from a chemistry. It
felt more like family. It felt like our culture was taking place, which would
allow us to bring in better players, better character kids.  
  
Once we got good kids in there that loved basketball, the sky was the limit.
It's opened up, you know, so many options for us to do a lot of different
things. Kids that believed in our vision. We finally got the majority of our
players believing in our vision.  
  
As any coach would tell you, you're going to be whoever the majority of your
team is. If the majority of your team is negative, you have a negative team.
If the majority of your team is positive and believes in your vision, that's
who you're going to be.  
  
I think once Aleighsa Welch got to us, the majority of our team was believing
in what our coaching was instilling in them.  
  
Q. Dawn, did Vic respond to your text? Have you had any interaction
since last night? To expand a little bit on what you said before about
Tennessee and UConn's dominance, how good is it for the sport two new teams
making the Final Four, and this year two teams playing for a national
championship who never won before? Someone will be a champion for the first
time tomorrow night.  
COACH STALEY: Vic did respond. He was up quite early today, so he responded
pretty early (smiling). He did respond.  
  
Then as far as looking back over the year, I think sometimes we lose sight of
how good women's basketball is because of UConn's dominance. But you're slowly
seeing it by having two new teams in the Final Four this year. There's going
to be a new first-time national champion winner tomorrow night.  
  
You're slowly seeing, you know, how good women's basketball is. It takes
probably UConn losing for you to really appreciate what's taken place over the
past few years. I'm hoping that it continues, and people can really see the
layers that are beneath what UConn has been able to do over the past decade.  
  
Q. How special is it to you to be one of two teams representing your
university this weekend, then one of three teams representing the
conference?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, it feels great. It feels great. This is what we've
worked so hard for. This is what we envisioned for our program. I can probably
speak for our commissioner, Commissioner Sankey, saying this is what he
envisioned for the SEC, for us to be playing on the third weekend in the NCAA
tournament, for our conference, which I think is known as a football
conference.  
  
We're raising eyebrows as far as putting basketball in that same conversation.
I mean, the SEC gives us an incredible platform, from a television standpoint,
from just our institutions, they're so supportive. We want all of our sports
to be successful. They give us a platform to do that.  
  
We're not surprised by us being here. Probably the rest of the country's
probably a little surprised by what's taken place by SEC teams.  
  
Q. What do you think the difference was in the first two matchups? How
hard will it be to win a third time?  
COACH STALEY: You know, the biggest difference is the margin of error was
small. The games could have gone either way. I mean, it took us making plays
at the end. We just made one or two more plays than they did in the fourth
quarter of both games.  
  
Is it hard to play somebody three times? It is. But for how the games played
out, that could have gone either way, I mean, it's so close. You can't use
that as bragging rights. And you're playing for a national championship.
You've got to throw all of that out the door.  
  
They're not looking at the SEC tournament championship game. They're not
looking at the regular-season game that we played. They're looking at how we
are. We're a little bit different than what we were six games ago. They're a
lot different to me as far as scoring the basketball. They're scoring the
basketball at a high rate.  
  
I think Vic's going to be who he's going to be from a defensive standpoint, so
we know that part of it. It's going to come down to us, either one of us,
sustaining runs and making plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Dawn, I know you probably burned a bunch of cell phone batteries out
of your many followers on Twitter last night. I know she checked in after you
got the Olympic job. Did you hear from the UN ambassador (Nikki Haley) in the
last 24 hours?  
COACH STALEY: No, I haven't heard from her yet. I hope she doesn't because I
don't want her to jinx us (laughter).  
  
Q. Do you have pregame rituals? If so, what are they? Do you have a
pregame routine?  
COACH STALEY: Pregame routine on the road, I don't really nap, but I do just
kind of lie still and watch TV, especially if my nerves are bad. But other
than that, not really. I don't have a pregame ritual.  
  
Actually, I do my hair. I try to do my hair. That's a ritual. I don't know how
that works out, though (smiling).  
  
Q. What has been your most difficult moment while coaching? How did you
go about overcoming it? Then how have you used this to teach your players
about overcoming challenges?  
COACH STALEY: Wow, the most difficult?  
  
You know, I always try to look at things positively, even when there's a
storm. When I was at South Carolina, we dealt with some transfers. You know,
you look at the amount of work you put into recruiting someone, when you don't
feel like they trust the process enough and give you a chance to show them
that, you know, this is the right place for them, that can seem like some
difficulty.  
  
But, again, just like when you're dealing with adversity, you can't allow your
other players to know how it's really affecting you. You have to turn the page
and keep moving forward.  
  
That's probably what we've done time and time again, like we're dealing with
an injury to one of our best players in the history of our program. We didn't
allow our players to see it other than it being a positive and us moving
forward, no matter how hard it was for us to kind of hurdle that, while also
being sympathetic to our injured player.  
  
So, you know, you have to turn the page. You have to stay strong for your
team. Your team will follow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2017

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by head Coach Vic Schaefer from Mississippi
State. We are going to jump right into questions.  
  
Q. Coach, how much sleep did you get? How much time did you actually
celebrate what you accomplished, knowing you have another big one another
night?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, the sleep factor, I think I walked out of the film room
at 3:21. My staff was still in there. Was up at 5:30 doing Good Morning
America. Why, I don't know who watches Good Morning America at 5:30 on
Saturday morning, but I did it.  
  
Went back to the room, started watching more film, fell asleep. We've been
rolling ever since.  
  
The celebration factor, I've addressed this a couple of times with some
different people. I had to go in the locker room and throw water on my kids.
They're really grounded. They've been that way all year. We've had obviously
some really big wins this year.  
  
Last night, I mean, they're just, Okay, Coach, who is next? When do we play?
Where? What time is the bus leaving?  
  
That's the way they've approached it all year long. They have a real good
understanding of there's another one down the line that's even bigger. It's
hard to say that knowing that you just beat Connecticut, and their streak. But
there is another game that's bigger than that one that gives you a chance to
win a national championship.  
  
We talked about, when we started this back in September, there were seven
championships on our schedule. We won four of 'em. We've lost out on two, the
regular season SEC Championship and the conference tournament championship. We
were involved in both of them within a week. Now we've got a chance at the
national championship, so...  
  
Our kids have been really good, really grounded, for all year really.  
  
Q. What offensive performance do you look forward to that you need to
get from Mississippi State and also South Carolina?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Offensively?  
  
Q. Offense and defense.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously they attack you with so much aggression. They
play the way we like to play. They're playing that lineup right now that's
really fast, aggressive. They go off the bounce. They play around A'ja
(Wilson), who you just can't get a butt on her. She's so good. In my opinion,
she's the best player in the country. I mean, I've had to deal with her now
for three years. I ought to know.  
  
Dawn has put those kids obviously in some great positions to be successful.
They play really hard defensively. That's the thing people don't give them
credit for, or they should get more credit for, is, man, they guard your tail.
When we walked out of the gym three weeks ago, four weeks ago, scored four
points in the fourth quarter, that will humble you in a hurry. That kind of
led to some of the things we did differently.  
  
They really, really play you extremely tough. They're physical. I mean, they
play the way that we do. If we'll play the way we typically play, we'll have a
chance in the ballgame.  
  
But we're going to have to play really hard, we're going to have to be
physical, aggressive. We have to try to take away some of those things that
they're doing really well right now.  
  
Q. Vic, on Morgan William. If you look back at the lists of recruits,
she was the 25th-ranked point guard, not just overall, but point guard in her
class. How much of that reflects the player she was at that time, how much
she's grown? Specifically to that growth, how much does her size mean that she
had to figure out how to make shots, like the one she made last night, by
finding ways to get the ball in creative ways over bigger defenders?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, I've tried all my career not to get too caught
up in numbers on kids. That's somebody's opinion.  
  
Now, you can't make a living on two stars, so to speak, so you've got to make
sure if you take somebody, like a Dominique (Dillingham) maybe that wasn't
highly recruited. But there was no doubt in my mind Dominique was exactly what
I needed. We had nobody. We didn't have any toughness, we had no competitive
spirit with that team. We had to recruit it. Her and Savannah Carter, who was
a junior college player, didn't recruit them for their jump shot. I recruited
them for their toughness, for their physical nature, their competitive spirit.  
  
Morgan's the same way. Now, Morgan was a pretty good player in high school.
When we watched her play, boy, she covered ground. They played a zone press.
She would cover from one sideline to the other. Even at her size, she's long.  
  
Quick, foot speed quick, athleticism. There was no doubt in my mind. I've had
some small point guards in my career. I've seen some really good small point
guards in my career.  
  
I think when you've done it as long as I have, you get a feel for, you know,
kids remind you of kids, if that makes sense. When you watch kids play, you
get a good feeling. You have a confidence of, Hey, she reminds me of so-and-
so, a First Team All-SEC player, whoever. I think she's going to be good for
us.  
  
I got that with her. I had that comfort level with her, that she was going to
be really special. Number one, she's quick, quick, quick. I got two of the
fastest kids I've ever coached in my life. Her and Jazzmun Holmes are two of
the fastest kids straight line I've ever coached.  
  
Q. Who are some other players who come to mind?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Aqua Franklin played for me and Texas A&M, a four-year
starter. Reminds me of a point guard that was at LSU a while back. Her name
escapes me. She won championships and was really good.  
  
The toughness factor, the Sydney Carters that we've had over the years. She
just gives you that comfort level that those kids gave you. You feel like,
Hey, she's going to be fine. I never once second guessed or even thought twice
about not taking her.  
  
Q. Temeka Johnson?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Temeka Johnson was who I was thinking of. Obviously Erica
White is a good one, too.  
  
Q. You mentioned the SEC tournament game against South Carolina, four
points. What sticks out in your mind? Up until that point, you had the
momentum. What went wrong? What do you try to correct for tomorrow's game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think you give Dawn a lot of credit. She changed up
some defenses, went to zone. We didn't handle it real well. They made some
changes defensively on how they were guarding Morgan.  
  
When you only score four points, you're not going to beat anybody in March
having a four-point quarter. And we did. Offensively we didn't make shots. We
didn't execute very well. They did.  
  
We just watched it 30 minutes ago, watched bits and pieces of that film.
There's some things on there that are glaring to us and our kids. Again, the
film doesn't lie. When you watch that, you see why we had the problems that we
had. So you've got to make those adjustments.  
  
When we got back home, that's some of the first things I addressed. We showed
the film of the fourth quarter, then we addressed those issues that we had
during the fourth quarter, which I'm not going to go into here. But you got to
address 'em and you got to correct 'em. That was part of some of the changes
that we had early on.  
  
The other piece was, we had to correct our physical mistakes in practice with
certain drills. We've done that, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sydney Carter. Back in 2011, I was here when you helped
topple another No. 1 team to go on to win. Do you have any of that in your
mind this time, being in American Airlines Center, taking on a No. 1 team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously I know what's happened here. That's six years
ago. Different team, whole different dynamic. But obviously I've had two real
special victories in that arena. Two special teams.  
  
That team last night, y'all, again, we can sit here and talk about it all day,
but the toughness, the competitive spirit that our kids played with last
night, we've seen it all year, numerous nights. Until you get to see it
firsthand, you really don't know my kids.  
  
They were just so tough, resilient. They talked last night about the game is
full of runs. We had a really big run early. That's what allows you to survive
Connecticut's runs.  
  
We built that lead early. Somebody told me we were up 16. I really didn't know
that. I was too busy worrying about defense, offense. Had no clue. Is that
correct?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, it allowed us to deal with their runs during the
course of the ballgame. Again, I don't think our kids ever once got rattled.
But we've been in those games before with the schedule we played.  
  
Certainly arena's been good to us. I'd love for it to be really kind to me one
more night.  
  
Q. With such a short turnaround, does it help you're playing a team
that's an SEC rival, you know the personnel? You don't have to say, This is
who the center is, who their guards are.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Personally I'd rather be playing somebody else, to be honest.
They know us better than anybody. Obviously we feel like we know them. But I'm
really proud that we have two Southeastern Conference schools in the
championship of our sport. That's really special.  
  
For me personally, I think that's what the NCAA tournament gives you, is you
finally are going to get to play somebody that isn't one of your 16 rivals. We
play 16 rival games, that's how I call it, in our league. I'd much rather be
playing somebody that might not know me quite as well.  
  
I think my staff does a tremendous job. They're very thorough in scouting. So
that's the piece that, if I had my pick, I'd rather probably be dealing with
somebody else. Fact of the matter is we've got to go against them.  
  
Again, we've got to fix some things that we've had some issues with them over
the course of two ballgames this year.  
  
Q. Vic, obviously you've seen a lot of A'ja Wilson. She's made her mark
in the SEC. In the two losses, she really kind of took over when she needed
to. What does she do so well that makes her so difficult to defend?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Number one, she's very active. She's physical. She's not going
to stop working. She's a constant worker. Just a competitor. She wants to be
in the moment. She wants the big shot.  
  
But if she doesn't take it, she's going to go clean it up. That's the thing we
tried to impress upon with our kids. They've got three or four kids now, when
the ball goes up, if you don't find 'em and put a butt in the gut, they're
going to go right by you and stick it in. They're going to get the rebound and
get the put-back.  
  
For us, we understand what's coming down the pike. We've had two doses of it
this year. We just watched film again. We'll watch some more this afternoon.
So we understand and respect South Carolina so much. Those kids that they
have... We've got to go out and try to fix some of our issues we've had with
them.  
  
A'ja Wilson, like I told you, because of her competitive spirit, because of
how hard she plays, just makes her even harder to deal with because she's got
a skill set to go with it. It is multi-dimensional.  
  
Q. How different is South Carolina playing without Alaina Coates? What
kind of different challenges do they present now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, they're fast. They're getting up and down the floor.
Cuevas, she may be faster, as fast as my two are. They're playing those
guards. Those kids are just in attack mode.  
  
They do a great job, for the most part, they can stretch you and shoot it.
They create a real interesting -- what it gives them is spacing on the floor
that maybe with Alaina they didn't have. That's the piece that you've got to
deal with, for us, is dealing with that spacing. When it's created, you got to
try to not give them as much room as they want, which is extremely difficult.
If you back off somebody, they'll knock down shots.  
  
I think for them, obviously Davis is just playing with so much confidence
right now. She hurt us when we played them in the second ballgame.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think the difference was in the first two games,
and how excited are you to get another chance at South Carolina for a national
championship?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'm excited to get a chance at anybody for a national
championship. Again, South Carolina certainly presents so many issues for us.  
  
What was the first part?  
  
Q. What did you think the difference was in the first two games?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, so, I mean, the first game we had with them at their
place, it's a knockdown, dragout, came down to one play. We talked about that
with our kids. It came down to one play in that ballgame. When you're playing
in those games, in those arenas, in those atmospheres, and we were playing in
front of 15,000 at their place, I walked out of the arena that night with a
lot of confidence in my kids.  
  
Certainly we were disappointed. We knew we missed a layup with 30 seconds left
to go up one. We had out-of-bounds plays. Blair had two open threes in the
corner that could have been difference makers. We all knew we could have made
plays during the course of the ballgame.  
  
That's what it came down. It came down to one play in that first game. You
walk out of there feeling, Okay, we're right there. They're picked to win our
league. We were picked second. Played them on the road. Came down to one play.
So I walk out of there with a lot of confidence.  
  
When I walked out of the arena on the second one, I was disappointed with
myself. When you score four points in the fourth quarter, and your offense
looks like it sets the game back 30 years, there's nobody to blame but myself.  
  
We went home and we went to work. We had a week and a half to get ready for
the NCAA tournament. That's what we did. That's what you do if you're a
competitor. I mean, I knew this team was capable of getting here. I told y'all
that before. I said it back in September. I know what a Final Four team and a
national championship team looks like. I've been a part of that. Fortunate
enough to do that.  
  
I told them that back in September. So my job was to fix what's broken. It's
never too late. I've been telling our kids that for a month now. It's not too
late to get better today. Let's get one play better. Let's get one play better
today. We talked about that now for a month.  
  
We got a chance to get one play better today. If we keep getting one play
better every day, we're going to be playing for the national championship. And
that's where we are.  
  
Q. You obviously mentioned the last game in the SEC tournament. Morgan
had seven turnovers, which is atypical for her. She's playing so well. What do
you want her not to try to do in terms of putting the team on her shoulders,
again, possibly with the size and length that presented such a challenge last
time?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think she's just got to continue to make good
decisions. She's playing well. She's got a lot of confidence right now. I
don't think I need to talk to her about what not to do. I think she's got a
good feel for that.  
  
She's a junior in class, but to me she's already had her junior year. She's
playing, you know, like a senior. She understands what her role is. She
understands the leadership piece, the responsibility piece. She's owning our
team right now, which is good.  
  
Again, the kid's playing with confidence. She wants to be in that moment. So
it's good to have kids like that. I got more than one right now, by the way.
Again, I think that's what allows you to be where you are today because you've
got a locker room full of kids that aren't afraid to take that shot.  
  
Q. In the big picture, if there were a lot of folks who have been
complaining, for lack of a better word, that it's always UConn, and they
wanted something new for the game, they're going to get something new
tomorrow. So help me make a case that they should be compelled to watch
tomorrow night, and maybe the most exciting moment didn't happen last night
but happens tomorrow.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Our game is so special. Again, here's the bottom line. UConn
ain't going away. They'll be back. They'll be back stronger than ever.  
  
I think that's the challenge for all of us, is we've got to -- if we're going
to have any success at this level, this stage, we've all got to continue to
elevate our game and our program.  
  
The fact of the matter is, the game is sold out tomorrow night. It's my
understanding tickets have gone up in price since the victory last night,
which I think speaks well for both schools. Both of us have tremendous
followings. We're both top seven in the country in attendance.  
  
I think it's exciting for our game. I think last night our arena was electric.
I mean, if you were in that arena or watching it on national TV, that was an
electric atmosphere for our student-athletes. What an unbelievable experience
for them and for anyone who loves our game.  
  
It's not up to one school to make that happen. I think that's what you're
seeing. So for us and South Carolina, you're going to see two teams that are
going to be extremely tough, physical, aggressive. They're going to represent
not only our conference but our game in such a positive manner.  
  
It should be a great game and fun to watch. Both of us play an exciting brand.
So I'm not sure I answered your question, but, again, I think we all need to
understand, like I said last night, I didn't have to play 'em best out of
five, best out of seven. I only had to play 'em once. It's why you play the
game. Our kids were special last night.  
  
But trust me, Connecticut's not going anywhere, you know. There will be
another streak started next year. They'll have a chance to run that streak for
a long time.  
  
I think what we did last night, it gives people hope. If you prepare, if your
student-athletes believe, on any given night anything can happen. That's the
beauty of sport.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Staley said she texted you last night. Did anyone else
that you were surprised reach out to you last night or today about what you
guys did last night? And it seemed last night was a huge Mississippi State
crowd.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, special.  
  
Q. When you played South Carolina the first two times, you were on their
home court in Greenville, which is also pro South Carolina. How much is having
your fans loud, supporting you tomorrow night going to help you guys?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Dawn did text me. I responded back to her probably I think
this morning after the Good Morning America that I'm not sure I was up saying
good morning, America, but I was in front of a camera.  
  
Again, was really thrilled for her, as well.  
  
Our fans are what make Mississippi State so special. I got to tell you, I've
been to a couple pretty big universities in my career. Our fan base is so
special. They love our kids. They're so excited right now. I can't even get
'em through the lobby to get 'em to a bus. I got to plan for a 30-minute walk
because it's stop, stop, picture, picture, autograph, autograph. I call my
team the people's team. When we win at home, we don't go to the locker room.
We go in the stands and hug mamas and kiss babies or hug babies and kiss
mamas. That's what we do. They just want to hug my kids. They want to give
them a dozen cookies. They want to tell them they love them.  
  
That's how we built our fan base. We're accessible, we're personable.  
  
The arena last night, special. That atmosphere for both teams, so special. How
proud I'm sure our Women's Basketball Coaches Association is and Miss Brown is
today. The atmosphere we created for the biggest stage in our championship.
I'm sure it's going to be that way tomorrow. I'm proud of my fans because they
were a big part of that.  
  
Today there's people driving in to be here for tomorrow. So it's an exciting
time, no question about it. I'm awfully proud to be the coach at Mississippi
State.  
  
Q. Vic, how do you identify when you're scouting, especially when you
were scouting her, that kind of sort of late-game confidence and swagger? When
did you maybe first notice she had that, I want the ball at the end of the
game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You're talking about recruiting, when you first start
recruiting her?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think in recruiting, my staff does such a great job. Johnnie
has been with me 10 years. Johnnie Harris knows exactly what our system is,
the kind of players that we need. She's been with me since day one.  
  
Since added Coach (Dionnah) Jackson(-Durrett) and Coach (Carly) Thibault, who
obviously know exactly and have learned our system and what we do. But Johnnie
has been with me. We've been together a long time. She does a tremendous job
in identifying kids that can play in our system.  
  
I think the meat of your question about her wanting the ball in those big
moments, I think that's something that's developed. Certainly Morgan was
confident when she came to us. She had 29 in her freshman year, you know, in
the NIT. I think with Morgan, she's learned to not only be this point guard,
who is really good in the open floor, but she's learned to run a team in the
halfcourt.  
  
In our league, and in this tournament, you win with halfcourt offense and
halfcourt defense at the end of the day. I think with Morgan, that's the piece
she's added to her game, is the halfcourt offensive piece.  
  
But I think her confidence has grown of late, no doubt about it. When you get
in a huddle and you're going against Baylor, the No. 1 seed, and she looks me
in the eye in a timeout and says, Coach, if I'm open, I'm going to shoot it.  
  
Hey, that's a good idea. You go ahead and turn it loose.  
  
But you want that kind of confidence in your huddle. The Jimmy Chitwood, Hey,
I'll say the shot, Coach.  
  
I have other kids that want to be in that moment. She is owning our team right
now, she's owning herself as the point guard and leader of our team. That's
what you want a point guard to do. I've seen her grow obviously throughout her
whole career. But I think right now her confidence is at an all-time high.  
  
Q. You talked in the days leading up to the game against Connecticut
about focusing on Mississippi State and not worrying about the name on the
opponent's jersey. Is there a similar train of thought against South Carolina,
given the recent history in the series? You've been close. You've had a lot of
momentum in games. There have been periods like in the fourth quarter of the
SEC tournament where things have kind of gone south. Can you follow the same
train of thinking, Don't look at South Carolina, just focus on us?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, probably a little bit. I think because of our
familiarity with them. Our kids, they understand what's in front of us. They
understand the challenges that we've had. They understand the things we've got
to adapt and fix.  
  
Again, we'll have a good practice today, good shootaround tomorrow, try to
address some of those.  
  
At the end of the day, you know, South Carolina's not going to change. They're
the same great team, coached by the same great coaching staff, and we're going
to have to adapt and change. I mean, you know what, we've talked about that in
our locker room numerous times, Hey, here is where we are. What were we when
we ended the regular season? Whatever we were. We said, Hey, if we're going to
get hot in the NCAA tournament, we're going to have to change. Some of y'all
are going to have to change. I think that's the beauty of this team, is they
changed.  
  
For the game on Sunday, we're going to have to change some things that we did
to try to adjust to the things they want to do. At the same time there's some
things we need to do better that we're really good at, that may have bothered
them a little bit. But we've got to do that even better.  
  
So it's not rocket science. It's not like we're having to invent some cure for
something that's incurable. But we're going to have to go out and execute.
That's the biggest thing right now. I think our kids have done that.  
  
Q. Considering your history against South Carolina and the fact this
team has overcome so many obstacles along the way, do you feel like this final
opportunity is the perfect sort of ending to the season for you guys?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we keep bringing up my history with South Carolina, so
apparently the fact that we've never beaten them is an issue today.  
  
You know, when you're playing in the national championship game, what better
way to finish off your season. That's where we are right now. These kids
deserve it. They've paid such a tremendous price. We practice harder than
anybody in the country, I'm quite confident. My kids are tough. They have such
an incredible competitive spirit. They've earned the right to be here. We've
come through an incredibly tough region. We've played a grueling schedule all
year long. They've earned the right to be here.  
  
I couldn't be prouder of 'em, I couldn't be more happy for 'em. I know the
sacrifices that they've made. But again, until you know what's inside their
breastplate, know the heart, the size of their heart, you just -- my
confidence in them is a whole lot different obviously than the confidence of
the media. That's fine. It's fine.  
  
But I know what I've got in my locker room. I know what I have on the staff.
It's really, really special. For these kids to be in this game in this moment,
it's really appropriate, in my opinion.  
  
Again, it's like the saying in our locker room, It's not what we do but how we
do it that separates us from the rest of the country. Everything that that
entails, there's not a lot of teams that do that. I think that's one of the
reasons why we're here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, UConn - 64, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer, then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously that was one heck of a great basketball game,
overtime game. Two great teams.  
  
Obviously I'm extremely proud of my group. What an unbelievable, gutsy
performance that no one in the country, including all of y'all, probably
thought could happen. And that's okay.  
  
But we knew it could happen. You see, you have to be careful when you start
talking about people that you really don't know about. If all you're doing is
evaluating what you see on TV, and you don't really know what's inside
somebody's breastplate, you better be careful about evaluating them.  
  
That's what these kids have. They have tremendous heart. They also have a
little pride. We had our pride stepped on last year by another great team,
just like that one today. We didn't play well. They played really well. We got
our tail handed to us.  
  
Because of that, these three right here, and the rest of their teammates,
they've kind of been on a little bit of a mission. They have tremendous pride.
They have tremendous heart. They're fighters.  
  
They have such a competitive spirit. Again, unless you know them, you wouldn't
know that. I know 'em. We believed in our locker room it could be done. A year
ago, I'm showing the Miracle, hoping for it. This year I wasn't showing the
Miracle. We weren't watching any movies. I wasn't talking about the Philistine
slaying the giant, although it was in the back of my mind.  
  
This was about two basketball teams, two great teams, competitors, tough,
physical, aggressive basketball teams. We beat the greatest team, with the
greatest streak in the history of sports. You got to give them a lot of
credit. We didn't have to play them the best out of seven. Didn't have to play
the best out of five. We just had to beat them one time, just beat them one
time.  
  
When you have these young ladies and their teammates, they can go through what
we went through for three days preparing, put that together. Again, it helps
to have a veteran team, four seniors, four juniors. Helps to have that. But it
also helps to have kids that have that competitive spirit.  
  
These kids were incredible tonight. It's never easy for us, y'all. It wasn't
easy tonight. There's always something. Always something that comes up that
makes it more difficult for these kids. But they always find a way.  
  
In that moment, they were ready for the moment. Morgan had 41 against Baylor.
Ain't any shots bigger than the one she hit tonight. But that's the shot we
wanted. That's who we wanted taking it. At the end of the day, you got to want
to be in that moment. Our kids want to be in that moment.  
  
That's what I knew about 'em. That's what our staff knew about 'em. They
prepared them and did a great job. That's why they won the game tonight.  
  
Make no mistake, we beat a heck of a basketball team, the greatest of all
time, with the best coach of all time. We're very proud of that. We're
honored, we're giving God the glory for number 34.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, take us through that last sequence.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Well, Coach called the timeout. He was like, Morgan, you can
win the game. That's what he say. Morgan, you can run this play. It wasn't
originally for me, but the way they had guarded, I told Dom (Dillingham) to
get the ball and take it down the court. Time was just ticking. I knew the
last -- end of regulation, I went for a layup, they blocked it. I was like,
She probably think I'm going to do it again. I got in the space, I jumped up,
I made the shot.  
  
When I made the shot, I was in shock. I'm still in shock. I'm over here like,
Hey, I just won the game. My teammates are just so happy and proud of me. I
can't thank them enough because I can't be playing the way I'm playing without
them.  
  
He said, You about to win the game. We want the ball in you are hands. Just in
case the foul, free throw-wise, or just get a bucket.  
  
Q. Morgan, when did you know that you could win this game?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Film. Days, I mean. We had to redeem ourselves from last year,
of course. I mean, just watching film, our coaches just preparing us, tell us
what we can do, have so much confidence in us that we can go out there and win
this game. We believed them. We just went out there and fought. It was a good
outcome.  
  
Q. Did the play intend to go as deep into the clock as it did, Morgan?
Did you put a little bit extra arc on it to get it over Saniya's hands?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I think it was on Gabby.  
  
But I just shot the ball (laughter). I know Coach said one shot. I didn't want
to give them too much time to go shoot the ball, end up going to a second
overtime. Just happened to be perfect timing.  
  
Q. A couple of your teammates sitting up there with you. The spin move.
Fans went crazy. Then your post player, seemed like you were just saddling
(Teaira) McCowan, and McCowan was able to get the ball off the deflection. She
gets a steal and goes down the court. Talk about your other teammates that
aren't here and what they done tonight.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: The whole team contributed. When T got that steal, went
halfcourt, I mean, I really thought she was going to dunk it. I was, Dunk it,
dunk it, dunk it. She ended up fouling.  
  
We did a good job turning them over. Coach wrote on the game, pregame, like
they play -- I mean, they play pretty ball, and they had 25 assists per game.
We had to limit that and guard, deny the ball. That's what our five players
did. They denied the ball. They only had 11 assists. Played out good.  
  
Q. Bre and Victoria, you had foul trouble early on in the game. What was
your plan for the game? How did you try to change the dynamic but keep the
same place for Mississippi State?  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: I guess with us, we kind of knew going in we had to impose
our will, as coach said. He said even if we get a couple early fouls, make 'em
count.  
  
After that, we just had to play smart. We started to play our style of
defense. We can't really think about fouls, just got to play smart in those
situations.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Feeding off of what Bre said, we have to play smart. Don't
take no plays off. If you got to make a foul at the end, make it, knowing
you're giving it your all and knowing your teammate has your back when you get
up.  
  
Q. Morgan and Victoria, is it different weathering UConn runs when
you're ahead? Did it feel different? Was it easier for you guys to get
composure, to get back to what you needed to be doing because you were up 16,
up 8, when UConn was making runs against you guys?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, see, we got up by 16 in the second quarter. Feel like we
got stagnant when they started going zone, we started standing around,
throwing up threes. I mean, we weren't attacking like we were in the
beginning. I feel like that's when they made their run.  
  
We finally adjusted, started attacking, getting inside. Each possession
matters in big games like this. When you get a shot, each possession -- that's
what Coach says. We need turnovers, we need good shots, get inside, stuff like
that. That's what we focused on.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Going off what Morgan said, yeah, the game is full of runs.
Either you going to make a run right after them. I feel like being ahead at
the beginning, kind of keeping a lead, takes off a lot of pressure. Helps us
to build our confidence and execute on defense.  
  
Q. For all three players. What kind of statement did you think you made
about Mississippi State basketball?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Like Coach said, it was personal. We got beat by 60 last
year. We had to prove that we're a way better team than we was last year.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: Same thing. Coach said this morning, his mindset said it
was personal. He told us to take the same mindset coming in. We knew if we
played our game, our style, you never what the outcome was going to be. We
knew if we played hard, played our game, we'd come out with the win, and we
did.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like we earned respect tonight. You know, people didn't
believe in us. But it didn't faze us. We just had to go out there and play. I
feel like it showed we're better than what everybody thinks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions now for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. You win this historic game, but there's still a final to play in two
days. What is your approach now with this team? How do you get them sort of
back to the place where there's one more mountain to climb?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, this team's been really good about onto the next
one. You walk in our locker room, there's not a lot of jumping around. I mean,
we jumped around on the court. When we got in the locker room, I mean, heck, I
had to throw water on 'em. They're just really grounded. They're always, Who
is next, Coach? What time is the bus leaving? Where are we leaving from?
That's kind of the way it's been all year.  
  
I don't think I'll have to ground them too much. It's late. It's midnight. I
got to feed 'em. My kids like to sleep. So I got to get 'em to bed and let
'em, you know, rejuvenate a little bit.  
  
But, you know, they know that. We talked about it in the locker room, that
there is one more. It's funny, last year I'm showing the Miracle, this year
now I'm having to live it, 'cause there's one more game.  
  
So for us, we'll have to come back tomorrow. The thing is, we're playing a
team, they're so familiar to us and we're so familiar to them. That's the
beauty of the NCAA tournament for us, is we finally get away from our league,
and it's not quite as difficult. But here we go. We're going into round three
with South Carolina. We've had two knockdown, dragouts with them. Dawn
(Staley) has obviously done a tremendous job. It's a great team.  
  
But, you know what, it won't be hard for me to get their attention, so...  
  
Q. Vic, by halftime they had only gotten 18 shots up. Obviously they had
few assists. Can you talk about your defensive strategy for tonight.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we got 21 more shots for the game, we forced 17
turnovers, and they're averaging 25 assists, and they only had 11. Our
strategy was, you can't let them do what they want to do. Bottom line.  
  
Again, there's not a lot of teams across the country that play that way.
There's just not. There's not a lot of teams that are out there doing what we
do defensively, trying to push you out, guard, all that. I mean, it's just the
way it is.  
  
But that's how we play. I had two different plans. I asked the girls, I said,
What do y'all want to do? I'm behind you. Whatever y'all think, we'll do it.
But I got two plans, you tell me what you want.  
  
Coach, we want to go get 'em.  
  
Okay, we're going to go get 'em, then all of us have to go get 'em. It's not
four and there's a fifth for pressure release. That's what we call it if one
doesn't do their job.  
  
You saw my big five player come over the top and get a couple hands on a
couple balls and steals, deflections.  
  
Again, when you've got a team that shares the ball so well, I mean, man, they
are a machine offensively. If you don't put something in the sprocket to jam
it up, it just keeps rolling. So you've got to do some things to make them do
some things that he don't want to do.  
  
That plays kind of into what we do. We just had to do it tonight. Our kids
were special tonight on that end, no question about it, forcing 17 turnovers,
21 more shots. That's probably the two stats of the game.  
  
Q. With the attitude of trying to take it personal, you came out and
built that 16-point lead. How did you get them to regroup and take the
punches, and punch back, not get caught up in what was across the opponent's
jersey, fall prey to that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Our kids, we know the game is full of streaks. It was good we
had a streak that got us up that big. That's hard to do against a great team.  
  
You know you do that, it ain't like you think you're going to get up that
many, then you're going to get 16 more and have them down 32. That ain't going
to happen. Those kids on the other end know how to play a little bit.  
  
We knew they were going to make a run. So what you got to do is try to
minimize that run. You go in at half up eight. I'm sure everybody across the
country went, That's nice, the little team played really good. Second half
they'll come out and kick their ass. Excuse me, kick their butt. Sorry. My
apologies. Don't print that, by the way.  
  
But again, our kids have so much pride. I mean, you see our fan base out there
tonight? Special. That's what's been so special about building that program
and about these kids. Those people love my kids. They willed them to victory
tonight. They were not going to let them lose. Our kids weren't going to lose.
It didn't matter what happened, whatever jumped up in front of us. Our kids
have seen it all year long. They found a way to get it done.  
  
I just think, again, you go through the 16 rival games we go through in the
SEC, it gets you ready for the moment. We've had back-to-back nightmare games
against two really good teams. It's not anything we're not used to.  
  
Q. Vic, when did you know that this team was ready for this?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't know. This team's always been difficult to read. I've
gone in the press room all year and opened up with, Man, I didn't see that
coming. We won by 24, 26, 28 in the SEC, which is hard to do. Just like Coach
Auriemma has done with his group.  
  
I'm not sure when it hit me. I just knew that if my kids would fight, I've
seen them in that moment when they're so competitive, their competitive spirit
absolutely will not be denied. I knew if I could bottle that up tonight in
them, we'd be okay, we'd be fine.  
  
But, you know, the moment last year was such a nightmare. It's in the back of
your mind. But I told them before the game, Who's responsible for fear? Who's
responsible for fear? If you've got fear in your heart, you got fear in your
mind, who is putting it there? What entity puts it there?  
  
We talked about it. At the end of the day we're not going to let that entity
put fear in our heart and in our mind. It's basketball. Let's go play. Lay it
on the line. Make it a dogfight.  
  
Q. Vic, what the heck happened there with 12 seconds left with the call?
The fact is that your guys could have said, Hey, what's happening here? But
you made the defensive play to set up the game-winning shot.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, I'm not sure. I really don't know. I probably need to
stay away from that. I mean, I haven't seen it. I don't have any idea.  
  
Again, you know what, that probably got in our kids, and they're like, Okay,
fine. We'll do it. We'll do it this way. Because we've done it this way all
year. Nothing's been easy for us.  
  
When that happened, we just -- once the coach kind of calmed down a little
bit, we got 'em back together, I said, Hey, fine. This is right up our alley,
ending the game on a defensive stop. Let's go make a stop. We did.  
  
Then when you make that stop, now there's 12 seconds on the clock, hey, that's
plenty of time. I don't like the advance rule. I like to bring it up. I like
people backpedaling. That's the way I like it done.  
  
Q. All season UConn has gotten the ball to Gabby Williams in the high
post. You put your 6'7 " kid in there. How important was it to disrupt her,
feed it inside, to their shooters?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That's a hard decision to make, too. Boy, it's probably not
one that people saw coming. I think if you're going to beat them, just like we
had to do the other night, we have to do some things that maybe they're not
quite prepared for.  
  
I thought that was a big matchup.  
  
Here is the thing about Teaira. Teaira, if you give her some challenge that
you tell her, You're probably not going -- it may be a big challenge, you may
not be able to do it. I'm going to give you a chance. If you can't, I'm going
to have to put somebody else.  
  
She embraces that moment. I was proud of her. Again, you're putting length up
there. 6'7". She got drove on a couple times. We knew there'd be some
heartache with that. We also knew that might be the best thing in the long run
to help us put a kink in the sprocket, so to speak.  
  
Q. A few days ago in your teleconference, you were saying how you used
to, when you were coaching teams, order off the left side of the menu, doing
everything to scrap by. Here you are beating UConn. What is it like to go
through the tough times, triumph, overcome? What is it doing for you?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That was a long time ago, '90 to '97. I've since been at the
University of Arkansas, Texas A&M, won a national championship there. But, you
know, when you grow up in these humble beginnings, it really keeps you
grounded. It makes you appreciate what you have.  
  
I know that for me personally, coaching today, year 32, I've got the greatest
job in the world. I get to wake up every morning and coach women's basketball
with some great kids and with an unbelievable staff. What a blessing.  
  
I mean, I couldn't ask for any more. So it's easy for me, knowing where I
started, to remember those humble beginnings and to appreciate them. I try to
share some of those stories with our kids. I mean, it was a bus league.  
  
But, you know, those were special times. I miss being on a bus with my kids,
watching a movie, talking, showing, hey, come up here, we'll watch film.
That's a bonding time that's really special at that level that you don't get
at this level. We roll out, get on a charter, fly, get off, go eat. I mean,
there's no time.  
  
That's what I really miss. Not that I want to go back to that. But that's a
piece of that era that I do miss. So it is special. But I wouldn't trade it. I
would not trade it for anything, absolutely not.  
  
Q. The one thing I noticed when I look at the rosters, you're the only
team here that does not have one McDonald's All-American. How did you make it
work for yourself?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, it's a system. It's the way we play the game. It's
not that we haven't gone after 'em. But when you start a program that's coming
off of 14-16, you take it over, it sometimes is a little bit of a challenge
early. So you got to go get kids that you know can play in a system, do things
the way you want 'em done.  
  
I say this all the time. We talk about, Where is the next McDonald's All-
American? Where can we get 'em? I want to know where the next Dominique
Dillingham is coming from. She's just tough, physical, aggressive basketball
player. Doesn't say anything about her jump shot.  
  
That's the piece that for us -- you got to give my staff so much credit. They
are able to identify those kids that fit our system. Again, they do a great
job evaluating this. Skill set's important, no question about it. But we don't
sacrifice character for skill set.  
  
I have too much love and respect for my community, for my university, my
administration. That's one of the things we talk about when we're recruiting.
I promise moms and dads that I'm not going to bring their daughter in and put
them around a bunch of idiots. We got great kids. Hey, do they make a bad
decision every now and then? Sure. They make them at Yale and Harvard, too.  
  
The bottom line is they're great kids. They're committed. They want to win.
They pay a price every day. That's the piece that if you're on the outside
looking in, you just don't know that about our kids. That's what makes 'em the
warriors that they are. It allows them to be successful.  
  
So, hey, I'm not trading 'em for anything. We got four really special seniors.
I mean, they believed in a vision when it wasn't really easy to believe. I
signed 'em before we ever played a game that first year, which is probably
good, or I never would have got 'em.  
  
Again, Johnnie and I knew what 13-17 looked like that first year. We didn't
panic. We backed up that first class with a top-20 class, so here we are.  
  
Q. That felt kind of like a championship game. A lot of momentum going
along. How do you take that and carry it into Sunday and still use it
constructively?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, we've been beaten twice by South Carolina. Our kids, we
know what's coming down the pike. It won't take much to get their attention.
That's our job, my job as the coach. They know now the prize is in front of
them, it's attainable.  
  
We've got one heck of a team to get ready for, a tremendous staff. They're
really, really good. They've obviously changed their system a little bit
throughout the course of the season.  
  
But it's down to two of us. Southeastern Conference teams playing for the
national championship. Hey, that's pretty special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 62, Stanford - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Stanford.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer, then we'll take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: First, I'd like to congratulate Dawn and her South Carolina
Gamecocks. They worked really hard. They had a really aggressive second-half
plan, came out and really did a much better job in the second half.  
  
I mean, Dawn and her staff have done a great job. They have a terrific team.  
  
I'd also like to congratulate our team on a great season. I'm so proud of our
team, how hard we fought. We really struggled with the third quarter. For us,
with Karlie (Samuelson) not being 100 percent, that really hurt us a lot. We
really got out of sync and never really got it going in the third quarter.
That was disappointing for us.  
  
I'm exceedingly proud of our team, how hard they played. I thought Alanna
stepped up big. They battled in there. We will hold our heads up high leaving
Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, what was it like going through that third quarter, like
nothing would go in the basket?  
ERICA McCALL: It was rough, frustrating. But my teammates talked to each other
the whole time. I'm really proud about how we kept communicating. I mean, kept
shooting. Unfortunately they didn't go in.  
  
We battled back in the fourth quarter. Alanna hit big shots. I'm glad we
battled, even though shots didn't go in.  
  
Q. The first half your team did a great job, then things started
slipping away. Was it anything they were doing differently or that you were
doing differently? How do you account for them having such a strong third
quarter?  
ERICA McCALL: I think they got aggressive, started to read where our double
was coming from. She started attacking points. She's a good player. She read
the double well.  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk about Marta's (Sniezek) play in the first half.
She really looked to score. She was great distributing the ball. What did that
do for you guys?  
ERICA McCALL: Her pushing the ball gave us a lot of energy. She really locked
down some key layups for us. Got that big and-one for us. I was really proud
of how she performed. I look forward to her doing that all next season.  
  
Q. Alanna, there's been a lot of talk about the leadership of the three
seniors on this team. You have more years left at Stanford. What did you take
away from playing with them?  
ALANNA SMITH: Well, I think one thing that our seniors do really well for us
is stay really level-headed, even when we are down, which we have been at
points throughout our season. We stay really calm. It doesn't get to our
heads. Yeah, that's just a huge tribute to our seniors.  
  
Like you guys said, our shots weren't going in. But we weren't worried about
it. We continued encouraging each other. That came from our three seniors.
That really helped our whole team.  
  
Q. Alanna, off the bench in the first half, you led your team in
rebounding, which is astounding. Did you feel that you were moving at a
slightly higher gear than normal the first half? Everybody was moving so fast
up and down the court.  
ALANNA SMITH: I couldn't really tell, but I think that's one thing that we've
really been focusing on, is keeping our pace really high and pushing the ball
up the court. That's something that our point guards have been doing really
well, and our bigs do really well, as well, is run the floor.  
  
I think that worked really well for us in this game, yeah.  
  
Q. Erica, your coach talked about how proud she was of the team. As a
leader, any thoughts on how proud you are of what your team has accomplished
this season, given your start?  
ERICA McCALL: I'm so proud of my team. We've been through a lot, especially
this past pre-season. We worked our tails off to get here. I'm super proud of
how my senior teammates helped lead the team with me.  
  
I can go through one by one of how much I love my teammates. But ultimately we
worked our tails off. We got here for a reason. There's nothing to hang our
heads down about, as Tara said.  
  
Just proud of them, really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, what was it about this South Carolina team that was so tough
for you in the second half? Was it their shooting, the rebounding of (A'ja)
Wilson, the speed? What were the things that really cooked you in the second
half?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I think that our team got a little out of rhythm, even
at the end of the first half, when Karlie came out. We did not come out as
aggressive as we needed to be. I thought we were really short on a lot of
shots.  
  
I don't think we got to the free-throw line, what, twice, if that, in the
second half. We turned it over too much. We just never could get it. When we
had a nine-point lead, they got back right in.  
  
For us, honestly, we just really struggled without our glue out there, Karlie,
twisting her ankle. Really kind of gave us a tough time.  
  
For Karlie not to score... We need her scoring. I think it was a great effort
by Bird (McCall), a great effort by Alanna. Brit (McPhee) really struggled
offensively. Marta I thought did some really nice things in the first half. We
needed her to be a little bit more aggressive in the second half.  
  
But, you know, without Karlie, we really struggled.  
  
Q. Tara, curious how much you feel your defensive game plan went
according to plan. You held them to three threes. A'ja Wilson, most of her
shots were on put-backs. Did the defensive plan start with aggressively going
after those doubles and sometimes even sending a third after A'ja?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, it didn't look good when the first shot was a three by
(Tyasha) Harris. But, you know, I thought defensively, the first half, I mean,
they shot 14% in the second quarter. I thought our defense was okay.  
  
The problem was, we gave up second shots. (Allisha) Gray got in on the O
boards. They got too many O boards and they put them back or they called fouls
on the O boards. I don't think we've ever all year been 21-5 at the free-throw
line.  
  
I mean, we didn't rebound well enough. We had too many mistakes with the ball
in the first half especially, turning the ball over. Our turnovers, some of
the little traveling turnovers, were, I mean, unforced errors. We kind of shot
ourselves in the foot with that.  
  
We were out of sync. We really depend a lot on Karlie, Marta, Alanna. Without
her, we really struggled.  
  
Q. Having Karlie less than 100%, I assume considerably less than 100%
after the injury, is that as much of a psychological hit as it is what she
brings on the floor, her shooting, that kind of thing?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. I mean, she's really been the glue to our team the
whole year. She talks. She makes big shots. If someone had told me before the
game, She won't score, I'd say, We're in trouble.  
  
She scores for us. She defends. She takes charges. She couldn't move. We
tried. She wanted to play. We wanted her to play. One of the first
possessions, Gray really took it right at her. Then we went with Bri.
Psychologically and physically, it was a challenge.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about A'ja Wilson's impact on the defensive
end. Seems like she was altering a lot of shots down there.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yeah, I mean, she's an All-American. She's a terrific
player. She blocks shots or she changes them. What did she end up with? 19
rebounds? She's on that glass.  
  
She really, you know, came out in the second half. I think Dawn probably
challenged her, and she responded.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Thank you.

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
South Carolina - 62, Stanford - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes first, please.  
  
Q. A'ja, they were obviously very physical with you out there. How did
you remain physically tough but also mentally tough, as well?  
A'JA WILSON: Of course, it was very frustrating. It was very tough to remain
tough. But it was something I've seen before in the SEC. Playing in the SEC, I
see that kind of every night. It wasn't anything that I haven't seen. It was
just a matter of this time, it was kind of frustrating because I felt like I
wasn't really in the play offensively.  
  
I mean, I just kind of remained me. My teammates really rallied around me.
Kept positive thoughts into my mind. Coach Staley kept positive thoughts into
my mind. I think that kind of helped me overcome just kind of the way the game
was going for me.  
  
Q. A'ja, curious about two things. What did you see out of the double-
teams? What were you able to recognize? Seemed like you were able to make
decisions to help you get to the basket, especially in the second half. There
was a spot where a 50/50 ball came your way, you made it to the basket. Put
you up. That seemed to give you more flow over the remainder of the game. Was
that the case?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I think so. It's very tough when you have kind of three
people around you. You see that your teammate is open, but you really just
can't get it there the way that you want it. So, of course, it's frustrating.
I see it, and I just can't get there.  
  
I kind of let the game come to me, honestly. I try to get every loose ball
without fouling. I find a way for us to get the possession. If it was that
50/50 ball, so be it. I think that really kind of gave me the momentum to say,
Okay, we're going to be okay, just kind of push through.  
  
Q. Miss Gray, y'all only scored six points in the second quarter. What
did Coach Staley say to you guys to take over the lead midway through the
third?  
ALLISHA GRAY: Our energy was down, we just needed to play to our tempo, start
pushing tempo. Once we get that, we got on our run. We was able to go on our
13-0 run.  
  
Q. A'ja, when you're getting double and triple teamed like that, you're
having trouble getting a look at the basket, do you count on the defense and
the rebounding? You led the team in assists, as well. Do you look to do all
that other stuff, maybe just say, 'Okay, now the offense will come to you'?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, most definitely. I just kind of let the game come to me,
whatever category it is on the stat sheet. I want to make an impact on my team
any way I can. Tonight obviously was kind of rebounding. I could have shocked
myself with that (laughter).  
  
But it goes to show, you know, you got to find a different way in the game
that you can impact your team. I think rebounding kind of stuck out to me. I
just tried to get every ball that I could.  
  
Q. A'ja, yesterday you were kind of telling us about what you were
telling your teammates after your Final Four from two years ago. Given that
experience from two years ago, what does it mean to now get to a championship
game?  
A'JA WILSON: Oh, I can't even put into words the feeling that I have right
now. This is a very special team. I feel like we've earned this spot that
we're in now. We know that we're not done. But just the feeling of just making
history at your school is just something really special. Especially with the
game of women's basketball, we're kind of putting South Carolina on the map
right now. It's just a great feeling for us.  
  
I think we're blessed and we're really honored to be in this situation.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said she felt that Dawn probably challenged you to
come out and play better in the second half. You had 11 rebounds in the
second. Was that the case?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think she necessarily challenged us. I think that kind of
came from within. We knew we had to go out and get every possession. I know
Coach said in our huddle, we got to treat every possession like it's our last.
That's what you have to do at this time of the year. I think that's something
that we really kind of stuck to us. We knew we had to get the ball, earn our
possessions, keep our possessions. I think we did a pretty good job of doing
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, I think earlier one of the questions to one of the players, the
poor shooting in the first half. I guess the question is, 25 percent shooting,
did you feel fortunate to only be down nine points?  
COACH STALEY: First of all, I just want to say to God be the glory that we're
in this position, to play for a national championship. Something that is so
very hard to do. Sometimes when your kids play on this stage, they don't quite
come out and execute like they have in their minds, like we prepped.  
  
We knew exactly what Stanford was going to do to us. They were going to sag on
us. They want to force us to take some outside shots. They forced us to play
at a speed in which benefited them. When you're playing at that speed, you
don't have any fluidity to what you're doing on the offensive end. If you're
not creating it by pushing the ball down the floor, by changing speeds, you're
not going to make great shots. They're not even shots that you practice at the
speed that you practice at.  
  
So we were fortunate to be down nine. But I just wanted to get our kids to the
locker room at halftime because I knew, no matter how many points we were
down, we could utilize our speed to get back into play, whether that's
trapping in the halfcourt, whether that's picking up full court, whether
that's coming off ball screens, setting our players up in positions where they
could be effective.  
  
Timeouts weren't long enough to get our message across. We needed to get into
halftime, kind of exhale a little bit.  
  
Q. Dawn, obviously offensively there was a difficulty getting into a
rhythm. Seemed like defensively you were doing a lot of what you set out to
do, knocking them off the three-point line, making sure every shot was a tough
shot. Did you feel like the team, throughout this game, was performing to the
defensive expectations you had set?  
COACH STALEY: That is exactly why, you know, we built our reputation on
defense. You're going to have bad shooting nights at times. This was one of
them. If we didn't hold Stanford to 29 points, which is not bad, it's not bad.
I thought we did what we needed to do from a defensive standpoint.  
  
A lot of what they got from an offensive standpoint was because of our shots.
We had some imbalance on the offensive end. They created easy buckets for them
in transition.  
  
But then the second half, I thought we just imposed our will from a defensive
standpoint, sped the game up, and got playing at a pace which benefited our
style of play.  
  
Q. You have kind of a thing about bouncing back. You've done it
throughout the season. Next man up mentality. What is it about you guys that
gives you so much resilience? Do you think it will give you an edge in the
next game?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, we feel like we're always going to be in the game. For
the league we play in, the SEC, it is a tough league. We've been in familiar
situations. We don't fret it. We don't get down on ourselves. We just find a
way.  
  
Our team has an incredible focus on the end result. The stuff in between, it's
going to happen. Runs are going to happen. Bad shots are going to happen.
Turnovers are going to happen. But we hang our hats on being able to control
some of the tempo that happens out there.  
  
I think a good team can bounce back from any adverse situation in a game. I
thought our team has done that throughout the season.  
  
Q. Dawn, what was it like playing against a coach that you know so well?
Did that make any difference in the game, how you planned for the game? What
does it mean to you to beat Tara after having played for her so long ago and
being mentored by her?  
COACH STALEY: You know, I think leading up to the game, you think about all
the wonderful things that we've accomplished together. Also you think about
the things, you know, Tara, we text, we call, we talk to each other throughout
the season.  
  
She's been one of my biggest supporters since I've been in coaching. She's
what's right for women's basketball. She wants younger coaches to have success
in this league.  
  
I can't thank her enough. But then you start thinking about, you know, they
throw up statistics on the television screen, 0-5 coaching against her. You
think at some point the law of averages should play out at some point
(smiling).  
  
But once the game started, I didn't really look at it as Tara VanDerveer. We
tell our players, our opponents are nameless and faceless. We need to go out
there. Because if you start playing the name, you start playing the face, you
start playing the tradition, I think it overwhelms you.  
  
We just approach it like they're any other opponent. We don't get ahead of
ourselves.  
  
Q. A'ja talked about it was tough staying tough with everything that was
going on. What does it do for you guys when she's able to do that? She took
her game to a different level when she couldn't score the points she wanted
to, things like that.  
COACH STALEY: I mean, A'ja, she's come a long way as far as handling
physicality. We know that teams are going to, you know, wall up and smother
her. I didn't think she handled the double-teams and triple-teams well
tonight.  
  
But she found a way to impact the game other ways. Getting in there and
rebounding the basketball. If we don't have her contributions on the boards,
you know, we're not playing on Sunday night.  
  
But really proud of how she stuck in there, hung in there, not got down on
herself, because she found herself in familiar grounds, playing in the SEC,
seeing so many different looks like that. You tend to figure out, you know,
Maybe it's not my night from an offensive standpoint, let me go try to impact
it somewhere else.  
  
Q. With losing Alaina to that nagging ankle injury, how much is it an
initiative that A'ja Wilson has stepped up like she has?  
COACH STALEY: I think with A'ja, knowing she didn't have her partner in crime
for the remainder of the season, I think she kind of exhaled a little bit. She
figured out ways in which she can still impact the game.  
  
We've moved her around and allowed her to kind of control the paint. She's
taken the approach of, you know, keep it moving forward, let's do it for
Alaina (Coates). She's not able to help us out physically, so let's make sure
we give her every opportunity to get another ring, because Alaina Coates likes
rings. She wears all her rings all the time on every finger. We want to add
one more to the collection (smiling).  
  
Q. Coach, you seemed slightly sluggish in the last two minutes of the
second quarter. You regained the lead at about 3:25 and never looked back.
What do you think was the biggest difference? What adjustment did you make at
halftime?  
COACH STALEY: The biggest adjustment was speeding up the game. We couldn't
play at that pace, shoot the ball the way we were shooting the ball. We had to
figure out a way in which to create some easy buckets in transition. I thought
we pressured the ball when we came out of halftime.  
  
During the middle of the third quarter when they got settled in with how we
were playing, we went to a zone. I thought the zone bothered them a little
bit, forced them to take some outside shots, and they missed. They missed a
lot of shots in the third quarter that we capitalized on. That was all because
of the pace of the game changed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

## March 31, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, UConn - 64, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Connecticut.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from Coach Auriemma and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, you know, when you get to this point in the season,
and you lose, it's the worst feeling imaginable.  
  
The excitement that was in Mississippi State's locker room, we've been there.
We've been there lots of times. We've experienced that probably more times
than normal.  
  
Today, you know, they deserved to win. They beat us. We had our chances. I
mean, they beat us. They took us away from the things that we like to do. We
didn't have the kind of maturity that you need to win at this level at this
time of the year.  
  
Some of our young guys got a little bit ahead of themselves. That's okay. We
went in the locker room and we experienced some of the things that a bunch of
other kids have experienced against us.  
  
I'm proud of our team. I'm proud of our kids. They had an incredible run. But
we came up against a much better team tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kia, can you talk about the way the game started, and what you think
that did to you guys mentally.  
KIA NURSE: They started the game obviously with an intensity, and they came
out and they made a push fast. Kudos to them for that.  
  
I think for us personally, we had to get back to UConn basketball. Stay
engaged and stay together.  
  
Q. Gabby, can you talk about that final play defensively, what you guys
were trying to do, how it turned out.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I mean, we didn't want them to penetrate too deep, which they
did. We were trying to face guard a little bit and put some pressure on the
guards so they couldn't bring it up as fast. Just had some help defense. But
came up short.  
  
Q. For both players. Can you describe what this run has been like for
you guys over the last couple of years.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It's been incredible, and I'm really proud of what we've done,
especially this year, with kind of the gap that we've had to fill.  
  
I wouldn't want to be with anybody else right now. I wouldn't want to have any
other people as my teammates. I'm proud of what we've done.  
  
KIA NURSE: It's been quite a fun ride. It's been a challenge. I think we
handled it pretty well. It was something that we hadn't -- roles we hadn't
been in, circumstances we hadn't been in. Unfortunately, it came short.  
  
But the people that we did it with, the help that we got from the coaches,
that's irreplaceable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, could you elaborate a bit on the things they took away or
disrupted tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, normally we're a little more patient on offense. I think
we became a lot less patient. We started to try to make some individual plays.
We kind of got out of playing five-on-five, you know.  
  
It was very, very disjointed, that whole first half. There was no rhythm to
our game. We usually have a tremendous flow. We just never got one in that
first half especially.  
  
Obviously we got one in the second half. But the first half, you know, I can't
even say I'm surprised. I mean, it's something I've been talking about to the
guys that cover our team all year long. I've been talking about it all year.  
  
We're playing way above our years and way above our experience level. Tonight
it caught up to us. When we really needed to be a little more mature with what
we're doing, we didn't have it. A big part of that was because of what they
were doing.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the defense in that final sequence, trying to deny
either (Dominique) Dillingham or (Morgan) William penetration?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, we knew -- well, first of all, having the ball
with 12 seconds left was not Plan A. Obviously they had a little more time to
get something done.  
  
But the kid made a great play. I thought Saniya (Chong) did a pretty good job
defending her. We said if they're going to make a shot, it's got to be a pull-
up jump shot. Can't be a standstill, can't be a layup.  
  
That's one of the toughest shots to make from that distance under that kind of
pressure. So, you know, I always tell my team, one play doesn't cost you a
game. It almost never does. One play doesn't cost you a game. But a lot of
times, you know, one play will win you a game. That's exactly what she did.  
  
Q. Geno, you weren't surprised to see the kids struggle with their
composure late in the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Late in the game? Struggled with it in the beginning of the
game. I think a lot of it is, like Kia said, we kind of lived a charmed life
for a long time, for a whole five months. Pheesa (Collier) played like a
fifth-year senior, and today she struggled. (Katie) Lou (Samuelson) has been,
you know, incredibly consistent all year long. Today she struggled.  
  
You take that and put it together against a really good team in this
environment... I told them at halftime, It's a miracle we're only down eight.
We knew we were in good shape. We knew it was going to be only a matter of
five, six minutes before we got it back.  
  
But they were just better. They were just better. You know what? When stuff
like this happens, it kind of makes me shake my head and go, You know how many
times this could have happened and it didn't happen? The fact that it never
happened, that doesn't mean I went home thinking, It's never going to happen.
I knew this was coming at some point. I'm just shocked that it took this long
to get here.  
  
Q. Coach, could you take us through the flagrant foul call, what the
explanation was from the officials.  
COACH AURIEMMA: There was a sequence where somebody was going to the basket,
and Lou was cutting. There was a collision underneath the basket. Lou went
flying out-of-bounds. They looked at the monitor, and they said she got hit
with an elbow or a forearm in the face or something. By rules, they have to
call that. I don't know why they didn't call it when it happened. They were
standing right there. But that's what they said.  
  
Q. Geno, can you talk about the mettle that these kids had to win 111
straight games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they didn't. They won 36. It's a lot. They finished
36-1. That's their record. That's what they own. That's all theirs.  
  
I'm proud of what they've been able to do, how much they changed from last
October, you know. When we started October 15th to where we are today, as I
said, these kids were way older than they were supposed to be. They should
have shown their age early on in the season, November, December, at some
point. We just kept playing like older, older players, more mature players.  
  
I watched last year's Mississippi State game. The score at the end of the
first quarter was like 28 or something to 4. Stewy had I think 15 or 18 in the
first quarter, you know.  
  
These kids have never really been in situations like they were in today. You
know, just wasn't meant to be.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you said to the players when you realized you
were going to have two shots and the ball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's a kid trying to win the game. As I said earlier to a
question, we're impatient. Normally, you know, we go over that scenario a
thousand times. It's the easiest thing to do. Look at the clock. Every day in
practice we said, It's usually not going to be the shot you take that makes
it, it's going to be an offensive rebound. We always just want enough time for
that.  
  
Saniya just tried to make a great play. God bless her. There was a collision
and nothing happened. She's pretty good at drawing fouls. Just impatient a
little bit, that's all.  
  
Q. Geno, when Morgan William hit her game winner, you had a big smile on
your face. It was interesting to watch. Could you share what you were thinking
at that moment as the ball went down.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Kind of some of the things I've already said about how many
times that's happened going the other way, you know. Things happen for a
reason. I just kind of shook my head. This kid's had an incredible run.  
  
When it went in, it was almost like, Of course. Of course, it's going to go
in. She's had an amazing run so far.  
  
Look, nobody's won more than we've won. I understand losing, believe it or
not. We haven't lost in a while, but I understand it. I know how to appreciate
when other people win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Stanford.  
  
We will open with a comment from Coach VanDerveer, then we'll take questions
for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, we're very excited to be here. Our team has, I think,
had a great season, worked very hard. The reason I'm sitting up here today,
one of the main reasons is because of the three next to me, not just their
outstanding play, but their outstanding leadership and their commitment to
their teammates and to Stanford.  
  
I think the seniors, I'm really so proud of their senior year. I hope they are
also equally proud of it. It's just been a lot of fun working with them, and
to see their growth and development and improvement. We want to keep it going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, there was such a sort of joyous release when you won that
game, which was very tight and tense. How do you -- you switched gears to
being so excited to be here to be excited to stay here and keep playing?  
ERICA McCALL: I think it's like Tara said, we switch gears fast. Coming off
the win from Texas, we had to emotionally click the switch on and get ready
for Notre Dame. Got to celebrate for maybe one day afterwards.  
  
That game against Notre Dame is back behind us know. We're focused on South
Carolina, and I think we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Karlie, how does the experience of having played with your older
sister in the Final Four compare to now playing with a younger sister on
another team?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yeah, it's different 'cause she's on a different team this
time (smiling).  
  
It's just as fun. We got to hang out a little bit at the salute dinner last
night at the ranch. Yeah, it's definitely a different experience because we're
not working for the same thing, but we're both excited to be here.  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk a little bit about A'ja Wilson and the
challenges she presents. She's 6'5 ", dominating the paint, especially in the
tournament.  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, Wilson is a great player. Finishing really well down low.
I think it's going to be a big battle for us.  
  
I'm really excited for the matchup, though, one of the best players in the
nation, get to battle against her. I'm looking forward to that matchup.  
  
Definitely looking forward to the challenges, however, because she can finish
well down low. She finishes well with her left hand. So I'm definitely going
to need some help from my teammates, but I think we can take on the challenge.  
  
Q. Bri, I want you to travel back in time a little bit, OC Rhythm,
Carlos and all that. You saw the Samuelsons, you were all kids in that gym. Is
it weird? You have your roommate, you knew (Katie) Lou (Samuelson) on the
other side. Tell us what it was like back then.  
BRIANA ROBERSON: I mean, it was really fun. We had little nicknames for each
other. We worked out. We had OC Rhythm clinics. I don't know, I knew they were
special players even back then. Their work ethic getting to the clinics early,
all of us really. We all did have the same trainer growing up, Jason Wright.  
  
I knew through their work ethic, they were going to be special. It's not a
surprise that we're all here today.  
  
Q. Karlie, when you came to Stanford, the spot-up shot was a given, but
your offensive efficiency is basically throughout everything you do. I'm
curious how you trace that development of being able to score in every
conceivable way, and if you see any weakness in your offensive game?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I definitely see weaknesses. I think I'm best at my three-
point shot. I've definitely gotten better from my freshman year to now in
scoring different ways.  
  
But, yeah, there's obviously a lot I can work on. I am proud of where I've
come, but I think my teammates do a really good job of giving me the ball, the
place I like most, which is behind the three-point line.  
  
Q. Karlie, another question about Lou. Do you have any agreement on a
communications blackout at any point? Are you texting freely at the moment and
deciding at some point you will go in your respective corners if it comes to
that?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: We're texting freely, of course. We're talking. Obviously if
we both win, we're probably going to focus just on the game. Haven't thought
about that too much. Really just focusing on each other's games this Friday,
yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a time, I mean, the first six you were here every
year. It was almost taken for granted Stanford was going to be in the Final
Four, like UConn. Having a couple years when you didn't make it, does it make
you appreciate it more getting back here?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. It's never easy to get here. We're very fortunate to be
here this year. I think that, you know, women's basketball, there are -- when
we first went in 1990, I think there had been total of eight or nine teams
that had ever been to the Final Four. Obviously now there's a lot more.  
  
But it's harder. Sometimes you just need the right matchup, make a big play.
We're really excited to be back.  
  
It's not like we've been gone too long, though. I think we went for a stretch,
then we were off for about 11 years. This is better than that (smiling).  
  
Q. Would you characterize your relationship with Dawn when she was a
player for you on the '96 (Olympic) team, what your relationship has been with
her since.  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think I've always had a very good relationship with Dawn.
But, you know, sometimes as a player, you're going to tell 'em things they
don't want to hear. So, I mean, Dawn could probably tell you a couple stories
of things that maybe she didn't want to hear from me.  
  
I always have respected Dawn's competitiveness, her work ethic, her absolute
passion for the game of basketball.  
  
If she tells you she beat me in chess, she's a liar (smiling). We just
compete. I love Dawn. I'm so proud of her. Not surprised at all.  
  
I think she's just a great role model for the young women coming up. I mean,
she carried our country's flag. She's everything you could look for in a
coach, and a friend. It's just a great story. I just want her to keep it
going.  
  
I texted her 'congratulations' after the Florida State win. We had been in
communication because of her being, you know, announced as the national team
coach. I said, I have just one problem, I can't cheer for you on Friday night.  
  
Q. Coach, when the Cal men's job was open, a columnist in the Bay Area
wrote he thought you would be a good candidate. Not to get you to talk about
that in specifics. The NBA commissioner recently said he wants to have a
woman's coach in the NBA. What do you think it's going to take for a woman to
coach either a men's college team or perhaps coach an NBA team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think it will just take someone that has some vision like
maybe Gregg Popovich having Becky Hammon.  
  
It's just a matter of giving people opportunity. I just think there are really
qualified female coaches. I just think it's just a matter of time. The same
way we got maybe close to having a female president. It's just a matter of
time.  
  
Q. Tara, you've coached a lot of great players, whether it's Candice
Wiggins, Nneka (Ogwumike), Chiney (Ogwumike). It was pretty clear in important
moments who the ball was going to. When you have a group now that the points
are spread out, more of a collective, how has your coaching changed,
particularly in late-game situations?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I need more antacid (smiling).  
  
It's very challenging. You know, a lot of it is game-to-game. This has been a
great year for our team, and a great growth for our team, growth for me, to
really figure out this puzzle. As you pointed out in a nice way, it's a
challenge.  
  
We have to figure out during the game, and that might be why sometimes it
takes us a while to get going. This is what's available. This is what we're
looking for. Bri (Roberson) or Marta (Sniezek) or Alanna (Smith), it's not
always going to be the same person.  
  
There was a comfort, kind of a sense of comfort when Chiney was going to come
to the game and give you 25 points, 15 rebounds. There was a security in that.  
  
But at the same time there's a real excitement with this team, just to say,
Hey, we're going to have to make game-time adjustments. Their confidence and
their resilience has been really fun.  
  
But we do go kind of with the hot hand.  
  
Q. Tara, how do you assess A'ja Wilson at this point in her career, both
as an offensive and defensive player?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I mean, she's terrific. First of all, she's very athletic, a
skilled player. Can hit the outside shot. She scores low, runs the floor well.
The team, they get her the ball. She plays with some really good guards that
get her the ball.  
  
She's the proverbial load. You have to play really hard to play against her. I
know our team will battle her, but it's not going to be easy.  
  
Q. Tara, you were just talking about how many qualified female coaches
there are. Earlier today, Geno said maybe the number of female coaches
coaching women's teams right now has gone down because fewer women want to
coach. Do you agree with that? If not, what do you see as the reason why there
are maybe fewer female head coaches coaching women's teams right now?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I would say one thing. Women aren't recycled in the
way that men are. I've had this conversation today already a little bit. But,
you know, last year, as Tom knows, I was very close to Johnny Dawkins, who was
let go at Stanford. Great guy. Great guy. I went in the day he was let go. I
kind of embarrassed myself. I started crying in his office. He's consoling me.
'Hey, Tara, I didn't get it done.'  
  
I told my friend about it. My friend said, 'Don't worry, he'll get a job in a
week.'  
  
That does not happen with women coaches. There is a lot more competition for
women coaches. There are women out there. Maybe research has shown that women,
sometimes they need to check all the boxes before they take a job, whereas a
guy will check two or three. Okay, I can do that job.  
  
As an example, for me at Stanford, I was at Ohio State, I had a very good job
at Ohio State. Andy Geiger recruited me to Stanford. I said no the first time.
He said, 'Let me bring you back.'  
  
Maybe for women, you have to recruit women, you have to really support them a
different way. And women have different roles in their families with children,
things like that. If athletic directors want more women in women's basketball,
maybe they have to look in the mirror and say, 'All right, how can we make
this happen?'  
  
I think it's on their -- it's their plate basically. There are women. If you
want women in your jobs, you have to look to hire them. Keep the pipeline
going, too. You know, get more women in the pipeline.  
  
Q. Tara, on the offensive end, though you spread it around, Karlie is
your most efficient scorer, but she's least efficient in isolation. How do you
balance between getting the ball in her hands and being able to manage that,
making sure you're getting it off the catch? And defensively, I'm curious
whether you think there's an advantage to be able to play South Carolina, a
team that plays at a slower pace, when you have been a lot more effective
defensively in the halfcourt all season?  
COACH VanDERVEER: All right, so offensively. Karlie with the ball is all good
for me whenever she has it, wherever she has it. You know, maybe analytics say
something different. Eye test says to give her the ball, get her a shot.  
  
As far as playing South Carolina, honestly, we play whoever they put in our
bracket. We're here, we're excited. If it was Mississippi State or
Connecticut, you know, whoever it is, we're just going to do the best job we
can getting prepared for who we're playing.  
  
Sometimes in the tournament, like, people maybe overthink it or be careful
what you wish for. I've just kind of adopted the philosophy, like, just be
excited. I told our team, when the bracket comes out, I said, you know -- we
knew we were going, thank goodness, because we were the second to last team
announced, I said, 'Just pretend you won the lottery. No matter who you're
playing, where you're playing, that's our attitude all the way through it.' I
think we've kept it all the way through the tournament.  
  
Q. Tara, Karlie, the last couple of years without playing for the first
time in her life on a team without one of her sisters on and what you've seen
in her growth, being on her own in that way. The second question, a bit about
Dawn, what have you taught her that she might use against you tomorrow?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Karlie has grown as a player. What I've noticed is she put
more time into her game before practice, after practice. She's always the
first one out. She'll be first out there shooting. We get to practice, she
gets a hundred shots before anyone else gets out there. They're putting on
their shoes, fixing their hair, whatever.  
  
As far as what I taught Dawn, I hope she uses all those things that were bad
things that I did (smiling).  
  
I mean, Dawn is her own woman, her own coach. I just think if she learned
anything from me, great. I don't know that I could say what it was. I know
she's going to be really prepared and their team will play really hard.  
  
Q. Tara, this is a question that has been brought up for years, but I'm
curious to hear your response. Geno obviously gets it every time he's here.
When you have one team that is so dominant, it's all anybody can do to get
within 20 points of them, is that really good for women's college basketball
or not? What is your opinion?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I mean, I don't know. I don't think it's good and I don't
think it's bad. I mean, it's what's happening.  
  
Why should anyone be penalized for excellence? He does a great job, they get
great players. Is it bad for women's basketball because it's not spread
around? Maybe it brings more attention to it.  
  
I don't really have a judgment on it. I don't think it's either good or bad. I
think it's just what it is.  
  
Q. Tara, once upon a time in your navigation of a season, all the heavy
lifting was on the front end, and it was take care of business after January.
This year it was quite different. How much did the upgrade in the Pac-12 help
you?  
COACH VanDERVEER: All right. The PAC-10 and PAC-12 I think has always been
extremely competitive. I think it's alternate facts to think it was easy to go
through the PAC-10 all those years with Lisa Leslie, Tina Thompson, all those
great players, all right? I'm going to try to set the record straight.  
  
It's not easy now either, all right? But it was never easy.  
  
What has been the game changer in my mind has been Pac-12 Network, because now
people see these players. If we didn't have Pac-12 Network, maybe we didn't
get some of the better seeds that we've gotten, the same thing would happen
over and over.  
  
When people see a Kelsey Plum, Jordin Canada, Erica McCall, Karlie, they see
these players. It has never been Stanford and the 10 little dwarfs. It's
always been extremely competitive.  
  
Pac-12 Network has been a game changer and it's been awesome, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: It's great to be here. Thank you all very much.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Schaefer, then questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Good morning. Thank you for having us. We're glad to be here.
Really excited about our opportunity. Really proud of my team. We've had
really a special year at 33-4. Coming through the schedule that we've had, I
believe the comments made when the bracket came out was we were in the 'spicy
region', and anyone who come out of that region would be battle-tested and
ready.  
  
We came out of that region. I'm really proud of our kids, for their effort. It
took an extraordinary, obviously, effort to get out of that region, beginning
with the two games at our place, then going on to play in Washington, the
leading scorer in the history of the game, having to deal with Kelsey Plum,
that great team.  
  
Then beating a really good Baylor team, obviously, that was so talented, seven
McDonald's All-Americans. Obviously a team that was favored to get here.  
  
But our kids found a way. They have all year. It was a great basketball game.
Had to be fun to watch for anybody that was watching it. I understand it was
the most watched thing on ESPN that day. Again, awfully proud of our
resilience and toughness that day.  
  
It's been that way all year with this team. They've been great all year long,
in the moment. They've embraced those opportunities. We know we have a
tremendous challenge in front of us going against a team that's the best
program in the history of the game, coached by the best coach in the history
of the game, men or women.  
  
We know what's in front of us. We've had to deal with it before. Obviously we
dealt with it last year, and it wasn't a real good experience.  
  
But I think we've grown from that day; we've learned from it. We're going to
do our very best to play a really good ballgame tomorrow night.  
  
Again, these kids have earned the right to be here, make no mistake about it.
I'm just proud to be their coach. We're looking forward to an opportunity
tomorrow night in Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Victoria, whether it's in person or on film, what does UConn do
differently as opposed to any other opponent you've played?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: UConn is a very good team. They run the floor a lot. They
make smart plays. They're just a really great team. On film and off film, you
can tell they're a really great team.  
  
Q. For all the players. The experience this year, you haven't played
yet, can you talk about how this is different so far, maybe how there's a
different sense of understanding what this is all about, the distractions,
what it's been like so far, how you hope it's different Friday?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like we've grown as a team since last year. We're
better overall. I feel like we're in better condition to go out there and
compete. Last year, I feel like we was a little timid to go out there, and it
showed. This year I feel a little different vibe in the locker room, practice,
that we can go out there and compete with them.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I feel the same as Morgan. We was a different team last
year. Like she said, we growed this year, became a better team. And going into
this game this year, I feel like we're more confident. We have a chance just
like everybody else has a chance.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Same as they said. I think we're a different team this
year. I think they're also a different and great team this year, too. They're
fast. They have a great transition game. They execute offensively. They're
well-coached.  
  
But we're well-coached, as well. We're a much better and deeper team this
year. I think it's going to be a great game and a great matchup.  
  
Q. Morgan, how are you different as a player this year? Is it your
confidence or more than that?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: This year from last year, I'm healthy this year, confident as
well. I feel like I'm back to playing myself than I was last year.  
  
I have a big role. I mean, I had the same roles, but this year I had to fill
the role of talking, being a leader, being the one that sets a tone for our
team. I try to have a good day every day so my teammates can, too.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: And she had a broken leg last year, too. Played with it the
whole year, too. Had a broken leg, so...  
  
Q. For any of the players. Geno Auriemma in here earlier said he sees a
huge difference in the way y'all are playing now than before Vic made the
change, four new starters. I just wonder how y'all think it affected you?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think a big thing that went into the change is the
two-week break we had coming out of SEC play. We got back and we had practices
for that whole two weeks. We just worked a lot on our offense, executing
offensively, setting better screens, coming off those screens better.  
  
I think as a whole we just got better offensively. We really focused on
executing. We knew if we wanted to win big ballgames, you have to execute
offensively down the stretch. That was a really big focus for us.  
  
Him changing up the lineup, we've changed up the lineup many times throughout
the year in practice. We were already used to the lineup change.  
  
I think everybody's comfortable playing with each other. I think that has a
big deal to do with our chemistry. We have great chemistry no matter what. I
don't think it really affected us, like, comfortable-wise. We're all
comfortable with each other, so...  
  
Q. For all three student-athletes. A year later, what did you learn
about that game against UConn? How much of a motivation is it for you guys now
to prove that you aren't that team that played against UConn last year?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think we just learned that we cannot be all tied up.
Last year I think we were just tied up. Came out, they had us down 20 to
something already. Can't come out tired out if you want to play against UConn.  
  
We just got to be confident, come out ready to play. I think if we come out
ready to play, we'll be fine.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Feeding off what she said, we have to come out and play
comfortable. Last year we got down fast. I feel like coming into the game
Friday, let it speak for itself. Let us see what we do, what they do.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: After the game, it's kind of like a reality check as a team,
as a whole. I feel like going into pre-season workouts and stuff, you really
just wanted to work your butt off, develop more as a player, like number one,
two and three draft picks. We had a lot to work on, and it was an honor to
play against them. That season, I just really wanted to work hard and get back
to this point.  
  
Q. Did you watch the tape of that game at all since then? What did you
learn from it? Also, this team which is known for its defense has been scoring
a ton lately. What's changed to get the offense going to put up these crazy
numbers?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Yeah, we have watched the film a lot. After we played
them last year, we watched it a lot, before the season even started, just to
remind you how fast the game can get away from you.  
  
I think it taught us we have to compete each and every possession, take it one
possession at a time. If you take it from there, it will be fine.  
  
What was the second question?  
  
Q. Offense.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Offense, okay.  
  
Just like I said earlier, I think just practicing our offensive execution has
helped us a lot, setting better screens, coming off the screens better. Then
having a point guard like Morgan, who can lead your team, get people where
they need to be, helps.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Yeah, again feeding off Dom, we saw that film a lot last
year. Even walking in the weight room, our strength coach has 60 on, like, the
window. We see it every day. It didn't leave our heads at all.  
  
To be put back in this position mean a lot.  
  
For the offense, like she said again, we executed plays, we started working on
our offense. Even though our defense is good, we had to start working on our
offense. We had to start working on plays, cutting off screens better.
Shooting the ball. Coach say like, You got a good shot, but get the great
shot.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Like they said, we did watch film. He made us remember that.
We don't need to forget that game. It's staying in the back of our minds so we
don't be complacent.  
  
The scoring piece, I feel like changing lineups, it gave everyone confidence,
like people who play behind them and behind me. For me personally, it helped
me as a point guard 'cause playing with the second lineup, it made me talk
more. Had to build the confidence in them, let them know, like, when I work
hard to get an open shot, you need to take the shot. Stuff like that.  
  
Blair did a great job. Teaira, all them did a good job coming off the bench as
starters. I'm just proud of them. I think that grew, that confidence. Once you
have a sub, I mean, the starters are coming in. I feel like that doubled our
points.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit on Morgan's injury. Was it the
fibula?  
COACH SCHAEFER: She had a crack in her tibia. If you look back at the film,
she wore a protective covering on it all year.  
  
We rested her. We didn't practice her at times all week, things like that.
She'd play in games. Kid's just tougher than nails. I've had other kids that
have had that.  
  
We tried then to see at the end of the year if it would heal, but it wouldn't.
She had a rod put down, like you normally do. It's a common injury. It's one
that doesn't tend to heal.  
  
But obviously now she's back to feeling good and 100%.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I was very close with my parents both, and I buried both
of them. I still remember where I was standing the day I got the phone call
that Donnie had passed. I don't wish that on any young person. It's hard
enough when you're an adult.  
  
She's Blair's roommate. She's at my house more than any other player for
dinner or whatever. So she's someone that I know, because of what she's been
through, I try to provide that stability whenever is necessary, because she is
away from home.  
  
I love all my kids. But there's always a special place in my heart for any
young person who has had to go through dealing with losing a parent. I mean,
it's terrible.  
  
The kid's handling it like a champ. Her mom, Monica, is such a strong, strong
Christian woman. So there is that unique and special bond, you know, that we
have.  
  
Q. Vic, your numbers are overall higher of late on the offensive end.
You've been real efficient all year, 19th in the country in offensive
efficiency. How much of that has to do with Morgan being healthy and putting
you guys in better positions? Then specific to her playing through that
injury, do you think she found some ways to compensate that allow someone who
is 5'5 " to do things like score around the rim?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. We probably need to remeasure, because I'm pretty sure
she ain't the five and the second part of that.  
  
Anyone that deals with what she dealt with obviously is a really tough kid. I
mean, when Morgan makes a move, there's so much torque, you know, involved.
Really. So getting through that, certainly I think she's learned a great deal.  
  
At the same time, you know, you look back to our Baylor game. We had four
turnovers total. I think we had one at halftime. That's an amazing stat this
time of year. We forced 17, which that was the stat of the game at the end of
the day, 17-4 in turnovers was the stat of the game by far.  
  
Our offensive efficiency I think really starts with her, no question about it.
I want the ball in her hands. I want her to make some decisions with the ball.  
  
You watch Connecticut the other night, just completely disrupted Oregon.
That's concerning, but at the same time, you know, I know with Morgan and
really the offense that we run, you know, we're pretty good at doing some
things, creating space and going off the bounce.  
  
We have shooters. That's the thing. I've said this all along about the change
in the lineup. We put kids on the floor that were hot. They were making shots.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at our stats over the last five
games going into the SEC tournament and in the SEC tournament and seeing who's
hot and who's not.  
  
At some point as a coach, you got to start playing some kids that are making
shots that you've been watching every day in practice. As long as they're not
a defensive liability, you got to play those kids.  
  
That's what we did. Blair had 39 in the regional, 21-18, led us in scoring.
She'd been making shots for weeks. It was time to get her in the lineup.  
  
Teaira deserved to start. Really, for her, it was more of Chinwe had been
getting a quick foul. So I was just trying to buy Chinwe some time. She had
two fouls like the first Minnesota at Tennessee earlier in the year. I was
trying to buy her some time.  
  
Then Teaira, I didn't really want to start her. Probably could have midway
through the SEC schedule. But I felt like she could be the Sixth Player of the
Year, which she was. I didn't want to keep her from having that opportunity.
Obviously we had great continuity and chemistry.  
  
At the end of the day, let me tell you, Roshunda Johnson, she's been nicked
up, dinged up all year long, fighting through nagging injuries. If we can ever
get her back going, she's an offensive weapon, again, that can create her own
shot, can stretch the defense.  
  
At the end of the day, that's kind of what's contributed to us. Like Morgan
said, she plays with those kids every day. Those kids have been in big
ballgames. Blair had made three threes, including the go ahead three at
Tennessee that helped us beat them.  
  
Our kids could care less who is out there jumping center. That's really what
we're talking about, who is out there jumping center, compared to how many
minutes they're playing in a game. The minutes haven't really changed that
much.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed when I asked the kids the question about the UConn
game, watching film, there was kind of a wink and a nod between you and them,
like they can answer the question saying what they said. Did you watch the
film to learn what you can do, since UConn's personnel is completely different
with the three gone? What did you learn out of the film? How did the whole 60
number in the weight room come about?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we watched the film when we got back. We watched it
leading into the season. We haven't watched that film. What I've shown them,
you know, here, we showed bits and pieces of that game. You can probably
figure out which piece we showed.  
  
But, you know, there wasn't a whole lot of great things to show. I mean, when
you get beat 60, it's embarrassing. I think the big thing we learned that day
was the speed of the game. They were Speedy González fast. They were really
fast. We walked into the gym that day with six players in walking boots, and
it looked like we still had 'em on when we were playing.  
  
It was a humbling, embarrassing experience for all of us. I think that's the
big thing you learn, is the speed of the game. Let me tell you, this team is
no different. I know the names have changed with some of them. The team is no
different. Great chemistry. Great defensive team. Great offensive chemistry.
Great skill sets. They are fast.  
  
So that's the piece that hopefully with us won't be new this year. We
understand going in, we better run the floor or they'll run us out of the gym
in a hurry again. That's the piece that has been the most concerning of all in
preparing for them.  
  
You watch on film. When they get a rebound, there's not one player that turns
and takes a step. They're turning and taking a stride. They are running.
That's the difference, I think, with them when you're dealing with them. I
mean, it's really a challenge.  
  
Q. Vic, from your Texas A &M days, it looks like you still mine Texas
for recruiting for talent. How much do you do that? Could you address
contributions you've gotten from your Texas contingent this year on your
team.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, all four of those kids have been special. We're always
going to recruit Texas. Obviously I'm a Texas boy, born and raised here. Have
so many colleagues and friends that are high school coaches in the state.
We've got four kids on our team right now.  
  
Ketara and Dom and that senior class are very, very special. Then Teaira is a
sophomore and Blair is a junior. We'll always recruit this state.  
  
Those kids have all been impacts, no question about it. They have impacted our
program. Again, because of my relationships with so many people in this state,
we'll continue to try to get back in and recruit the best kids.  
  
The thing you got to remember is everybody wants to talk about the next
McDonald's All-American. We get together as a staff, Who are we going to get?
I want to know where we're going to get the next Dominique Dillingham, a kid
that wasn't highly recruited, but has impacted our program as much as anybody
I've ever signed. Her toughness, physical, aggressive. I mean, she's just a
tough, physical, aggressive basketball player. That doesn't say anything about
her jump shot.  
  
You got to have kids like that. So we'll continue to recruit this state.  
  
Q. How much of playing UConn is in the head, playing against that
winning streak, the legacy, the national championships? How do you address
that, the perception that everyone is playing for second place?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, there's nothing you can do about it. It's there. It
doesn't matter how much you do talk about it or don't talk about it.  
  
Last year I talked about it a lot. This year, you know, we're trying to treat
it just like another business trip. This team has been really good on the
road. We spent most of non-conference on the road. We only had three home
games. So this team has done a great job of going on the road and being
businesslike.  
  
It wouldn't matter if you were playing Connecticut on the road, home, or here
at the Final Four. You're still dealing with a well-oiled machine that is
well-coached, has great players, and they're always going to play great.  
  
That's what we have. So to combat that, we have to continue to play like we're
playing, which right now we're playing as well as we've played all year. If
I'm going to have to play them, which I am, now is the time to play 'em, from
my perspective, in controlling the things that I can control.  
  
That's kind of what we've tried to focus on this whole tournament, is let's
control Mississippi State. Let's work on the things that we know we got to get
better at. Let's win the minute, let's win the hour, let's win the day. That's
been what we've done since we got back from the SEC tournament. We scored 48,
49 points in the championship game. Set the game back 30 years offensively.  
  
I don't like having two weeks off after that tournament waiting to play in
this tournament. But it happened at a great time this year for us. It allowed
us to get back to doing some things. Allowed me to make some changes, quite
frankly, work on some things that needed working on. It was really beneficial
for us this time.  
  
Q. Vic, these guys would be hard to prepare for if you had a month, let
alone a couple days. I know you're not going to give the game plan away. Can
you give us a sense philosophically when you started thinking about preparing
for UConn? Do you look ahead in the tournament, send an assistant coach to
scout ahead? Always interesting how a team would like to scout Connecticut
even if Connecticut is not their immediate game.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure. For us, we're always -- my players have been great about
it, too. We're great about, Who is next? What time do we play? When is the bus
leaving? That's how we've taken it all year long.  
  
Like you said, you could have told me a year ago when we walked off the floor,
You're going to get them in another year, get ready. I'm not sure how much
time I would have spent on it because I'm worried about 37 games between now
and then.  
  
So as it is, we started getting ready for them when we got home from winning
the Elite 8 game, beating Baylor. We started getting ready for them then. We
were very attentive watching the game that they played on Monday night.  
  
At the end of the day, again, there's only so much you can do because of their
philosophy. Extremely difficult to prepare for, because they're so multi-
dimensional. Each player can do so many different things at each position, it
really creates some mismatches for you.  
  
So, you know, we've got to try to minimize those situations, if we can, the
best we can. The battles that we can deal with, let's deal with 'em.  
  
Q. Coach, with all due respect to Connecticut, you've answered questions
about Connecticut now for three days. How much do you want your kids to go
into the game with the swagger that says, We're Mississippi State? We've won
33 games, we're hot, deal with us?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think we can say that just like that in our room. We have to
be careful stepping outside and have that type of brashness.  
  
For us, we do talk about, Hey, look, we're playing well, y'all. We have four
turnovers tomorrow night, we'll be right there. Take care of the ball. Let's
don't get caught giving up layups that we can't defend.  
  
There's all kinds of things that you talk about. But, you know, again, it's
hard to forget. We're human. Listen, there's not a more humbling thing than
getting beat 60 on a Sunday afternoon, I think it was a Sunday, or Monday,
knowing you're going to the WBCA convention the next week, and they've asked
you to speak about defense to your colleagues.  
  
I mean, I remember calling Danielle, the president of the WBCA going,
Danielle, it's Coach Schaefer at Mississippi State. Are you sure you want me
to give a presentation at the Final Four about defense? We did just give up
98.  
  
That's a humbling deal, y'all. But at the same time I think you grow and learn
from it. Again, our team's different.  
  
Now, we've got to go play. That's it in a nutshell. We just have to go play.
If we'll go play, like we've been playing, look, we just bit a No. 1 seed.
Baylor's pretty good, by the way. They're really good. Got a lot of really
good players. They were so good they were talking about the UConn-Baylor
matchup on Saturday night, before we played them on Sunday. They're obviously
pretty good to a lot of people.  
  
I just think we have to take care of ourselves. Control what we can control,
win the minute, win the hour, try to win the two hours.  
  
Q. Vic, when you came to Mississippi State five years ago, did you think
you could be in the Final Four in five years? Also, just to develop the fan
base. They used to have hundreds at home games on a Sunday afternoon. You had
almost 6,000 on a Friday afternoon. Explain those two things. Did you envision
being here now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Certainly I envisioned being here. I'm not sure anybody
envisioned it happening in five years. It's pretty quick. That first team we
inherited we went 13-17. We didn't panic. We knew what 13-17 looked like. We
went to work, went recruiting.  
  
Those kids that we inherited, we kept every one of them. We didn't get rid of
anybody. We asked them to change, and they did. I give those kids a lot of
credit.  
  
The recruiting piece became very important. I have a tremendous staff. I have
an unbelievable staff. They do a tremendous job developing these young ladies
both on and off the court. They're great role models.  
  
I did believe it. I wouldn't have gone there. I would have never gone to
Mississippi State if I didn't think we couldn't do what we've done. I just
don't know that anybody thought - including myself - that it would happen in
year five.  
  
Our fan base is special. We've averaged over 7,000 fans a game. We're top
seven in the country in attendance. We had 10-5 this year, 10-6 a year ago.
What happened at Mississippi State in women's basketball is very special. You
can count on one hand and two fingers where else that's happening across the
country.  
  
But that's part of building a program. When you go to build a program, it's
not about X's and O's, wins and losses. It is about a fan base. I'm so proud
that the Final Four is sold out tomorrow night. I know my fans had a big part
in that. We're going to have a great contingency here. Great support for our
kids. Just like we had more fans in Oklahoma City than I think Baylor had.
They were loud and proud. We've traveled well to the SEC tournament now for
three straight years. Had as many fans as anybody except South Carolina.  
  
So I think that's the piece that as a coach you're so proud of knowing the
impact that my kids have had on a university, on a community, and on a state.
Again, that's why we do what we do. Very few times in life do you have a
chance to make an impact. These kids have made an impact.  
  
We go in the stands after every game. If we win, we're in the stands. We're
hugging babies and kissing mamas or vice versa. Whatever it takes. But that's
what we do. In this game, that's easy. But I call my team the people's team
because everybody that comes, they want to hug them, tell them how much they
love them, they want to give them a dozen cookies. They want to feel a part of
them. That's what makes our game so special.  
  
So for us, it's been so much fun, so much. It's the best thing I've ever done.
The best decision I've ever made. Again, I give my kids all the credit. People
don't come watch us play because we're standing around in a 2-3 zone. That
might work for other people. It don't work for us. They come see our kids play
because we're a blue-collar, hard-nosed, tough, physical, aggressive
basketball team.  
  
I think the people in our community can identify with that, and they
appreciate that. They want to show their son and their daughter, Hey, I want
you to play like Dominique Dillingham. I want to play fearless and step in
front of a freight train and take a charge. I want to see you compete like
they compete.  
  
That's how you build a program. I'm really proud of that. You know, I got to
give Coach Blair a lot of credit because I sat and watched him for 15 years,
was with him. That's how we built it when I was with him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2017

  

### [Kaela Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26929)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is South Carolina.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Staley, then take some questions.  
  
COACH STALEY: We're excited to be here, playing in the third weekend of the
NCAA tournament. Look forward to the challenges that lie ahead of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kaela, all season long you've been most efficient on the spot-up
shooting. Obviously your game has had to evolve beyond that here in the NCAA
tournament. What do you see in that growth? What area has been most effective
for you during the NCAA tournament?  
KAELA DAVIS: I think it's just been attacking the paint, being aggressive, not
just settling for jump shots, just kind of looking past that first defender,
and, like I said, trying to get points in the paint.  
  
Q. A'ja, you're from South Carolina. You know all the great things about
the state, some of the not-so-great things. What do you think it's like to
have two minority head coaches representing this state and the school in the
Final Four, be such good representatives for the state and the school?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it's a great thing. Like you said, I'm from South
Carolina. Just to see the two coaches really come up and really change the
program, build our school, bring something so positive back home, to the state
of South Carolina, is always a great thing.  
  
I love this feeling. I love this sight I'm seeing. The sky's the limit for
both of these programs.  
  
Q. A'ja, you were here a couple years ago in the Final Four. What did
you learn from that experience as one of the veterans of the team, and what
have you told the younger ones who have not been here before?  
A'JA WILSON: I've learned that it is just a different feeling, it really is. I
mean, when you got to play, you don't know if the next game is guaranteed, you
don't take anything for granted.  
  
That's something I really want to tell my teammates. The biggest thing I've
been preaching is I don't want my teammates to feel the way I felt last year
and the year before that. It's not a good feeling.  
  
I want to try my best to kind of get this team to not have that feeling, want
to have the opposite feeling of what I felt. It's something that I've tried to
make them aware of. I'm pretty sure they all know you can't really take this
game of basketball for granted.  
  
Q. For any of the three players (laughter). So for the two players, what
is the easiest thing from what you've seen in scouting Stanford now, and what
will be the most difficult thing?  
KAELA DAVIS: I mean, I think, honestly, it's the Final Four. I don't really
think there's anything easy. I think we just have to play our game, honestly.
Stanford, they're playing really, really, really well right now. I think, what
was it, 80 assists on 105 field goals is what they're doing in the tournament
now. That's crazy.  
  
They're sharing the ball, shooting the ball well. They're getting scoring from
a lot of different players, production from a lot of different players.  
  
You know, we've been playing really well on the defensive end. I think that's
something we're definitely going to have to continue.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, just really going off of that. Don't really have much to
add (smiling).  
  
Q. A'ja, South Carolina has made its bones on the defensive end of
things. Do you think your offensive versatility is something that maybe
sometimes gets overlooked? Do you feel like you're able to change the
perception of South Carolina offensively with what you're able to do on the
floor?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't know, honestly. I think we all have different styles of
game. I think we all adjust to our system. That's what makes our system so
great.  
  
I really wouldn't say that my offense really gets overlooked, honestly. I
think I just kind of play my role. That's something we've all done on this
team.  
  
I honestly wouldn't say it gets overlooked.  
  
Q. For both players. What would you say was the most difficult moment
for you this season, and how did you and/or your team overcome it?  
KAELA DAVIS: That's a really good question. Most difficult moment?  
  
I mean, I think, you know, any of the losses that we had this season were all
difficult. I mean, I think obviously starting off with Duke, I think that hit
us pretty hard.  
  
I think we've found a way to learn from each one of those experiences and to
not just take them as losses, take them as lessons, as well.  
  
I think we've just found a way to, you know, take a little bit of adversity,
you know, just come back from it.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I was going to say, the losses that we kind of overcame
throughout this season.  
  
Q. For both players. What is one thing specifically that Coach Staley
has done for you to help you improve your game this season?  
KAELA DAVIS: There's a ton of things. But, you know, coming in, for me, it was
really just on the defensive end, just kind of staying engaged, staying locked
in with whatever we're doing, whatever's going on.  
  
For me, I think it's just been a way to not only be effective offensively but,
you know, be an overall player and be effective defensively as well.
Especially when I had a little lull there, offensively I wasn't doing great, I
had to find a way to stay on the floor and be productive while I was there.  
  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think I can actually, like, pinpoint how much she's
really helped me with my game, honestly. She's helped me all around, whether
it's mentally, physically, emotionally throughout. Just taking the game in,
just knowing...  
  
What do you always say? When you give something to the game, the game always
gives it back to you.  
  
COACH STALEY: The game is a gift.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, the game is a gift. You get what you put in. It's going to
return what they think you deserve.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We will dismiss the student-athletes back to
the locker room.  
  
We will continue with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, when you played for Tara in the Olympics in '96, did you
appreciate then what you appreciate about her now as a coach?  
COACH STALEY: I do. '96, that entire year, just opened my eyes to seeing
basketball coached and played at a different level. The amount of pressure
that was on our team, on Tara, she made us feel all of the pressure that was
on her. She didn't want the team to fail.  
  
I feel like from my experiences with her, she taught me how to approach the
game, how to approach pressure situations, and how to execute while being
under that amount of pressure.  
  
Q. Dawn, I know you've been to Final Fours as a coach. When you look
back at your time as a player, is there still experiences from that Final Four
that you still draw on, maybe you try to give to your players? Also, as part
of that Final Four, your team played Tara twice on the way to their two
championships, and you faced Geno in his first Final Four appearance. Did you
pay much attention to that at that point?  
COACH STALEY: I didn't pay much attention to the coaching when I was playing.
You know, the emotions, as I reflect on participating in the Final Fours, not
being able to win a national championship, is the thing that fuels me as a
coach, you know, to check that box off.  
  
Fortunately I've been around some great players to get us back at this point
to compete for a national championship. Hopefully our day has come.  
  
Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk, Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner,
talking about maybe a women's coach in the NBA. What do you think it's going
to take to have either a women's coach coach a men's team in college or at the
NBA level?  
COACH STALEY: Opportunity. Opportunity. Basketball is basketball. It doesn't
have a gender. It has a mind. It has an approach. It has a willingness. Given
the opportunity, women can excel in this game. As you can see. Becky Hammon is
doing a great job. You need more people like Coach Popovich to give them
opportunities to learn, to grow, and to embrace it.  
  
I don't think he sees gender. I think he sees someone that has a great
basketball mind, that's tireless. Once you're given that opportunity, you see
great things come out of it.  
  
Q. Other coaches, do you communicate with them? You don't have to say
their names. Do they share words of encouragement for you? And how did you get
the name Miss Magic growing up?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I talk to other coaches, definitely. If you're in this
game long enough, you want to create an edge, no matter where you are. You do
it through your network of friends, coaching, to figure out how you can make
your team better. We often do that.  
  
As far as Magic, you know, growing up in Philly, I like to say that my game
was probably more open court and more flashy than your regular, average
player. I like to pass the ball. Magic was the best to do it.  
  
Q. Philosophically, when Coates went down, how did you and your coaching
staff approach what you were going to do afterwards? It was interesting to
hear Tara VanDerveer talk about how you may actually be a tougher team to
guard right now because the ball is spread more, seems like there's more
avenues for you to attack offensively.  
COACH STALEY: When Coates went down, obviously we were concerned. She's
someone that has contributed to our program for the last four years. She's
gotten us SEC Championships, both regular season and tournament championships.
She's got us to the Final Four.  
  
You exhale for a second because you feel bad for her. Then once that moment
passes, you got to get your healthy bodies ready to go. You got to get their
minds ready. You got to get them ready spiritually, physically, emotionally.  
  
I mean, we never looked back. We never fretted it. We never felt like we
didn't have enough in the room to get it done.  
  
The part that I'm, you know, proud of is the way that they've come together.
They actually have gotten closer because of it. That's what you need your
teams to do in an adverse moment.  
  
I mean, you can't foresee the chemistry part of it. A lot of what we're doing
is because of the closeness of this team, because of Alaina's injury. That's
how you want your team to respond.  
  
Q. You were talking about women coaching in the NBA. You and Tara are
two of the most prominent women's coaches. But the opportunities for four
decades for women to be able to coach women have been slowly declining. How
big of an issue do you see that as being, women getting a chance to coach
women in college basketball? How do you change the trend, the downward
trend?  
COACH STALEY: I look at it like this. Obviously women are playing at a high
level, which makes our game attractive to men's coaches. That's a great thing.  
  
And also, you know, it reduces the amount of female coaches in our game
because of it. So we've made it popular. We've made it appealing to male
coaches. Now they want to, you know, be a part of our game.  
  
But I think when given an opportunity, just like men are given the opportunity
to coach the women of our game, you tend to have some success with it. I don't
think there should be a gender. I think there should be opportunity, you know,
for all women. I don't think we need to be overlooked at this point.  
  
Years ago only women wanted to coach women because it wasn't the popular
thing. But it's becoming more popular. I hope ADs and administrators are not
just looking for the male gender to coach our players.  
  
I'm one that thinks basketball is a place of utopia and fairness. I want to be
looked at as a coach and not necessarily as a female coach. I hope everybody,
you know, approaches it that way.  
  
Q. Is it an important question?  
COACH STALEY: The numbers are looking like it's geared towards that. I know
probably some of my other female colleagues would beg to differ, probably
differ in how I look at it.  
  
But my approach to the game has been, you know, loving the game. It loves me
back. That's the approach that I take from it.  
  
Q. Dawn, a couple weeks ago when Temple lost, the way they lost, Tonya
was talking about seniors, the dynamic of the game. You don't see it coming.
You had a tough one against Tara in '92. How long did it take you to get over
that?  
COACH STALEY: I still remember that. I think as many wins that I've been a
part of, it's the losses that really sting. '90, '91 and '92 all were
opportunities for us to win a national championship. But the last one was
probably the hardest one.  
  
I often look back on it and wish I had approached it a little differently
because I do think I could have made Angela Taylor foul me. Especially they
put her in the game just to guard me in that last play. I just popped out -- I
should have popped out and stopped.  
  
At the rate -- I can't say that. I can't continue. I could have made her foul
me in that instance (laughter).  
  
Q. Dawn, you played Mississippi State a couple times this season in
really, really tough games. What makes them so tough to play? Are you not
surprised to see them here, as well as you?  
COACH STALEY: Not surprised to see them here. They're very well-coached. They
are experienced. Their team has been together for the last three or four
years. They're very calculating in what they want to do from an offensive
standpoint. Defensively they're pretty stingy.  
  
Vic has done a great job as just building, having some success in our league.
When you're having success in our league, when you transition to the NCAA
tournament, you know, it puts you in the position where you're ahead of the
game.  
  
Then, you know, for how they defend, for how they rebound, how they're
calculating on the offensive end, I'm not surprised to see them here on the
biggest stage of women's college basketball.  
  
Q. Your men's team, the South Carolina men's team, have any benefits
that you don't have?  
COACH STALEY: Right now the benefit is they'll probably get all of our fans
because it's their first time going to the Final Four. But as far as benefits
--  
  
Q. Program benefits.  
COACH STALEY: Program benefits? No, we pretty much get what we want. It may be
different. We get what we want in order to be successful.  
  
That's what is great about our administrators, from our president to our AD to
our janitors, we get the same ovation as anybody on campus. Not just
basketball, but football, women's soccer, tennis. All of us feel like, from
our administrators, we feel like we're the only program at our university.
When you can make somebody feel that special all the time, it leads to being
successful.  
  
Q. In terms of your offense, a lot of times your program has been
described as a defense-first team. You are consistently top 20 in offensive
efficiency, though. This year, in particular, it seems like you have your most
diverse offensive team. I'm curious whether you think that is the case. Do you
think it's underrated historically, and do you think this offense gives you
your best chance at a national championship?  
COACH STALEY: Well, here is what has happened over the past few years. We
didn't have as much talent as we have, you know, over the past maybe two or
three years. So we had to do it with defense and rebounding. We built our
program on just that because of the personnel that we have.  
  
Now that we have a more talented roster, we're more versatile. We can do a lot
of different things.  
  
I'm not a systems coach, you know. I play off the personnel that we have. We
put them in positions to be effective. A lot of times it's off the bounce. A
lot of teams that are here, like Stanford, Connecticut, they're a passing
offensive team, a systems team that rely on passing. We're a team that relies
on putting the ball on the floor, ball screen action, and some passing.  
  
I think we have the best of both worlds in that if you take one thing away, we
have some other things that we can rely on because we have the talent to do
so.  
  
Q. Is this year your best offensive year?  
COACH STALEY: I think we've been put in the situation where we've had to make
adjustments. When you've made adjustments, and they work out, it seems pretty
good. I thought our coaching staff did a great job.  
  
Once A'ja Wilson went down for a two-week period, we went to a smaller lineup,
which helped us. When Coates went down, we just adjusted. We perfected the
offense that worked for us. You're seeing us spread the floor a little bit,
utilizing the talent that we have.  
  
Q. Dawn, what did you learn as a coach two years ago when you fell just
short in the Final Four? Along those lines, seeing UConn here year after year,
the consistency, what makes it that difficult to keep on getting back here to
the Final Four?  
COACH STALEY: Well, what we've learned two years ago is probably what we
learned throughout our entire coaching career, and just in basketball. The
margin of error is so small, so small. I mean, if Aleighsa Welch makes a shot
on one entity, we're up three, and the ballgame's over.  
  
But because she missed, we go down, we defended extremely well, so much so we
got a blocked shot, it was an air ball that -- what is her name? Graduated.
She put it back in. I forget her name. She's from Maryland, right? She put it
back in. That's the margin of error, an air ball that turned put them up by
one.  
  
I mean, it's hard getting here. It's very difficult getting to the third
weekend of the NCAA tournament. For us, it's an uphill battle. But because of
the conference that we play in, it provides us a platform to have some success
in the NCAA tournament.  
  
With Connecticut, the way they do things, you know, at the rate that they do
things, I mean, it's pretty special. They do a great job at running their
system on both sides of the ball. They make you rise up to their level of play
year in and year out.  
  
Hopefully by us being here, possibly continuing to play them in the regular
season and hopefully the post-season, you get a little bit closer to reducing
the margin of error.  
  
That's what it is, you have to continue to reduce the margin of error against
a team that is so stingy on both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Dawn, following up on the offensive development you talked about. You
brought in Melanie Balcomb to do some offensive analytics. How did that come
about? What kind of insights have you gotten from that? How much has that
helped with the personnel you have this year?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we found out that Melanie wasn't returning to Vanderbilt.
We wanted to keep great basketball minds in our game. The guys do it all the
time. There's not a great coach on the men's side that is jobless, without
wanting to be in that position.  
  
I just thought it was a great opportunity for us to capitalize on bringing in
a great offensive mind into the fold. It's worked out terrifically. Our
coaching staff has been together, most of us, for nine years now. Sometimes
you're hearing the same things, you're doing the same things. The things that
you're doing work.  
  
But you bring someone like Melanie into the fold, she just gives us a
different perspective on things. Melanie is one that breaks it down. I mean,
she likes counters to everything that she does. Sometimes we look for maybe
one or two options, where she's looking at how the defense is playing and how
we can still run the same play and get maybe a third or fourth option out of
it.  
  
She's constantly throughout the year helping us with that.  
  
Q. Dawn, for people who don't follow the season throughout, and are only
catching the Final Four right now, for any of the other three teams, how would
you describe or explain to someone how to beat a team like UConn who has won
111 straight games?  
COACH STALEY: To beat a team like UConn, you have to prep for them not just in
tournament play. You have to prep for them all season long. You have to work
on something that is effective against them, and you have to perfect it from
day one. You keep working.  
  
They do have the luxury of working on things throughout the year because they
don't have a whole lot of competitive games in their league. So for us, you
know, we play them mid February. They have a month and a half to get ready to
perfect the game against us.  
  
Also with their regular season, they play so many top-level teams in the
country, you know, they're already ahead of the game, just including their
style of play. Again, they make you rise to their level of play.  
  
In order for you to beat a team like UConn, you got to be given opportunities
to play them not just once a year. I think some of the things that we did in
the game against them this year, if given the opportunity to play them on
Sunday, we've been working on those things since then.  
  
That's something that you have to do. It's all about preparation. You can't
come into a tournament like this and think you can beat them off of one day of
preparation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UConn.  
  
We will take an opening statement from Coach Auriemma, then we will take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, it's a long journey really from October 15th, when
we started, to this weekend. A lot happens in four or five months. You go
through a lot. Players change and teams change.  
  
We're no different than anybody else in that respect. But what happened this
year was really remarkable in that the unknown was what everyone talked about
in October. Then throughout the whole season, it became really evident that,
you know, this was a really, really good team, made up of really good players.
They proved it every night. This is where they belong.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. For both players, who is the leader of this team and why? How has
that dynamic transformed during the course of the season?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think that we've all kind of shared the leadership role. Kia
and I, Saniya [Chong] stepped up, Lou [Katie Lou Samuelson] has stepped up.
There hasn't been one person to kind of take over.  
  
I think for different aspects, you know, different people take over certain
things.  
  
KIA NURSE: To kind of piggyback off of what Gabby said, obviously what we
learned from the seniors that came before us is it's never a one-person thing
to have to lead a team on their own.  
  
We decided that this year, different people who weren't in that role before
had to step up and do that. Like she said, it's been a team effort the entire
way.  
  
Q. Kia, what for you was the toughest moment of this season? How, as a
group, did you overcome it?  
KIA NURSE: I think during the beginning of the season, our toughest moments
were in practice, in understanding what we needed to do to be successful.
Because, like Coach said, there was this unknown from a lot of people. With
us, our unknown was: How do we step into these roles we haven't done before,
do them successfully, help out the younger guys as much as possible.  
  
We had a transition to make. We did it as best as we could. It was a
challenge. But I think we stepped up together. With the help of the coaches
and everyone on the team, we did a good job.  
  
Q. For both players. Obviously the team has been here for 10 straight
years to the Final Four. You don't have too much experience on the court in
the Final Four. What have you learned to get you ready for tomorrow night's
game?  
KIA NURSE: Well, obviously we're fortunate to have been here, you know, twice
with the two of us, understanding how the older kids, like Stewy [Breanna
Stewart], Morgan Tuck, Kaleena and Kia, had approached this tournament and
what it took to be a success in it. We're fortunate our ringleader has been
here a couple of times.  
  
Using the advice he gives us, things he helps us in practice, try to take that
as a game plan emphasis.  
  
Q. For both student-athletes. What do you remember about last year's
meeting with Mississippi State? How much has the ringleader and his assistants
told you to block that out, that this is a totally different situation?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Well, they've returned a lot of players. There's some familiar
faces. We've been watching them all year. So we do remember some things about
them.  
  
Like you said, they have evolved and changed, just like every other team
that's here right now. So right now we're just going to face the team that's
in front of us.  
  
Q. For both players. Can you give us a feeling of the legacy? You're
playing for a team that's won 111 straight teams, won 11 national
championships, and now you step up to a leadership role. What is that like? Is
there pressure? Does it make you feel like you're part of this? Take me
through the dynamic of what that's like.  
KIA NURSE: Well, I think no matter what, when you come into a program like
this, there's going to be pressure. What you learn from the moment that you
get here, from the coaches and from the vets who have been here before, is you
learn how to deal with it, how to handle it, how to put it aside when it's not
needed.  
  
When you come here and you have to step into a role of leadership, and it's
difficult, it's a challenge, the best part about it is is the people that came
before you to build this legacy, who had done it so flawlessly, they had the
same challenges, had to get through the same things. You are not doing it
alone. You have the help of your coaches, you have the help of your teammates.
That makes it all the better.  
  
Q. With this week being so intense, what is the most fun part about this
whole process?  
KIA NURSE: Obviously the Final Four itself is something to be celebrated. It's
not easy to get here. It's a lot of fun to be part of. There's a lot of stuff
going on around it.  
  
The funnest part about it is you get to do it with your teammates, with the
people who have put their tail on the line every single day in games and
practices to help get you here. To see the smile on the face of our senior
last night, T [Tierney Lawlor], who got to go to a rodeo. To see how happy she
was, that's probably the most fun part, to be with your teammates and
experience this with them.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It's just a blessing in itself to be here. It's definitely an
opportunity we don't take for granted. Like Kia said, this is our last few
days together, just this team. So we're just going to try to enjoy it.  
  
It's the last trip we'll have with Saniya and Tierney. We want to make sure
they have a good experience, as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We will continue with questions for head Coach Geno Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, excuse my language here, but I seem to remember at the
beginning of year you said something to the effect of there are times when you
wish these guys could be more assholes on the court or something to that
effect.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wouldn't say that (smiling).  
  
Q. Well, you probably would. But I wanted to get a sense of how you
think their collective personality is as a group today, and is it different
from what the collective personality was in October?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, in 1998/'99 season, we started the season as the No.
1 team. Well, no. We played three of the top-10 teams in the country in
California in a row. We scored a hundred in every one of those games. We won
every one of those games by, like, 30. We were No. 1 in the country. Everyone
was talking about how they can't believe a team could play that well that
early. We had five freshmen. I mean, they happened to be Hall of Famers, Sue
and them.  
  
Then something happened. Sue got hurt. Things changed. As we got towards the
regionals, I tried to make the team into something they weren't. Like I knew
what they didn't have, and I tried to give it to them. It all backfired on me.
We lost. We deserved to lose because I screwed it up leading up to that.  
  
I tried to force something that has to come naturally, you know. So I thought
about that this year. Right around that time, early in the season, I said, I
can't do this. I can't make them into something they're not. It's not going to
work, you know. Things are going to have to play themselves out. We're either
going to become that or we're not.  
  
Little by little, you know, they started to respond to whatever circumstances
were in front of them. But they've never changed. They haven't become what I
hoped they would become, like edgy and really pissy, just walk out there and
grab you by the throat and choke you, like some teams that I've had.  
  
They just walk out: Yeah, we're probably going to win, so let's just play. I'm
sure something bad will happen during the game, but it's okay, we'll fix it.  
  
Lou, put your hand up on defense.  
  
Well, you know, she's probably going to make a couple threes, but we'll win.  
  
Phees, are you going to guard anybody?  
  
Eventually I will, but it's not like I have to do it all the time. Coach,
really?  
  
They just have this attitude like everything will be fine, don't worry about
it. Yet they keep winning. You know how many times I go home and go, Man, I
hope we get our butts kicked the next game so bad. But it just doesn't happen.
I'm happy for them that it doesn't, but I'm pissed for me (smiling).  
  
Q. Taking that personality of the team, applying it to the Mississippi
State game, a lot of talk about what happened last year. How do you get that
out of their minds, that it's probably not going to be a 60-point game this
year, erase that, all as a fresh start this year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Right. Well just this morning, I watched that game again. I'm
going to remind them at practice today.  
  
There's nobody on this team right now that had anything other than 'I was at
that game' to do with that score. If you watch that game, Stewy [Breanna
Stewart], looked like an NBA player playing against high school kids. Moriah
was so much better than anybody on the floor. And Tuck just dominated long
stretches of the game. So the score was like 30-4 at the end of the first
quarter. I think Lou had one bucket. I don't think Kia had any. The other guys
didn't even play.  
  
If they think they had anything to do with that win, they're going to be
reminded today, No, they didn't. This is not the same Mississippi State team
we played. The turnaround they've made offensively has been remarkable.
They're still the same defensive team that they were. And we're not the same
team by any stretch of the imagination. If those three seniors were here, I
would have a tough time convincing them. But won't be tough with this team.  
  
Q. Geno, you said a little bit there the experience, even though you've
been to 10 straight, those guys really haven't been on this stage. How do you
get them to do the right things to keep this thing going for you guys?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, the only reason we get asked that is because we've
been here so much. That only applies to me and C.D. [Chris Dailey] and Shea
and Marisa to a certain degree, as well. And we're not playing.  
  
So the players that are going to be playing, Kia has played a lot in two Final
Fours. Gabby, not much. Lou, a little bit. Saniya, not at all. Crystal
Dangerfield, not at all. Pheesa, hardly at all.  
  
They don't own any of those 10 Final Fours. They don't own any of those 11
national championships. They only own part of the streak. I mean, the only
thing that this team has to hold onto, I've said this before, is the 36 wins
that they have right now this year.  
  
So going into this weekend, how are they going to handle this situation that
they're in right now? I have no idea. But it's not going to be that much
different than, How is Mississippi State going to handle their first Final
Four? How are those kids going to handle being here for the very first time?  
  
We all have the same issues. This is not an easy environment to play in. Both
teams I think are going to see the effects of that.  
  
Q. Where in Mississippi State's performance do you see there will be a
keynote? Where have you taken some notes from where their development was from
the first game to this one?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think, from what I can see, and believe me, I haven't seen
like 40 of their games, however many they've played, but there must have been
a reason why Vic [Schaefer] benched four of his starters. Either it was
because he thought they would be better coming off the bench, or he was upset
about something.  
  
So when coaches make those kinds of decisions, that says a lot about the
relationship that they have with their team and the kind of feel that he has
for his team. And they responded. They responded amazingly well.  
  
I thought in the beginning of the season, offensively, they were good, but not
this good like they are right now. And the big thing that everybody has to
remember is, you know, I don't care how good your defense is, generally
speaking, when you get to this point in the season, you're not going to win
this thing with your defense. I mean, you have to play good defense, don't get
me wrong. But if you can't score, and score when you have to, on demand, in
this tournament, it's really, really hard to win. Really hard to win.  
  
They've done a great job in the tournament of scoring. That's why they're in
the Final Four.  
  
Q. There have been some really good games in this tournament, especially
Elite 8 games, overtime, the Stanford game. What does that mean for the
women's game, to have a tournament like that? What can we do to have more
people pay attention when a tournament is that good?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that seems to have been the question for a long time.
What are you going to do to generate more interest? Part of it has to be the
competitiveness of the games, which that's what happened. It has to happen
every year.  
  
The reason why the NCAA tournament on the men's side has been so compelling
over the years is because of all the upsets that happen. The mid-majors are
starting to get screwed, so maybe that's going to be less and less.  
  
You know, it's the upsets. It's the overtime games. That really attracts
people. On the men's side, it happens all the time. It has to happen more
often on the women's side.  
  
Not in our games, but it has to happen in every other game (laughter). I think
that's kind of a starting point.  
  
Then there's a bigger question, this is not the right venue to talk about it,
but there's some changes that the women's basketball tournament has to make,
to make it better. I don't think they're willing to make that change yet. But
eventually they're going to come to their senses and they will.  
  
Q. Coach, regarding player attitudes, there is a lot made of a comment
you made last year about benching players because of their attitudes. Have you
had issues like that this past year? Do you think they've kind of pulled
themselves together and had a good attitude going into games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, we wouldn't be here if we had issues. Teams
that have those kinds of issues generally don't get this far. Teams that live
with those issues year after year don't get this far as many times as we have.  
  
We've been fortunate over the years not to be completely free of that stuff,
but, for the most part, this year has been relatively easy in terms of getting
everybody to be on the same page the entire season.  
  
Now, that's easy to do when you're only playing six players, or seven. When
there's four players on the bench that think they should be playing, then you
have some other issues. Right now we don't have that. Next year we'll have
that, but right now we don't have that.  
  
That's every coach's challenge. That's why you see so many kids transferring
now. They don't want to buy in. They want it, and they want it now. So far,
we've been fortunate to avoid that.  
  
Q. Geno, not that you're a television programmer, but how do you feel
about the change from Saturday/Tuesday to Friday/Sunday in relation to what
that will or won't mean for the popularity of this year's tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I've said this in the past. TV and what's going on in
the actual arena don't go together. So what's best for television is a 10:00
start on the East Coast, or a 9:30 start on the East Coast. It's not best for
my players to sit around till 9:30 tomorrow night, but it's best for TV
because they're paying the bills. So they get to show the game whenever they
feel like it.  
  
So we're lucky, how does that affect attendance in the arena and what's more
important? We say, Well, you know, at the regionals, there weren't a whole lot
of people there.  
  
Well, you think anybody cares about that? No. They were on TV, weren't they?
That's all that counts.  
  
So what are we trying to do? Fill the arena or make sure people are watching
on television?  
  
People in Dallas have done an amazing job. The arena is sold out. Is it 'cause
it's Friday/Sunday and people don't have to take five days off from work to
wait till Tuesday night to play? I don't know. I don't know. Does ESPN like
Friday/Sunday? No. Are they going to make sure it gets back to Sunday/Tuesday?
Yes. Is that good for us? No. Is it good for them? Yes.  
  
In the end, who is going decide what's what?  
  
I'm not blaming anybody. I'm just saying that that's the world that we live
in. 2002, we played in front of 30,000 people at the Alamodome. Now we're
worried about sellouts? A lot has happened in that time.  
  
You know, we have to figure out how to work together, make it work for the
actual student-athletes, 'cause we always use that term, you know: What's best
for the student-athletes? Not playing at 10:00 at night, that's not best for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. The other folks that have gone with you to all of these Final Fours
are your fans, the aura that has been built over your program over time, the
expectation to win, knowing you're going to win. How much of that aura do you
hope to, like, get your players to buy into? How much of it do you want them
to resist? How do you handle that balance?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Resist, what do you mean?  
  
Q. How much of it do you want to be, This is our team, this is unique to
us, and how much of it do you want them to buy into, This is UConn, this is
the expectation of UConn women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't know that you can always separate the two. We
are what we are. No one's imposed this on us. No one makes us who we are.
We've done this ourselves.  
  
The kids that choose to play at Connecticut are choosing us as much for what
they hope to do when they get there as for what's already been done. They want
to be a part of that.  
  
There's a lot of programs in the country, a lot of sports, even in the pros,
that have that kind of reputation. People want to play there. Like Kia said,
how to separate what's happened in the past from what's happening right now is
important. We've had teams in the past where kids would come to Connecticut
and they thought, Yeah, I get to Connecticut, I go through pre-season, I get
my uniform, then I call my parents and tell them, This is what the parade is
when we win the national championship.  
  
When they realize they're going to get their ass kicked every day in practice,
they don't like it, they quit. Why did you just not come here and come to the
parade? Things don't just happen by themselves. You have to make them happen.  
  
Not every kid understands that part of it. So, yeah, they want to be a part of
it. They want to be part of the legacy. They want to create it. At the same
time, you should see in recruiting. When we're recruiting, like, a great
player out of high school, invariably they'll say, Why do you want to go to
Connecticut? You're going to be compared to Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and
Stewy [Breanna Stewart]. I don't know. Go to someplace where you'll be
compared to somebody no one has ever heard of.  
  
When you come here, there's some things you have to live up to. You can't
escape it. You might as well embrace it, enjoy it, let it help you, rather
than be, you know, something that detracts from you.  
  
Q. Geno, as the unquestioned leader of your sport in terms of everything
you've won, the NCAA, the Olympics, basically since Title IX, the number of
opportunities for women to coach women, that's been in decline. Do you think
that's an issue that needs addressing or not? Have you ever sensed resentment
among your peers because you won so much -- not because you won so much, but
because you're a man who has won so much?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think in the beginning, 30 years ago, 20 year ago, 25 years
ago, yeah, there was a lot of that. There was a lot of that. By everybody? No.
But by a lot of people. This feeling of, Well, why aren't you coaching men?
Which is really the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  
  
But not anymore. I don't think anymore. I mean, there might be some old-timers
that still think that way. But not anymore.  
  
I would like to think I've done too much for the game, for the growth of the
game, for people to resent the fact that I'm a man. That doesn't exist
anymore. I don't even give it a second thought.  
  
As far as opportunities for women. There's a reason why there's not as many
opportunities for women. Not as many women want to coach. It's quite simple.  
  
When I started coaching, I was 21, 22 years old. Somebody asked me to coach
women's basketball, ninth grade girls. I didn't start coaching there because I
thought I'd be talking to you in Dallas. That's what I did because it was kind
of cool, and I liked it.  
  
Then I coached college girls. Then I coached high school guys. Then I was an
assistant at Virginia for four years. I didn't just drop out of the sky and
land at Connecticut with 11 national championships.  
  
So anybody who resents that, that's their problem, not mine. I worked my ass
off to get here.  
  
Back then, women had very few opportunities other than teaching maybe, some
other jobs that certainly couldn't even imagine the opportunities that my
players have today when they graduate. So what happened? Kids graduate from
college. They're pretty sharp. The opportunities available to them, light-
years different than they were when I first started 30 years ago.  
  
Then they look at the profession itself. They go, I really need to put up with
that crap? I can get a job at Travelers, making X, live a normal life. You
want me to sit in a gym with 400 other coaches and watch 17-year-old spoiled
brats play and I have to take five of them to come play for me? Not everybody
wants to do that. Why? They have options that they didn't have 25, 30 years
ago.  
  
So it's not like people are consciously depriving women of opportunities.
There's just too many other choices that, quite frankly, are better choices
for a lot of women. And the ones that do choose to get in it, they're really
passionate about it, they work their butt off. I've never had anything but
women on my staff. I hope they all want to be head coaches. I hope they move
on and become great head coaches.  
  
A lot of them at some point go, I don't like this business. I want to have,
like, a normal life.  
  
What are you going to do? Make them stay in the business? It's a function of
how much we've done to elevate women in our society - not nearly enough. But
they have other choices, other than be a phys-ed teacher and a coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, guys.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and good afternoon, welcome to today's Women's Final
Four head coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll
have the opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Stanford Cardinal,
Tara VanDerveer. Stanford is playing in its 13th Final Four and is pursuing a
third national championship.  
  
Before we get to your questions this afternoon, Tara, if you would, just a
word of welcome, your thoughts on coming to Dallas, being a participant in
this year's Final Four.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: Thank you.  
  
Our team is very excited. I think we've worked really hard. This has been a
really fun team for me to work with. I'm really proud of the growth and
development of our players. I really thank our staff for doing such a great
job, our assistant coaches and staff.  
  
This is an incredibly close team. They were really looking forward to coming
to Dallas.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Tara. We'll start taking questions.  
  
Q. Tara, you have an association with Dawn Staley dating back to the
1990 Final Four when she played for Virginia and Stanford won its first
national championship. You coached her on the Olympic team. What traits do you
see in the team she coaches that you recognize from her days as a player?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Dawn is extremely competitive. She's a competitive person,
coach, player. She's very intelligent. She's very passionate about basketball.
I see all of these things, having coached her and known her for, I guess,
about 30 years. I started as a high school coach, too.  
  
All these things contribute to her outstanding job as a coach at South
Carolina and our future Olympic coach.  
  
Q. Tara, can you put in perspective, you and Coach Auriemma both took
over your respective positions back in 1985. You both coached against Dawn
when she was a player. Now all three of you are going to be at the Final Four,
have this Olympic connection as well with her taking over as national team
coach. It has a historical feeling, all three of you being there together. Can
you reflect on that a little bit.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I loved coaching Dawn. First of all, playing against
her, we played in the 1990 Final Four. Virginia, Stanford and Connecticut were
also in the '91 Final Four. Then we played against Dawn again in the 1992
Final Four semifinal game. Both were semifinal games for us.  
  
We do have a long history together, and a long history the three of us. Even
Dawn and Geno go further back being at Virginia.  
  
I think it just points to the fact that you have people that stick with
things, really love the game of basketball, are passionate about it. Dawn has
gone from being a passionate player to a passionate teacher and coach.  
  
It will be very exciting to be in Dallas with Dawn and Geno.  
  
Q. Talking about your team, the way that it's developed. It just seems
like this is a team that has gotten better as the season's gone along.
Everybody talks about doing that, but that doesn't always happen. Sometimes
teams do peak in February. It seems like this is a team that's found itself as
the year has gone along. Can you address maybe why that is. When did you sort
of feel like this team has a chance to do what it's doing?  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think in the beginning of the year, the goal was to win
the Pac-12. We didn't win the regular season. But there were certain goals we
had. We had boxes we were able to check off, whether it was our team wanted to
win a thousand games for me. When they wrote that down, I thought, This is a
group that I say gets it.  
  
I think the reason that they've improved, the reason we're in the place that
we're in, there's a couple of things. Number one, we have great senior
leadership on this team. This team is extremely close. They play hard, with
each other. They're extremely unselfish. They're hard-working. They're in the
gym early. They don't care who gets the credit. They're very excited for each
other. They want to continue playing with each other.  
  
As the season went on, we just got better and better and/or confident.
Different people are stepping up for us. That's why we're in the situation
we're in.  
  
Q. Tara, when you look at South Carolina, what in your opinion do you
think they do really, really well? How would you try to approach attacking
what they do really, really well?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I think they do a lot of things really well. They have
an elite player in A'ja Wilson. They get her the ball. She is a big presence
down low. They run well. I think they're a very well-coached team. They
rebound, they're an elite rebounding team. You have a low block presence, a
great rebounding team, you have people that are moving the ball. They're
fantastic one-on-one players.  
  
All of them put the ball on the floor really well. I think you're going to be
challenged defensively, you're going to be challenged offensively because
they're athletic and long. You have to rebound the ball.  
  
I think on every front, they are an excellent, excellent team.  
  
Q. Tara, I wanted to ask about your impressions of Marta's developments
from year one to this point in her career.  
COACH VanDERVEER: I think that she's helping us. I think she had a great
freshman year. I think she's helping us where she is, much more mature this
year. She is a floor leader. She is a fantastic passer. She really understands
the game of basketball. She's also someone that, for me, I can be extremely
direct with her. I don't sugarcoat anything with Marta. Sometimes I need
someone to be hard on. She gets that.  
  
But she, whether she's in the game, she might make mistakes. She might be
upset. But she really stays engaged mentally. She really focuses. She's a very
intelligent basketball player. She really understands things.  
  
So if she makes a mistake, I'm always shocked when she makes a mistake out
there. Marta, you knew not to do that, knew not to go under that screen.  
  
I know.  
  
But she's a really, really smart player, incredibly unselfish. I like how
she's worked really hard on her defense.  
  
Q. What was the recruitment of her like, trying to convince a player
from the opposite coast to come out across the country and play basketball?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, we've had a history of a lot of kids coming from the
East Coast. I think one thing for Marta was she really was serious about
academics. She's not sure if she wants to go to medical school. But I think
she really loves the challenge of the elite athletics and elite academics.
That's the situation she was in when she was at National Cathedral. She was at
a great school that also had really good sports.  
  
She's a terrific athlete, a soccer player and basketball player, as you
probably know. But I think it also helped that we have direct flights
(laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure you're happy to spend a couple days at home. How much
has this felt like a three-week road trip? Is anybody happy it's finally in
Dallas, with Karlie and Katie Lou?  
COACH VanDERVEER: You know, for us, it's not just been three. We went on the
road to Oregon, then on the road to the Pac-12 tournament, then we went to
Kansas, then we had some mechanical problems, we went directly to Kentucky. We
came back one day, got back Sunday night, leaving today to go to Dallas.  
  
The reason that it works is because this team and staff get along so well. I
mean, we really enjoy being with each other. It's fun.  
  
I mean, our bus broke down. We laugh and have fun. Just say, Hey, nothing's
going to get us down. That's the kind of team you want to coach. I'm really
enjoying it.  
  
As far as Katie Lou and Karlie playing together, I think it's great for the
Samuelson family they don't have to split up. But we want to give them a
dilemma. They want to be in the championship game. If we end up playing
Connecticut, I hope her parents will root for us in that game because they
have two more years to root for Katie Lou.  
  
Q. Tara, of all the teams you've taken to the Final Four, wouldn't you
consider this the most team-oriented team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes. This is a blue-collar team in the proud tradition of
Jim Harbaugh. This is a put on your boots, put on your hardhat, bring your
lunch bucket. This is that kind of team.  
  
I have never been any prouder of a team than I am proud of this team, and
happy for this team.  
  
Q. Tara, I wonder if you could kind of sum up what would be the key
points and development of Brittany McPhee? She's really come on here as
probably your top scorer now in the tournament. She looks like she's hungry to
score, but she's a great all-around player now.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Right. Well, you know, I think coming into this year, in the
fall, quite honestly, we needed Brit out there. Karlie got hurt. Even in the
fall practices, I mean, a lot of things. Brit got a lot of opportunity. I
think that's been the big difference. Her opportunity of getting the ball.  
  
This team moves the ball. It's coming to her more. She's able to take
advantage of it, knocking down the three, going to the basket. She's a worker,
number one. She's in the gym early, she stays late. She's improved her defense
and her passing. Really she's improved her basketball IQ. She studies the
game. She's always loved the game of basketball.  
  
She's gone from being a great high school player to now becoming a great
college player through her hard work and her coachability.  
  
I think more than anything in the tournament, she's gained a lot of
confidence. She's playing with supreme confidence right now. It's really
exciting.  
  
Q. Tara, what is your schedule today? Are you flying out right after
practice?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Yes, we had yesterday off. People were able to just relax.
We're done with finals. I think they just had a nice day.  
  
Our team watched the game last night in the locker room. Had Chinese food.
They were I'm sure just really enjoying being together.  
  
We're practicing right now. They're warming up. We're practicing today. We
leave at 1:00. We're the first team off in the morning for interviews and
everything. We'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Tara, with you and Dawn, when she first got into coaching, she wasn't
sure she wanted to do it. She was still playing at that time in the WNBA. Did
you sense, even when you were coaching her with the national team, that that
was going to be her destiny, that she was going to coach?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, I didn't know it was her destiny. If she went into it,
I knew she would be really good.  
  
First of all, she understands the game of basketball. She sees the floor
really well. As a player, she was a tremendous passer. She's a tremendous
competitor. I think those things, understanding the game, teaching the game.  
  
I think Dawn, if she was going to do it, I knew she would be really good. I'm
so proud of her and so happy for her. Honestly, I wish we weren't playing
them. I root for her and their team.  
  
But, you know, I think she's done a terrific job. I think Dawn also knows that
she doesn't know it all. She surrounds herself with really capable assistant
coaches. It's always about trying to do the best job for her team.  
  
Q. You mentioned being proud of this team. You've made reference before.
Is this a team that reminds you most of that '92 bucket of bolts team?  
COACH VanDERVEER: It does, it does, yeah. There's just a lot of coincidences
with that team. We're excited about this team. I don't know that I've coached
a team that's any closer than this team, you know, 13 players.  
  
This is not a start-studded team. We have players that are really good at
certain things, and they've got to do those things. But they understand their
role, and they embrace their role. The unselfishness, just the team
cohesiveness is something that you can't teach and you can't coach. It kind of
has happened.  
  
I told our team today when we were in our team circle, I said, Maybe 10 years
from now, 20 years from now you'll look back and understand what you have. But
let me tell you, it's something very special.  
  
Q. In regard to South Carolina, when they lost Coates, their center
inside, Kaela Davis is a 6'2 " guard that has asserted her game a lot. What
have you seen from her and what challenges does she present? They are a
different-looking team than they were in the earlier part of the season.  
COACH VanDERVEER: We kind of had to do the same thing with Notre Dame.
Obviously South Carolina had more time to adjust to it. They went from
basically a two-post team to a four-around-one team. They're more athletic.
They spread the floor a little bit more.  
  
They have this anchor inside. They can go to Wilson. I mean, she is shooting
like 60%. They might not have the same depth, and obviously they're better
with Coates, but they're really good without her, too. Like you said, Davis
has stepped up, and other players kind of filled that void.  
  
People asked about Brittany McPhee. The cork comes off the champagne and other
people bubble up. That's what Davis is doing.  
  
Q. Tara, what kind of recruitment, if at all, did you do for Katie Lou
Samuelson? Could you share how that went, why you think she ultimately decided
to go across the country.  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, Katie Lou, her two older sisters were at Stanford. We
recruited her. She made the decision. You'd have to ask her. It was totally
her decision.  
  
We wish her well. Obviously the team is doing well. But we recruited her just
like we recruited Karlie or Bonnie or any of the players that are on our team.  
  
Q. Coach, it's the first trip to the Final Four in a little while in
terms of you only have three players that have been there before. What do you
think this experience is like for them being back a second time, and for your
first-timers who are experiencing all this, especially with all the media
attention they'll have to deal with?  
COACH VanDERVEER: Well, you know, I don't think it's bad for women's
basketball that other teams have been going. Obviously, we want to go. But I
think it just shows, we went in 2014, and I think having gone, I don't know,
six or seven years out of the 10 years, I'm very proud of the fact that we've
been going a lot.  
  
Our seniors are very excited to go back. Our freshmen and underclassmen are
really excited to see what it's like. We want to have a great time there. I
think the fact that the older kids have been there will help the younger kids.
I think it's a good bridge for them to say, Hey, this is what to expect, this
is what you do. It will be fun for all of them.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks again, Tara. Safe travels. We look forward to seeing you
there.  
  
COACH VanDERVEER: We'll be on our way down there later on today. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks, Dawn
Staley.  
  
South Carolina is playing in its second women's Final Four and pursuing its
first national championship in 2017. I know Coach Staley and the Gamecocks
just arrived here in Dallas. We'll bring in Dawn for some opening comments,
then take your questions.  
  
COACH STALEY: Well, we're super excited to be here in Dallas participating in
our second Final Four of the history of our program. We beat some incredibly
competitive teams to get here. Just grateful and thankful for the opportunity
to play on the third week in the NCAA tournament.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks so much, Dawn. We'll take questions at this time.  
  
Q. Dawn, you had your first brush with Tara VanDerveer back at the 1990
Final Four when you were a player, and you played for her in the '96 Olympics.
What is the difference between playing for Tara and playing against her?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, there isn't a whole lot of difference. You know
that you're going to be well-prepared for any situation that you'll see in the
game. Tara has taught me so much about the game as a player, that I still use
the foundation of how I approach games from the days in which she taught me as
an Olympian, the times we spent together.  
  
The key is preparation. You need to always be able to put your teams in
situations that they will be successful in, you know, not too much, not too
little, but just holding players accountable for their end of the bargain to
make dreams come true.  
  
A dream came true for me when I played for Tara in the 1996 Olympic Games.  
  
Q. I'm not sure, have you not beaten her as a player or coach competing
against her? How big would that be in the big picture?  
COACH STALEY: I'm o-fer. I'm part of the 1,000 wins that she has. I'm one of
the defeated teams in that total win category. I mean, she's a hard win. She's
been in these situations a number of times, and she definitely uses her
experience against us.  
  
We're hoping that Dallas brings us a little bit of different luck.  
  
Q. Dawn, just wondering how your team has been able to withstand the
loss of Alaina Coates. Has anybody in particular stepped up for your team
during this time?  
COACH STALEY: Well, how we've approached any adversity we've faced this
season. We do it just like it's a kink in our armor. But we keep moving
forward. We don't rest on, you know, people that we don't have. We don't rest
on the laurels of not having the services of Alaina Coates. We knew we
wouldn't have her, so we have to move on and figure out ways to capitalize on
who we have.  
  
I think Kaela Davis has been a beneficial of the void that Alaina Coates has
left. It put her in a position where she gets the ball in her hands probably
50% more than she did when Coates was in the lineup.  
  
Probably our entire perimeter players, because we've gone to a smaller lineup,
and it's creating driving lanes. A'ja Wilson is able to block the block, work
the entire paint area without feeling like she's on top Alaina and her
defense.  
  
Q. Dawn, I wanted to ask you, not just you and Tara being in the Final
Four, but Geno, too, two past Olympic team coaches, you taking over that role,
just the thread that's been there with the three of you, having that much of a
prestigious role with USA Basketball, now all at the same Final Four.  
COACH STALEY: I think it's great. Our USA Basketball family is back. I'm so
happy to be in that number. We all have made sacrifices for the greater good
of our sport. For us all to be here says we're doing things the right way.  
  
We've given so much to the game, and the game in turn has been the greatest
gift that keeps on giving. I want to be amongst greatness. This opportunity
does that. I'm extremely happy.  
  
I also want to be a national championship coach, just like the two of them.  
  
Q. After you had the great game against Mississippi State in the regular
season, battled with them in the SEC tournament, you sort of suggested you
wouldn't be surprised to see Mississippi State make the Final Four. Now both
of you guys are there. Can you comment on what that means to the SEC, to have
two programs in the same year, two programs that are relative newcomers to
this kind of stage?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think what the SEC does is it prepares you to play in
NCAA play. You have so many different styles of play. You've been battle-
tested in so many ways. When you face other competition, you feel familiarity.  
  
You don't fret any situation. I think Vic has done a tremendous job with his
players. He gets them to play on the biggest stage. I'm not surprised that
he's here. To watch them play, to watch what they've done in the tournament
thus far, you know, I hope we've all prepared him to face UConn and give them
a good go at it.  
  
I think they have all the key ingredients to make the SEC proud on Friday
night.  
  
Q. You do have a couple players who have the Final Four experience with
Bianca and A'ja. A'ja played very well in her Final Four two years ago. Does
that help a little that they've been through this before?  
COACH STALEY: It helps, yeah, when you have experience at the Final Four. We
feel different as a coaching staff. We feel better prepared to know what is
expected.  
  
We enjoyed it two years ago. We absolutely did. Was it a business trip? It
absolutely was. But when it's your first time, you know, you're seeing all the
different moving parts, and you're trying to fit all of it in to make it work.  
  
Whereas now, we know what to expect. Although we're going to enjoy it, we're
going to be better prepared for our players and our program, especially the
ones that haven't experienced it.  
  
It's a business trip, but it's one we're going to enjoy every step of the way.  
  
Q. Dawn, I was wondering how your team has come up physically with all
the travel, going to the West Coast, now to Dallas. Does it help going
straight from California to Dallas instead of coming home first?  
COACH STALEY: You know, we went out to California on Wednesday, last
Wednesday. That extra day really helped us acclimate and adjust to Pacific
time. We just didn't think it was feasible to go back to Columbia and Dallas
without us feeling another time change.  
  
Our staff did a great job at just coordinating us, taking care of business in
Stockton, making sure we were okay to seamlessly win the regional and then
come right from California to Dallas.  
  
There's no sweat off our brow. We want to be here. This is what we worked so
hard for all season long. We probably would have gone to the moon and back if
it was necessary for us to participate in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Dawn, I wanted to kind of get your mental thoughts right now. Last
year you had a great run. As a coach, what do you think you might change this
year preparing for it now, because you have the experience?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think, you know, practice times. It's a shorter week.
It's hard to prepare. It was an open practice last year. It's not an open
practice this year. We just get a chance to do all of our preparations at the
arena. We don't have to go to another gym.  
  
At this time of the year, rest is equally as important as preparation is.
Sometimes that preparation, we'll be watching film and preparing in that way,
just communicating and talking about some things, as opposed to always being
on the court. That's probably the biggest adjustment that we'll make.  
  
Q. For the two veterans you have returning with experience already, what
would you tell them to prepare the other girls who haven't been there yet? How
would you tell them how to lead them for this next game coming up?  
COACH STALEY: Well, you lean on them. A'ja Wilson and Bianca Cuevas both have
Final Four experience. What they're doing is they're leading them. But the
most important thing is our kids have stayed the course, stayed in character.
We're going to enjoy this. When it's time to prep, we'll prep. We'll prep like
any other regular-season game. Probably over half of our team never
participated in the SEC tournament, as well. So we'll take that same approach,
that same tournament approach, stay the course, and keep it as normal as
possible so we can perform on Friday night.  
  
Q. Dawn, we have an WNBA team here now. You played in Houston back in
the day. Have you heard from some of your former colleagues that you played
basketball throughout the years? Do they reach out to you and let you know how
well you're doing?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I think nowadays people use Twitter to communicate and
social media to communicate. My Twitter timeline is blown up. I got to go
through to make sure that I didn't miss anybody.  
  
DeLisha Milton is probably the one that reached out through text messaging.
But it's been unreal, the amount of support throughout the season, not just
getting here to the Final Four, but just the season, how our basketball family
has reached out and supported us from afar.  
  
Q. As you look back over your life, we have to reflect on the man who
encouraged you, and that's the late Dave O'Brien at Temple. You're writing
history right now because you're giving our African American young people not
only the chance to play the game, but now you're coaching. How do you feel
about making history and the possibility of winning a national championship
and the Final Four?  
COACH STALEY: I think what's taking place is quite incredible. I give all the
glory to God. Obviously I'm a vessel in all of this, and just appreciative
that He gave me a profession in which I can be a dream merchant for other kids
and other people.  
  
I'm just really grateful for the opportunity to do that because the game of
basketball has been incredibly giving to me. I feel like I owe it, I got to
repay the debt, for what it's given me. What better way to do that than help
young people realize their dreams through the sport.  
  
Q. Dawn, what do you think Stanford does best? What do you have to do to
combat what they do best?  
COACH STALEY: Stanford is very disciplined. They are a team in which they do a
great job of reading defenses and offenses. They make you go a little deeper
in what you're trying to accomplish. They make you go through options, you
know, three, four and five instead of one and two. That's hard for teams which
aren't organized, don't have great guard play.  
  
For us, they'll be a challenge for us, but we also have seen a lot of
basketball. We've seen a lot of different looks this particular year.
Hopefully we'll draw on our experiences of playing in the SEC, of playing the
four games we played in the NCAA tournament this year, to our advantage, in a
stingy team like the Stanford Cardinal.  
  
Q. Dawn, the way A'ja has been able to carry the load she has. It put
more load than ever on her with Alaina out. Talk about how well she's
responded. Then does Stanford -- are they a little bit harder to guard or
figure out because they don't really have a star? They're really a complete
team. You don't know who is going to hurt you on a given night.  
COACH STALEY: Uh-huh, I'll answer the A'ja question.  
  
A'ja, I'm super proud to watch her leadership. Obviously I know what she can
do as far as being a stat filler. But the way she's taken on the leadership
role, it has been quite remarkable.  
  
When teams are dealt any type of adversity, people step up. People fill a
void. Although A'ja was our leader before Alaina's injury, she's taken it to
another level. To see a young person do that, I'm proud. I'm proud. That's why
I'm always politicking for her being the national Player of the Year because
of these circumstances that our team has experienced this year. Not just the
wins and the losses and the points and the rebounds and the blocks, but a
national Player of the Year. They don't let their team lose, no matter what
adversity they're dealt with.  
  
A'ja has been dealt a great deal of it this year, her injury, losing Alaina
Coates, having three different starting guards. She still has been able to
perform at a high level.  
  
Then the Stanford question. They are hard to guard. Yes, they have a lot of
moving parts to what they do. Any one person can get hot on their team. But
they got the key ingredient to beating you. If you don't have a star, star
player, you do it by committee. When you do it by committee, you have to play
each committee member, you have to give them their own space. You don't have
to double-team any one person, but you do have to prep for them top to bottom.  
  
It creates a longer scouting report and more information that our players have
to remember and execute.  
  
RICK NIXON: Dawn, really appreciate you jumping on. Welcome to Dallas. We look
forward to seeing you this weekend.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you so much.

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Mississippi State Bulldogs,
Vic Schaefer. Mississippi State is making its first appearance in the Women's
Final Four and will be headed to Dallas here today.  
  
With that, to get things started today, I'll bring in Coach Schaefer. If you
would say a few words, what it means for you and your program to be coming to
Dallas for this year's Final Four.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: We're very excited, humbled and honored to have an opportunity
to continue to play. We feel like we've come out of a tremendous region. We've
had four very tough opponents. I'm really proud of my kids. They have been
tough and resilient through the entire two-week process, as well as the entire
season.  
  
Just are excited to continue to play. I've got some kids from Texas that I get
to bring back home for this great event. Again, just appreciate all the hard
work, commitment and dedication it takes to do something like this. This is my
third Final Four professionally as a coach. I know the commitment that it
takes from an administration, to players, to assistant coaches.  
  
As the head coach, I'm really appreciative and just thankful to be a part of
this.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks so much. We'll start taking questions.  
  
Q. Vic, I wanted to ask, on UConn's broadcast last night, he talked
about a meeting you had in Houston. I guess it was more of a chance meeting.
You never got to go up there like you maybe had planned. Can you talk about
that meeting, what y'all talked about. He said he doesn't take any credit for
what you guys accomplished.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think even more than that meeting that was by chance
in September during recruiting, he and I got to spend about a day and a half
together in Colorado Springs last summer recruiting.  
  
It was really great for me to just talk to him about, you know, the game and,
in particular, offense. Again, for some reason, I've kind of been known
throughout my career as the defensive guy.  
  
Offensively just talked to him a little bit about that particular side of the
game. He shared some stories with me about him early in his career, what kind
of brought him to where he is. I think they're so multi-dimensional
offensively. Of course, all his players are multi-dimensional, can do so many
things.  
  
Again, until you've watched them and played them, I have a true, real
appreciation for them defensively. They score so many points, their defense
gets overlooked. Just like last night, they made Oregon miserable.
Defensively, they were just in passing lanes, refusing to let them make
passes. They took the three-point line, chased them off of that.  
  
Because they are so prolific point-wise, a lot of times people don't pay
attention to that. But their defense is really, really good.  
  
Our conversation, more me picking his brain about, Hey, how did you get to
this point where you're just so doggone good offensively? Kind of like being
around somebody that's 100. If you're 100 years old, I want to know what
you're eating for breakfast, I want to know what time you're eating breakfast,
what you're eating for lunch.  
  
I was pretty specific in trying to get some information out of him. It was
great. He was super.  
  
Q. One of the things he talked about, clearly he talked about your team
is a lot different than last year when you played, and he said he doesn't have
to convince his team of that because they saw what you have done in this
tournament, what you did against Baylor. What about your team? Is there
something you have to convince them that you're a different team than the team
that played UConn last year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think my team realizes that. I think we're a year older, a
year wiser. So I think from that standpoint, our kids believe we're different.  
  
Now, the fact of the matter is, UConn may not have the same personnel, but
they're still the same, you know, dominating UConn program. They're a well-
oiled machine. They have tremendous chemistry.  
  
Even though the numbers or the names may change, the program itself just keeps
rolling. So I think our kids understand that. At the same time, we know we
can't really get caught up in the whole UConn thing. We've got to do what we
do. We've got to be more concerned, I think, about Mississippi State than we
do about anything else.  
  
I think that's probably where we've kind of evolved maybe even from a year
ago. We're going to be more concerned about us, making sure we're doing what
we want to do, how we want to do it, instead of being so consumed with
everything about our opponent. That can get overwhelming, quite frankly.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Auriemma mentioned something about recruiting, how he
and his coaching staff go after players who want to be coached, who want to
live up to the responsibility of playing for Connecticut, the expectations
that go along with it. The kids that you've brought in as seniors, who have
kind of laid the foundation, how do they epitomize that kind of mindset or
mentality to help get you guys where you've gotten?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think they're exactly that. I think they're accountable. I
think they came here with an idea of setting a precedent and being a part of
something special, about being the pioneers to come in here and really create,
you know, something that's never been done.  
  
So I give those kids all the credit. Those four seniors, they'll go down in
history as the all-time winningest program to date, all-time winningest class
to date in the history of the program, and four of the greatest players to
ever play here.  
  
They deserve a lot of credit, obviously, for where we are today, the
turnaround of how we've accomplished this in such a short period of time.  
  
Don't want to take anything away from Coach Fanning. She had some great teams
here during her time, had some really good players, including LaToya Thomas
and Tan White. There was a couple years there in the last two that weren't
real good, but certainly she had some really good teams here. We certainly
don't want to diminish that fact.  
  
Q. Geno talked about that fact that he doesn't think kids have changed
in the sense that they still want to be pushed. In your sense of recruiting, I
know you approach it the same way you approach a scout for a new opponent,
what is the process like to try to find maybe the intangibles that a player
has or the makeup that they have to find out that they want to be coached,
they want to live up to a standard, they want to be a pioneer?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think there's a lot that goes into recruiting. It's
not just walking into a gym and watching somebody play. We're reading the stat
sheet, seeing how many points, rebounds, assists they have.  
  
I told you the story before. We sit at a table all the time and talk about
recruiting. We talk about, Where is the next McDonald's All-American, the top
50 player, next Gatorade Player of the Year. I want to know where the next
Dominique Dillingham is, somebody I recruited for her toughness, for her
competitive spirit, for her fire. Didn't recruit her for her jump shot.  
  
The kid has been a three-and-a-half year starter for us. When you do your
homework as a coach, you have to recruit kids that fit your style, that fit
how you want to play. You know what, they got to fit how you want to prepare.  
  
I think coaches find out all the time sometimes these great players that have
all these gaudy stats in high school, they don't want to come work. You've got
to earn your right to win. You've got to earn your right to win the game. That
comes with effort.  
  
Sometimes, you know, it comes too easy for kids at a young age. At this level
nothing comes easy. You've got to want to work. If you don't, it really can be
a struggle, especially at this level.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer, last year when you hired Carly Thibault as the
assistant coach, what did you see that you liked in her? What has she brought
to the table this year, during the run through the tournament?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, you know, Carly came highly recommended from a number of
people. Anybody that knows me, when I've had to replace an assistant, I really
take my time. I'm not one to rush into anything.  
  
In calling people across the country, from coast-to-coast, her name came up
quite a bit. Of course, I've known Mike a long time, not real well, but known
of him. He and I have crossed paths occasionally and talked.  
  
What she's brought to our program is really, at a young age, she is -- I'm
trying to think of the word. She's mature beyond her years, if that's the
right way to say it. Her knowledge of the game is really off the chart. Her
preparation skills are really off the chart. Her attention to detail, as my
entire staff, those are things that were important to me when I was an
assistant.  
  
I had a saying when I was an assistant, I wasn't paid to be wrong. I didn't
never want to be wrong to Coach Blair. So my assistants are the same way.
That's what I want. That's what I need.  
  
I think if you're going to be successful at this level, you better surround
yourself with really good people. I'm smart enough to know I can't do it by
myself.  
  
Carly has really fit in well here with my staff, with our players, with this
university. But her work ethic, her attention to detail has really been
pleasing for someone, who is, quite frankly, as young as her, not quite had
the experience. But, man, she is off the chart. She's been a home run for me.  
  
Q. Vic, two questions for you. First, I was looking at a story the other
day about the dynamic you and Blair, your daughter, have. When you mentioned a
seventh grade game where you stepped in there, how have you sort of done that
balance? Kim coached her daughter. We've had other coaches that have done
that. How have you kept that balance of when you're a dad and when you're a
coach?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I'm wondering before I answer, has there ever been a father-
daughter in the Final Four? I'm just curious, coach and daughter.  
  
You know, the balance has been real easy. I give her all the credit, and her
teammates credit. They've been great throughout this whole process.  
  
I think for us, most of the time when we see each other at school, it's always
coach and player. My kids grew up having dinner at the dinner table every
night. We sat down together. We talked about the day. We didn't let people go
sit in front of the TV or go up to their room and eat. We always had family
time.  
  
Because of our location, where we live, close to campus, where she lives,
close to campus, we still have those dinners a lot of times, usually on a
Monday night, on our off days. We still have that with her and her twin
brother, Logan, who is a student here.  
  
I can tell you, as a father, I'm miserable with an empty nest (laughter). I
can tell you, I don't like going home to that at all. But it's really been
unique and special. Obviously, she's earned her way. She's been a big
contributor throughout her career, but really down the stretch she's had some
big minutes for us, made some big shots.  
  
Q. Can you reflect a little bit on the path of your career. It's sort of
different than a lot of people do, probably different than your three
counterparts in the Final Four. You were a head coach, then you went about a
15-year period being an assistant coach, then became a head coach again. Can
you talk about what was the reason for why you did it that way. How did you
change as a head coach from the first time you did it to now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That first opportunity in 1990 was at a university that I
dearly love, got my master's from. When you got that job in 1990, I had never
coached women's basketball. I had no contacts in the game. I got that job a
month after signing date, there were three kids on the team. I was a green
tomato as a head coach, so to speak.  
  
I had to go out and recruit. I signed four players out of a newspaper in
Houston, Houston Chronicle. Then few junior college players nobody wanted.
That was my first recruiting class there.  
  
Went through some lean years to start with. But by the fifth year, we were
18-10. I was blessed to be Coach the of Year in the Southland. Coach Blair
told me a year after that, I think I'm going to lose Tom Collen. Think about
coming to Arkansas.  
  
I'm like, Man, I'm just getting this turned around, really happy. It didn't
happen. Tom didn't leave. Next year same thing, same place, at the junior
college national tournament in Tyler, Texas. He told me the same thing again,
I think I'm going to lose Tom, think about coming to Arkansas.  
  
Again, I had a young team, we were really good, going to be really good the
next few years. We loved Huntsville. But it did happen. The truth of the
matter is, we just had the twins. They were a year old. We were $25,000 in
debt. I was making $35,000 a year as a head coach at Sam Houston State. I had
to do it for my family.  
  
Coach offered to double my salary, give me a courtesy car, $1,000 in Reebok
apparel, if I remember it right (laughter). That's kind of what pulled me to
Arkansas, as well as being able to go work with him.  
  
Obviously we had six great years there. Went to the Final Four in '98.  
  
Then in 2003, we got to Texas A&M. That's another story. I really wasn't going
with him. I was going to be the next head coach at New Mexico State.  
  
Long story for another day, but ended up turning that down, took the associate
head coaching job with him at A&M in '03. Eight years later we win the
national championship.  
  
I've had a pretty incredible career. Had a lot of success with Coach. I think
a lot of people questioned five years ago what I was doing, why would I do it
here.  
  
I think what we've shown the country is what I believed when I came here; that
this is a place that wants to win, they're committed to winning. It's a
tremendous university. We have great facilities. It can be done. It just
needed somebody to come in here with a blueprint and a formula. We had that.
We had done it at Arkansas. We had done it at A&M. We just brought the
blueprint with us here and have put it into place.  
  
Q. Vic, I wonder how you approach trying to game plan against UConn.
Kelly Graves of Oregon talked about trying to eliminate catch-and-shoot
threes, pick your poison, if they're going to make 17- or 15-footers against
us, we're going to have to live with that and do our best. When you're looking
at them defensively to try to attack them, what do you see in terms of what
you can do?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't want to give away the game plan. I think obviously
they can do it all. I think that's what Kelly was basically saying. If he felt
like he had to give up something, he was willing to give up the 17-footers,
that's what he was willing to give up.  
  
I'm sitting here right now, was watching film before the phone call. Number
one, what do we do well? Number two, what do they do well? How is that going
to look when you meet head on?  
  
You try to figure out, Okay, is what we do well better than what they do well
better? Whatever which one wins out, you've got to deal with that.  
  
So with them, you know, they're just a well-oiled machine. I mean, that's the
only way to put it. They are a machine. Geno is a great coach. Not only do
they have great players, I mean, we talk about being attached all the time,
chemistry. They are. I mean, that's why they're so good.  
  
I think one thing we've got to do is we got to score. I mean, it's not going
to be a 50-48 game. That's where we've been different in the last two and a
half weeks. We've kind of maybe not focused so much on trying to hold
everybody scoreless, we focus more on, Okay, here is how we can attack and
score a little bit.  
  
If you look at our scores in the NCAA tournament, we've been able to score
some points. I think that's what's different about our team right now. That
was part of the reason for the change in the lineups. We had some kids that
were hot. They needed to be on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about this being your fourth Final Four in your
professional career. Now that you've done it as a head coach, does it feel
different than when you were an assistant? Is it comparable?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, it's my third. It is a little different in that there's
a lot more responsibility than just trying to develop a defensive game plan.
So there's not enough time in the day. The fact of the matter is this: I've
got to spend the bulk of my time with my kids and my staff, trying to get them
ready, you know, for Friday night.  
  
But there's so many other things that are happening that drag you and need
your time. That's where having a great staff comes into play, which I have.  
  
But the time demands are really, really difficult, to be honest with you. At
the same time, I'm not complaining, obviously. I couldn't be prouder. It's a
good problem to have. No doubt about it.  
  
Q. Vic, going back to Sam Houston State, how does an assistant boys'
basketball coach end up as the head basketball coach at Sam Houston State?
What did you learn from that first experience of running a program that you
carry with you?  
COACH SCHAEFER: That's a great question.  
  
You know, in 1985, I got my first job coming out of college. I was the
freshman boys' coach at Milby High School in Houston, HISD. That's the first
year they took the ninth graders to campus. At that time, the ninth and eighth
graders were off campus. I was the first freshman boys' coach at Milby High
School, for coach Boyce Honea, who is a legendary high school coach in the
state of Texas. A tremendous man, he's in the Hall of Fame. Grew up with his
son in my teenage years.  
  
From there, I coached AAU in the summer. I had some really good AAU teams.
After that second summer, I tried to apply everywhere to get into the college
game. Gary Moss was the new head coach at Sam Houston State. He hired me as a
GA. I quit my job as a freshman coach, drove to Huntsville, became a GA there
for two years.  
  
In the middle of the second year there, I lost my dad real suddenly. Not only
did I lose him, but Coach Moss got fired in the middle of his season. So we
finished out the season there.  
  
I went back and got my old freshman boys' high school job back at Milby. We
went 32-2, won the city of Houston championship. I moved back home just to
keep an eye on my mother. When you lose somebody that you've been waking up
next to for 43 years, it can be a bit of a shock. I wanted to make sure she
was okay. Moved back to Houston, got my old job back.  
  
In the spring of '90, Sam Houston State called and said, Hey, are you
interested in the women's job? They had just hired a coach, Debbie, her last
name escapes me, from Missouri. She had been there one year and left after
that one year.  
  
I said, No, I'm not interested.  
  
Anyway, that conversation happened three more times. Finally the last
conversation happened on a Monday morning. After I hung up saying, No, I
wasn't interested, we were in the PE office out in gym out back, Coach Honea
said, Who was that?  
  
That was Sam Houston State. They want to know if I want to come up and
interview for the women's job.  
  
He said, Why don't you do that? I'll cover your classes. He said, It will be a
great experience.  
  
I said, Coach, I don't want that job.  
  
He said, Just go interview, it will be good experience for you.  
  
I said, Coach, I have to go today because the deadline is at 12 noon. If they
don't have my résumé by then, it's too late.  
  
I believe they already made up their mind who they wanted to hire. I went up
there and interviewed, got the job. That's kind of how it all happened.  
  
That was a program that, you know, had just gone Division I. They were still
trying to live in the NIA budget days, yet try to be in Division I. So it was
really difficult.  
  
I remember my budget was $36,000 total. That was recruiting, travel, team
travel, paying for officials, postage for recruiting, telephone, the whole
nine yards. It's crazy.  
  
That's kind of how it all began.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything as a coach during those years that you carry
with you today, how to run a program?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah. Not only that, but, man, I went against some really good
coaches. Obviously Gary Blair was at Stephen F. Austin at the time. Stephen
F., Texas and Texas Tech were the only three schools in the state that were
really committed to women's basketball at that time. Across the country, there
was only another handful.  
  
I had to live going against Stephen F. Austin every year at least twice.  
  
No, you learn, look, first of all, it's different coaching guys from girls.
That was a piece that I had to learn early on. The best advice and the -- I
share this at every clinic I speak at. It's probably the biggest key to my
career. I got it from my wife early in our relationship. It's simply this: if
they don't like you, they're not going to play hard for you.  
  
That doesn't mean you have to be their best friend. But the bottom line is, if
they don't like you, and probably you could add if they don't trust you,
they're not going to play hard for you.  
  
I think that's been a really big, big turning point for me. It's helped me
throughout my career. I'm thankful for that from Holly.  
  
But just how to learn to run a program on a shoestring budget. I mean, you
talk about penny-pinching. I can remember calling restaurants saying, Hey, I'm
going to bring my team in. Would you give us free iced tea, lemonade, if I
bring my team in there. Save $2 times 20, $40. Throughout the year, it's a way
to penny-pinch nickels and dimes. That's what you did.  
  
I can remember going into Black-eyed Pea restaurant and telling them, You
can't order on the right side of the menu, you have to stay on the left.
Everything at the restaurant was too expensive at the Black-eyed Pea.  
  
You learn a lot. You have a great appreciation for so many things at this
level because you've been through the bus league, you've been through the
barbecue circuit, hey, we can't have that for dinner, we can't eat there. Hey,
make sure you clean your plate, appreciate what we have, those kinds of
things.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to reference your statement that you just made about
your past career, perseverance is definitely paying off. I want to say I'm
very happy for your team. I want to reference the 5'5 " point guard who scored
41 points in the last game. You also talked about players trusting you, liking
you. After reading her story about her stepfather passing, then she also
showed a great appreciation for you, her will to win, the 41 points, in my
opinion, says a lot about how your girls feel about you. She referenced you as
a father figure. I want to say you are right on point when you say if they
don't like you, they won't play hard for you. Those girls really show how much
they like you. My next question is, is there anybody on Connecticut's team
that you feel can contain her, Morgan William?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, first of all, thank you for the kind comments. Again,
not every day is peaches and cream. I'm sure there's some practices they don't
walk off the floor in love with their coach. That's part of it. I think kids
want structure, they want discipline.  
  
Again, my kids are loved by my entire staff, our entire community here. I
treat 'em and try to love 'em like my own. That can include sometimes a soft
hand in the back to love 'em, and a firm hand in the back when they stub their
toe. But that's what we do as parents. That's how we try to treat our student-
athletes.  
  
As far as Morgan William goes, I mean, Morgan obviously had a great ballgame
the other night. She is very difficult to deal with. I don't know, I'm sure
they'll have a great plan for her. When she's locked in like she was the other
night, she's very difficult to handle.  
  
Obviously she typically isn't someone we depend on to get 41. But, again,
that's how unique and special our team is right now. You've got to prepare for
a number of different weapons offensively that we have.  
  
Victoria obviously has been a big offensive piece for us throughout the
season. Then you roll out Blair in the NCAA tournament. She gets 39, 21, 18 in
the first two rounds. Now you're thinking, Okay, that kid. Breanna Richardson
is an explosive, dynamic player. Dominique Dillingham has added so much to our
offense with her game.  
  
You can go on and on. Obviously Teaira McCowan and Chinwe, my two-headed
monster down there, they have been fantastic all year long, averaging double-
double between the two of them.  
  
With Morgan, she obviously is an explosive guard. I'm quite confident they're
not just going to let her play HORSE on Friday night. Hopefully we're not
going to let them play HORSE either. I think we've got more kids that can do
the same thing she did. It's just a matter of finding who is hot. That night
it was Morgan William.  
  
Q. With Connecticut's bigs, they have a tendency to get into foul
trouble. What is your strategy to make sure they do get in foul trouble?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I certainly think obviously we're going to do what we
do. We've been scoring a lot of points offensively. We've been doing it a
number of different ways.  
  
When you have a short turnaround like we all have, I think there's just so
much you can plan for and do.  
  
Offensively we've really expanded I think. We're doing a number of different
things. Obviously our bigs are a big part of what we do. We're going to
continue to try to, you know, run some stuff for our bigs, as we try to run
some stuff for our guards.  
  
Obviously our bigs are our aircraft carriers, as I like to call them. They've
been carrying us. Teaira had a big game against Washington. She's had some big
games throughout the season, 25 against Florida earlier in the year. Both her
and Chinwe have been explosive for us down there. We just have to see how the
games going, what people are giving us.  
  
Those two have been seeing a lot of double-teams. When they're doubled, they
have to be able to make good decisions, not turn the ball over, get it to
people who are open. That's what they did against DePaul. That's what allowed
Blair to have the game she had.  
  
We always try to adjust. It will be dictated by what UConn does.  
  
Q. Vic, from your standpoint, even with all the success you've had the
last couple years in the SEC, the confidence building, the tournament run this
year, can one game like Baylor, such an emotional win against a high-caliber
program, can that be kind of a springboard for momentum, confidence, whatever
else, within a team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I certainly think so. We've grown a lot since last year's
debacle up in Bridgeport. That's a humbling experience, going through that. I
think our team has really grown from that, really been part of why we've had
the season we've had.  
  
When you go beat a team like Baylor that's just loaded, I mean loaded from top
to bottom with great players. Of course, Kim is a tremendous coach. Her and
her staff do an unbelievable job. When you beat a program like that, it really
I think, again, says a lot about my kids.  
  
That's who they are. That's who they've been all year. They've been that
tough, physical, aggressive, resilient bunch. We had to go through all those
things on Sunday against Baylor. They are so talented and so, so good.  
  
But our kids just fought. You can't help but come out of a ballgame like that,
playing against a team like Baylor, with continued confidence. But I don't
think you can beat a team like Baylor without going into that game with some
confidence, with an edge about you, knowing you've played three really good
teams in the NCAA tournament, you've come out of the Southeastern Conference,
where you played for two conference championships within a week, that you had
a chance to win a conference championship in the last week outright.  
  
So I think all that goes into it. But certainly I think it was a tremendous
accomplishment over a tremendous basketball program.  
  
Q. You've been around the women's game for a long time, some very good
programs. You've seen teams go on great runs. What separates UConn, being able
to sustain for such a long period of time? Is it getting great talent? Is
there more to that equation that you see with UConn?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think there's a lot in their equation. Again, we have a
saying in our locker room: It's not what we do but how we do it that separates
us from the rest of the country. I think that's UConn. I think Coach Auriemma
and his staff, it's not what they do -- there's lots of programs that have
lots of great players. But they not only have obviously some really good
players, as he said last night on TV, but it's what they do with those kids.
It's the development of those kids. It's the retention of those kids. It's the
accountability that you have with kids.  
  
I think they're cutting edge. I think they have a way they want things done.
They're going to stand firm and hold kids accountable to that. It's a formula
that's been so successful for them for so many years.  
  
Again, I think their plan, if you want to call it that, their strategy, their
philosophy, I think it just dictates and makes you be successful. As coaches,
we all can learn from that.  
  
That's why I wanted to spend time with him this summer. I've been doing it a
long time, 32 years. But I don't know it all. I know they've had so much
success. So when I get a chance to sit down with a Hall of Famer like that,
pick his brain, and he is willing to let me do that, I mean, what a blessing.  
  
I'm really appreciative of him for doing that with me. So you know what, it's
made us better. No question about it, it's made me a better coach. It's
certainly made our team better.  
  
RICK NIXON: Coach Schaefer, again, thanks for being with us. Safe travels to
Dallas. We'll see you soon.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all so much. Appreciate you. Go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 28, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches' media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.
UConn will be playing in its record 10th straight Women's Final Four in 2017
and will be playing for a record 12th national championship.  
  
I'll bring Geno into the conversation. Geno, just a quick opening statement,
your feelings on coming back to the Women's Final Four here in Dallas.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick.  
  
Like you said, we've been fortunate enough to be in the Final Four, this is
our 10th year in a row. It just seems like it gets harder and harder to
believe because it is getting harder and harder to accomplish this. The teams
that you have to beat year in and year out are getting better and better.  
  
This year certainly with Albany and Syracuse, UCLA, then Oregon. We're very
fortunate to be able to make another trip to the Final Four. It doesn't get
any easier from here. The teams that are going to be in Dallas are obviously
great, great teams.  
  
We're anxious to get down there. We're leaving today. It's a real quick
turnaround from last night. But I think once we get settled in there tonight,
we'll be like everybody else, and we'll get ready for Friday night.  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll go ahead and take questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Coach, you said something to the effect last night, on a taped
segment on the broadcast, about the stars of this year's team kind of taking
on the identity that the previous players have left. I'm not sure if there was
any buy-in from them. What kind of a process was that for them to take the
next step from role players to 'stars' or the ones who were leading the way?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's the big unknown going into the season, when
you're asking kids to do something that they haven't necessarily done to the
level that you're going to ask them to do it. You have to hope you have the
right kind of kids, the right kind of people.  
  
Certainly they're good players. I mean, obviously we wouldn't be where we are
if they weren't really good players.  
  
But, you know, in order to accomplish what we accomplished, you can't just
have good players, you have to have a certain maturity about you. You have to
approach things, you know, in a way where you do take full responsibility. You
don't have the luxury that they had last year of, Well, if I play great, we
win by a lot. If I don't play great, we win by almost a lot. That was the
world they lived in.  
  
Now you're asking them to go immediately to, If I don't play great, we're
going to lose. So generally you have to suffer a little bit and lose a little
bit to have that realization hit home.  
  
But for these kids, they showed a maturity that I didn't know if they had or
not. They looked around and made a quick decision early on, It's on all of us.
They all took responsibility. That's why we had the success that we had.  
  
Q. Last night on the telecast, there was a reference to last summer,
after the game you played against Mississippi State in the tournament last
year, that Vic Schaefer reached out to you, you got together. Is that
accurate? What was the conversation like when y'all met?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Somebody asked me about that. I didn't know exactly where that
came from. I had a chance to speak with Vic after the tournament last year. We
ran into each other in Houston. I don't know what we were doing down there. I
wish I knew what it was. I can't even remember what it was.  
  
We just ended up talking over, you know, a drink and some food. Believe me, I
didn't give Vic anything he didn't already know. We just discussed, you know,
in general what we do offensively, what our philosophy is. It was just us
basically going back and forth on a couple ideas. It wasn't me, believe me,
saying, Hey, Vic, if you do this, this and this, next year you guys are going
to be in the Final Four. There wasn't anything like that at all.  
  
I think what they did this season was remarkable, not because all of a sudden
they're in the Final Four, but because they already had a good team. They
changed the look of their team, even though they had a lot of the same players
back.  
  
He did some things that were a little bit different than they did last season,
and it showed in their play. It was never more evident than it was the other
night against Baylor.  
  
They're an unbelievably good team. He's done an amazing job. Believe me, I
take none of the credit for that. Trust me.  
  
Q. That was just generally a chance meeting as much as anything? That
wasn't like he reached out and y'all planned to meet or anything like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. He had mentioned to me, Hey, I want to come up to
practice, I want to come up, spend a couple days. It never materialized for a
lot of different reasons. I was still involved with USA Basketball. Obviously,
he's got his thing going. We could never really put it together.  
  
It just kind of happened that we just had one night where we just happened to
be sitting and talking. It just was good. I enjoyed it. It was a learning
thing for me, too. They do things that we don't do. We do things they don't
do. Probably the same conversation you have with a lot of coaches in the off-
season.  
  
Q. Like you said last night, this is a different Mississippi State team
than what you played last year. Because of what they did to Baylor, I'm
assuming that you don't have to convince your players that this isn't the same
team you beat by 60 last year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, no, I don't have to convince them of that at all. The guys
that beat them by 60 aren't really playing in this game, you know. We have
three players that scored a lot of points that night and did a lot of things.
They're not here.  
  
Mississippi State has, if I'm not mistaken, almost their entire team back. And
they're better. You know, we haven't gotten to where we are by pretending that
anybody is not as good, or is not good enough to beat us. That's not how we've
gotten to where we are.  
  
If we're not going to take Oregon lightly, we're certainly not going to take
Mississippi State lightly.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you a question about your coaching staff. As you
mentioned a while ago, you had to coach Team USA in the Olympics. How do you
keep your coaching staff focused when you're busy doing stuff in order to keep
this thing going?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the good thing about it was I didn't have to miss any
what you would call crucial time. You know, a lot of stuff that I did maybe
was in September when the staff was maybe out recruiting. So maybe we didn't
get a kid or didn't spend as much time with a kid because I wasn't there. But,
you know, I don't worry about that that much.  
  
I was never away during practice. I was never away during games. I was never
away during any of the crucial times or any of the important times that you
have to be there to make it all work.  
  
On the other side of that is, whenever I'm away, whether it's for a day, a
week or a month, my coaching staff is so good, they don't miss me one bit. And
my players kind of enjoy it when I'm not around, to be honest with you,
because I'm a pain in the ass.  
  
It actually does everybody good when I'm not around (laughter). My staff, I
don't have the kind of coaching staff where, you know, they follow me around
24/7 and they have to check with me on every single decision that has to be
made in our program. I'm lucky in that respect. If I didn't have that kind of
coaching staff, we might have had some slippage in what we're doing, but that
wasn't the case at all.  
  
Q. The SEC with Mississippi State, then we saw Florida, you look at
South Carolina, I mean, it's just amazing. Before it was Tennessee. I know the
conference, they keep bringing these teams in action. Can you talk about
that.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think it's the natural progression of things.
Everything goes in cycles. There isn't anything that lasts indefinitely. There
was a time when the SEC referred to itself as 'The always difficult SEC.' Not
by the commentators, it really used to bug a lot of people in this part of the
world that the SEC was somehow better than every conference in the country.  
  
They had some great coaches, don't get me wrong, and they had some great
teams. The last time I checked, there's only one SEC team that won a national
championship, and that's Tennessee.  
  
All of a sudden that kind of changed. A lot of the coaches are no longer
coaching in that league. Schools that were struggling back then, whether it
was Kentucky, Mississippi State, Texas A&M, obviously they won a national
championship, but I don't know if they were in the SEC then or not.  
  
So, you know, South Carolina obviously being the most recent, along with
Mississippi State. So you've got teams that really weren't prominent when
Tennessee was dominant. Auburn was more dominant. Georgia was. Vanderbilt was.  
  
Now they still have a lot of quality teams, it's just different names. That's
what's supposed to happen in college basketball. Each year there's supposed to
be more teams that get better and better.  
  
Q. Geno, if you could not coach UConn, what would be the team that you
would most want to coach, male or female? I'll let you go NBA, Olympics,
anywhere else.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh (laughter). Well, I've had the privilege of coaching the
best team in the history of the world, and that's the USA national team. I've
had a chance to coach them for eight years. If you were to ask me if I could
end my career only coaching one team for the rest of my coaching career, I
don't think it could get better than that, especially with the players that
I've had during those eight years.  
  
That's about the ultimate in terms of the talent that I was coaching, the
passion that they play with, the experience that they have. Just everybody
that they are, you know.  
  
When you've coached at that level, you know, you've coached those players,
it's pretty hard to say, I would rather coach anybody else.  
  
Q. Geno, I wondered if I could ask two things real quick. The first
being, when you look at the coaches in this group, you and Tara coached the
Olympic team, and Dawn is the new Olympic coach. You both coached against her
when she was a player. Could you put into historical perspective having three
people who have had that much involvement with the national team, still right
at the top of the college game. Then, if you could maybe talk a little bit
about Vic Schaefer, somebody who was an assistant for a long time, won a
national championship as an assistant, then became a head coach. I know he had
been a head coach before, but now is a head coach of a program that is in a
Final Four.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it really is an interesting dynamic in Dallas this
weekend. Obviously Tara has been to a number of Final Fours. I thought about
that yesterday, about the Final Four history that they have, that we have, USA
Basketball history that she has, that I have. Then you throw into that, you
know, a former player of hers, a former assistant of mine in the Olympics, a
great player at the Olympics that played for Tara and coached on my staff.  
  
You really couldn't orchestrate something like that. It kind of just has to
happen. It's unique. You don't see that generally anywhere, much less in a
Final Four.  
  
Then, as far as Vic is concerned, you know, when you're an assistant for a
long time, you always worry, Am I going to get a great opportunity? Then, when
you get an opportunity, Am I ever going to be able to take advantage of it?
Then you find yourself in the exact same place you were when you were an
assistant.  
  
That to me is a testament to how much he's worked, how hard he's worked, how
much he's given to the game, what he's getting in return. It's what he
deserves. You went to a place that never played at this level, and has been
there now in a short period of time.  
  
The coaches that are in this Final Four, none of them are getting there by
accident. Nobody stumbled into this thing, believe me.  
  
Q. Napheesa Collier obviously had a great season. You seem to have a fun
relationship because you're always teasing her about something. She plays it
pretty close to the vest with the media. You don't see a lot of her
personality. Can you share a little bit more of her personality, what kind of
drives a kid like that, especially the type of sophomore season she's had.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, in some ways she's very introverted, like she comes
across in the press conferences, being interviewed. But away from all that,
she's kind of a kid. She doesn't take herself or things too seriously. She
doesn't really stress about much, including guarding people. She doesn't
really hold onto things. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't wallow in it. She
just moves on to the next thing.  
  
She has tremendous confidence in herself. It's a confidence based on she's
worked at it, she's put the time in. She has a lot of God-given things.  
  
She's a little more mature than her years as a player. As a person, she's
exactly her age. Maybe that helps her a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, Vic Schaefer made a lot of changes to his lineup and rotation,
team runs about 10 deep or so. How does that increase the difficulty in game
planning against Mississippi State? What do you expect to see against
Mississippi State on Friday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think Vic did some really courageous things. It takes
a little bit of courage to, one, extend your bench, because you have to live
with some of the challenges that come from that. I mean, there's a lot of
challenges when you only try to play six players or seven players, like we
have right now. That's not by design, believe me.  
  
But there's a lot of challenges when you're trying to play eight or nine, as
well. He's done some great things. He's moved some starters, made them come
off the bench a couple games.  
  
I think he's done what good coaches should do: he's followed his instincts,
he's followed his gut, and he's done what he thinks is best for his team. It's
worked out. It's worked out great.  
  
You know, a lot of times a lot is made over how many players somebody has.
This team has 10 players or nine players. This team has five post players that
are all really, really good. That is a huge problem. The only thing you can
console yourself with, only five of them play at one time.  
  
What you got to do is you got to deal with the five that are on the floor. We
don't necessarily try to get into how many players are they going to play.
We're more worried about what is their style of play, what are those players
going to do when they get in there, what is their team identity, what are they
going to try to get accomplished against us, and how do we combat that.  
  
But I think what he's done has gotten them to where they are. I don't think
that's going to change. I don't think there's any easy answer for it.  
  
Q. Geno, I wanted to get your impressions of Chloe Pavlech, a first-year
GA on your staff. Would you say her relationship with your players is almost
like peer-to-peer, given they're basically all within the same age bracket?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, Chloe has been great. I've really enjoyed getting to
know her. She's got a great way about her. She really wants to learn. She's in
a tough situation, though. That's the hardest part for someone who is getting
into coaching right out of college. You're not a player, so the players don't
look at you as a player, because they know you talk to the coaching staff all
the time.  
  
You're not one of the coaches because you're not really, like, a coach yet.
You're someone who's in limbo all the time. Navigating that is not easy. If
you try to be too much like a player, then the coaches are like, You're not
too serious about coaching. If you're going to be too much like a coach, the
players are not going to confide in anything.  
  
You really have to walk the fine line. I think she's done a great job of that.
She'll be here again next year. That will make it a little bit easier for her.  
  
My impression of her right now is that she's on the right track to move up in
this business.  
  
Q. Geno, from a big-picture standpoint, so much has been written and
said about the streak, what you've accomplished, the 10 straight Final Fours,
all that sort of thing. From the inside, is there something that gets
overlooked, from your standpoint, maybe under-emphasized that people need to
pay more attention to about what's happened at UConn in terms of the success?
Second question. This year's team, there were even some quotes from you after
last year kind of hinting that this year may be different. When did you learn
in the course of the process that maybe things weren't going to be all that
different with this team, that there was maybe a special spark in this year's
team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know that there is anything magical certainly about
what we do. Not at all. I think what you see is what you get. We try to stress
some things that we think are important.  
  
There's a lot of teams that are really good. I mean, I bet you if you talked
to all the coaches at the Final Four this weekend, you might get four
completely different ideas about how to run a basketball program and how to
manage a season. They all got there, and they're all successful, you know.  
  
I don't think there's anything we do that's exclusive, that's revolutionary
and different. What we do is what works for us. What works for us, you know,
is the attention to little things that we think are important.  
  
That doesn't mean anything we do is different. It's not. There are things that
exist in every program. We just try to emphasize every one of those little
things.  
  
We try to recruit kids that love being coached. You say, Doesn't everybody?
No, not everybody recruits kids that love being coached. A lot of coaches
recruit kids that are really good players. That doesn't mean they love being
coached.  
  
We try, anyway, to recruit kids that we think want to be held accountable.
They want the responsibility that comes with playing at Connecticut, having to
live up to a certain expectation. They want to share. They don't want to
necessarily be the, you know, man, so to speak, on the team. They want to
share. They don't need to be the center of attention.  
  
That's so easy. Why doesn't every coach do that? They don't feel like it or
they don't think it's important. I don't know.  
  
I'm just trying to say what we try to do is try to find the kids that work for
us, for me, for how I am, what I value. That doesn't mean that it's the best
thing or the right thing or the wrong thing. It just works for me.  
  
Obviously, there's a lot of teams that go to the Final Four. They may have the
same philosophy, they may not. It works for them.  
  
So, you know, that's the best way I can answer that.  
  
Q. This year's team. When in the course of either practice or the season
did you get the feeling that this might be something special, that there
wouldn't be the expected dropoff, even with all the talent you lost from last
season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Last night, about 9:00 (laughter).  
  
You know, there was a time during the first two weeks of practice when I knew
we weren't going to be very good, 'cause we couldn't be very good the way we
were practicing, the way our players were approaching certain things.  
  
With two minutes left in the Florida State game, the opening game of the
season, I was convinced that we got major problems; this team is going to
really learn a huge lesson that they haven't had to learn up until now, and
it's going to hit 'em tonight, and we'll be better off for it. If it doesn't
hit 'em tonight, it's going to hit 'em against Baylor, for sure.  
  
We ended up winning that Florida State game. Probably shouldn't have. We
probably shouldn't have. Then we won the Baylor game. I think from that day
on, there was this sense of, We can be pretty good if we can beat those two
teams.  
  
Then when we won at Notre Dame, I think that sealed the deal. That pretty much
made everybody on the team feel like, All right, maybe we should stop talking
about who we don't have and start talking about who we do have.  
  
Q. Coach, going all the way back to the Chattanooga game, a game you win
by almost 40. I remember talking to Gabby afterwards. It seemed at that moment
they embraced the fact they needed to play their game at a different level, to
the UConn standard. Even though you won the close game against Florida State,
is that around the time in which you think they kind of adopted, We're not
living up to what was here before us? The second part is, talk about
Bridgeport, the support you got there, even with it moving out of there next
year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I have a theory on today's players. They will work very,
very, very hard. They will practice hard. They will compete at a real, real
high level, up until a point. I don't think our kids are that much different
than anybody else.  
  
When we were getting ready to play, let's say, Notre Dame, or getting ready to
play Baylor, or Texas, you could see the different look in their eyes in
practice, the different mindset, as opposed to when we were getting ready to
play a team that they didn't think was good enough to beat them.  
  
Maybe that comes from winning all the time. Maybe that is just natural. But I
think maybe around that time, and that's why I think this year it was hard to
coach at times, because you were trying to get them to understand, We're not
coaching for the regular season. You can't just decide who's good and who's
not. We have to be great every night.  
  
It took a while for us to really embrace that. The way you usually teach
players to embrace that is you bench them. You say, Look, you're not going to
play hard every night, you're not going to play as much. We didn't have the
luxury of doing that this year.  
  
We really had to embrace it as a team or we weren't going to have the kind of
success that we had. They did. It's to their credit. And they deserve all the
credit.  
  
Q. And Bridgeport, the support?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I heard a rumor that the NCAA is thinking about moving
the regionals to one site for all the regionals, which -- I don't know if the
NCAA is saying that, but people are suggesting that, which automatically
doesn't make it a regional anymore. The term 'regional' means people in the
region get to see the team live.  
  
I've also been concerned about, Well, we're going to move the regionals out of
the Northeast. I'm sure there's a lot of anti-Connecticut sentiment out there,
Let's get these guys on the road.  
  
Look, I don't care where we play. I don't care what time we play. I don't care
if we play in a parking lot with the lights on at midnight. We've had some
teams that are going to win, no matter what.  
  
I understand the idea that you don't want somebody being close to home all the
time. But one thing we're saying is, Well, we're going to move the regionals
to home court. Maybe now we can't do that. We have to move them to one place.
Those are two really big extremes.  
  
So a place like Bridgeport, whether we're in it or not - obviously if we're in
it, it's better. Our attendance in Bridgeport was higher than almost three
regions combined.  
  
It's a great place to have a regional. Well, they say, Only if Connecticut is
in it. Which regional is any damn good without the home team anyway?  
  
So, you know, there's no secret why the crowd is the way it is at Bridgeport.
One, they love basketball. Two, they think we're going to be in it. They're
going to buy the tickets ahead of time. Even if we're not in it, X number of
people are still going to show up because they're huge basketball fans here.  
  
So I'm not surprised by the turnout, not surprised by the enthusiasm of the
crowd, by the support. It was like that in Albany. It was like that in Rhode
Island a few years ago. There's a lot of really knowledgeable basketball fans
up this way.  
  
We'll see what happens in the future.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could comment, Morgan William had sort
of an amazing game, she's a real little person. She's listed at 5'5 ", but I'm
sure smaller than that. Can you talk about when you're facing a guard that's
that small. She didn't have any turnovers. She can be a difficult person to
guard and stop. Also, what do you think it does when somebody like that has a
game like that? I think a lot of people probably identify with her, were
cheering for her.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it was certainly one of the more remarkable performances
that I've seen in the NCAAs, especially by a kid that isn't necessarily used
to those kind of performances.  
  
So for her to have the kind of game she had in the biggest spot she's probably
ever been in, obviously her game is way bigger than her size. You know, it was
fearless. That's the best way I can describe it. She played the game
fearlessly. A lot of times kids get in that situation, they're afraid to lose.
She was playing all out, and only one thing in her mind: we're going to win.  
  
I was riveted to the TV the entire game. I was really, really impressed with
their team as a whole, but she was just incredible.  
  
I'm going to tell Crystal Dangerfield, who may be able to look her eye-to-eye,
This is a big game that could be won by little people, so you better get your
butt in gear.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thanks, Geno. We appreciate you being with us today.
Congratulations. We look forward to seeing you here in Dallas this afternoon.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. Thanks for having me.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 90, Oregon - 52  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I first want to congratulate coach Auriemma on a great game and
a great season so far. First chance I've ever had to play UConn and kind of
see up close exactly what they're about, how they play, and I'm not going to
make many headlines with this, but they're really, really good. I think we had
our team ready. Our team was confident going in. I just don't think we were
able to handle that that early, I think just kind of the shock of how good
they are, and got us on our heels quickly. I thought we kind of rebounded a
little bit in the second quarter, and again, in the third quarter just
unfortunately the turnovers doomed us right from the get-go, and that
defensive pressure I think really set the tone.  
  
I do want to say that I'm really proud of my team. I don't think anybody saw
this happening. But what I talked to them about after the game is this is
where we want to get to. I just -- you know, they've given us so much this
year. They've worked so hard. Our chemistry is phenomenal. We just made two
trips to the East Coast back-to-back with finals in between, and not once did
anybody on my team ever complain. They didn't complain about an 8:30 a.m.
start on Saturday our time, and they just gave it everything we had, that they
had.  
  
Just really proud of their effort. I'm happy for our seniors to be able to
leave a legacy to the University of Oregon and do something that our
University has never done in women's basketball. I think there are only good
things ahead, and I look forward to that.  
  
Q. Sabrina, an awful lot of talk is made of UConn's offense, but can you
talk about how frustrating it can be to play that defense?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, they're a great offensive team. They don't really beat
themselves. They don't turn the ball over, and they have weapons everywhere,
so it's definitely hard to play defensively, so we're going to work on it and
get better.  
  
Q. Sabrina, curious, you had spoken throughout this time about not
knowing what you didn't know, and I'm wondering when you sort of take the
totality of this experience in the NCAA Tournament now start to finish, do you
feel like you have a measuring stick for where you want this team to get to
over the next three years?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I definitely think now we have a feel for it,
especially playing these last two weeks into March. I think we're just going
to be excited come next year to see what we're going to reach. I think sky's
the limit for us next year as we continue to get better and work together.  
  
Q. Maite, 22 turnovers led to 32 points. Can you talk about what they
were doing defensively to turn you guys over?  
MAITE CAZORLA: They were pressuring us. They were denying us all passing
lanes. I think it was just our mistake. We didn't come to get the ball. We
just was standing there waiting for the ball to come to us. I think it was the
pressure.  
  
Q. Ruthy, from the tempo heroics at the end to tonight's disappointment
but yet getting the opportunity to go against UConn, what did you learn about
your game during this tournament, and what will you work on this off-season?  
RUTHY HEBARD: We got to go against UConn and everybody in this tournament, I
think we all learned a lot. I definitely learned what I need to work on, the
strength in my left hand and getting an outside shot for sure. I'm going to
work on it in the off-season.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I'm curious what's going through your head right now and
just this run; obviously you guys came from a long ways away, all the way
across the country.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we're obviously going to learn from this loss. I think
you have to learn from every loss, but we're going to put it behind us and
just enjoy this experience. It doesn't come around often, and we sure didn't
expect it to come around this soon. So I think we're all just enjoying the
moment and definitely living in the moment and not trying to worry too much
about what happens.  
  
Q. Sabrina, a lot of players when they're playing UConn and down by a
lot look defeated. You didn't look defeated at any time. In fact, you came out
and started the second half, were joking with your teammates. I wonder if you
could take me through what you were saying to them at that time and just in
general how you managed to stay so positive throughout.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I know we talked about it in the locker room and we
were in there trying to figure out ways to fix our mistakes, and then I said,
guys, we should just live in this moment. It doesn't come around often, and
just enjoy it. Enjoy playing against the No. 1 team in the country, and we're
going to try and do what they do because I think we can become the next UConn
here at Oregon.  
  
So then, yeah, we were joking around. We were obviously taking it seriously,
but I was just enjoying the moment to be honest. I think it was really fun.
The atmosphere was great, and playing against them is something that we'd like
to do more often and definitely learn from what they do there.  
  
Q. Ruthy, how is it tough to guard the perimeter with Katie Lou, Gabby
and Napheesa? How difficult was it for you tonight?  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's definitely tough. We're used to big post players and
they're a smaller team, more athletic, so we definitely used the scout and we
were prepared for it, and I think it'll be something we work on, too, for the
post to get faster and get used to playing inside and out.  
  
Q. Maite, I know you pride yourself on defense. What kind of things did
you learn about the defensive game from UConn that you might be able to steal
something here or there?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I think they're a really good defensive team more than
offensive. I think we need to learn from them. They don't make mistakes,
neither offensive or defensive, so I think that's one thing I take away from
them.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I wonder what it was like for you to see Jacinta and
Mar'Shay get to go out there and just have a couple of minutes on the court
and kind of have their college careers and be able to play in the NCAA
Tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well, they mean so much to our team and our program
since the beginning. They've kind of carried us and definitely guided us
through this whole journey that we had. So I think they enjoyed there time
there at the end, just being with us and playing those last minutes, and their
presence will definitely last forever in this program.  
  
Q. You mentioned trying to become the next UConn. What do you think it
will take to close that gap that you had tonight? Is it just more experience,
or is it an attitude? What do you think separates them from the pack?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I think it's going to be a little of everything.
Experience is definitely going to help, especially now that we are a young
group. I think seeing what it's like, and we have to hold ourselves to a
different standard. They hold themselves to a different standard. They don't
beat themselves, and I think come next year and the years following, we're
going to start holding ourselves to a different standard and not beating
ourselves, either.  
  
Q. Kelly, you talked a little bit about it, but just put in perspective
what this run will do for you guys moving forward? With so many young talented
players I've got to think the future is bright for the Ducks.  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. No doubt. This is all part of the process. I thought
Geno put it really good the other day when he said they don't know that
they're not supposed to come in and just beat people like we are. But guys,
our last three weeks of the season we beat Washington who was a 3 seed, we
beat Maryland, a 3 seed, we won at Duke, a 2 seed, lost to Stanford, who's
going -- we've played three of the Final Four teams. I just think all of this
is part of the process, part of the growing up. I think a run like this will
make it easier to motivate our team in the off-season. Hey, we got a taste of
it, we see what it's like, we want to go back. One of our goals will be to
host the first and second round so we don't have to make two trips cross
country. We traveled over 6,000 miles for this tournament.  
  
All those things will, I think, really help us, and obviously gives these guys
confidence, that they can win in the tournament.  
  
Q. I imagine it was impossible to simulate what UConn does, especially
in one day's practice. What was it like going against them? What did you learn
about playing them that you didn't know just watching them from afar?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, you know, you watch them on film and you see, hey, we can
do this and we can do that. But I think the speed of the game. They just play
so fast. And when you're trying to -- especially when you're a young team, and
I don't want to use youth as an excuse. This is our 37th game. But when you're
trying to process that, it takes some time, and it's got to be more of a --
just a natural reaction instead of a thought process, and we were thinking,
you know, and therefore -- it looks like a post player is open inside and you
want to make that pass, and before you know it, Gabby Williams, a tremendous
athlete, steals the interior pass.  
  
You know, it's just -- that stuff is tough, and then once it gets rolling, you
know, they become even better. But I think the student-athletes said it great;
they don't beat themselves. They play both ends of the floor, and they play
for 40 minutes.  
  
So we played them in stretches fairly well, but not -- obviously not for 40
minutes, and you just can't have those let-ups because that 10-0 run in a
minute and a half crushes you, and then you try to dig out of it, and then,
bam, it's another 10-0 run. We'll learn from it. We'll get better. I think,
like I said, it's all part of the process.  
  
Q. When Collier and Williams come out and start making some perimeter
shots, run me through how that changes how you have to try to defend them.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we went with kind of our two big kids. We were hoping that
we could at least punish them at our end, offensive end by getting the ball
inside and we didn't do a great job of it. We knew we were going to give up
something at the other end, and Gabby Williams has shown at times that maybe
she's got as comfortable shooting that 17-footer as she was tonight, and it
was -- you've got to kind of give up something. I think when you're maybe not
quite as good, you have to kind of pick your poison. That was one we picked.
We chose wrong. Those kids did a great job. They're just great players. They
really are.  
  
I think that set the tone for them.  
  
And shooting is contagious, good shooting and bad shooting, and once she
started making them, it seemed like Saniya was making them, and I thought we
did a good job on Katie Lou and Kia for the most part, but those two did a
heck of a job.  
  
Q. I'm curious what you did to stop the turnovers in the second half.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, took a deep breath. That helped. I had to joke with them a
little bit. You know, listen, the first half, it was, I think, 28 to whatever
in points off turnovers, 28-6, so we're down 25, and 22 of those were from the
margin in points off turnovers. We just said, man, if we could just not throw
it to them, just throw it to us, we might be a lot better. Plus we went to a
little more high-low stuff in the second half, kind of changed our approach,
got away from a lot of ball screens, and I think that helped, too.  
  
But like anything, you settle down and adjust.  
  
Q. You talked about this earlier, but it seemed like you let Gabby and
Napheesa to a degree take those mid-range jumpers. Do you think that's the
best way teams have a shot at beating UConn, and if not, what can teams do to
have a shot?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we didn't mean to give them that much room. I think our
freshmen centers, both of them, got a little gun shy, didn't want to get too
close because Gabby did beat them off the dribble a couple times. Going in, we
wanted to do two things: Eliminate catch-and-shoot threes, and eliminate lay-
ups. You know, if they were going to make -- if Gabby was going to make
17-footers and Napheesa was going to make those shots, hey, you know, all the
more power to them. But those are the two things that we needed to take away
in our opinion, and that's just our opinion. We had one day to prepare for
the. If I was in their league, maybe I'd have a whole different approach, but
you try to cram in as much as you can for that test, and it didn't work out
tonight.  
  
Q. I couldn't help but notice there was a lot of giggling on the dais
when Sabrina was asked how she was handling the composure, or keeping her
composure. Wanted to talk a little bit about how much of that was a discussion
letting Maite handle the ball and getting Sabrina off the ball versus just
kind of necessity of what UConn was doing.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I thought they did a great job of taking Sabrina out the
best they could. I mean, she worked hard just to get catches, and we didn't do
a great job of setting very good screens, or she didn't do a great job of
using those screens, and they just do a good job of blowing them up. It's
tough to get good looks against them.  
  
And I'm glad that a couple of the reporters, that they mentioned this. I think
everybody talks about their offense. I've always felt what sets them apart
from everybody else is the defense. They give you nothing, and we've been a
really good offensive team. I think we're one of the more efficient teams in
the country, and we were playing on our heels all night long, and it was
survival mode at times.  
  
To me, that's what really sets their program apart.  
  
Q. With their defense, what makes them so good? Is it just the
athleticism and ability to switch or the intensity with which they play?  
KELLY GRAVES: C, all of the above. You know? It truly is, great athletes.
They're interchangeable, so they switch screens, and we don't see a lot of
that. It's hard to take advantage of that stuff. There were times when Saniya
and Dangerfield were on our posts and we tried to roll them down, but there's
so much pressure on the ball that it's hard to see them, and I think they're
just well skilled. I know Coach challenges them each and every day. I know how
he operates and how he coaches, and they just get better, and it's part of the
culture, and that's the area where we've got to continue to improve. You know,
it's defense like that is a culture-based deal, and you don't build that in
one or two years. That's longevity, and that's kids coming in as freshmen and
getting broken down and saying, this is how we do it.  
  
I coached Morgan Tuck and Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson two years with
USA Basketball. I got to know those kids, and I know what they went through as
young kids, and that's how you get better. It's how you get better.  
  
And so, yeah, they just -- professionally as a coach, I was glad to play them,
you know, because it helped me be a better coach. I know it will help my
players be better players.  
  
Q. Throughout this run you guys talked about playing these four games
without a lot of pressure on yourselves and getting this far. Are you looking
forward to seeing how this group which is pretty much all coming back improves
and handles expectations next year?  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. No doubt. I can't wait, actually. I can't wait. I
think this is going to be a fun group to watch mature, and like I said, I
truly believe from the bottom of my heart that we can be the kind of program
that can be in this position and perhaps beyond year in and year out. That's
our goal. Whether that happens, I know it's fragile, these tournaments,
there's a lot of really good programs that never get to a Final Four, never
win a National Championship, but that's why I left my former school. You know,
I want to be on this kind of stage and have a chance, and I think we have the
makeup, we have the resources, we have the University brand, we have
everything, and now we have really, really good student-athletes to be able to
make that a reality in the future.  
  
In the meantime, I wish coach Geno the best. I do have to give a shout-out to
the Pac-12 and Stanford and tell Coach Vanderveer that I'm really happy for
her and her team. They earned it, and we wish them the best in the Final Four,
too.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 90, Oregon - 52  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, there's not much you can say about what just happened.
Right from the opening tap, we just had a look and a feel about how we were
playing and what we were trying to do. And I thought our defense was
spectacular right from the opening possession and stayed that way pretty much
throughout the whole game.  
  
I couldn't be happier for this group. They had a lot of question marks going
into the season, and maybe they didn't have any in their own minds. Everybody
else did, including me. But they seemed to have answered every single one of
those questions, and they deserve to be in the Final Four. They've earned it.
I'm proud of them, and I'm happy for them.  
  
Q. Kia and Gabby, did you guys have to take ownership of this team early
on to ensure you guys were going to have the kind of success that you wanted
to have?  
KIA NURSE: Well, I think both of us were forced into leadership roles because
we were becoming the older guys on the team, and I think that was a challenge
that we accepted, and I'm extremely proud of how Gabby stepped up to the
challenge and has done a great job all season, being vocal. This is the thing
that neither of us have had to do at all in our careers, and to have done it
with the help of the coaches and the help of some of the players who have come
before us and taught us the way, I think it's becoming more of a habit for us
now.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, just going off of what Kia said, we were just kind of
thrown into this role. I mean, those guys did everything for us last year,
last two years, but the thing about them, too, is they showed us and they
taught us how to do it ourselves. They knew that once we got into this
position that we would be ready for it because they showed us how to do it.  
  
Q. Coach said how this was a special time to be in the Final Four since
everyone except for you guys thought you might be struggling for. Does it make
it sweeter than maybe the last couple where you guys kind of knew you were
going to get there whereas this year less was expected from everybody except
for you guys to get back to the Final Four?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, it feels really good. I think with us, too, we've seen
it, you know, every day in practice. We see things that other people don't
see. I guess for us it's not as surprising, but we did definitely still
surprise ourselves. It feels good that we were able to fill in those shoes.  
  
KIA NURSE: I mean, going off of what Gab just said, obviously this is a
special one for us. For us to be in this position when people didn't think we
were going to be, and for us to have played as well as we did today to get
there, it's a good feeling.  
  
Q. Gabby, when you came off the court against UCLA, wasn't a lot of
smiles, you guys said the last couple of minutes was tough. Was there a
conscious effort to really come out hard tonight?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, we always want to throw the first punch, and it was kind
of like we didn't want to give them any hope. You know, we were lucky enough
to come out to a good start, and I think we executed our game plan really
well. The key was not letting them back in because that team really knows how
to fight, so we just had to stay tough.  
  
Q. When Stewie would talk about what her goals were, it was in terms of
trying to be as close to perfection as possible. I wonder if both of you view
it that way, and do you feel that this season has lived up to those goals?  
KIA NURSE: Well, where we are and the position that we're in and the school
that we go to, perfection is a word that gets thrown around a lot, and I think
that starts in practice, when we do drills, where we have to make a certain
number of shots in a row, without any mishaps, without any balls being thrown
out of the place, and I think for us to have a season like this, for us to
have done it the way we did it, I'm proud of the team, I'm proud of how we
stuck through it and proud of how we worked to get to where we are today.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think sometimes it doesn't feel perfect, and the
coaches kind of put the pressure on us, and you know, we lose a lot in
practice, and I think that's where that kind of perfection idea comes from,
because we just have such high standards for ourselves, and the coaches put so
much on us so that when we get into the game, it's easier almost. It's fun.  
  
Q. Going off of that, a lot has been made of this season, lots of
streaks going on, and that history, that perfection. What do you feel this
team or when will this team be able to take ownership of that success, of that
hard work that's happening in practice that no one else sees?  
KIA NURSE: I think we have an opportunity to do it right now. The streak,
we're a part of it. We didn't do it all on our own. There was a lot of people
who came before us to start the streak, and we are kind of carrying on that
legacy that they left, and that's something that we focus on every day. We're
focused on the fact that UConn is built into what UConn is today because of
everybody who came before what we're doing right now.  
  
So to understand that, to want to go out and play great Connecticut basketball
every game is a testament to those people who have done it before us.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I agree with Kia, and I think every team has an
identity. I'm glad that we found ours kind of at the right time, and I think
the momentum we have is really good.  
  
With that, I think we just want to add to the tradition. We want to add to the
culture, and no team wants to be the team that's responsible for losing that,
for being the end of it.  
  
Q. Of all the streaks that are alive right now, is 10 straight Final
Fours one that you really are proud of?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to put it into any kind of context, you
know? I don't know what the previous record was. So I don't have anything to
compare it to.  
  
It's such a hard feat to accomplish in so many ways. It only takes one loss.
You're now playing best out of five or best out of seven.  
  
So in all those 10 years, all it took was one loss at the wrong time during
March and you're out. So for us to have gone 10 months of March in a row and
not having lost a game through a whole different cast of characters, over all
that time, that's pretty darned good. That is pretty darned -- that's probably
more than anything what really hits home for me.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you kind of said it before, but so much less was
expected from this group coming into the season by everyone but them, and to
have them get back to the Final Four and keep that streak going, does that
make it more special in a sense than some of the others where you kind of knew
that you were expected to get there and win a championship, or has this group
had less expectations from everybody else?  
GENO AURIEMMA: It has a certain pattern to it, the seasons, and there's themes
that run through seasons, either because a team wants an identity or because
it's cast upon them, you know. So it seemed to me like these last couple have
been all about Stewie and that group and her commitment to saying, I want to
win four National Championships. So that became the dominant theme, and these
guys were like a part of it. You know?  
  
And it became about four in a row last year. Never been done before. All the
great things that were going on, and rightly so, that became the thing, and
because we had the three best players in the country, three of the best
players in the country at their positions, it was like a foregone conclusion.
And the players that we have today, for the first time in their careers,
they've owned the whole month of March. They weren't just along for the ride.
It's theirs. And that's a huge step. That's what I told them in the locker
room. That's a big step to go from riding in the backseat on a trip that
you're going to, to all of a sudden you're in charge of driving the bus and
you're responsible for getting us there.  
  
A lot of times people have to lose to learn how to win, and for them to just
step in right where the other team left off and take immediate ownership of
it, that says a lot about who they are. You know, I can't say enough about
each and every one of them, but especially that starting five. I mean, there's
just something unique about them right now that's going on, and they deserve
all of it. And they don't have to share it with anybody; it's not anyone
else's but theirs, and they're enjoying it.  
  
Q. Napheesa has obviously been great all year. Did you expect her to
continue to play as well as she has in this tournament?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, you never know what's going to happen to kids
when they get in this environment, you know? You don't know. Sometimes they
think themselves into a mess, like they're just playing the regular season and
then somebody said, well, you know, this is one-and-done now. We don't have
three games this week and three games next week. You lose one and you're out.
Sometimes that does funny things to players.  
  
So you know, I don't know. I didn't know what to expect. But having watched
Pheesa play all year long, I can't describe what she does. She's effortless in
what she does. Seriously, it's like a self-driving car. It's just effortless.
She just goes. I mean, she's effortless on defense, too. Don't get me wrong.
But the offense for her just comes effortless. I can't even explain it. She'll
take some shots, I'll just shake my head, and there's no way to explain what
she does. It's unbelievable. She had a bad night tonight. She missed eight
shots. That's a bad night for her. She felt the pressure of the tournament, I
think.  
  
Q. You ran Ruthy off the baseline all game long. Was that something you
guys instituted in your game plan because that took her out of her game and
rhythm in the paint?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, we know we can't just stand there and slug it out with
teams. We're just not big enough. So that first half, I thought our quickness
gave Oregon a lot of problems. They're very disciplined, but yet they're not
very methodical. They're a very disciplined team that plays with a sense of
freedom that they can make the play they feel like they want to make, and what
happened in that first 15 minutes was everything that they tried to do, they
found that they couldn't just make the next pass, make the next cut. You know,
they're used to being able to do that, and tonight they couldn't do it, and
their bail-out, throw it into the post and get a bucket, once Gabby and Pheesa
started taking that away -- and that's not such a bad thing if we're not
making shots, but the fact that we're scoring every time down the floor and
they're having a problem at their end, I think it just compounds the problem
for the other team. They're a really good team, but they struggled, and we
made them struggle, not because they're a bad team, they struggled because we
made them struggle.  
  
Q. When you talk about patterns, could you liken this with one major
exception to 2003 after that whole group graduated but of course you still had
Diana and nobody else, and also when Pheesa starts, everyone said no
Americans, and now you're getting three in the votes?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, 2003, those first couple practices, that first week of
practice, maybe the first two weeks of practice, I remember looking at one of
our assistants, and I thought, we're going to win a National Championship
because Diana had the ability to take two freshmen and two other kids that had
never started a game and make them look like veterans. She did that to them.
She elevated their game by who she was, the way she played, how she talked to
them, how she led them.  
  
Going into this season, we didn't have anybody like that, so I didn't know
what was going to happen. I didn't know who was going to be responsible for
any of this stuff, and maybe that's the way it needed to be this year, so that
they all had to depend on each other instead of all depending on one person.
And they never were allowed to take a break because they all had to be there
every night or we weren't going to be able to do what we've done.  
  
So you know, them becoming All-Americans, they earned it. Their reputation
didn't get it for them. Oh, they play at UConn so they get special treatment.
They earned it this year. They played the best schedule, they beat the best
teams, and they did it under the glare of the lights that they play under all
the time, and you know, maybe Gabby should have made first-team All-American,
as well, I don't know, on the AP. I know it's a lot to ask to get three kids
in the top five. But the fact that those three were three of the top 10
players in the country, they earned it, and they deserve it.  
  
Q. Playing Mississippi State on Friday in the Final Four, I'm guessing
you probably watched some of the game last night --  
GENO AURIEMMA: I watched the whole game last night. That's not the same
Mississippi State team we played last year here. That's a whole different
team. They have a lot of the same players, but that's a whole different team.
They looked amazing last night. I mean, going into the NCAA Tournament, I
thought Baylor had the best chance of winning based on if you check all the
boxes and say, here's what you need to win, you need size, you need
experience, you need athletic ability, you need good guard play, you have to
have depth. So when you check off all the boxes, you go, wow, they're the only
team that has all that. And for Mississippi State to keep answering and keep
answering and keep answering and keep answering the entire 40 minutes, that
was an amazing performance.  
  
We're playing the same team we played last year in the regionals, but we're
not playing the same team. I think Vic should have been Coach of the Year.
That was an amazing performance that that team put together last year.  
  
Q. Obviously your scoring is noticed, the turnovers defensive-wise is
noticed. Can you speak about one thing that probably wasn't noticed tonight is
probably the rebounding, which took away a lot of their second-chance shots
and created more opportunities for you that probably is not going to show up
on the stat sheet?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. You know, we talk a lot about rebounding at both ends is
really the key to every game if you think about it. What did they shoot today?
They shot 42 percent against us, and that is because they shot 75 percent in
the third quarter. So if you eliminate that, there's not a lot of made shots
on your first attempt. So we're pretty good at guarding people in their first
attempt.  
  
But what happens is most people when they offensive rebound, their next
attempt they shoot 80 percent because you don't miss lay-ups. So your shooting
percentage goes up if you can get second shots, create more possessions, all
the stuff like you mentioned.  
  
So if we can limit people to one shot, it's really hard to score a lot of
points against us, so the game plan today was we weren't going to give them a
lot of threes, and we weren't going to put them on the free-throw line. They
shot four free throws, and they made five threes. So normally they get about
30 points from the three-point line and the foul line, and today they got 18.
So those were the two things we were trying to do more than anything, and we
knew how big they were, but our quickness, I think, negated their size today.
Sometimes size wins over quickness; today quickness wins over size.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Good morning, everyone. Yesterday was a great day in the
University of Oregon sports history, not only this team moving on to our first
Elite 8, but our men last night going to their first Final Four since 1939. I
think a couple of their players commented to us that we helped inspire them,
and now hopefully we can use the inspiration that they have given us to carry
us tomorrow.  
  
But my coach used to always say when I was in school, he said, you know, if
what you did yesterday looks good to you today, then you haven't done much
today. So we're excited to move on. Our team earned this right to be able to
have a chance to play UConn. Really proud of our effort for the entire
tournament, and certainly yesterday. I think this group has shown a real
resilience, and we look forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I'm guessing you guys watched the game last night, the men's
game. What was it like? Where did you guys watch it? Just seeing the men's
program get to their first Final Four in 75 years, Coach said it gives you
guys a little inspiration, but what does it mean to you guys?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well, we watched it, some of us together, some of us
individually. It was pretty late, so we laid in bed and watched it. But it's
awesome to see what they're accomplishing. They work hard day in and day out.
We're with them all the time in the training room, and it's just really
awesome to see. Dana is doing a great job with them, and they work hard just
like we work hard, and they're definitely inspiring us to try and work just as
hard as they are and try and accomplish what they are.  
  
Q. You guys are playing some of your best defense of the year. What's
your kind of defensive mentality at this time of year? Has it changed at all
since January?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Not really, we just have to make them hit shots, difficult
shots. That's all we can do. If they make it, then that's good for them, but
we just have to make them difficult.  
  
Q. Your entire lives, UConn women's basketball has been a powerhouse.
I'm sure you all grew up probably watching a lot of their games. What's it
like for you guys to play this team? Is it special, or do you try and view it
as just another step in what you're trying to accomplish?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, what an exciting opportunity. You know, for any athlete or
competitor, this is what you live for. You want to play at the biggest stage
against the best team. Tomorrow can't come soon enough.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we're excited for this opportunity, especially as a
young group. I think it's going to test us in many ways, and I think we're
just excited to see where we stand and get a shot at playing against the No. 1
team in the country.  
  
Q. In your view, besides the fact that they have great players, what
makes them so successful and dominate year in and year out?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, their culture. You know, they recruit great kids and
kids that want to compete and kids that want to win. They don't really have
any knuckleheads on their team. So I mean, they have great culture, great
kids, and Geno is one of a kind, so I think that definitely helps them in
achieving what they have achieved thus far and what they're going to achieve
in the future.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Mallory, can you talk about in a Napheesa Collier, what
kind of a challenge she presents for you guys, and what is it that you see in
her that makes her such a great player inside-out and how are you going to
combat that?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's a great player. I think we're blessed to be able to
play against great post players, outside players all year long. So I think
we're just going to focus on making shots difficult and playing great defense.  
  
MAITE CAZORLA: Going off what Ruthy said, she is kind of an all-around player,
so she can play outside and inside, but being able to -- like having the
height advantage is going to be really helpful for us tomorrow, but being able
to make her hit those shots from the high post is going to be probably key
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mallory, when Gabby Williams committed to UConn, her dad suggested to
Geno that they recruit another kid from that part of the country. Run me
through your experience with Gabby and the Williams family, any good stories
you may have from your time playing against them or meeting them.  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: I played against Gabby my freshman and sophomore year in high
school, and every year we did play them, it was an honor because it's Gabby,
and she was the best, one of the most decorated players to come out of
northern Nevada. She's an awesome basketball player. She's just a competitor,
and their family is a great family.  
  
We were friends off the court, too, as well, but just being able to see her
success is amazing, and from such a small town to be on this big of a stage is
amazing for her.  
  
Q. Sabrina, hearing your answer before reminded me of your coach, and
his laid-back attitude with the exciting opportunity and the knucklehead
comment. He uses that word, also. Talk about the relationship you have in one
year with the big guy sitting on the end of the stage there.  
KELLY GRAVES: Good-looking, big guy.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, I know as a freshman, I've definitely gotten to know
him well during our recruiting process. He was always there. I think he maybe
missed one or two of my AAU games my whole junior year, and I think the same
with all of us. He was always there at all of our games. We just grew like a
really good relationship with him off the court, not necessarily on the court.
And I definitely think that that helps us as people, and outside of the
basketball court. But I don't know, that comment, he definitely likes the
whole knucklehead thing. I've heard it a few times.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: It's better than what my coach used to call me. We can't say it
out here.  
  
Q. Lexi, as a shooter, what kind of defensive challenges or what kind of
challenges does UConn pose on defense to someone who likes to shoot the three
ball?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, they're a great defensive team, so it's going to be a big
test for us, for everyone, and you know, I have great guards that push the
ball and find me in transition. You know, I'm not too worried, and then you
have our posts that draw so much attention.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I was wondering, you guys talked the other day about you
went to Spain for a preseason trip and that helped you guys all get to know
each other better. Can you just talk about that trip and how you guys got to
know each other better and how it brought the freshmen together?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, well -- how long did we go, 12 days? We were there for
12 days, and just being out of the country for 12 days with a group of girls
that you're just starting to get to know already builds a great relationship.
Things are obviously different outside of America. We couldn't walk places
alone. We had to stay as a group in an unfamiliar territory. So I think just
all being together, we visited, like, museums and churches and cathedrals. And
I think just being able to be together for 12 days in a foreign country was
something that I think all of us definitely, like, look up to. This happens
once every four years, so I think we were really excited that it happened this
year with so many new people. We all got to know each other really well.  
  
Q. Mallory, can you talk about playing against Gabby, her athleticism
and how difficult it is to play somebody like that who can be so quick but has
the ability to play against a taller kid?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Well, I mean, the last time I played her was my sophomore
year. But being able to watch her, she's so versatile, and it's just amazing
because she can play down low, but she also has the outside game, being able
to drive from the high post and things like that, but she's also an amazing
rebounder. She can jump out of the gym. She's just an overall amazing athlete.  
  
Q. Lexi, seems like you haven't been at Oregon that long, but you're
kind of the elder statesman already. When you heard about this recruiting
class coming to Oregon, I'm sure you even hosted some of them and knew them a
little bit. When did you realize that the future could be now this year when
they're all true freshmen instead of a couple years from now?  
LEXI BANDO: Well, first off, I was so excited for this class to come in. There
was so much hype around them, and the hype was real. You know, incredible
players, incredible people off the court, and it's just a blessing to be able
to play with them. You know, I don't think people thought we were going to get
to this stage this early, but you know, these freshmen have led us here, and
it's been an incredible journey.  
  
Q. You would be the first double-digit seed to make the women's Final
Four. I realize you've got to play the game first, but if you do that, is that
a necessary step in the evolution of women's college basketball?  
And then my second question would be about the Pac-12; you've had Cheryl
Miller's era, you had Stanford winning championships. But now it looks like
the Pac-12 is doing what the SEC did years ago where they're realizing en
masse that we can really do well in women's basketball. We've got tons of
resources and beautiful campuses, so why don't we make a push; is that what's
going on, or is it just individual?  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, there was a lot in that question. The first part, in
terms of the Final Four, you know, we're playing this for us. I think that's
what we're looking forward to. I don't know if that's going to make a
statement in a bigger picture of things. But was it necessarily a goal of ours
when we set out on this season's journey? It's in front of us now, so it's
obviously something we're thinking about. You know, the Pac-12 for many years
-- and I watched it from a short distance when I was at Gonzaga -- was
Stanford and then everybody else, several teams pretty good and some not so
good, and I think what's happened, everybody has just gotten better. There are
no gimmes anymore. 1 through 12, a lot of programs are stepping up, with
Oregon State and Washington in last year's Final Four just shows how the
conference has evolved.  
  
Yeah, I think all recruits should look to come west. It's beautiful out there.
We're laid back, like Doug likes to say, about some of our coaches. And you
know, it's just a wonderful conference, great coaches, great players, awesome
places to visit when you're on the road. You know, I just think it's a
conference that will continue to get better and better. I truly do.  
  
Q. Did you think three years ago that you'd be this quickly getting to a
chance to get to the Final Four as a group, especially the group you brought
in this year, that it would be this quick a turnaround for this program?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, I'm a typical coach. I don't look that far ahead. I
like to look at the next day. But I mean, maybe not in our third year, but we
certainly expected to be a good program. I mean, there's no doubt about it,
and the way we've recruited and my staff, they deserve so much credit. They've
been phenomenal. Great recruiters, great teachers, and great people, and I
think that's kind of very much helped us get to this spot today.  
  
But yeah, I mean, the honest truth is that's why I left Gonzaga. I had a great
thing going there. We could have always been competitive, won championships,
been a threat to get to the second weekend of the tournament, but I think at
Oregon, we have the resources, the brand, the administration, the support.
Everything that we have there will help enable us to get to the lofty goals.  
  
I mean, you look at the University athletic department, and we're pretty
competitive in every single sport that we offer, and that's pretty neat. Our
kids get to rub shoulders with some of the nation's elite athletes and world's
elite athletes, and that's special. I saw that, and I have Oregon ties. My
family has Oregon ties, and I just thought it was a no-brainer to me, and I'm
really excited.  
  
To put a timeline on it, coaches can't do that. That's tough. That's tough to
think that we can get to this spot and have a chance to get to a Final Four in
our third year with so many young kids. But it's here now, so we're going to
seize upon the opportunity.  
  
Q. Today you got more resources around than existed in different ways
than before. For example, I'd say that it was not long ago that here in the
Pac-12 the scores were in the paper in the morning, when they ran scores. Now
you've got the Pac-12 Network and everybody can just get on their computers.
How much of a help is that to you when you're recruiting?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, I think the Pac-12 Network is huge. Now, I know we play
those 8:00 games sometimes; I know you're in bed already. So I don't know how
many people on the East Coast are watching. But I think it's been huge. It's
been critical.  
  
I think it's allowed those players on the West Coast the opportunity to stay
home. They don't have to go to the East Coast or the South to get the
attention nationally that they had before. So it's just opened up a lot more
doors, and I think you are seeing players on the West Coast stay on the West
Coast to play.  
  
So yeah, I think it's great. I've always felt that getting on TV is one of the
most important things you can do for a program, and certainly it's helped our
conference.  
  
Q. What kind of a performance will it take for you guys or anyone to
beat UConn this year?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, it's going to take our absolute best. There's no doubt
about it, and we've got to play for 40 minutes. You know, watching them play
and what Coach Auriemma has done is incredible. It truly is. I think they've
set a standard that is good for our sport.  
  
You know, I hear people say all the time, oh, their dominance isn't good for
the sport. Really? I think it's great for the sport. It makes us all
accountable. We need to get better. We've got to improve our game.  
  
At the same time, they're tough to watch because you know, now we've got to
play them. But they are a lot of fun to watch. They play the game the right
way. They share the ball. They play hard. They play very smart. They never
beat themselves. They play together, and then what they do is they play for 40
minutes, and if you let down even for a minute, they can spur a 10-0 run and
you're buried, and that's what they do.  
  
People can play with them for a time, but can they play with them for 40
minutes? And that's the challenge we have ahead of us. We've got to play a
40-minute game. Things are going to go wrong. We've got to lift our heads up
and fight through it and continue to fight, and this team has shown that kind
of resilience. I'm not going to sit here and just say we're happy to be here.
We are happy to be here, but I have a really good basketball team, and I have
a basketball team who believes in themselves and in each other, and so we're
excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Geno Auriemma was one of the coaches that was quoted in your press
release when you were hired at Oregon, had nice things to say about you. How
close are you with Geno and how has that relationship developed throughout the
years?  
KELLY GRAVES: Obviously I admire him a lot. We've had a chance to spend a
little bit of time together. We're not calling each other every week to check
up, but we have a friendly relationship, and I think there's mutual
admiration. I really appreciated the things he said when I was first hired at
Oregon. You know, he has a close Nike relationship, just like we do at the
University. And the things he said yesterday, that means a lot to me. And I
share the same admiration of him. I think he's -- listen, I'm going to go out
and say, I think he's the best coach in basketball, male, female, men's
basketball, women's basketball. He's just absolutely phenomenal, what he does,
and how he motivates and coaches, and it's going to be an honor to play
tomorrow, and that being said, I hope I kick his butt.  
  
But I'm really looking forward to testing ourselves against the very best.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, have you played UConn before at any point in
your career at Gonzaga, Oregon? Also, a lot of teams when they play them for
the first time, there's that mystique, see the jersey, see the UConn, and
you're already down 10-0. You said they don't really seem to care who they're
playing, they just play basketball. Does that help you that there doesn't seem
to be that awe factor?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I hope so. And to answer your first question, I have never
played UConn, and I hope -- I mean, if they had that issue, they would have
maybe shown that against Duke. That's a pretty big brand. Maryland, another
big brand, and they haven't shown those kind of in-awe feelings or behaviors.
Hopefully that's not the case tomorrow. I can't answer that because we haven't
played them. But I have a way of keeping our kids focused and grounded, so I
think we're just going to be worried about ourselves and how we perform, and
if it's good enough tomorrow, it's good enough. If it's not, it's not. But
hopefully they're not just looking at that jersey on the opponent.  
  
Q. When you get a win like you had yesterday, the first thing you hear
up here is right now we're going to enjoy this one tonight and then we'll get
ready. It's UConn. How long did enjoy this tonight last?  
KELLY GRAVES: Until I called my wife and talked to her, and we had some fun
words. And then after that, it was watching tape. That's not always pleasant,
you know, when you're sitting there trying to figure out how the heck you can
stop those guys. But for players, I always tell them enjoy it tonight because
we don't show them any film or talk to them until the next morning anyway. But
as coaches, your work begins as soon as the work just ended. That's just the
nature of the business. They've got several months to rest and pat ourselves
on the back and things like that once this tournament is over.  
  
Q. As you were assembling this recruiting class going to their AAU
tournaments and whatnot, did you have a sense each piece that you added that
this was becoming something really special?  
KELLY GRAVES: I did. I did. You know, our first year there was tough. We went
13-17, and the one thing that kept us going was we were on the recruiting
trail, it seemed endlessly. My family actually stayed in Spokane. My middle
son was a senior at Gonzaga Prep in Spokane, so they actually stayed there the
entire year, and I see that as a blessing because I didn't have any -- there
was no guilt. There was no guilt, like Honey, how come you're not home
tonight? I was able to go on the road and spend a lot of time recruiting. Same
with my staff.  
  
And we knew what we were able to get on the recruiting trail, and with each
"yes," each commitment, it kind of reenergized us and kept us going through
what was a tough year. I hadn't had many losing seasons as a coach, and that's
how we kind of base our happiness, unfortunately, is on the won-loss record.
But with each success on the recruiting trail, it kind of gave us more
momentum and confidence, and it really kind of got us through that year.  
  
But with each commitment, seriously, we were starting to go, wow, this is
something special, this is something special. And we had a great recruiting
year, and that was just -- the cherry on top was Sabrina. We waited a long
time for that commitment, but she kind of solidified everything. She was that
Alpha that you need to kind of put it all together. So it was quite a journey
that first year.  
  
Q. What was Oregon's pitch to you? Did they feel like women's basketball
was a sport that hadn't measured up to, say, more recently, football or track
and field in a long time? Did they think, this is a sport that's emerging,
we've got a lot of resources we can put into it, and then what made you
finally decide, all right, I'm taking this job?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, Lisa Peterson, our associate athletic director back there,
was a great salesperson. There's no doubt about it. It was an easy sell, quite
frankly. I loved Gonzaga. I absolutely loved it. My family and I would have
been happy to stay there forever.  
  
But I think professionally, every coach wants to be challenged a little bit,
and I knew going to the Pac-12 would be a challenge that I was ready for. We'd
won 10 straight championships, and one of the things Lisa told me was, well,
good luck winning your 11th, like is this what you really want? So there were
some coaching colleagues that I relied on and talked to, and they all
encouraged me to take that next step. You know, and my wife is born and raised
in Portland. All her family lives in Portland. We have a vacation home about
an hour and a half from Eugene that's our favorite spot on earth. It was seven
hours from Spokane, but an hour and a half from Eugene so we were down in the
area a lot. I have a lot of friends that live in the area. It was the only
place I would have ever left for. Like I said, I loved Gonzaga. And how great
was yesterday, for a Gonzaga/Duck fan to have two teams go to the Final Four?  
  
You know, and the pitch they made and the -- I'm trying to say the support
that I knew we were going to get sold me on it. Like I said, I'm happy to be
there. I'm happy to be a Duck, and privileged to be the coach there.  
  
Q. You never told me what their pitch was.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, their pitch was to come home a little bit. We want to be a
National Championship program. I mean, they threw all that, and it matched,
because that's what I want, too. Not that you can't get there from Gonzaga,
and the men are obviously showing that. However, it's different in the men's
game than it is the women's game. The last so-called mid-major to go to the
Final Four on the women's side was 2001 with Jackie Stiles, one of the
preeminent players in the history of our game, and that's a long time ago. So
it's a lot more difficult on the women's side to get there, and professionally
I wanted that challenge to do it, and I think Oregon offered me that.  
  
Q. How could you watch film yesterday when Gonzaga's men and the Oregon
men were playing for a chance to go to the Final Four? That's your two
schools? How could you sit there and watch film when history could be made
right there? And we talked the other day about Oregon basketball versus Oregon
football and putting basketball on the map a little bit more. You guys have
the big tournament next year, the Phil Knight thing for the mean and the
women, which was really going to be the showcase, like, wow, Oregon
basketball, all these teams coming here to play for Phil Knight. But now with
the men in the Final Four and you guys a step away from the Final Four, that
national picture is coming a little bit earlier than that I would think.  
KELLY GRAVES: Pretty cool. I mean, it's pretty cool. To answer the first part
of your question, business before pleasure, all right. Business before
pleasure. And you see these bags under the eyes? You can do both. You can
watch and enjoy the games on TV and then watch your next opponent, too. You
know, sleep is overrated, quite frankly.  
  
And then I have a great staff, who, they are on this thing, big-time. But
yeah, I think we've been known as a track and field school and a football
school. I think it's really special.  
  
You know, to me what's really, really cool is I go through a lot of our -- on
Facebook, I get so many messages and texts and tweets and all that kind of
stuff, like everybody does, but some of our past alums, who I never coached,
have changed their Facebook profiles, pictures, to them in their Duck uniform.
And they've reached out, some of our great players -- and there is a history,
a tradition at the University of Oregon of good basketball, winning
basketball, championship basketball. It's neat to see them kind of reconnect
and be proud of their program and reach out, and I think that's something that
Oregon has been waiting for. And now we just hope to follow the lead of our
men. They just keep one-upping us. For crying out loud. But good for Dana and
good for his guys.  
  
Q. I first met you when Gonzaga wasn't Gonzaga yet and you took a trip
across the country to play St. Joseph's and then you were going home. I think
I remember the motivation for that.  
KELLY GRAVES: We were really good. We were on the ascent, I guess I can say
that. And somebody told me, a very wise person, told me you need to play on
the East Coast so people can see how good you guys really are, so we started
doing that. That trip was one of the first ones we took to the East Coast, and
we tried to get back at least to the Midwest, sometimes to the South, and then
the East Coast a lot, so people could see how good Gonzaga was. I remember
that trip. We got them that morning. I think it was kids' day, too. Yeah, it
was loud. Yeah, that was a fun trip, a really fun trip.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: It's cold. Other than that, you know, we're in a game that we
want to be in, obviously. It's a game that everybody wants to be in. It's the
last step, really, to where every kid wants to be. Every kid wants to be in
the Final Four. It's what they talk about when they go to college, playing in
the Final Four.  
  
So the day before the game and then all day tomorrow is probably the most
stressful time. The actual game itself is fun to play in. I know the players
are excited about it, and it's good that we're playing a team that we've not
played and don't know that much about. So there's a little bit of a difference
preparing for them than it would be, say, if it was Maryland or somebody else
that we had played already during the year. So that should be fun the next
couple days. We're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what have you seen about Oregon that's
impressed you on film or watching them yesterday at all?  
SANIYA CHONG: Well, looking at them, we know they have some pretty good
guards, and they definitely can get into the lane. And when they're coming off
ball screens, they're pretty good in kick-outs, so we're pretty aware of that,
and we're going to stop that.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Like Saniya said, they have some really good guards and some
tall posts, so we're going to try to keep them off the line and keep the ball
away from the big guys.  
  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, they pretty much covered it, but obviously focusing on great
team defense tomorrow and understanding that they have a lot of pieces that
they can use, and for us it's not going to be an individual performance on
defense as it usually is, it's going to be a team thing, focus and emphasis.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, like Kia said, focusing mainly on defense tomorrow.
They have a couple bigs and really good guards that we need to stop.  
  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think everyone pretty much covered everything. We've
got to stop dribble penetration, make sure we have good perimeter defense, and
just make their big guys run.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, two-part question: Do you have your phone with you? Are
you watching Karlie right now? And could you explain how your relationship
with your sisters has helped you get to this point?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Well, I'm trying to get back as quickly as possible to
watch Karlie play. It's definitely been a great experience being able to watch
her succeed so much in this tournament, and she's motivated me so much
throughout my life, and I'm really proud to be her sister.  
  
Q. Kia, Coach said that it was nice to play somebody new that you
haven't played before. You guys have the same sort of feeling that you've
played Maryland, played other teams that are still alive, but this is a team
you haven't played ever?  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, absolutely. It's fun to be in a situation where it's kind of
out of the usual. It's a team that they've had a great run so far. There's a
reason that they're here, that they've been successful with their
multidimensional pieces. And I think for us coming up today and tomorrow,
being prepared as much as we can, understanding that we have to be great and
better at things that we didn't do well in the last game and trying to fix
those for this next one.  
  
Q. Kia, you played a pretty key role as a freshman in a National
Championship run. Can you just address how impressed you are watch these
Oregon freshmen, how composed they are, how they're handling the high-pressure
stakes?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, your first NCAA Tournament is never an easy thing, and I
think they're doing a great job handling, not only the stakes and the high
pressure in every single game, but also the distractions and everything else
that comes along with it. Obviously they've done a great job for their team.
They've been a big piece of what they do, and it'll be a great defensive
match-up tomorrow.  
  
Q. I'm curious just how much interest or how much you watched Sabrina
play in high school. Sounded like you maybe saw a couple of games in northern
California.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah. She's one of those kids that was good for a long time.
You know, she was on everybody's radar as a young player. It didn't just
happen as a high school senior or junior. You know, there's a lot of things
about her game that are just really fun to watch. I did get a chance to see
her play a lot in high school, both during the summer and a couple times in
California. And it's not really a surprise what she's doing because she has
the kind of a game that is a little bit older than she is, which is not usual.
You know, usually kids play right about their age. She plays a little bit
older because her game is not necessarily based on how fast she is or her
ability to -- it's not like -- it's a complete difference than Jordin Canada,
let's say. She just has her own unique style, the way she plays, and it's fun
to watch, and it's effective, and it's exactly what this team needs for them.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you weren't really surprised about what Oregon is
doing; what was it about Kelly Graves and that marriage with Oregon women's
basketball that you thought would make them kind of a rising power?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, a couple things. I don't know every sport at Oregon. I'm
not that familiar with every single one of their sports. But it seems to me
that most of their sports are pretty good, and they're pretty good nationally.
I remember seeing their baseball team play our baseball team in the NCAA
Tournament, and I thought -- the only thing they need is the right person.
It's not like somebody has got to go in there and reinvent something. It's
already there. It's a great place, great facilities, and they have a national
brand that they didn't used to have, say, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. They
were maybe more of a West Coast team. Now they seem to be a national team.  
  
I used to tell my friends that you knew Oregon had arrived -- it had nothing
to do with anything big. But their football program just captured a lot of
people's imagination back in the day, you know, and that's kind of how it all
made sense to the East Coast people, because of how quickly they became
significant in football, which seems to be what everybody drives everything on
these days.  
  
I remember reading in the paper, it was really funny, Terrelle Pryor, when he
was coming out of high school was like the No. 1 football recruit in America.
And we recruit a lot of kids from western Pennsylvania, and I grew up in
Philadelphia. So when I read who his final schools were, it was exactly who
you would think: Penn State, Pittsburgh, Ohio State, and Oregon. I'm like,
you've got to be kidding me. That's when you say, all right, it's a little bit
different than it was 25 years ago. So all they needed was just the right
person, and his success at Gonzaga, I mean, they didn't have to look far, and
they got the right guy. They got the right coach.  
  
Like anything else, you know, when you've got the right person at the top and
you get the support of the university, this is what happens, and it should
happen more places.  
  
Q. We seem to talk about it every year, but attendance this year at the
Regionals, except for this place, has been pretty pathetic. I think 3,000
people were down in Oklahoma City and then Lexington and 4,500 out west, and
probably going to be a lot worse tomorrow night. Any thoughts on what they can
potentially do to make these Regionals, get people to show up to them as
opposed to this year where it just wasn't very good?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. That's a good question that seems to be popping
up a lot more. I don't know what exactly the answer is to be honest with you.
Women's basketball is kind of unique, you know? Like, I think the biggest
mistake that women's basketball has made over the years is trying to be like
men's basketball, and at some point they're going to realize they're not. And
once they realize they're not, then women's basketball can start working on
what's best for women's basketball.  
  
You know, the whole idea of, early on even, the huge arenas, the big places,
the crazy starting times. It's like everything they did was, well, if the men
can do it, we can do it. Well, no you can't, so stop pretending you can. It's
like a reminder all the time. Women's basketball fans are not basketball fans,
they're fans of their team for the most part, and then you've got some places
where they're really women's basketball fans.  
  
And you know, until people start betting a lot of money on women's basketball,
that's just the way it's going to be.  
  
So we have a unique situation that needs to be handled. I'm not saying I know
what all the answers are, but there's certain places in America that there's a
lot of really good women's basketball fans, and there's a lot of places that
it's not. So to put Regionals in those places doesn't make any sense.  
  
However, I don't blame necessarily the NCAA and the committees because a lot
of places don't want to host the Regionals. So you might end up having a
situation like they have in all the other sports, where you're going to end up
going and playing more home sites, unfortunately. But that's the reality.  
  
Q. As far as Katie Lou goes, where has she kind of grown the most since
she got to UConn, and is there any particular challenge with a West Coast kid
and anything you have to focus on when they make the trip out east?  
GENO AURIEMMA: How much time do you have?  
  
Q. As long as you have. I have a flight back at 8:00 tonight.  
GENO AURIEMMA: It still won't be enough time.  
  
Yeah, it presents a unique challenge when you get somebody that has to travel
that far to go to school, number one, and that would be no matter what.  
  
Number two, I guess kids grow up differently out there. There's just a
different mindset, a different attitude, a different mentality. And that's not
like across the board 100 percent, because Diana Taurasi's personality was
completely different than Lou's, and Lou is different than Kaleena Lewis, and
Kaleena Lewis was different than Charde Houston or Wilnette Crockett.  
  
So we've had a bunch of kids from California, and they've all been a little
bit different on their own, but there's this, hey, don't worry about it,
everything will be fine. It doesn't fly real well in my world, hey, don't
worry about it, everything will be fine.  
  
So one of the biggest challenges is that you have to try to convince them that
everything is important, every little thing is important. And a lot of times
with Lou, she wants to decide what's important, and I've said this before: The
worst thing that can happen to a kid is when they make a lot of shots at an
early age, and Lou did that, Diana did that, Kaleena did that. And when they
get here, there's a lot of things that they don't necessarily think are
important in the game of basketball, and it's a struggle in the beginning. And
then once they realize it, then it just (snaps fingers).  
  
Like, I think from my experience, California basketball players -- and Lou
especially, is a good example -- they're like Italian car drivers in Italy.
Like red lights, stop signs, whatever; they're just a suggestion. You don't
necessarily have to do it. So Lou, get your hands up on defense when a guy is
a good three-point shooter like the Korver kid. It's not like she's going to
do it, but it's a suggestion. She might do it, she might not. And it pisses me
off, don't get me wrong, but that's life.  
  
Q. Historically your program doesn't lose to unranked teams. You don't
have a history of upsets. How do you keep your team focused on the next game
and keep them from not looking ahead?  
GENO AURIEMMA: By being pissy every day, and it's not healthy. You have to get
the right kind of kids generally speaking. I find myself saying that a lot,
generally speaking, because it's almost impossible anymore to categorize
something as exactly this. But when you start with the right players that,
one, want to be on a great team or they wouldn't come here; two, they want to
be really good because they sense that if they come to Connecticut, they have
a chance to be something really special if they work at it. So once they
decide to make that commitment and they're willing to give up a little bit of
their ego for it, then you can appeal to them about what it takes to get
better and how much you have to improve every minute of every day, and how you
have to prove every game that you're as good as you think you are.  
  
So going out and going through the motions and losing to somebody that has no
business beating you, that makes you like everybody else, so why did you come
here? I find myself saying that -- Chloe, how many times do I say that, right?
She's new to our program. I must say that every day. If you want to be like
everybody else, why did you come here? So we're trying to be different. We're
trying to do things that are hard to do, that are not the norm. So if you're
just going to go out and half-ass through something, then why did you come
here? And then after a while, they get tired of hearing that and they don't
want to hear it anymore.  
  
But I don't think it's anything other than we appeal to them, and we won't put
up with it if they don't. And generally, we have enough good players that I
can teach them a lesson and bench their butts. This year they got me, though.
I can't do it, I've got to play them, whether they put their hand up on
defense or not. I've got to play them. But that's changing in a couple months.  
  
Q. Both Oregon and Connecticut have strong Nike ties and you guys are
going out to play there in Eugene next year, albeit not against the Ducks. Is
there some kind of Nike family thing going where you guys are all part of the
same --  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, we're acquaintances with Nike, yeah. Oregon is related to
Nike. It's a big difference. They're part of the close-knit family. We're an
acquaintance, although a strong one. We do like to think of it as family, when
we all get together as coaches, all the Nike coaches, and that's where we kind
of establish a certain bond, a certain familiarity with each other. You know,
that's kind of -- even before Kelly got involved in USA Basketball, that was
kind of my first really getting to know Kelly, at all those Nike trips. And
you do get to interact with other coaches, and some you do get to be friends
with, and you do get to follow their careers and all that.  
  
And Nike always has been very, very adamant about we are all part of a family
thing, and that's how it's handled. That's how it's run. That's how it's
gotten to be where it is. That's why they are who they are, because of the way
they treat people and the way we treat each other. You know? I don't know,
maybe there's an extra pair of sneakers in Kelly's room last night for beating
an Under Armour school. There is a little bit of competition there, I know.  
  
Q. Geno, you've every year seemed to say that this game tomorrow night,
somebody has to step up, some player usually carries you to the Final Four. Do
you have any idea tomorrow night who may be the one to step up and be that
player?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No. If you'd have asked me last year, it would be easy for the
most part. I've got three guys to pick from, for the most par, and one you
knew for the most part. But I don't know, this year it's been kind of
different. I mean, it's like Napheesa has been pretty constant, Lou has been
pretty constant, Kia has been amazing this tournament. And then Gabby is just
-- some games she's the complete difference-maker, in spite of all the other
players. And then yesterday it was Saniya.  
  
I really don't know. I wish I could tell you, yeah, these two guys are. But
I'm watching Notre Dame play Stanford, and the kid from Notre Dame has 21 in
the first half. You want somebody to step up and do that. You want somebody
tomorrow to go, yeah, I got this. Whether it's on our team or their team, it's
probably going to happen. But as to who it's going to be, I don't know. I
don't know. Hopefully it's not just one. Hopefully it's a couple of them.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Oregon - 77, Maryland - 63  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I just want to congratulate Coach Frese and her team. I'll tell
you, I have had zero sleep over the last four days, and a lot of it is just
because I've been watching film of them. They're so impressive, and she's got
a great team, and they had an awesome season.  
  
Also, obviously very happy that we're moving on. I continue to be amazed at
this team. You know, just the fact that over the last five days we went cross-
country twice, had final exams, played a great team -- three great teams in
this tournament. And you know, they continue to show poise down the stretch,
and I'll tell you, it's just impressive to watch. We continue to get better
and better as a basketball team. We're excited to move on, regardless of who
we play next.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how were you guys able to control the tempo of this game and
keep them well under their normal scoring average?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, we just buckled down on defense, and we got back in
transition and tried to stop their easy transition buckets. But we did what we
do offensively. We got it side-top-side, pounded it down low to the bigs and
did what we usually do.  
  
Q. Oti, obviously you've had one of your biggest games of your college
career here on this level. What does it feel like, and what was your mentality
coming into this game when Mallory picked up her fourth foul?  
OTI GELDON: It felt great. Coming off the bench, I just had to make sure I did
whatever I needed to do for the team, which was defense and rebounding, so I
just had to make sure I kept doing that.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Oti, it seemed like it was sort of a team effort to slow
down Bri Jones. If you could take me through what the mindset was going in,
how you go about doing that, and when you knew it was working the way it
ultimately did.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's an amazing player. We definitely scout her a lot,
how to guard her, how to try to stop her. I think we just focused on getting
low and trying to force out of the paint, which was definitely tough, but I
think we did a pretty good job of it.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, can you talk about how you guys have evolved in
your freshman year? Do you think you're at a point now where -- obviously the
team is playing its best -- that you've gotten over whatever freshman things
you might have had, and has that helped during the tournament?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Like Coach always says, we're not freshmen anymore, we're 30, 35
games in. So I think once we step on the court, we're all just ball players.
It doesn't matter grade you're in, how young you are, so I think we just go on
the court every day wanting to win, and we try our best.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I mean, 30-plus games in, we're
not freshmen anymore. Especially now, this late in the tournament, we've just
got to come out every game and work hard and try and get as many wins as we
can.  
  
Q. Coach Frese talked about how this team, the Oregon team, reminds her
of her own National Championship team in 2006, as you guys start mostly
underclassmen. What has it been like playing in the tournament and that
experience and having this type of run?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, we're blessed. We're blessed to be in this position,
and I think we're just excited about everything. No one's been here. None of
our kids have ever experienced anything like that. So I think we're just
excited to be able to advance and play another day and see where that takes
us.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, it's an amazing feeling to be here, and I think every day
we just go out and work hard and try to win the game so we can get another
game.  
  
OTI GELDON: Yeah, piggy-backing off what they said, it's really exciting. We
just need to make sure we stay focused and continue to do what we're doing
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. This question is for Sabrina: You were hitting your shots. You were
clearly hitting clutch threes, but also No. 10, Lexi Bando, she was seeming to
have like an issue missing the three. But you guys never quit on her or gave
up on her, and she answered and responded later in the second half. Did you
say anything to her or did you guys just -- it was just kind of a rhythm
thing, we're going to keep coming to you until you get on fire?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I definitely said a few things to her. Sorry, just saying.
But she's the best shooter in America, so we all hold her to a high standard,
and I definitely hold her to a high standard. I told her before the game, if
she stops shooting, she's being selfish. She needs to let that ball fly, and I
told her she needed to quicken her shot up a little bit. I think she was
taking too much time to get it up and thinking about, you know, she wanted
this to go in. So I told her just quicken her shot up and just let it fly, and
she did.  
  
Q. Brenda Frese said they don't know any better, that they should be
nervous at this time because you have such a young team. What do you think
about that? She has that experience with having a really young team go all the
way to the Final Four. Do you know any better? Are you at all nervous about
the fact that you're now in the Elite 8, one step away from the Final Four?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I don't think so. I think Coach said it before the game that
it's just another game. We're just on a bigger stage, but it's still the same
game. We're all comfortable playing, and I think we're just going to take it
game by game and keep doing what we do.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I don't think we're really nervous. We have nothing to
lose. It's kind of fun to see. We all laugh and giggle and just are really
excited to be here and enjoy this opportunity that we have. So I think we
continue to enjoy this opportunity and work hard and good things will come to
us.  
  
OTI GELDON: I think the Pac-12 prepared us well for this tournament. Maryland
was definitely a really good team, but we've played Stanford and UCLA and
teams like that, so I think we were prepared for them when we came into this
game today.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you spoke yesterday about saying you didn't know what to
expect come March, this being your first time in. But here you are running
this team, talking to Lexi through her shooting problems. You're going to
coach the 3-on-3 team coming down. Obviously leadership is not an issue for
you when it comes to that and making those series of threes in the first half
of this game. Here you are for the first time; how comfortable is it? How much
does this fit and how much is it you as a player now?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, basketball is basketball regardless of really what
stage you're on, and I hold these kids accountable, preseason and now. I want
everyone to try their best, exceed all the expectations that people have for
us, especially as freshmen. So I think that just builds into the leadership
that I have for this team, and I think our coaches do a really good job on
setting a vision for us, and we're trying to achieve everything that we set
out to achieve.  
  
Q. If UConn manages to beat UCLA, you're going to face UConn. It's going
to be the potential for one of the greatest upsets in history to cap off this
run. Have you allowed yourself to think about it in those terms?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, regardless what team is going to win tonight, we're
going to be prepared. So whatever is going to happen, when that ball goes in
the air is going to happen, but I know that we're not going to go down easy.
We're going to give every team a fight. We're going to play our hardest, and
if that means we upset the No. 1 team in the country, then that's what's going
to happen.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how eager were you to face Destiny, obviously one of the
top-rated point guards in your class, and based on the numbers you outplayed
her. Was that even more satisfying as a part of the win?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, not at all. It was my team versus her team, it wasn't me
versus her. The numbers and all that doesn't matter to me. I think I was just
excited that our team withstood their run and we withstood what they had to
offer and got the win.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you talk a little bit about some of the aspects of the
Oregon game that you'd like to see maybe tighten up or really hit strides a
little sooner for the next game as you advance in the tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think we need to take care of the ball a little more. We
got a little bit careless with it there in the second half, so I think we just
need to take care of the ball, continue to move it side-top-side. We'll hit
shots. We do that pretty well. We keep pounding it in down low to our great
post players, we'll hit the mid-range shots. I think if we continue to do what
we're doing, we'll be fine come Monday.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Like she said, take care of the ball, making sure you hit every
rebound and definitely get a fight up there in the air, and I think with that,
we'll definitely be ready.  
  
OTI GELDON: If we continue to do well on defense and transition, stopping them
in transition, I think we'll continue to do well.  
  
Q. Sabrina, on the flipside of you guys playing so loose and care-free,
when you are in control of the game whether it's against Duke or tonight
against Maryland, can you feel the other team kind of crumbling under the
weight of expectations and getting tight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I don't think a lot of teams are really prepared for us to
come out how we did, and the atmosphere was great. It was loud, and I don't
think they were really prepared for what we had to offer that late. But no,
we're just excited. We get the ball to the people that need to have the ball
in their hands that late in the game, and we do what we do.  
  
Q. You had mentioned yesterday that these guys probably don't realize
what they're doing at this point; can you just address the poise and that
whole aspect of this? Are they playing with house money at this point? Are you
surprised at how loose they are and what they're doing?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, you just said all of it, really. I think it's all in the
attitude. I think they are playing loose. They're a loose team, so it's not
like we're -- we try to make them that way.  
  
They just continue to show great poise, and I think Oti had a great response
to a question. I think the Pac-12 has really prepared us for this moment.
Whoever we play in this next game is going to be like our 11th game against a
team on the 1, 2, or 3 seed line. And we've played three or four against 4
seeds.  
  
So we've played against a lot of really good teams. We've played them tough.
We've won a few. So I think our kids, the more you win these close games and
these big games, they start to believe. Like they said, they really don't have
a lot to lose.  
  
Q. Coach, most people get one 40-year-old freshman point guard in a
generation and you had Vandersloot. Talk about what it's like to have somebody
like Sabrina. She acts so much older than she is as a freshman, the way she
takes responsibility for things and the way that she seems to conduct herself
and take care of business.  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. Good comparison. Her and Courtney share a lot of the
same traits that have nothing to do with skills on the basketball court.
They're great leaders. They're hard workers. They have a competitive spirit
that defines them. I think they give their teammates a lot of confidence
knowing that, hey, tonight we're going to have the best player on the floor,
and all those things are so valuable.  
  
And then you add to that all the things she can do on the court, a diverse
range of talents. It's not just the shooting, it's the penetration, it's her
elite vision that she has, especially in transition, her ability to scrap out
rebounds for a 5'10" slow kid. You know, she's the whole package. She truly
is.  
  
Q. Kelly, two-part question. Maryland came in averaging 90 points a
game, best scoring offense in the country. You hold them to a season low 63.
What was working?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, that was the key to the game. I think we did a few things
well. Number one, early on, we just tried to go to 2-2-1, just a little tempo
press to slow them down. I think, number two, we didn't turn the ball over a
lot, so they weren't able to get out and get easy baskets in transition.
Thirdly, I thought we shot a decent percentage, especially in the second half.
We shot the ball really well, and we played the game at our tempo.  
  
Offensively we wanted to, like Sabrina likes to say, side-top-side. We kept
moving the basketball and making them defend. You know, we just -- really, I
thought defensively and tempo-wise, we played about as good a game as we can
play, because to beat them you've got to lessen the number of possessions.  
  
Q. We had talked the other day about trying to counteract Maryland's
experience. You hold Shatori 6 for 18 in shooting, Bri missed a bunch of lay-
ups. What were you able to do to frustrate them?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you know, we're big. We're taller than the average team,
so that helps. Even though we committed some fouls that I wish we wouldn't
have, and we'll talk about that in the day in between, we can match teams'
size and make it difficult for them to shoot over us.  
  
I thought inside, playing them to a one-rebound difference was key. They've
been crushing people on the boards, and we did a good job there. They didn't
kill us on second-chance points. And I think lastly, they didn't make a three.
And if you can make these guys shoot twos, you've got a chance.  
  
Q. Just to jump off that point, not just the fact that they had no made
threes, but they only attempted six. What were you doing schematically to
chase them off the line?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, that's just what we were doing. We were trying to chase
them off the line. You can't leave No. 12, and I thought with Walker-
Kimbrough, we did just a really good job of getting over the top of screens. I
thought consistently, defensively, our team did a great job of staying
focused. You know, sometimes you might go under a ball screen and that gives
her license to take that shot. We consistently went over the top, and they
really played it well.  
  
I think it's just kind of a focus thing. And again, they didn't get a lot of
opportunity in transition, which is where they get it. Slocum and Walker-
Kimbrough, they do a good job of probing and pushing the ball in transition.
That's when they get those kick-out threes, and we just didn't allow a lot of
that tonight.  
  
Q. You guys have been a pretty good transition defensive team all year,
but you actually are 236th in the country in terms of the half court. That's
the whole season, though. Is there a dramatic difference in how well you
played defensively in the half court? What is responsible for this run in
large part?  
KELLY GRAVES: No doubt. That's the area we've improved the most from day one.
I don't know if you have any game left, but if you'd played us early in the
season, you'd have been an All-American. We couldn't guard anybody, and we've
gotten better and better and better, and I think that's where our team has
shown the most growth. Your defense is what's tested in the tournament, and
we've passed it three times, those tests.  
  
Q. What was the locker room like? Obviously Mark Campbell's birthday and
he's now got that winner stays shirt going, you guys got the mojo in the
locker room.  
KELLY GRAVES: I gave them double trouble tonight. I did the same thing. It was
pretty euphoric. It was pretty euphoric. We had a lot of fun, and I'm just
excited that they're excited. I'm wet all over the place here, but it's really
worth it. There's nothing sweeter than victory.  
  
Q. You had five players that went into double digits. Just talk about
the distribution of the ball on offense.  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought offensively we were on point tonight. We had a few too
many turnovers, as they already talked about, but I thought we had long,
drawn-out possessions. I thought in that stretch in the third quarter we
started to separate a little bit. They were switching up their defenses, and
we were able to hit Lexi Bando a couple times in that corner, and those are
big lifts. You know, she can get three at a time, it just makes us a lot
tougher to guard because we've got Ruthy inside that demands some attention.
We have Sabrina, who can just do a lot with the ball in her hand, and I
thought Maite Cazorla tonight was tremendous. She rarely gets the attention
she deserves, but she had an excellent game, excellent floor game. Didn't come
out I don't think, and just solid at the point.  
  
I think that's just kind of how we play. We share the ball, and I think we
play the right way.  
  
Q. What is it about Oti that you think she's raised her level on the
biggest stage to help you guys advance?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, she's fearless, won a couple of State championships in
high school. She gives us an energy that others don't, and let's face it, we
got in some foul trouble inside, so she had to play a little bit. But I
completely trust her. She's so versatile and attacks the rebounds with
abandon. You know, and her confidence, you can see, her confidence is just
rising game in, game out.  
  
Q. You guys have shot the three well all year. What were you able to do,
especially second half, to open things up for yourself inside?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think they may have pressed a little bit. They started
to pick us up full court, put some pressure on us. That spreads out the
defense, and we were able to reverse the ball quickly and find that shooter in
the corner. They switched a little bit more to a zone in the second half, and
again, tried to trap ball screens, and when you do that on us, we have elite
passers, Maite Cazorla and Sabrina are great passers, so they'll find Bando
over there. They know where she's at.  
  
Q. You talked about experience. Your players talked about experience.
Would you say that was the answer, because it seemed like you had an answer
for every time Maryland shot a switch, whether they went to full court,
whether they went to zone, whether they double-teamed a player. You guys
always had an answer.  
And the second question is do you think that gives you an advantage against
a top-ranked team like a UConn or a UCLA or whoever wins today?  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you know, the experience thing now, the point is kind of
moot because we have three games of experience now in this tournament, like I
said, plus a tough, tough Pac-12 schedule.  
  
Yeah, I think in our league, if you knew our league, there's different teams,
different styles. We've got the teams that slow it down and really focus on
defense. We've got the athletic teams that like to push tempo and pressure-
defend. So we've kind of seen it all at this point, and now it's just a matter
of our players executing, playing smart, and we have really smart players, and
it helps to have two elite play makers in Maite and Sabrina who have excelled
on an international level.  
  
I think we're prepared going in, and my staff does an awesome job. I'm blessed
with the best assistant coaches in the world who prepare these guys for game
situations.  
  
Q. No matter what happens in this game that's being played right now,
you're going to have a chance to make some history, either by being the lowest
seed to ever make it to the Final Four or a chance to have the type of upset
victory over UConn that no one has ever done. No one has ever stopped a streak
that long. Have you given yourself a chance to think about that in these
moments afterwards, and do you think a team like this, a team on a roll, and a
team that doesn't have enough experience to necessarily know what they're
doing is the best position to do it?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't know. I don't know. You know, we obviously haven't been
in this situation. These guys haven't. It's going to take -- either UCLA or
UConn, it doesn't matter. It's going to take our absolute best performance of
the year to move on. And quite frankly, I haven't really even thought about it
yet. I'm kind of taking this win in. Just happy for my team. I truly am. I'm
proud of them and just happy for them. I mean, they've worked really hard, and
I know, so has Maryland, so has everybody else has worked hard, but this is a
really special group, and they're showing that right now.  
  
Yeah, I'll enjoy it. Talk to me tomorrow. I might have a different answer for
you.  
  
Q. One other person that doesn't seem to get enough credit around here
is you. You are now the first person to take two double-seeded teams to the
Elite 8 in the history of the tournament. Let's talk for a second about you
and what you're doing to get these teams prepared and why this doesn't seem to
be a problem for you.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I wouldn't say it's not a problem. I mean, you know, I
don't know. I think I just have -- I'm able to compartmentalize. I'm able to
put things in perspective. I don't really ever get too high or too low, try to
keep the kids focused. The one thing I have been able to do over the years, I
think this is my ninth or tenth win as a double-digit seed. I think it's just
throw out the seeds, who cares, we're a good team. We are a good basketball
team, we're in the field, we're a good team. And I always say a good team with
nothing to lose is a dangerous team.  
  
I think our kids just can play loose because they don't see me uptight. I'm
not going to overplay the next opponent's hand, just like we didn't overplay
this one. I just think that's what you've got to do. I think kids like the
consistency. If you build every team up and they can't play, you start to lose
credibility. I think consistency has always been the best medicine.  
  
Plus we let them know that we've had success as a lower digit so that they can
believe in their coach a little bit. You know, you kind of play on any
advantage that you can have. But listen, I've never scored a basket in the
NCAA Tournament. It's all about the players. It truly is.

### [Brionna Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26977)

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Oregon - 77, Maryland - 63  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, like I just told the team in the locker room, I'm not
going to let one game define the season that we had this year, and I'm
extremely proud of this team and everything we've been through. But I'll tell
you this: Oregon is for real. I thought they were sensational tonight. I
thought they punched first. I thought they were fearless, aggressive,
confident, really punished us in terms of any mistakes, any breakdowns that we
would have.  
  
Most proud of our seniors. You know, 125 career wins they leave with, six
conference titles, two Final Fours, and everything that they've meant to
Maryland for us.  
  
Q. Destiny, this was your lowest point total of the season. Can you
describe what they were doing on defense that held you guys?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I just think it was just one of those days. We were clicking
on offense, things were just -- we kind of lost our game, and I think, even
though this was a low-scoring game, we were trying our best, doing anything we
could do. I don't think there's really an answer for it.  
  
Q. Shatori, was there anything they were doing defensively to kind of
throw you off there a little bit off your game?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Their defense was pretty good, making my shots
difficult. I give credit to the defense, their defense.  
  
Q. Shatori, beyond the three-point shots not falling, they seemed to be
able to run you guys off the line for most of the night. What were they able
to do in that respect? What allowed them to do that?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: I think at times we were maybe overthinking it. It
took us a little bit to get in our rhythm, and they took advantage, they
scored. And I mean, they played a great game, both sides of the ball.  
  
Q. Bri, the double-teaming through much of the night, was that what
allowed them to frustrate you early on? Seemed like you found your footing
later on, but was that the key for them inside?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think early on, I just wasn't being as patient as I normally
was, but credit to them for -- they came out hard on defense, and I think once
we settled in, we worked out of the double-team better.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys struggled to kind of create any momentum, get
anything going in transition or fast. Why was that? What was Oregon doing to
stop that?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Just like Tori said, they were just playing a good game on
both ends of the floor, and they were just being an overall better team
tonight.  
  
Q. Bri and Shatori, I know it's tough right now, but four years at this
program; what have these four years meant to your life?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think I couldn't imagine playing in any other school, and I'm
glad that I chose Maryland. And just the player I've developed myself into,
and I think credit to the coaches and the players I've gotten a chance to play
with, and it's just been an amazing experience.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, this definitely has been an amazing
experience, an amazing four years. I just want to thank Coach B for everything
she's done for me. My teammates this year, my past teammates, I can't repay
this University for everything they've done for me. They've opened so many
doors. I'm glad I spent my four years here at the University of Maryland.  
  
Q. Destiny, watching you dribble out the last few seconds, obviously not
the way you pictured this game going. What's going through your mind during
that time, and are you going to lock that moment away and use it as motivation
do you think going forward?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: The thing that really sucks that was going through my head at
that last minute is that we sent them out this way. And you know, it sucks
when you have two amazing people and two amazing players, and you know they
deserve so much more. And I mean, we clawed and we fought for them, and I wish
we could have done more, and that was the thing that was going through my head
at those last seconds.  
  
Q. Brenda, the team had such great ball security the last two games,
today 21 turnovers. Was that more indicative of what Oregon was able to do
defensively or some unforced errors on your end?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think it was a blend of both. I think defensively they gave us
a lot of different looks with what they were doing, but obviously it's
uncharacteristic for Dez to have five turnovers. We were high in the guard
area, so definitely a blend of most.  
  
Q. Brenda, the six three-point attempts total is much lower than you
guys typically have. What were they doing schematically that allowed that to
happen, especially in your half-court sets?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, it's tough to get threes up when you turn the ball over 21
times, so that impacts your offense with what you're doing. But we weren't
patient. I mean, we talked about moving the ball and being able to cut and
penetrate to kick. I thought they did a much better job on our dribble
penetration and being physical than we were able to do. Every time they
penetrated on us, they got wide-open kicks and dump-downs against our defense.  
  
Q. In such a low-scoring game, do you think that affected the players as
the game went along and they kept trailing? Did they start pressing a little
bit too much, or what was going on?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, I thought we pressed early. They took the air
out of the ball, which was a really smart move by them. We've seen that in the
past. But we didn't handle it well at all.  
  
You know, then it felt like every time we would get it to within six points,
we would have some sort of breakdown, whether it was off of an O board,
whether it was a defensive stop, and then they would break it back open.  
  
Q. You've had your own spectacular freshman with Destiny this year. Can
you talk for a second about the duo of Hebard and Ionescu and what it was like
playing against those two?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I said this coming in: I thought Oregon -- I likened them
to our 2006 National Championship team and how they played when we started two
freshmen and two sophomores. They're just fearless. They don't know any
better, that they should be nervous about this moment. They're confident.
They're really disciplined, and they make you pay for your mistakes.  
  
But they are beyond their years when you talk about as freshmen in terms of
how they're playing.  
  
Q. A lot of the conversation coming into this bracket was about
Maryland-UConn and Duke-Maryland. The fact we didn't see those match-ups come
to pass, what do you think that said about the depth of talent in the game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, no question, when you talk about the depth. I was thinking
about that. When you look at the teams that are in the Sweet 16, and you look
at the talented freshmen for Oregon, you look at our freshmen with Destiny and
our freshman class. And if you went across the board with the teams that are
out there in the Sweet 16, our game is getting there. It's not all the way
there in terms of top-5 talent, but in terms of the depth, it's starting to
get there. You've got the Cinderella teams with Oregon and Quinnipiac now in
terms of what they're able to do.  
  
Q. Bri has faced double-teams all year and done pretty well. Was it
something about them having someone who's 6'4 ", 6'5", did that kind of throw
her off?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought their length and physicality gave her some
problems. I think in the other positions, we didn't relocate and dive and cut
as move as much also to offset that to be able to help her play through the
double-teams.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what was the game plan coming into tonight, into
today, playing them that didn't work, that made you switch to full-court press
and double-team?  
BRENDA FRESE: I have to pick one thing? You know, disappointed in terms of the
different areas we've been able to excel, obviously, that they took away, our
transition game, obviously rebounding, to be only plus one on the glass.  
  
But for us we really felt like the pick on balls in terms of defensively was
going to be a big area as well as us attacking it off the bounce on the
offensive end. I really thought those actions we didn't handle well. We didn't
defend like we had in the first two rounds, and credit their aggressiveness on
the offensive end.  
  
Q. At three-quarter court you went to relatively early on, and then the
full. Was that just an effort to speed up the game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, I mean, when you watch us play, that's something
we've been very successful with over the course of the season, and yeah, I
knew they were going to try to take possessions away from us to be able to
stop our transition game. You know, when they were working the shot clock,
you're definitely trying to speed them up in terms of their possessions.  
  
Q. Bigger picture, this team seemed like it was built in a lot of ways
to face UConn. We've talked about that in the past, in terms of limited
possessions, rebounding, Destiny at the point. How disappointing is it for you
not only to see the season come to an end but to not get that chance at a team
that you guys played really tough this year and last year?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, it's disappointing, like I said, in terms of our
ending because we haven't played like this for a long time. So for it to rear
its ugly head tonight. And obviously as competitors, yeah, that's why we
continue to put them on our schedule. If you want to be the best, you've got
to play the best, and we definitely wanted to have another opportunity and
felt when we play Maryland basketball that good things happen for us.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk about this year the Big Ten maybe not getting
respected by the Committee, you getting sent here, McGuff's team being a 4
seed. The Pac-12 seems to be doing really well in terms of conferencing. I
know these things are cyclical. But what does the Big Ten conference have to
do to play the seeding game a little bit better, for lack of a better word?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, it starts -- obviously, we had some uncharacteristic, out
of conference, non-conference losses that impacted the Big Ten as a whole, so
it starts there in terms of how we're all trying to be able to schedule. And
then in the tournament, when you talk about having two teams in the Sweet 16
is a great thing, but we've got to be able to get more depth to be able to
advance out further.  
  
Q. Kind of the same thing I asked to Bri and Shatori; what have they
meant to you and this program the last four years, and how much will this team
miss them going forward with such a young team now?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I mean, everything. Like I told them in the locker room,
you know, they -- that's why we're in coaching. When you talk about their four
years and their progression and how they came in as freshmen and where they
were, to be able to see them lead this team to new heights, six freshmen this
year, their leadership, everything that they put on the table.  
  
But I know, as we have all year, Bri and Shatori didn't come in like this. It
was a progression, and like we talked about in the locker room, they're going
to hand the baton off to the next wave of players. They have a perfect example
all season of how to work and how to get here early and stay late and how to
put yourself in a position to be really, really successful.  
  
But I can't say enough in terms of what they embodied on the court, off the
court, and I know they're going to continue on and do great things.  
  
Q. Do you see Shatori as the best wing in this draft and Bri as the best
big in this draft coming up?  
BRENDA FRESE: Gosh, I haven't really studied it. I think the draft is more
about what each team needs. I think obviously the two of them have solidified
themselves in this senior class as just dominant players that can come in and
have a big impact. I'm confident wherever they're selected they're going to
have really successful careers.

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Kari Korver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30452)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

  
_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 86, UCLA - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UCLA.  
  
An opening statement from Coach Close.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Well, you know, credit to UConn. They are so consistent in their
standard of excellence.  
  
I thought we were prepared. I thought we believed in what we were doing. We
just had that segment in the first half for about eight minutes where we sort
of lost our focus and our discipline.  
  
When you lose that, they capitalize. So credit to them. They've set the bar of
excellence, and they've kept it there for a really long time. It's just a
really big commitment to all the little details, a lot of the little inches.  
  
I think I shared it with you last year, this is my least favorite statement to
make because I don't want it to end. I just love these young women. These
guys, I mean, this little kid from L.A. here said, Hey, I want to stay home, I
want to build a program, take a risk, do something special. We fell short, but
that's exactly what she's done.  
  
Kari Korver, she's one of my very first phone calls within my first week of
when I got the job. She believed in our mission, not just on the court. We do
things a little differently at UCLA. She believed in it before it ever bore
fruit on the court.  
  
I told the three seniors that I'm different, I'm better because of them. I
feel like I've received way more than I've ever given. I hate to see it end.
But I couldn't be any more proud of their fight. On the court in the second
half, I thought they fought their guts out, really responded.  
  
I couldn't be any more proud of their fight, but I'm even more proud of the
way they represent UCLA, their character, the way they pour out and invest in
each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, you got off to such a good start. What was it? Did
they do anything different when they went on the run? What was the difference
in the first bit?  
KARI KORVER: I think we didn't rebound particularly well. We had a 10-minute
stretch where we didn't get any rebounds. They had a bunch of transition
threes where we weren't getting matched up very well. They had second-chance
points. They hit threes in transition.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Kari. We also had some mental lapses in the
second quarter. That's when they got on their run.  
  
For a second, we kind of looked defeated. That's when they capitalized on
their opportunities to score in transition and get offensive rebounds. I think
it was just our lack of focus.  
  
Q. You were on the team that played UConn a couple years ago. How do you
think your team has evolved in that time?  
KARI KORVER: We're such a better team than that year. We're a lot closer. Our
chemistry is so much better. We share the ball so much better. We're way more
of a hard-working team.  
  
Yeah, our culture has completely changed since that time.  
  
Q. Kari, your coach said you needed to play your best game of the season
to beat these guys. Do you think this was your best game of the season? Do you
think it came close?  
KARI KORVER: I think there were spurts. But, no, I don't think this was our
best game of the season. Like I said earlier, we didn't rebound particularly
well. We know if we're going to win this game, we have to rebound.  
  
Yeah, we had some good spurts in there.  
  
Q. Jordin, all year you've been dominant. To do it today, 20 points, 11
assists, two turnovers, against this UConn team, do you think you made a
statement about the kind of player you have become?  
JORDIN CANADA: I mean, doesn't matter if I'm playing UConn. I really don't
care who I'm playing, honestly. It's all about what I can do to bring energy
to my teammates, what can I do to make my teammates better, and to grow, as
well.  
  
I mean, obviously I had a good game, but that doesn't even matter because we
lost. Yeah, I mean, that's all I can say. Like, I don't really care who we're
playing. I just focus on myself and my team and what I can do to get better.  
  
Q. Jordin, after the game, Coach Auriemma stopped in line and talked to
you a little bit longer than the rest of the players. Say what he said to
you.  
JORDIN CANADA: I'm assuming he thought I was a senior because he said,
Congrats on a great career, good luck on the next level (smiling).  
  
I just took it and ran with it. I told him, Thank you. Maybe that. That's what
he said to me. I just said, Thank you.  
  
Q. For both players, could you talk about your impressions of Saniya
Chong.  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, I felt like some of her success was my fault. There were
times when I was trying to help in, and I shouldn't have. She got open threes.
One time I was pressuring her, she got a wide-open layup. She did a great job,
and I need to do a better job.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: She played her role. She knows who she is as a player. She
helped her team the best way she could.  
  
Q. Jordin, you talked about what Geno said to you. What did Cori say to
you as you came off the court?  
COACH CLOSE: I don't even know.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: She told me we're going to continue to build the program, that
she was proud of me, proud of our team.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Glad you were listening (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, ladies. Congratulations on a
great season. We'll open it up for questions with Coach Close.  
  
Q. The game before, you were watching that Oregon-Maryland game, you
were giving high fives to the Oregon players as they came off the court. Did
that help give you a little extra not momentum or emphasis, but the fact that
they just pulled off a huge upset, another Pac-12 team, you came off to a
strong start?  
COACH CLOSE: I don't know what it did to us. Our players didn't even know that
was happening. I just am proud of Oregon. I think the way that we have built
the Pac-12 is caring about the Pac-12 more than caring about our own
individual success.  
  
I think as now rising tides lifts all boats. But we've said, Hey, we're going
to raise the level of the Pac-12 together. I was just sincerely excited for
them. We recruit against each other all the time. A lot of the players on
their team, I have recruited. I know their staff very well. One of their
assistant coaches is one of my best friends in the business.  
  
I was sincerely excited for them. I don't know how it affected us. But I want
to give them a lot of credit and tell them I'm really excited for them.  
  
Q. How deflating is it when someone like Saniya Chong has the game she
does? You did a good job against a couple of their starters.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I don't think it's deflating. I think that's what they do.
They don't rely just on one individual player. They're a really solid team. I
mean, you've heard Geno talk about that for years; that when you go to UConn,
you're ready, and it's not about you, right?  
  
Didn't matter to Katie Lou or Collier. Hey, that's my team. When she does
well, we do well.  
  
I don't think it's deflating. I think that's a compliment to them. That didn't
surprise me. You can't do a good job on just two or three players with
Connecticut. You have to do a phenomenal, A-plus job on the team. I've watched
her a lot on film. She did a great job all year long for them.  
  
Didn't surprise me at all. It's never about the individual. It's always about
the team. I think she was just ready when her number was called and her
opportunity came.  
  
Q. You only had six turnovers against UConn, which is the least they've
forced this season. Do you think that's a key for another team to beat UConn?
If not, what do you think is?  
COACH CLOSE: I think, because they're so efficient, you have to control
possessions. So that can happen in different ways. That can either happen in
turnover margin, getting easier shots, or it can happen in rebounding.  
  
In that segment, I think at halftime they had 17 points off of our turnovers
or second-chance points. I think you can't let them have more shots on the
goal than you because they're just too efficient. You have to get more shots
on the goal because there's not another team in the country that's as
efficient as them. You have to get more opportunities.  
  
You have to win the possessions battle. Yes, I think we did okay, but we only
took care of half of it. We took care of the ball, but we needed to take care
of the rebounding and second-chance opportunities. We needed to get some more
of those opportunities. The compliment to them on their rebounding is they
only really crashed two people. The fact they get so many second-shot
opportunities, what a compliment to their perseverance.  
  
Q. Did you think you would match up better with Collier and Williams?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, it's very difficult. When you have to chase on screens and
you got a hedge on really good three-point shooters, that's always going to
leave you a little bit vulnerable for slips and rolls to the basket. They run
so much in the middle of the floor, it makes it hard to rotate and help
because who are you going to come off of. Obviously not any of their players.
They shot the three so well.  
  
You know, I thought we would have to play our best defensive game. I thought
we would have to do it really consistently. I think any time we had a mental
lapse or we were a step late, then, you know, it's the inches.  
  
One of my staff members said to the team in the locker room, You didn't lose
it by the feet, you lost it by the inches. You can't give up any inches.  
  
I thought we matched up okay. I knew we would have to be absolutely locked in.
Those hedges and pick'n rolls either off the stagger screens where you have to
hedge for a second to buy time for the person coming off, or on the screen and
rolls, I knew we would have to be extremely quick on those exchanges. We
weren't.  
  
Q. UConn couldn't literally put you away or dominate you like they have
previous teams in this tournament. What do you think you need to do as far as
for next season to beat a team like a Baylor, Texas, Notre Dame, UConn?  
COACH CLOSE: I think we've already shown we can do that with some of those
other teams.  
  
I will tell you we have a very good, teachable moment right in front of us.
Our second and third games of the year are against Baylor and UConn at home in
November.  
  
We're going to have a chance to see if we've learned anything from this
experience.  
  
I really believe we're knocking at the door of the nation's elite on a
consistent basis, but we haven't thrown the door down. That's what you got to
do. You got to want it so bad that you're not knocking on the door, you're
throwing it open, busting through that next level.  
  
We're close, but it's the difference of this much. I think this game, what we
talked about in the locker room, is about those inches. I mean, you can tell,
I'm becoming such a softy in my old age, they get me to cry at a moment's
notice. I love them. I believe they're invested, not only in competing for a
national championship, but they're investing at growing at every opportunity,
pouring into each other.  
  
I believe you will see the difference right off the bat because we will work
all spring, all summer for those little inches.  
  
You can't have a mental lapse. You can't go into yourself. There were a couple
times we were mad we missed a basket, then in transition defense we weren't
quite quick enough matching up and communicating. Bam, give up a three. That's
a five-point swing. We missed a layup, gave up a three. We will learn from
those inches.  
  
We have to be ready to bust the door down, not be okay knocking on it.  
  
Q. You and Oregon came across country, got set with early afternoon
playing times on top of that. Talk for a second what the impact is on having
to adjust to flying all the way over here, then playing so early in the day
for you guys.  
COACH CLOSE: I think if you're a competitor, you got to be -- obviously didn't
bother Oregon. So I think at that point you got to say, Hey, whenever you
decide to let me toss this ball up, I'm thankful to be here and you will get
my best.  
  
I think it's a lack of mental toughness for us to even acknowledge it. You're
getting a chance to play in the Sweet 16. I don't care if it's 6:00 in the
morning, get yourself ready to play.  
  
Q. Two parts to this. Jordin dismissed it a little bit in terms of who
she was playing. For her to put up 20-11-2, and Monique having 17-16 against
their bigs on the inside, are those markers, in your mind, for what you can
do? Do you see them as reasons to be more confident going into the Baylor-
UConn vortex next November?  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah. But I think they've been proving that all year. I think
that's what you saw from Jordin, That's what my job is, that's what people
expect from me, that's what I have to deliver for my team.  
  
Monique only had six -- I don't know how many rebounds she had at halftime.
Not very many. We really challenged her. For her to deliver on such a high
level in the second half with her rebounding, I thought she really stepped up
and did a really good job. I thought she was really confident from the start.
Really proud of her.  
  
Jordin and Monique, they sort of hold the torch. They know that they have to
show up every single day, that we are playing around them. They may be the
focal point, but you need every single person.  
  
I think just like Samuelson and Collier and those guys were focal points,
obviously Gabby Williams, you saw Chong, you need everybody all the time.  
  
But they are, they're the pillars of sort of what we're building around. With
great privilege, they get the most touches, most plays run for them. They also
get the biggest wrath from me. Much is given, much is required.  
  
They will need to carry that torch at an even higher level this off-season.
Talking to Jordin the other day, I said, You're going to have to be the one
that says, Hey, if you want to be ready -- I didn't say this, I said, If you
want to be ready to be at your best, if you want to be ready for when UConn
comes in our building, you're showing up at this time, doing this work. Anyone
that wants to be ready, you better show up.  
  
That's the kind of leadership that Monique and Jordin give us. We will go as
they go.  
  
Q. Your thoughts from a coaching perspective. How do you create a new
team next season knowing you have some pieces leaving? Sounds like you have an
idea of what you want the team to look like. There might be a different
culture because they're new pieces. How do you balance that?  
COACH CLOSE: I think it's about people and relationships. Every year is a new
puzzle. Every year, it's not a scientific formula, it's an absolute art piece.  
  
I don't think you can create a beautiful art piece without really knowing what
you have. I think it's going to be a lot about caring about individuals,
taking the time to invest if in them as young women, understanding how they
fit together. We're not individual pieces that we're throwing together, we're
really trying to build a complementary puzzle.  
  
I don't think you can know that until you invest in the people. I think that's
what we're doing. The mission of our program is to be an elite basketball
program that teaches, mentors and equips young women for life beyond UCLA.  
  
The reality of that is you have to know them in order to push them to that
end. If we want to be an elite basketball program that's competing for a
national championship every year, you got to do the work with the people. You
got to invest in them sincerely, push them to grow. You can't push people to
gears they don't even know they have if you don't have a relationship of
trust. It will start there.  
  
I have phenomenal assistant coaches and staff. It will be about, Hey, how do
we adjust? We're not going to run always the same stuff and just recycle.
We'll say, Hey, what puts our players in the best possible position? It's all
about investing in relationships and player development.  
  
Q. On Monday night, what do the Ducks have to do?  
COACH CLOSE: I mean, the good news is that March, you have to have great guard
play. Oregon has great guard play. They're going to have to read the screen
and roll really well, handle all those switches. There's not a mismatch. A lot
of times when people switch as much as they do, there's a mismatch you can
exploit. I think that's going to be harder.  
  
They're going to have to shoot the three well. They have to get enough stops
that they can play up-tempo and shoot the three. I think they're going to have
trade some threes and twos.  
  
Their kids, they don't know they're young. I've been watching them all year
grow. They just love playing together. It's going to be a tall challenge, but
I'm excited to watch them compete.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time this weekend.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Thank you all. I appreciate the media and how you guys are
growing our game. Thank you and you guys keep it up.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
UConn - 86, UCLA - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UConn. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach Auriemma.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Obviously, you know, we played a really, really good team.
They are hard to play against. And today was a struggle for us. Even when we
got up 20, I didn't think it was like being up 20 against somebody else, where
you know it's going to go from 20 to 30. I never had that feeling.  
  
It was a grind for our guys. We felt it a little bit in the fourth quarter.  
  
These two here, especially, they were amazing. They just keep playing and
playing and playing, just keep making plays when we need them to make a play.
Between the two of them and Saniya, they were just really, really, really
good.  
  
We got our work cut out for us on Monday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Gabby, can you talk about Saniya's contributions today. Seemed like
her baskets came at big moments, breaking the press when they brought the
press to you.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, at times it seemed like she was the only person we could
really trust with the ball. She was able to penetrate the zone, which is what
you have to do against a team like that. She handled their full-court
pressure. She just played really confidently tonight.  
  
Q. Gabby, Saniya on the defensive end it seemed like was everywhere she
needed to be today. What do you see from her at that end both in a game-by-
game basis and today?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, she stepped up. They're not an easy team to guard. I
mean, the matchups are pretty tough. I was really impressed with how she did
on the glass. She was boxing out guys that were a lot bigger than her. She
tried to stop dribble-penetration as best she can. I think she did a really
good job with that.  
  
Q. Gabby, it's not very often that you get matched up with somebody
that's almost as athletic as you are. Monique Billings has that type of
jumping ability, the length, is very similar in style to you. Can you talk for
a second about what it was like to actually face somebody that can compete
with you athletically, not just basketball-wise.  
GABBY WILLIAMS: It was tough. It was a challenge. Usually, you know, I try to
use my athleticism as my advantage. I couldn't really do that tonight. So I
had to find another way to, you know, guard her to match up with her.  
  
I'm glad I was able to see that, you know, going into next game.  
  
Q. Gabby, during the handshakes, many of you guys didn't really have a
smile on your face, yet you won. Why was that?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think we were just kind of exhausted. It was a long final
three minutes. We were happy, you know, once we got back into the locker room.
We didn't end the game as well as we would have liked to. I think the look on
our face is just a result of how the last few minutes kind of dragged for us.  
  
Q. Did you get a chance to see Oregon before you played today? What do
you think of that matchup come Monday?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, we watched the game. We've been watching them the whole
tournament. We've been watching everybody.  
  
So it's the same thing. They're here for a reason. Right now they're a really
good team obviously. They're a lot similar to UCLA in that they have really
good perimeter players. They're really good on the glass.  
  
We're just going to have to go in with kind of a similar game plan, I think.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: You know, like Gabby said, they're a really good team.
There's no bad teams left. Monday is going to be a hard game as well. We're
really going to have to stop them on the three-point line because they have
some really good guards.  
  
Q. Napheesa, you had your customary offensive game today. Three blocked
shots, tie-up during a team moment. Did this feel like a big step forward for
you defensively as well?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think every game I try to get better on defense because
it's one of my weakest points in my game right now. I'm just trying as hard as
I can in the games, trying to do those hustle plays.  
  
Q. Napheesa, Gabby was saying that last three minutes seemed like it
would never end. How did you keep finding a way to make one more play? How did
you find that within yourselves?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Well, the time I was in, because I fouled out at the end
(smiling), we tried to keep them off the three-point line and tried to box
out, which we didn't do as well as we did in the beginning of the game.  
  
Because we were fouling, because we kept reviewing plays, that made it drag
out longer. From the bench, from my standpoint on the bench, it seemed like
that really dragged it on, like I said, just because we weren't really, you
know, stopping them on the perimeter as much.  
  
Q. For both players. It's only three minutes in, but when you're down
9-2, is that a bit of a wake-up call for you?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: We like to say that, you know, to play with us, it's a
marathon, it's not a sprint. They came out hard. They came out aggressive. But
there was 37 minutes left to play.  
  
I think we got a lot of good shots up in those first few minutes, they just
weren't falling. Once they started to fall, once we started to execute better
on defense, the game kind of fell into place.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, teams are going to go on runs. I think the important
thing is to stop the runs as quickly as we can. I think we did that. Then go
out there more and try to score.  
  
Our shots started falling, so I think that's what happened. So I think we
adjusted to it pretty well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll see you tomorrow. We'll take questions
for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, at this point in her career, how nice is it to see Saniya come
out tonight in this spot and play this well?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I was just looking at the stat sheet. That's probably more
points tonight that she scored than in maybe the three previous NCAA
tournaments combined. That's how little she played the last three years.  
  
I said before the conference tournament at Mohegan, there's three guys we need
to play at their level, Saniya is one of them, Crystal is the other one.
Today, the effort and play of Saniya, I thought it was the difference in the
game. You know what you're going to get from those other guys. They did what
they always do, for the most part.  
  
Saniya made some big plays, big shots. She's as good now as she can be. It's
at the perfect time in her career. I mean, she's a senior. Sometimes it never
happens. I'm really thrilled for her that it's happening. She deserves it.
She's hung in there.  
  
Q. Geno, Gabby was saying a little bit earlier, to play with us it's a
marathon, not a sprint. Is it the same thing when you look at Saniya in terms
of her development?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I was really anxious to see how Saniya's game would
transfer over to the college game because when she played in high school, it
was chaotic. They would just run up and down the floor. They would try to
score 100 every night in a high school game.  
  
I went to see her play one night. I don't know, she must have had 45 points or
something. If she could have passed it to herself, she would have, back then.  
  
When she got here, it just was a real struggle for her. It was a real
struggle. A real struggle to play with other good players on the floor, to not
just be able to do whatever you feel like doing; that you have to share the
ball, you have to play some defense, you got to be mentally ready. You know,
it was really a struggle for her.  
  
She would get it going for a week. We would always say, All right, this is it.
Then it would go away. Then she would get it back for another week. All right,
we got it. Then it would go away. It was like that every year.  
  
This year, you know, it's all kind of fallen into place for her. She deserves
it. She's worked hard. She deserves it.  
  
Q. Coach, a similar question that I asked your player. You looked pretty
frustrated, as well. What part of the game were you guys not executing that
was obviously frustrating you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, as I said, you know, when we got up 20, it
wasn't going to be just roll over and get up a bunch. That doesn't happen
generally at this time of the year.  
  
But I didn't think we really took advantage of a lot of things that we could
have taken advantage of, the way they were playing against us. Some of that
was we were tired. We played a lot of minutes. Some of it, we made some
bonehead mistakes, you know.  
  
I don't mind us making physical mistakes, either 'cause we're tired or we're
just not good enough, whatever the case may be. But we got tired mentally, and
that bothered me a little bit. At this time of year, where you are mentally is
going to be the difference maker in the games at this time of the year.  
  
Everybody's good. Everybody's physically capable. So I was kind of
disappointed. And I know they were, too, because they pride themselves on
being able to finish things out.  
  
Plus, you know, the fouls, the waiting. It was just a drag. It was.  
  
Q. Geno, I know in your former job as USA Basketball coach, you said you
hated it when they said they have nothing to lose against the other team.
Oregon has so much youth. What has impressed you about them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They were too young to know any better. They didn't realize
they're supposed to be, like, nervous. They don't realize this is supposed to
be really hard, you know. You're not supposed to just walk into the NCAA
tournament and just start beating teams with three freshmen in the starting
lineup, and a freshman point guard.  
  
I'm not even the least bit surprised at what they're doing. Not even a little
bit. I remember when Kelly got the job. I told everybody in the coaching
profession, I said, They're going to be in the Final Four sooner than anybody
thinks. As I said earlier today, it better not be this soon. But they're going
to be there because he's a hell of a coach. You can recruit pretty good
players to the University of Oregon. He's done that.  
  
They are a really, really good team. If you got really good guards, you can
have a really good team. They've got some pretty good guards.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked about Saniya figuring it out, out on the court. To
what extent do you see the figuring out on the defensive end, what she is for
you as a defensive weapon at this point?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, that was a big struggle for her, playing defense,
because, again, it was something different for her. I think the thing that
kids generally learn when they come to play at UConn is you can't shoot your
way into our lineup. I mean, Lou does. She don't guard anybody. She doesn't
even pretend. At least some people pretend. She don't even know how to
pretend.  
  
But Saniya knew. She came here, we got some pretty good players on the team.
Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Kelly Faris. We got guys that are pretty good.
She knew. If I don't play defense, I'm not going to play.  
  
It was a real struggle for her. It finally dawned on her. She's become a
really good defender, really good. I trust her. Never thought I'd say that,
but I trust her. She has put a lot of time and effort into this. It means a
lot to her right now.  
  
We put her in a situation that I wanted her on the free-throw line at the end
of the game because I trust her. And we put her on Jordin Canada a lot,
because I trust her. That's the best thing that you can get from your coach,
is they trust you.  
  
Q. To talk about Oregon, how you were saying they were young, they don't
know any better, are you also concerned about their play as far as, like, when
Maryland tried to defend them, Maryland threw everything at them, the same
thing how you sometimes win, teams try to catch at you, you throw different
defenses? Oregon seemed like they had an answer for every defense thrown at
them. Is that definitely one of the major concern, going into the game
Monday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, yeah. It always is at this time of the year. This is the
hardest time of the year to be a good defensive team because all the bad
offensive teams are home. They're not playing. So everybody you play at this
time of the year knows what they're doing on offense, for the most part. So
you got to be good defensively at this time of the year.  
  
But, even more important than that, you got to get great possessions and you
got to score over and over and over and over and over again. You go long
stretches without scoring at this time of the year, you're going to lose, or
you're going to put yourself in position to lose.  
  
Sometimes the pressure that teams put on you by scoring, and I think that's
what they did to Maryland today, they would come down and get a bucket, and
Maryland would miss, then they would go down and run 28 seconds off the shot
clock, get another bucket, and Maryland would come down and miss. After a
while, the pressure to have to score gets to kids.  
  
Yeah, I don't know if we can defend them on Monday. I really don't. We'll come
up with something. But this time of the year, I want to try to get to 90 and
take my chances. I don't want to try to win a game 65-60. That's probably not
going to work.  
  
Q. Jordin Canada said after the game you congratulated her for a great
career. Did you know she was a junior?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. We recruited her coming out of high school. She's become
a really, really good player. I don't think she was this good when she was
coming out of high school. She was good, and I thought she would get better.
But she's worked really hard to improve offensively. She makes shots now that
she didn't make back then.  
  
We played them two years ago, and we didn't have to guard her that much. Now,
you see, she controls the entire game for them. She not only gets the ball to
players, but she gets in the lane and she causes problems. You got to kind of
build your defense around how to guard her.  
  
I know, I mean, you watch a majority of their games, and there hasn't been too
many people that have been able to guard her. I just wanted to kind of let her
know that, that her career has been great. For a minute there, I did think she
was a senior 'cause... Did she sit out a year maybe? No. Seems like she's been
there forever. When kids start out as a freshman, they feel like they've been
there forever.  
  
I remembered after the fact that she has another year left. She's just gotten
better and better every year. I was really impressed with her.  
  
Q. This team that you just played was incredibly athletic as well as
long. Strikes me that Oregon doesn't have that pure athleticism at the same
level. Is that your impression? Does that make a difference in how you're
going to be able to run your stuff?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're a completely different kind of team. You know,
Doug Bruno and I have that conversation all the time, about what really
constitutes athletic. People have this vision of what a great athlete is. It
usually involves somebody that looks like LeBron, you know. Somebody that
there isn't anything on the basketball court they physically can't do.  
  
Well, that's one definition of an athlete. Bruno and I talk about the kind of
athletes that have an amazing set of eyes. Like, they see things nobody else
can see. Their feet, they move to spots way before anybody knows they're
supposed to be there. Their minds are really just quicker than everybody
else's. They're one step ahead of everybody else.  
  
So Oregon's got a bunch of those kids. They're athletic in a different way
than UCLA is. Doesn't mean they're better or worse. But they're different. I
don't think a lot of times that gets recognized. We try to do that. We try to
recruit kids that have that, you know, and can run and jump, like Gabby. We
try to do that, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Just talk for a second about the freshmen in this tournament. You
have your own, Sabrina is unbelievable, Maryland has one in Destiny.  
KELLY GRAVES: Agreed. Yeah, no doubt about it. I don't know all of them.
Destiny, of course, very familiar with, because over the last three or four
days, I've seen a lot of film on her. Very, very impressive, plus she's a West
Coast kid, so I had a chance to watch her in high school, as well.  
  
I can mainly just speak to these three. It's incredible what they've done. Not
too many teams are going to go this far relying so much on freshmen, and we
really didn't have much experience with the rest of the team. I think coming
into the season, we had six years of Duck experience, so it's not like we had
a Walker-Kimbrough and a Jones who can help those two freshmen that they have.
We kind of went into this thing sight unseen.  
  
But been very impressed with their professionalism, each and every day, their
coachability, and just their effort. They play really hard.  
  
Q. Kelly, how has the team responded the last couple days to all the
travel and finals being done and really focused in on Maryland and what they
do?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they've handled it, I think, a lot better than their
coach. I've got a cold. And that's a lot of travel. But they're 18- to
21-year-olds, and I think they've handled it well. Two cross-country trips in
a matter of five or six days, I think, would take its toll on anybody. Add to
that two days of finals in between, and it's understandable that they might be
tired. But we're certainly not going to use that as an excuse by any means,
and I think that come tomorrow at tip-off, we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. Was there a moment in the season where you saw the freshmen coming
together or a game where you kind of said, okay, they're starting to get this,
and this could be a special group?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think early on, we had a game against Michigan State
where we just kind of put it all together, won by 30-something points. And in
that game I think the freshmen really shined. But that was early, so we didn't
really at that time even know what we had.  
  
I thought it kind of started to come together when Sabrina came back from an
injury. She missed about a month. We lost four games during that stretch, and
we made kind of a miracle comeback at Cal. They were ranked at the time. Ruthy
made a tremendous defensive play that led to a basket, which gave us a chance
then to have Sabrina's basket at the end. Mallory played really well that
weekend.  
  
So I think that was kind of the weekend that we figured, hey, you know, we can
do this. I know we're young, but we can play, and I think from then on, we
actually played really, really well the rest of Pac-12 play. I would say maybe
the Cal game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about coming out of the Pac-12 Conference
and what you think that has done for your young team coming into the NCAA
Tournament?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they had to grow up fast because it's such a competitive
league, as is evident by five teams in the Sweet 16. You know, we were joking,
I don't think there's a -- in fact, I know there's not a team in the
tournament that has played more teams in the 1 and 2 seed lines. We've played
seven games against teams on those seed lines, and so, you know, we've kind of
seen a little bit of everything. We've seen teams in our conference that have
athleticism, others that have size, others that have quickness, some really
offensive-oriented teams, and some great defensive teams, so we've seen a
little bit of everything when you run that gauntlet. So they had to grow up
fast.  
  
You know, and I think playing in the Pac-12 has, I think, prepared us for this
moment, no doubt.  
  
Q. You were saying kind of in Eugene how Maryland has kind of played
with a little bit of a chip on their shoulder. Have you seen that on film over
the last couple games you've broken down? Could you describe how that chip has
come to fruition?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, chip or no chip, they're really good. Whatever they need
to be motivated, I think only adds to what they already have. I mean, they are
a great team. You know, I'm -- not baffled, but you wonder why they were a 3
seed with their résumé. It's incredible, who they've played, who they've
beaten. The only two teams they lost to are still playing, one of whom is
considered the best team in the country.  
  
They're just really good, and the more you watch them, the more you realize
that we've got our work cut out for us. They really don't have many holes.
Certainly offensively they have no holes. We've still got to play the game.
We're going to find them. We're going to do what we can to counteract where
they're good, and so we're up and ready for the challenge, no doubt.  
  
Q. I know you left Gonzaga because you wanted to be at the football
school that Oregon has, but it seems like you and the men's program have
turned it into a basketball school the way you're both advancing in the NCAA
Tournament. Any thoughts on how this might be a basketball school as opposed
to the football school it's been for so many years?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I might make people angry if I say it's a basketball
school because football is a big deal there. It's incredible the success that
our men have had. They're great -- I love the staff. They're so open to
helping my staff and us and working with us. The young men they have on their
team are incredible, good friends with our team. I think there's really good
synergy between the two programs, and you know, we've had some of our biggest
thrills on this trip. Actually one of our biggest thrills -- okay, our two
games were better, but the third-best part of the last trip was we all got a
chance to go to a sports bar together, have dinner and watch our men win. So
pretty neat.  
  
And then last night, of course, we sat around and watched that, too. We all
cheer for each other. I think it just goes to show you the commitment that
Oregon has to athletics. I mean, it's incredible. You look up and down, and I
would say we're a track-and-field school if you want to know the truth, cross
country. I mean, there is not a sport that we don't excel at, and I think as a
student-athlete, it's pretty neat that they get to rub shoulders with some of
the elite athletes in the country.  
  
Q. It seems like a lot of the things that you guys do well are things
that Maryland does well. Ruthy and Bri have similar offensive games, Sabrina
matches up pretty well with Destiny, and in terms of the three-point shooting
of Lexi and Shatori, do you see it that way? Do you see the two as parallel
teams, and if so, do you think that helps you or hurts you going into
tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I don't know if it'll help or hurt. We'll find that out
soon enough. Yeah, I guess we do mirror ourselves. We just don't play at the
fast pace they do. We don't push it as much as they do in transition. I think
we're capable, but I think early in the year we tried to do that, and we had
basketballs going off walls and into our poor fans' faces and hands. We just
weren't able to play at that pace, so we've kind of dialed it back a little
bit, become a little bit more half-court oriented. But I think potentially,
yeah, this is a team that can get out and go.  
  
I just think what's important in this game, we've got to somehow limit the
number of possessions. If we play this game in the 90s tomorrow, we're
probably in trouble. If we can keep it between 75 and 80, okay, now, that's a
different story. But yeah, I guess when you look at it that way, we do mirror
each other in a lot of different ways. We're just not as experienced.  
  
Jones, watching her on film, is very impressive. I'm not sure we've seen a
better post player all year. It's incredible. Her positioning, her patience,
balance, strength. I mean, she's the whole package in there. I'm assuming
she's going to have a heck of a pro career.  
  
Q. When you're game planning against a team like Maryland that has such
strong senior leadership, is there anything you can do to counteract that
because they've see it all, been to Final Fours. Is there anything you can do
to counteract that experience?  
KELLY GRAVES: Not really. This moment obviously is not going to be too big.
I'm hoping it's not too big for these guys. I'm hoping it won't be because
they don't know any better. They've only been to one NCAA and they've won two
games. They've never lost. But yeah, there's no substitute for experience, and
to have two great leaders as well as great players as those two are, I think,
can only be a benefit for them, plus they have a championship coach. You know,
she's got that pedigree.  
  
So they have a lot going for them in that experience.  
  
Q. Just to jump off what you said in terms of pace, you guys did slow it
down significantly, and it seemed to happen after you had the 0-3 start in
Pac-12 play. Was that the key to finding it, and if not, what other factors
did play a part in going from that team to the team you are now?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think getting Sabrina back helped, just gave us another
ball handler. We don't have a ton of play makers, so we have to do it kind of
the old-fashioned way, through ball screens, through patience, through ball
movement, through spacing, those kind of things, and I think it was just a
natural progression. I think when you have and rely on so many young kids like
we do, they always play faster than they should. I'm sure Brionna did not play
the way she's playing now as a freshman. You try to do things too fast. And I
encouraged Ruthy to watch her and learn from how she's playing the game
because I think Ruthy is going to have that same kind of ability early on.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
KELLY GRAVES: No. I think we're just slowing things down, just -- as the
natural evolution of a basketball team, with young kids. You just play faster
early, and they're just getting -- we're getting better. I say "they." We are
just getting better offensively.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on tomorrow, but it came out yesterday that you
might have a team in the 3-on-3 tournament for USA Basketball with some of
your freshmen. I know you're a big USA Basketball guy. How neat is that that
you could have three Ducks playing together for this tournament, and are you
going to coach them as the Duck team for the USA Basketball Tournament?  
KELLY GRAVES: I am not going to coach the team. I'm probably going to go on a
little vacation with my family for the weekend because I don't see them as
often as I'd like this time of year. No, they'll be in good hands. Sabrina can
coach them. She's fine. It's just a great opportunity, and I don't know where
we're headed with 3-on-3. My guess is that the NCAA has added sand volleyball.
Maybe there's a point here in the near future where we add 3-on-3 basketball
as a sport. And I think we're headed that way in the Olympics, as well. I just
think it's a great opportunity. There's, I think, six or seven Pac-12 schools
that are sending teams there. I think we're the only conference that maybe USA
Basketball reached out to carte blanche, saying anybody that wants to send a
team. So hey, sign me up. Any chance they have to play more basketball and
compete, I think the better.  
  
Q. Seems like Oti has had a big role for you guys in the tournament.
What kind of element does she give you guys off the bench that just kind of
helps to give you guys a little bit of a punch?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, she's versatile. Oti is just a versatile player, can guard
guards, she can guard big kids. She's excellent on the offensive boards. She's
given us a little different game at the high post, so when we go with her at
the high post instead of Mallory, Mallory has got nice mid-range jump shot,
and Oti can attack the basket a little bit more from there, so it just gives
us a different look, just energy. She's a fun-loving kid and she kind of keeps
the team loose and works her butt off. There are a lot of different areas
she's helping us.  
  
Q. With UConn buying up all the tickets for this event, if you guys are
able to keep it close against Maryland later, are you kind of hoping the crowd
will root for the 10 seed?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, I know our fan base is really ticked off because
they couldn't make the trip cross-country. I'm just kidding. Yeah, I don't
know. I think generally we cheer for underdogs, and my guess is we're
considered quite an underdog. You know, if that comes to fruition, maybe that
happens. I don't know. And I don't think -- I think our team has shown with
wins in some big places this year on the road, I don't think the crowd matters
that much to them. Yeah, I don't think they really play to that or focus on
it. But we could sure use the support. So if the UConn fans do want to cheer
for green and yellow, that's fine, I'll take it.  
  
Q. Defensively was the Duke game one of your better games, and is it
going to take that level of performance and maybe even above that to beat
Maryland?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, yeah. We, I thought, played here. We're going to need to
play there defensively in this next game. Again, we talk about players
evolving, a young team evolving, and defense is usually the thing that takes
the longest. That's a program, that's a culture that you have to build to play
great team defense, and we're just starting to get it a little better. We're
playing to a scout better. Our fundamentals are better. The team concept, the
understanding of how to play within the team defensively is getting better.
Just the natural evolution of things.  
  
As good as we were there, though, we've got to be a lot better. This is a --
well, as a coach it's going to be fun to watch. These are two of the best
offensive teams in the country that we have a chance to watch this weekend in
UConn and Maryland. So I'll be taking some notes, as well.  
  
Q. Specific to your offensive attack and the role that Lexi has played,
both the big shots she's had, but simply the fact that you talk about limited
possessions and efficiency, how effective she's been from three-point range
and how important that has been.  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah. Well, she's a great shooter, no doubt about it, but she
never takes a bad shot, you know. And she's got some kids around her that --
she's got a good inside attack that teams have to play for, so she's the
beneficiary of maybe some extra help or some double-teams inside. We're a good
passing team. We like to make the extra pass, and so that helps somebody like
her.  
  
But she's actually become better at creating her own shots. She can actually
now penetrate a little bit, so it keeps them a little more honest. So she's
getting better in her own game. No, I think -- even when teams try to take her
out, it spreads the floor a lot more for the other four to make things happen.
So she's just -- just having her out there is always a benefit, whether she's
making them or not, they have to play her for the shot.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how well do you know their point guard Destiny, and what
challenges do their guards present you guys?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I played with Destiny Slocum and Kaila Charles, their post
player, as well. We played together at the McDonald's game, and she's a great
point guard. But I don't think it'll cause us too much trouble. We play
against great guards in the Pac-12, and I think we're going to be ready
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For all three of you, just talk about the run you guys have been on.
Coach said you're playing with house money and you don't know any better, just
keep on playing basketball. What's it been like to play in your first NCAA
Tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, we're the underdogs. I think we've been that
all year, especially having six freshmen on the team, and we're playing with
nothing to lose. I mean, I think we've been saying that. Our coach has been
saying that all year, and a team with nothing to lose is a team that's going
to be tough to beat.  
  
So I think we come out, we play every game like it's going to be our last,
because we never do know when it's going to be our last game of the season,
and that's definitely something that I tell the team all the time. You've got
to do everything the best you can because you never know when the ball is
going to stop bouncing. So we come in every day, we play hard, and I think
we're peaking at the right time, so we're going to come out tomorrow and we're
going to give it everything we have and see where that takes us.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's been an amazing experience. Like Sabrina said, there's
nothing to lose, so it's really fun to just go out and give your all and know
at the end of the day when you give your all, you can't be disappointed in
that.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: I have to agree with both of what they said. We have to give
it our all and we are the underdogs. But like Sabrina said, the underdogs are
the ones that nobody expects to win. So we're the team that everybody fears a
little bit more.  
  
Q. Ladies, a lot has been made of the six freshmen, the youth of your
team, but if you had to describe Oregon women's basketball, what would you use
to describe how your team has played this season?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I know we have a lot of freshmen, but I think it's just -- we
play with a lot of heart. We play for each other, and that's definitely what's
got us this far.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think probably one word that would describe us is, like,
relationships. I think, especially having six freshmen, we came in, we had to
get to know each other quickly and get to know the upperclassmen quickly, and
our coaches, you know, we had to get to know them through our recruiting
process. So I think definitely the relationship aspect of this team outside of
basketball has helped us mold together on the court and play for someone other
than ourselves.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: They both covered that one.  
  
Q. Ruthy, I'm wondering, Kelly Graves is saying that he's been telling
you to look at Bri Jones a little bit and just kind of see as a player you
might be able to play at her level maybe when you become an upperclassman.
What is it like seeing her on film and is that kind of one of your goals to
play at that level?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, she's definitely a great basketball player. Her composure
and her ability to finish around the rim is really motivating, and I'm really
excited to play against her tomorrow.  
  
Q. People like us make a big deal about the cross-country travel and the
early start time tomorrow, but as Coach said, you're 18- to 21-year-old kids,
it makes no difference, you just play basketball. Does it matter you're
playing early and does it matter you've flown back and forth twice in a
week?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Well, I mean, we did fly back home to Eugene for two days.
But personally I don't think I got used to the -- back to the West Coast time
because I was already adjusted to the East Coast time. Travel shouldn't really
be a factor in the way that we play. I know it is difficult, but I think we'll
be fine tomorrow morning getting up early and being able to play.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, like Mallory, I'm not really used to the West Coast time
again, so I think we'll be ready to play.  
  
Q. Sabrina, it seems like you have relished taking the big shot. You've
had a number of them, and I'm wondering how long that's been the case for you
and whether you see the NCAA Tournament as an opportunity to do that once
again in a big spot?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I've never really taken game-winning shots prior to my
freshman year coming in here at Oregon. But I think just the competitiveness
in me always wants the ball in my hands at that crunch time, and I think my
teammates believe in me to make game-winning shots. I think that's what it is,
because I've never really practiced game-winning shots prior to this. I mean,
I dream about it all the time and whatnot, yeah.  
  
Q. As freshmen, was there a moment that you can point to where you guys
felt like you were starting to come together and could be part of something
special?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I always knew we were going to be something special, just with
the recruiting class and everything. I think the four games in Spain really
helped us out, and we kind of clicked from the start, and definitely just the
preseason really helped us mesh together, and it went from there.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I agree with Ruthy. I think that Spain trip really
helped us as a young team. We had the 10 practices earlier than most people
that weren't able to go on a trip. So I think that definitely helped us form
relationships and start -- and, of course, the first few practices of the
season weren't great for us. We weren't used to each other. It was pretty much
a brand-new team. But Coach always told us to stick together and continue
doing what we've been doing, so it pays off now. We know each other. We know
each other really well on and off the court, so I think that helps us this
late into March.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Agree with both of them. Just the Spain trip, I think that
really was the building block in what made -- it's going to make this team so
great. That was just a good experience overall, and we've just all come closer
as a team.  
  
Q. For all three of you, obviously it's the first time that Oregon has
been to the Sweet 16. How are you sort of balancing having fun during this
experience and sort of taking that all in, but also realizing that you have a
goal after this weekend to get to the Final Four?  
SABRINA IONESCU: You know, I think we're just enjoying the moment and living
in the moment. This is never going to come -- we're never going to be able to
relive this moment again as freshmen. But I definitely think it gives us a
taste for the next years, the following years. We're excited for next year and
the year after that, especially as a young team. But we definitely want to
continue just coming out and giving it everything we have on the court and
just enjoying the experience.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's just really exciting. I think we're just going to keep
playing hard and see how far that takes us, and whatever happens, I think
we're going to be really proud of ourselves, and I think we should be.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: The experience is amazing overall. It's just an honor to just
make it this far in the Sweet 16, but I know we all have been working super
hard to get here. Just all the hard work we've been putting in has paid off.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, I know you're focused on tomorrow, but it came out
yesterday that you guys are potentially playing in the USA Basketball 3-on-3
tournament in a couple of weeks. Coach said Sabrina, you'd be coaching the
team. Talk about that, playing 3-on-3 is different than playing 5-on-5 and how
you guys got involved in this and what you're looking forward to.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I already was joking around that we're going to start
having plays and play calls, whatever, yesterday. But we both -- we've both
done USA and I think we got a taste of that. But I think we're definitely just
focusing on tomorrow and where we're at now, but I definitely think it's going
to be a great experience for us, and we practice 3-on-3, 4-on-4, 2-on-2 every
day in practice here at Oregon, so I think we're kind of used to playing not
5-on-5. But I think we're excited just for the opportunity to represent our
country in that.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, I think we're really excited, and it's going to be really
fun.  
  
Q. Ruthy, just in terms of the comparison to Bri Jones, you guys do a
lot of the same things, not just scoring around the basket, but efficient, not
a lot of wasted movement. Do you see a lot of your game in her, and are there
any other people that you have patterned your game after right around the
post?  
RUTHY HEBARD: She's definitely a great player, and the way she finishes is
something I'd like to continue to do as well. She's really composed and a
strong player. We watched film on her, and her ability to move people is
something I definitely want to get better on, and her offensive rebounding is
great. So I'm definitely going to try to watch her and try to be a little more
like her in those areas.  
  
Q. He talked about starting out and the building blocks. In terms of
getting solidified, how much has the Pac-12 schedule helped you because, by
comparison, you guys' non-conference schedule may be a little bit higher.  
RUTHY HEBARD: Definitely playing against really top teams like Washington,
UCLA, I think, has helped us get here, too, and I think helped us just prepare
for Temple and Duke as well, just because we got to play against top teams
every day, I think.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, going off that, there's no days off, really. There's no
games off in the Pac-12. There's no night where it's going to be easy to get a
win. I mean, every win is a hard-fought win. So I think that definitely helps
us coming in late into March. We're going to come play against top teams in
the country, and we pretty much do that every night in the Pac-12 back at
home. So I think having such a tough schedule in the conference is going to
help us now.  
  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Adding off of that, just the Pac-12 really prepares you for
March and the NCAA Tournament. Like they both said, you never really take a
night off, so it just prepares you really well.  
  
Q. I know you guys were only home for a couple days and exams were
thrown in there, but I'm guessing there's a buzz around the campus with what
you and the men have done in March. It's a football school, but becoming a
basketball school pretty quickly with the success you guys have had. What's it
been like around campus and watching the men play last night?  
MALLORY MCGWIRE: Just around campus, we have this academic center, and
everybody in there talks about how well both the men and women have been
playing, and it's really nice to see that the campus has been engaged in
watching the games and just seeing how well basketball has been doing at
Oregon.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, going off of that, the buzz around campus has been
great. We always get told congratulations wherever we're going. I think that's
something great to see, that people are paying attention and seeing how much
growth we've been doing. And the men's team, they've been great to us as well.
We get tweets after every game, congratulations, and that kind of goes both
ways. We congratulate them as well. We see them every day in the training room
and on the court, so I think it's great to see that relationship between men's
basketball and women's basketball, and then, of course, the rest of the
University.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, like they said, it's been great. It's really helpful for
us to get congratulations from students and teachers, so it's really nice.  
  
Q. For both of you, Ruthy and Sabrina, between the numbers, Ruthy, that
you've been putting up in March, and Sabrina, the numbers you're putting up,
but also the poise you showed the other night when you were bumped during the
Duke game, I'm curious whether you think that it's overstated how much veteran
leadership matters compared to having teams where the freshmen are doing so
much of the heavy lifting. Obviously your opponent, too, with Destiny, who
runs the team, that some of you have been friends with. Do you think that's
overstated or do you think there's an advantage perhaps in having youth on
your side?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I think it's highlighted all year that we were freshmen, but
Coach Graves always says, we're not freshmen anymore. After 10 games, 15 games
in, we're just ballplayers. And I think focusing on that and knowing what we
can do to help the team out is just what I try to focus on and not think about
youth as much.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, the leadership definitely helps because, you
know, we've never experienced anything like this just coming into freshman
year. I know we were all kind of nervous, where do we go to classes, where do
we -- when is practice, how early do we have to get to practice? So definitely
that side of basketball and school has definitely helped us having some
upperclassmen.  
  
But I think once the ball starts bouncing and once it's up in the air on that
tipped ball, it's just basketball, regardless of if you're a senior or you're
a freshman. No one is taking it easy on you because you are a freshman, and
we're coming at everyone just as they're basketball players, we don't care
what grade they're in. But I definitely think the experience helps. We have no
idea what to expect coming into March. We had no idea. Definitely Pac-12, we
didn't know it was going to be that difficult playing against all those teams
every single night that we played.  
  
But I think that's just going to help us next year. I think we're going to be
well-prepared for the Pac-12 and definitely late into March.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Q. Obviously Destiny has had a tremendous freshman year and Sabrina for
Oregon has had a tremendous freshman year. Talk about the guard play and how
these freshman point guards have been incredible across the landscape.  
BRENDA FRESE: Right. I mean, I think for both of them, they're just fearless.
They're confident. You know, the biggest compliment I can give them both is
that they don't play like freshmen. When you talk about Destiny, you can
continue to see what makes her so special. She is beyond her years. When you
talk about -- the point guard position is just like being the quarterback in
terms of what it requires, and for both of them to slide into their team for
Destiny, two seniors on our rosters, and to come in seamlessly, has been
remarkable to watch.  
  
Q. Curious when you've looked at video and getting ready for this team
tomorrow, it seems like there's sort of an answer to the things that you guys
do best on a personnel basis. For Bree, there's Ruthy and for Shatori, there's
Lexi and for Destiny, there's Sabrina. Is that what you've seen and what else
has stood out for you as you get ready for Oregon tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I think both teams you can obviously see have balanced
scoring across the board, and when you talk about the inside-outside play for
both teams, you can see where the production is spread in terms of the two
teams.  
  
Obviously any time you get to a Sweet 16, that's the great teams that are left
in the bracket, so both teams are going to battle it out for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Since Oregon beat Temple, their attitude has kind of been loose and
they're kind of playing with house money given their youth and this is their
first experience in the tournament together. Does that make them a dangerous
team with the talent they have that's so young?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I liken them to our 2006 National Championship team when
we started two freshmen, two sophomores, and a junior. That team just played
-- they had nothing to lose. They didn't understand the expectations and what
was at stake, advancing each round. So you can, you can see that there's no
pressure on their shoulders, that they're excited to be here, and they're
playing with -- they're peaking at the right time. They're playing with a lot
of confidence.  
  
Q. If you could talk to us about how you go through the games and how
that changes from the beginning of the season and now being in the tournament,
what's your preparation? What are things that you do to get yourself ready for
the team?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, it's both. I mean, throughout the season, I constantly
go back and watch. Every time we play a game, I go back to evaluate our own
team to be able to see where our strengths and where our weaknesses are. I
just continue -- even now in March, you continue to keep learning about your
own team, who's your best inbounder, who's your best late-game finisher, who
do you want at the free-throw line. That's a constant, wherever we're going.  
  
And then you have the preparation on the other side to get ready for your
opponent, and that requires a lot of film across the board between our staff.
I take in as many games as I can until I feel like I've mastered the other
team, so to speak, in terms of what kind of philosophy they have and how they
want to play and what we can take away.  
  
Q. Can you address what Ashlyn Barrett has meant to this team, what she
has taught your players, and then what you plan to do? Is she coming this
weekend, and if not, how do you plan to let her know what's happening?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, for Ashlyn and her family, it was more than we
could ever have envisioned. The initial was obviously wanting her to be a part
of our team and being able to give her an experience back that I know having
gone through, having my own son, when he was sick, and the hospital visits and
kind of what that relief meant.  
  
For our team, they're inspired every day by her. They know how sick of a
little girl she is and everything that she's been through. We've watched her
going from being a mobile child, where she was walking and running to now
being in a wheelchair, and just more and more experiences, times, where she's
having to go to the hospital and to the ER room. Ashlyn had a benefit last
night back in Maryland. Obviously we couldn't attend. They're trying to get
her to some new doctors up in Boston, which is going to require a lot for
their family to be able to do. We were able to Skype in, FaceTime last night,
which was a big deal.  
  
I think the travel would be really tough for Ashlyn to be able to be a part of
this. For us, it's text messages and phone calls back to her mom and pictures
back and forth is just how we can stay connected.  
  
Q. The first two rounds you got to play at home, amazing environments.
What's the challenge been like, if there has been one, to get the team ready
to play on the road so far away from home and a game of this magnitude?  
BRENDA FRESE: It's been easy, to be quite honest. It's no different than the
travel that takes place during your non-conference and regular season, and so
for us, four, four and a half hours, to be able to get up here. You're playing
in the Sweet 16, so you know, it's not hard to motivate your team in terms of
where we're at. Our kids are on spring break, so they're not missing any
school time. They're in a great place. They're ready to play.  
  
Q. I'm curious how you came to the decision as to where and who sits in
what order on your bench in a given game, whether that's static from game to
game, how those choices came about, and if there are any particular reasons
why you came to that decision.  
BRENDA FRESE: That's an unusual question, you're right. It varies from year to
year with what you're doing. I know early I emulated my mentor Bill Fennelly
when I came into coaching, and we sat in the middle of the bench as coaches
and players were to our right and to our left. It's evolved over the years for
whatever reason. We talk about it leading up to a season where we feel like
different staff members need to be placed within the bench. That starts at the
beginning of the season.  
  
So where the players go, I don't know how they choose their seats, but you
know, our staff is consistent in terms of -- it's like going into your
classroom each and every day. You have your same seats, and that stays
consistent for us throughout the season.  
  
Q. Has there been a moment where that's come into play, where it's been
significant to have a coach nearby at a particular time that you can think of
offhand? In other words, has the order made an impact?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I definitely utilize my coaches where I think their
strengths fall. There's different interactions. We ask our players to come up
towards the bench with our guard and post coaches and different ones that just
from meaningful conversations that are going to take place.  
  
Q. Just wondering, Lexi Bando in Oregon, she's had some really big
three-point shooting games recently and some that haven't been as spectacular.
What have you seen in those games where she is having good shooting successes
from beyond the arc?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, we've told our team as we've watched film, timely
threes. I feel like her shots right now in the tournament are timely threes,
and you've got to be able to find her. She is shooting the ball extremely
well, and you have to be there on the catch.  
  
Q. There have been a few issues about the ticketing here, and you've
talked about how disappointing it is that some Maryland fans can't make it up
here. Do you think there should be some changes in terms of holding some
tickets until people know where people are going, or how do you address this
in the future? Obviously you can't do anything about this tournament, but in
the future.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, absolutely. You know, I mean, you're talking about holding
a block, right, for fans, whether that's 500, 200. I mean, the ability, then,
after if you don't use that block, I'm sure the UConn fans would go back and
purchase them. But when teams work so hard all season to only have 100 tickets
available is disappointing. It's disappointing for our fans that can drive it,
when you talk about a region that you're supposed to be put geographically
placed for your fans, to be able to get there that now are priced out or the
tickets are sold out. Definitely. I hope the article brings awareness to the
NCAA in terms of, you know, allowing some sort of fairness and equity across
the board.  
  
Q. How do the seniors in your program help bring along the freshmen and
get them ready for games like this?  
BRENDA FRESE: I can't say enough for our seniors, Shatori and Bri, what
they've done all season long, and it started from our first practice in the
summer to our foreign trip to Italy. They've embraced them. They have just
layered them in confidence. They've believed in them. They've really allowed
them to really kind of mingle -- mix the team to really make them really
tight. So that leadership is critical when you talk about now, every round you
advance, you see it gets closer and closer, the confidence level that's
required per round. The two of them have done a remarkable job with their
leadership.  
  
Q. I know you haven't played Kelly many times as a coach as Oregon. Talk
about what he's brought to that program at Oregon before his time at
Gonzaga.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I've never coached against Kelly, but have always -- from
afar, the success that he had at Gonzaga and now being really able to be
scout-specific with his team and his program, he's a hell of a coach. I mean,
he is tremendous. When you talk about his game planning, his prepping, to take
three freshmen in the starting lineup and take the team -- he's ahead of where
they should be, the success that they've had coming into the Sweet 16. So
really, really impressed with what him and his staff have done.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Chloe Pavlech and what she meant to the
program and how weird it is to know that she's on the other sideline
potentially on Monday night?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, well, you know, we got to have that experience when Chloe
came down to College Park. So now to be back again, you know, she's meant
everything to our program, so I'm not surprised, obviously, to see her now get
a chance in coaching. She has tremendous energy. She could do anything, TV,
coaching. She has a personality bigger than life. You know, the kids adore
her. She brought everything to the table in her four years at Maryland.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about her path
when she was at Maryland. You know, she really wanted to go one of two ways,
whether it's coaching or into TV, and so, I mean, as a journalism major, she
really looked at both parts, and as a point guard you're that floor general,
that leader. Like I said, Chloe has a bright path in any direction of life
that she wants to go. Whoever meets her, you can see her charisma, and she's
going to be very, very successful in life.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. I'm curious how you come to the
decision about which players sit where on the bench, what that process is
like, how it happens. Is there an order? Is there any superstition that goes
into it? How does that come to pass for each of you guys?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: I'm not particularly sure about the bench sitting,
but I know every time we come off the bench, you tap everyone's hands up, and
everyone stands up and slides down and you sit by Coach Terry Nooner.  
  
Q. Destiny, I was just curious how well you know Sabrina from McDonald's
All-American or different tournaments and just your scouting report on
Oregon?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with her, both from the West Coast.
I played her AAU team a few times. She was on my team for McDonald's. I mean,
we're friends, so I know her in that way. Scouting report on Oregon, led by
their freshmen, really, really good shooting team, so I think that's something
we've just got to look out for.  
  
Q. I'm just curious how familiar you were with Oregon, if you ever were
a part of their recruiting for them being on the West Coast.  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, I took an unofficial visit there, so I know the coaching
staff pretty well and some of the recruits, so in that way I'm pretty
familiar.  
  
Q. For the seniors, when you guys were freshmen, what did the seniors do
for you to incorporate you into the program and then how have you don that for
the younger?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think early on when we first got to campus, they took us
under their wing and showed us everything about what Maryland basketball is
about, in practice, outside of practice. And I think we tried to do the same
thing for the freshmen coming in this year and just tried to show them what
Maryland is all about.  
  
Q. For all three of you, Maryland fans have been having problems getting
tickets to this event, obviously, because UConn fans bought them up a long
time ago. Can you guys address playing -- your fans not being able to get up
here, and have any of your friends or family had trouble getting tickets and
not being able to make it here?  
BRIONNA JONES: Yeah, we were aware of the ticket situation, but I feel like
we've been -- we played in hostile environments before when we played the Big
Ten championship, that was in Indianapolis against Purdue. That was close to
their home, and they had a lot of fans there. We played in a hostile
environment against Louisville. It's not nothing that we've never seen before,
so I think we'll be ready for it.  
  
Q. Bri, Oregon obviously has some length in the front court. What are
your thoughts on matching up with them, and is it kind of a personal challenge
to you when other teams have players that can maybe try to match you in the
post?  
BRIONNA JONES: I enjoy playing against post players, bigger post players. I
was really excited for this match-up, just getting to be able to match up with
people more my size. I'm just really looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Destiny, just curious what the week has been in terms of response
from people who may have seen the big shot; it seemed to go viral, and whether
that's sort of the attention-getting moment that you've talked about, trying
to leave your mark on the season, on your career at Maryland, whether you felt
like that was sort of laying down a marker?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I wouldn't think of it as like a marker, I think of it just
kind of -- it was just a lucky shot that went in. It was just kind of a
motivation for our team in that game. It's just kind of something -- social
media was blowing up, and I have like more important goals than people talking
about that shot. So now I'm taking a break with social media and trying to
focus on what's important to our team and things we've been working on since
June.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
DESTINY SLOCUM: It's for like two weeks.  
  
Q. Brionna, a follow-up on their bigs, they have Ruthy, obviously down
low is a very good player and then Mallory shoots that mid-range jump shot.
How unique is that challenge to have two bigs with different types of
offensive games?  
BRIONNA JONES: It's definitely a unique situation, but I think we've played
different post players in our conference, in our non-conference that are
similar. They have post players that can shoot the jumper or post players in
the low post. I think I'm definitely prepared for that match-up.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask each of you if you could reflect on times when,
either individually or as a team, you've been having some challenges and what
your coaching staff has done to get you through in the middle of a game in
order to be where you are right now.  
BRIONNA JONES: I think for some games, like when we start out slow, for one,
our coach is definitely really good at motivating us, and tells us to pick it
up and just locking back into that moment, and you can't get it back all in
one possession, just taking it one possession at a time to get back to our
normal strategies.  
  
Q. Shatori, can you address what Ashlyn Barrett has meant to this team
and how you plan to keep in touch with her through this weekend?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, she means a lot to our team. We like to think
of each other as sisters. This whole organization is just like a big family,
and we look at Ashlyn like she's our little sister because she is our little
sister. She sat and signed our national letter of intent just like all of us
did, so she's just as important to the team as we are. And I don't think she
realizes how much she means to our team, just coming in smiling every day,
when we know she's facing challenges every single day. And that means the
world to us because if she can do that, we can do what we do and push through
anything. And yeah, we Skyped with her yesterday. She had an event. So we're
just going to try to just keep in touch and play for her. (I think the very
first answer was Shatori).  
  
Q. Bri and Shatori, can you talk about playing with each other the last
couple years and reflect on what your time at Maryland has been like?  
BRIONNA JONES: I think coming in, we were just two freshmen, like, trying to
just get a grasp on what Maryland was about. And I think through our years,
we've grown, and I know Shatori is a really competitive person, and I think
she's brought out that in our entire team, and I think she pushes us to be
better every day, and I think just having her for the last four years, it's
been a blessing to be able to play with her.  
  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Bri is a blessing to have down low, and I promise I
would probably have like 600 more turnovers if it wasn't for her. We give a
lot to credit to Bri. I mean, she's our engine. We play through her. I mean,
she's a mismatch problem on all cylinders, and just to see her grow from her
freshman year, coming in with a torn ACL and to see her fight that whole year
and where she's at now is just so crazy to see and watch.  
  
Q. Bri, can you talk about the season? Did you personally expect to have
this kind of dominant role throughout college basketball? You've established
yourself maybe as the best center in the country.  
BRIONNA JONES: I think just every year I've tried to come in and prove my game
and do something better every year. And I think just this being my final year
and just having the sense of urgency of wanting to come out and do whatever I
can for this team, offensively, defensively, just doing whatever I can in my
power to make this team better, I think that's my approach to the season. And
it's just paid off through all the hard work that we've put in through my four
years.  
  
Q. Shatori, would you say this year's team has more of an edge given how
last year's season ended and how much that loss has fueled the run that you're
on now?  
SHATORI WALKER-KIMBROUGH: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we will never forget how
we felt last year, how we sent our seniors out last year. It shouldn't have
went that way, especially all the hard work they put in for their four years.
Part of us, we've been playing for them especially, and like I said, I
remember how I felt, so I would never want our six freshmen to feel that way.
So that's why me and Bri try to lead by example and definitely try to make a
statement every time we step on the court.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, hi, everybody. Sorry we're running a little behind. We had
three kids with a final exam, so we couldn't leave any earlier. You'd think we
would be used to the traffic, but we weren't. But we're excited to be here.
Appreciate all of you helping us grow our game and giving coverage to the
journey of these women. We're excited about the opportunity to continue the
dance and to continue to get better, and we'll just go from there.  
  
Q. You made it a point, it seems like, to go out to Baylor and play them
and go out to South Carolina and play them, obviously hostile environments.
Talk about what your team learned from those games and how you will try to use
it tomorrow in what's probably going to be a real hostile environment.  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think, add the Pac-12 hostile environments to that, as
well. I think it's just a maturation process. You learn to focus on the things
under your control. You know some things are going to be a little bit more
difficult, but it's not something that's going to be unfamiliar. You know, I
think that's one thing I've really enjoyed about this team is they really
don't put too much into that kind of stuff. They're just like, hey, we can't
control that; it is what it is. We're used to it, we've embraced it, and I
think having good point-guard play helps, too.  
  
Q. I remember you and I talked a while ago about when you first got the
UCLA job, you came to UConn and went to practice a few times.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Talk about that experience, when it was, and what it meant to be in a
UConn practice and now you're playing them again?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, great people, that I think -- one of the things I think is
really important is that they're really interested in growing the game, not
just growing UConn, not just -- I think it's bigger than themselves, and I was
a beneficiary of that. I'm a big believer that you've got to learn from the
best, and so I think I've gone back four times, and I brought our entire staff
back, I think maybe our second year at UCLA. And spent, I think, three days
watching practice, and they were gracious to let us pick their brains a little
bit, and it just was a great experience.  
  
Obviously, I've had some great experiences at UCLA. I had the opportunity to
seek out mentorship by John Wooden, as well. I think for me it's just enjoying
being a consummate learner, and you know, I really want our program to be a
consistent, elite program that's playing at the top. So why wouldn't I go seek
out wisdom from the people that are there?  
  
Q. What year was the first time you came to see them? And also, since
you did learn from Coach Wooden, also, just comparing the two of them.  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, I'm really old, so I'm not sure exactly what the year is. I
think the first time I went back was spring of maybe 2011, 2012. I think it
was the spring of that -- I think we were not in the tournament my first year
at UCLA, and I went back myself. And I think I spent three days there, and
then I actually went to Notre Dame on my way back and spent three days there.  
  
But the second part of your question, in terms of Coach Wooden, I think Coach
Wooden and Coach Auriemma have a very high attention to detail, and they are
always going to be pushing the envelope of your best, and I think that's the
big -- I think their styles are vastly different, but that's something they
really share in common is an extreme attention to detail and a consistency to
push that envelope, that there's more, there's more, even to help their
players find gears inside of them that maybe they didn't even know they had.  
  
Q. Two questions sort of jumping off of that point. My memory is that
you have the pyramid of success in your office. You have the first two lit up
at this point. If there's a victory over UConn, if you guys come in and snap
that streak, do you think that the third part of the pyramid will be lit up?
And just also related to that, I'm curious whether you have used the history
and the history of UCLA and the history of coming in and facing a team that
has that record as motivation, as a part of your preparation, getting ready
for this game?  
CORI CLOSE: I'll work my way backwards, and let me know if I forget anything.  
  
I think, no, I haven't, but it is interesting. A few days ago, Nan Wooden
called me, it was her birthday and she was calling to congratulate us on the
game Monday night. But she definitely reminds me of who broke that record, so
there's some other people who have reminded us.  
  
I think that I've really actually tried to stay away from everything that
doesn't have to do with the next 40 minutes. And I think that's part of why
people have a hard time is because they get distracted by a lot of the other
things that really have nothing to do with us. And as much as we are attached
to the history of UCLA and the motivation, I don't think we need any
motivation at this point. You know, if I'm focusing on motivation in the Sweet
16 game, I probably have some bigger problems.  
  
You know, I've really just tried to narrow the focus and tried to know our
team, how do we play our best, stay focused on that.  
  
In terms of the pyramid of success, and I think you're referring to in our
office, we had it -- we called it second-level living, and we were just
literally building the foundations and moving our way up. I think it's really
just -- it's a vivid reminder that we're trusting the process. We're not
talking about the championships. We're doing the work and making the
commitments that lead to those things, and you know, I'll light up a lot of
things if we're able to do that.  
  
But the bottom line for me is that my commitment to these young women is to
create a transformational experience that not only helps them reach their
potential on the court, but helps them long after the ball goes flat.  
  
Part of it is a reminder to the players, but maybe some of it is just a
reminder to me, that it's just one block at a time, one step at a time, and
stay focused on that.  
  
Q. You've talked about learning from coaches, and then also what your
philosophy is and cultivating young women. When you put all of that together,
what would you say is your approach to the season that you've had, but then
does that change when you enter into the postseason tournaments?  
CORI CLOSE: We try not to. I mean, I think that's why you really embrace, like
the gentleman said, about going to play at South Carolina, going to play at
Baylor, playing in the No. 1 conference in the country, is that so when you
get to this point, it doesn't feel like this huge change, we've got to do
something different, we've got to be something different. I think that's
really -- we're trying to build habits that prepare us for moments like this,
and so I really hope it isn't that different. I mean, obviously there's more
media attention, there's more -- longer times being in the locker room before
you ever practice, little things like that, but that's just part of the fun
vibe of being in the March Madness and the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But I really am trying to keep it consistent in our preparation. I've been
challenging our team the whole year, and I just said, hey, you've got to fall
in love with the preparation, and you've got to fall in love with making a
play for somebody else. And it's got to be selfless basketball, and you've got
to enjoy the process of getting better and pushing those comfort zones. It's
gotten us to this point, so I'm going to keep with it.  
  
Q. During the season, technically you played what we referred to as the
AP league, western division. We look out there one night and suddenly you were
diving, then you were rising. Can you talk about the ability to sustain those
ups and downs and get to where you are now?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think, you know, life has disappointments, and basketball
has disappointments, and it has growth opportunities. I think, you know, we
obviously aren't undefeated, but we look back on every single one of the
processes where we've had ups and downs, and I bet if you asked our players,
they would be able to say, oh, we learned this from this point, we learned
this from this point, and I think really just taking a growth mindset to all
the ups and downs that happen in a season and trying to let it teach your
heart.  
  
Just a few weeks ago or a couple weeks ago when we lost in the semifinals of
the Pac-12 tournament, I just was so -- I just was really aware that this was
going to teach our hearts, and I saw how our invested our team was, and I
think that's the way it is all the way through the year. When a team is really
invested, every time there's an up, every time there's a down, there's an
opportunity to grow.  
  
Q. I know you probably didn't spend too much time this year watching
UConn. They're obviously on TV enough that you saw them a few times, but now
that you've probably spent the last week or so paying attention, what has
impressed you most about what they do now?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think that the thing that's impressed me about their
program over time, and this is why I think they play better than their
individual pieces on paper are supposed to -- and this is the year, of course,
that everybody would have said that -- is their ability to pass the ball.
Every single person on their team can pass it, and I think, therefore, they
create such easier opportunities for each other.  
  
There's a lot of times when I'm watching film that you'll say, oh, that
offense or that action created a great opportunity, but the passer couldn't
find them. Passer couldn't get it to them. And UConn teams, year in and year
out, they pass the ball so well that they make their unit better than the sum
total of their parts.  
  
I think this year maybe more than any year, because there's not this go-to
player -- like we're going to run this play and we're going to go get Stewie a
touch here and that's the end of it. It's all these different players making
plays at different times.  
  
I've watched a fair amount of film now, and it's just remarkable the
efficiency, and I think their ability to not talk about just one player, to
have different players be involved in so many different plays. Obviously I've
been watching Katie Lou Samuelson since she was really young. I've got one of
her high school teammates on my team in Ally Rosenblum. There's some obviously
great individual players.  
  
But that isn't what's impressed me the most. They use each other's strengths
to make life easier for somebody else.  
  
Q. In terms of Jordin's development this year, her numbers were already
terrific last year, but her assist percentage jumped over 40 percent, one of a
handful of players in the country that that's the case, and her turnover
percentage went way down, actually the lowest of anybody in the top 20 in
assist percentage. What do you account for that change? How do you go about
doing that? Generally assist percentage leads to more turnovers because you're
trying for more. She's managed to do them both. How has she done it?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think every year that Jordin has been here, I think she's
really changed in her habits, her work ethic, as well as in her mental
approach to the game.  
  
I think she was such a dynamic scorer coming out of high school that it was
really hard for her to step back and think of the game globally first. Like my
job isn't first to score. I mean, every time in high school when things got
hard, you put the team on your back and you went and got buckets, and that was
it. Even she talked about this recently, just she thought defense was
everybody else's job. And I think the combination of her falling in love with
defense, I know that sounds like a weird answer to your question, but I think
it's given us easy opportunities and numbers breaks where those assist-to-
turnover decisions are really a much easier situation for her.  
  
But I've really seen just a student of the game. Her and I watch individual
film together every week, and watching her see the game sort of just from a
deeper standpoint, and now she'll come to me in practice and go, what about
this. It happened on the plane yesterday. She's like, I think if we put Kari
in this action at this point, this will cause some troubles on the switch or
whatever else. It's really fun to watch her really think the game.  
  
I think when you make other people better and your turnovers go down, it's
because you're anticipating more than you're reacting, and she's starting to
see, oh, this is going to happen. When I do this, it's going to cause this,
this and this. And I think she reacted to plays maybe in her first two years,
and this year she's anticipating plays.  
  
Q. Have you seen anybody as athletic as UConn's Gabby Williams up
front?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I'd say Monique Billings is right up there, so I think
that's going to be a really interesting match-up. I obviously really respect
Gabby Williams and her athleticism. More than her athleticism, though, it's
her consistency and determination to try to be involved in every play.  
  
But I really like Monique Billings' athleticism, too. I really think that's
going to be a really fun match-up to watch out there because they both have
the ability to affect every play on both ends of the floor.  
  
And to the end that which person can make those plays consistently, that'll be
an interesting one. But obvious respect for Gabby, but I also have a lot of
respect for Monique Billings, as well.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if you saw, Becky Hammond was reportedly offered the
Florida job. You know, a job used to be a very difficult position to be in.
There's a chance to have a raise and to continue to grow the women's game,
which I think is something that is so significant in your life, as well. But
obviously the chance to be a trailblazer, also, in the NBA. What are your
thoughts on it, and what would your take be?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, you know, I think my take would be you've got to really know
your own heart and what your own sort of calling is to make a difference, and
I think that's different for different people.  
  
For me, my heart is really with college-aged young women, and I think it's a
unique age. So for me it wouldn't really be a question. But I also really --
I've been inspired by watching her journey in the NBA, and I know how many
other people are, and she's really good friends with Jenny Huth on my staff.
They grew up together in Colorado. I just really respect what she's been
willing to do not only for women and opportunities, but think about all the
little girls that have watched that and gone, maybe that could be me.  
  
So as a fellow coach, you know, I think she's just got to know what the
deepest calling is in her heart, in her life. And I think you can make a
difference in our game and make a difference in people's lives in lots of
different ways, and I'll be really excited to see what she chooses because we
know whatever she chooses, she will do a lot of good.  
  
Q. Just making the trip out here again, is it a little more comforting
that your kids have been to Bridgeport, gone through the East Coast routine
and they can be comfortable going into tomorrow's game?  
CORI CLOSE: It's always interesting for us. We had three kids have final exams
as I mentioned earlier. We're finished, I think, as of this afternoon. We've
got a couple papers that need to be turned in, but last year we were done just
the way the calendar fell, so that added a little bit. But it was fun just
listening to our players as we flew in, as drove in, there is a sense of
familiarity, and I think it's a difference. Last year was the first time we'd
been to a Sweet 16, and I think since 1999 -- my numbers might not be exactly
right -- but I think this year we expect to be here. We expect to compete at
the highest levels. We expect to play our best when our best is needed.  
  
I just think there's sort of a different level of just confidence. Our culture
has grown a little bit. That's just a building -- it's sort of one of those
building-block things. There's just a mental expectation.  
  
But I think there is a familiarity. I think there's a little bit of comfort
there, but I think most of that is just a maturation process, and our
expectancy to be at the highest level this time of year.  
  
Q. You guys went out to Baylor and played, you guys went out to South
Carolina and played, pretty hostile environments. Can you talk about what you
learned from those games and how you intend to put that to good use tomorrow
in what's probably going to be a hostile environment?  
KARI KORVER: I think in both those games, we had really good starts. I think
we had really good first halves. Against Baylor, I know we had the lead going
into halftime. I can't remember for sure about South Carolina, and then we
just didn't play for four quarters. And that's something we've been trying to
learn the whole year is we need to play basketball for four quarters if we're
going to go and beat great teams like that in their place, so we've been
learning that throughout the year.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Korver, our consistency in that has grown
tremendously, and I think something else that we need to focus on and got
better at is our defensive rebounding. We lost the battle of the boards from
both teams, and we have to rebound in order to win this game. I mean, Collier
and Williams, they're great at rebounding, so we have to make sure that we're
boxing them out and we're staying consistent in that as well.  
  
Q. Jordin, after last year, numbers were already very solid. Your assist
numbers have risen this year, but your turnover have gone down. I'm wondering
how you account for those two things and what you think has led to your
assists and turnovers being so much more efficient this year?  
JORDIN CANADA: I think for me what I really focused on this past year is
slowing the game down for myself. I think the first two years I was just
playing fast and not really playing efficient enough. And I think this year I
really tried to focus on that and put my teammates in positions to succeed,
coming off screens, reading the defense. I think that's something that helped
me, and then once I got to learn that and practiced that more and more, the
game kind of slowed down for me, so I was able to make great decisions.  
  
Q. For both of you, you've probably seen a few UConn games on TV, but
having watched film the last couple days, what's most impressed you about them
seeing them on film?  
KARI KORVER: I think their offense, the way that they move the ball and they
all are involved, and it's not a ton of dribbling. It's just they find the
most open person and get them the ball and they score or their transition, as
well, is really impressive.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: I think their defense, how they're able to just shut down
teams, no matter who they're playing. It could be a top-10 team, it could just
be another team. It doesn't matter. The way they play defense is team
basketball. Like I just love the way that they play defense.  
  
Q. Turning that question on its head, for those of us who haven't been
able to see you play out on the West Coast, what are the aspects of the UCLA
game that you think will be on full display or will need to be on full display
in order to be successful?  
JORDIN CANADA: I think transition offense is where we thrive the most. We get
out and we push and we run, and we're able to do that when we get defensive
stops. I think that's one of our best attributes of our game is transition
offense.  
  
KARI KORVER: I think to add to that, on defense we've gotten a ton better.
When we started the year, we let teams score in the 80s so then we had to
score like in the 80s or 90s to win. And now I think we can really hold teams
to a lot lower point value, so I think our defense.  
  
Q. To be in the building where the Sweet 16 disappointment happened last
year, is that significant for both of you, and have you allowed yourself to
think about that in terms of how you want to hopefully look for a different
ending this time around?  
JORDIN CANADA: I mean, obviously it's kind of hard coming back to the same gym
that you lost, but at the same time, you're not thinking about that. That was
last year; this is a different year. You're focusing on what you can do to get
better as a team, and the way we've been playing these past couple weeks
actually has prepared us for this moment. So I mean, we're not really worried.
I haven't even been thinking about last year's game. That's a game that
happened in the past, so we're moving forward.  
  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, I would agree with Jordin. I think walking into the locker
room initially was kind of weird because we were in that locker last year, and
Coach is crying, and you're losing your seniors and all of that. But we're
focused on the game tomorrow; we're not focused on last year.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys play in one of the toughest conferences in the
country; how well does that prepare you for a team like UConn? And also you've
played in front of hostile crowds in that conference, as well, and tomorrow
afternoon will probably be another hostile crowd I would think.  
KARI KORVER: That's a great -- I love the Pac-12. Every night you have to come
and you have to play a great game in order to win. There's no nights off. I
think there's times where we lost on the road this year and we were
disappointed in the Pac-12, but now look at -- like Oregon is in the Sweet 16
and we have five teams in the Sweet 16, I think. So those losses, they don't
feel as bad. We still would have liked to win, we still think we could have
won, but we're in a great conference, so we're prepared.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I agree with Kari. I think that something we have learned
playing in that conference is fighting for 40 minutes and being consistent and
learning how to just play hard, everyone, whoever is in the game for however
long. We need to focus on that and being consistent, and this conference has
definitely prepared us for that. Every night you're going to get a good game.
It doesn't matter. It's highly doubtful that you're going to get a game where
you blow out teams by 20 or 15-plus, like you're going to get a good game
every night.  
  
So it's just being consistent and making sure we're fighting for 40 minutes.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
BRIDGEPORT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+BRIDGEPORT)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Gabby Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33291)

### [Kia Nurse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30895)

  
_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think at this time of the year, there really isn't a lot of
statements you can make other than we're anxious to play. I think that's what
-- everybody is probably feeling the same thing. We're just anxious to play.  
  
We talked about this weekend is a tough weekend, and everybody talks about the
Final Four and how great it is to get to the Final Four and play in the Final
Four and play for a National Championship. But this weekend is a tough weekend
because it took a long time, took 12 months to get back to this spot, and
could be over tomorrow at 4:00.  
  
I think everybody is just anxious to play.  
  
Q. For all the history that these two programs have in college
basketball, them on the men's side and you on the women's, you haven't played
them very much. But talk about what Cori has done there the last couple years
and the history of the programs.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think this might be the third time -- the fourth time
that we would have played, I believe. We played at UCLA in the 1998-'99
season. It was our third game of the year at Pauley Pavilion. And we played
UCLA at our place, and then we played them at Mohegan two years ago. So this
will be the fourth time.  
  
They had a rough stretch there from the time, '98-'99 to a couple years ago.
They had some good teams, but not to the level that Cori has been able to get
them to now.  
  
I always thought it could be pretty unique. I've always said whenever you're
at a school that has a great tradition in men's basketball, it just sets
itself up to be really, really good in women's basketball, if you want it to
be, if you get the right coaches and the school is behind it 100 percent,
which seems to be the case. And Cori has done a great job recruiting, which,
it is UCLA; I don't think they're worried about shovelling anything in March.  
  
We're planning to play them again next year at their place, and hopefully we
can keep it going.  
  
Q. What's Lou's identity these days? She came in as the three-point
shooter, but she's had five assists in four of the last seven games. She's had
five rebounds in like six games recently. What's her identity now?  
GENO AURIEMMA: How many rebounds? Five? All of them on purpose? (Laughter).  
  
You know, whenever you get a kid that can really make shots, you can't win
making shots, obviously. Bruno and I talk about this all the time. It is
called basketball. You've still got to put the ball in the basket. So whenever
you get kids that can make shots, you've got something that's pretty special,
obviously.  
  
Speaking from experience, having gone through this with my son, kids who can
make a lot of shots early on in their careers, they're a handful to coach.
Because if you're not careful, the world revolves around the next jump shot,
and when Lou got here, that's kind of what the perception was. That was her
reputation. She makes a lot of shots from a lot of different places.  
  
And whenever we get a kid like that, Kaleena was the same way, Diana was the
same way, must be something in the water out there, you have to really impress
upon them that there's so many other factors to basketball other than making
shots, and once they discover all those things, they really -- they just take
off because they start to see the beauty of the game in other areas other than
just shooting it.  
  
We're nowhere near where we need to be with Lou in terms of the other stuff
other than making shots. But she's way far removed from where she was when she
got here in terms of wanting to be a better rebounder, wanting to be a better
defender. She had seven steals one night. I mean, she would go months without
getting seven steals. So she's trying to do things that add value to your team
other than just shooting the ball, and obviously the tournament certainly
reflects that.  
  
Q. You've probably seen this week, you became a viral sensation on the
comments that you made last year at the Final Four about kids being me, me,
me, and body language and stuff like that. And first part, are you happy -- it
kicked off -- a lot of parents, I know, talking to their kids about that. Are
you happy that that's engendered that kind of conversation? And the second
part is LaVar Ball from UCLA's kids, he's become a lot of me, me, me himself,
and I'm wondering can you compartmentalize him like Earl Woods and someone
like that, or are you afraid that some parents will take the nod from him and
start speaking like he will?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, I think I was responding to a question last year,
and it had a lot to do with our philosophy of recruiting and what we're
looking for and what we try to do. I know some people may have interpreted it
as I'm complaining about today's kids. I'm not complaining about today's kids
at all. What I was describing is something that's been going on for as long as
they've played sports. I'm just -- I was just commenting on this is what I
look for. This is what's important to us, and this is what I see, and it's
been like that since I started coaching 40 years ago.  
  
The difference today is the advent of the social media gives more people more
access to information, and it allows them to promote themselves a little bit
more than in the past.  
  
Kids inherently want to be good teammates. I really believe that with all my
heart. Most kids when they're on a team, I guarantee you, you go watch any
seven-year-olds or eight-year-olds, they want to be good teammates. You watch
them play. When they get a little bit older and they start having a little
more success and then the parents get involved, they become not so great
teammates because they're told a lot of times that you're not going to get
anywhere unless you shine.  
  
So now back in the day, we had AAU tournaments. You had to win X number of
games to qualify for the National Championship, and you played on your team,
and you had to live in your state or whatever, your area, to play. And you
played, and if you lost, you went home, and it was devastating, and that's
Rebecca and Jamelle Elliot and Jen Rizzotti and Nykesha Sales, Megan
Patterson, as far back as them.  
  
Well, that's changed. Now when kids go to these tournaments, they're not going
there to win games. They're going there so that the coach can see them exhibit
their skills, so this idea of winning for the weekend doesn't exist anymore.
So it's not their fault. That's just the way it is. You know, I try, when we
go recruiting, to identify those kids who still have a tremendous interest in
being great teammates. We're not always successful. Believe me, I've had my
share of guys that were really hard to coach for that reason, and you can
trace it back generally to the parents, without question. You can trace it
back to the parents.  
  
And to your second question, I don't know Mr. Ball. I don't know him at all. I
enjoy watching his son play. And I would say that is he an exception to the
rule? Yeah, because how many fathers have a kid that good? So he can do what
he's doing and get away with it, which is fine. I mean, he's just being him,
and the son is just being him.  
  
I root for the kid because I think he's a hell of a player, and I wouldn't
want to be in his situation. I mean, I would next year when he signs, I'd want
to be in his situation, but I wouldn't want to be that guy that every time he
meets somebody the first thing they talk about is his father. I wouldn't want
to be that guy, but that's just me.  
  
But I don't think you're going to see a lot of what you're seeing right now.
You know, you mentioned Tiger's dad. I don't remember Tiger's dad being that
out front like it is today because all these things didn't exist back then; so
you can do it now, so people take advantage of it. But you'd better have a kid
that can back it up when you start talking like that, and he probably does. He
probably does.  
  
Q. Napheesa has talked a lot about this season about the confidence she
has played with that's allowed her to make the jump from freshman to sophomore
year, but if you look at her numbers, it's just consistent day after day, game
after game. Can you talk about that consistency from practice to game for
someone so young? And second part would be if there's one thing that has made
her a finalist for three major awards as National Player of the Year, what
would you say it is?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think you hit it right on the head: She's the same
every day. So what you're seeing in every game is what she does every day in
practice. Nothing ever changes. She's a lot like Maya Moore in that respect.
From the day Maya Moore walked into practice the very first day until she
graduated, she was the same every day. There were no bad days. There were no
bad attitude days, there were no bad effort days. I mean, there are a lot of
bad defensive days Napheesa has, don't get me wrong. She's still a work in
progress in that area.  
  
But there's very few kids that come in right away and give you the kind of
consistent effort that you're getting from Pheesa every day, from day one.
Last year she just didn't have the confidence maybe or didn't pick up things
as quickly as she's doing it now, and we had a couple guys that said, Pheesa,
if you don't get it, you're not going to play much, and that's okay because
we're going to win anyway. And now this year she's worked a little bit harder
to get things. She's a better player. She did more things over the summer to
get herself ready. And if you think about it, there may not be another player
in the country that can do as many things on the offensive end as Pheesa can,
and I don't care who they are going to talk about. She's not going to get
national Player of the Year; I get that.  
  
But I'll tell you what, if I could only take one player in America on the
offensive end, out of any other player that's playing college basketball
today, and you'd say, check every box, what can't she do, I would take Pheesa
over anybody in the country on the offensive end, and she does it every game.
And she'll probably suck tomorrow. (Laughter).  
  
Q. This may not be central to your preparation, but I'm wondering if you
could take me through how you decide who sits where on the bench, where
coaches are sitting, how that decision is made for you, and if that's evolved
through the years.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, through the years, it's always been -- since we've had
this many full-time assistants, since we've had three full-time assistants,
before that it was I'm on the end of the bench and Chris was sitting next to
me. Now I'm two down because Shea and Marisa sit there, and CD sits to my
right, and that's always been the case since we've had three full-timers.  
  
Where the players sit, I have no control over that. I just show up, and the
very first game I look down the bench, and I go, okay, that's where these guys
decided to sit. I don't move them around.  
  
Now, the young guys think if they sit closer to me, they're going to get in
earlier. What they don't understand is when they sit closer to me, they get an
earful, and sometimes by the end of their career they've moved down the bench.  
  
During timeouts, we have a certain seating order. I want there to be that
consistency, so we put an X on one of the chairs, and that's where our guard
will sit, and then we've got two on each side. But other than that, we're
probably like everybody else.  
  
Q. The trio of Jordin Canada, Monique Billings, and Kari Korver, as you
prepare for them, what do you see from those girls?  
GENO AURIEMMA: We were just watching some of them this morning, and they are
really a unique bunch when you think about it because we -- I mean, I didn't
get to see the Korver kid play much in high school at all. I don't know why, I
just didn't. But I saw a lot of Jordin Canada and Monique Billings. I saw a
lot of them, and I really, really loved them as high school players. And
naturally we don't get to see them that much being out here, but their
development coincides exactly with UCLA's growth.  
  
And it's pretty cool because they've got -- one kid can really shoot it,
another one is great with the ball, and another one just goes and gets every
rebound and is athletic as all get-out. So they've got a really good kind of
-- pieces of the puzzle all kind of fit for them, and Cori does a really good
job of giving them the kind of freedom that kids like that need to just play a
little bit. She's not -- at least it doesn't appear to be, like one of these
over- controlling coaches that's got the kids like that. The kids are kind of
free to play and just be Cali, just kind of do their thing. I kind of like
that.  
  
But I'm just glad we're not in our bracket and not in their bracket, because
I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be in their bracket. They remind me of
our '91 team. I watched them play the other day. There was about 10 minutes
left -- eight minutes left in the game, and I remember saying, I think they're
going to win. I couldn't believe it. And everybody in the place was going
nuts. I thought, oh, my God, this is like 1991, replaying itself. And Trish,
that potty-mouth coach of theirs, if I ever said some of the stuff that she
said, I'd get crucified. I told her that, too. Catholic school girl like
herself? She should be ashamed of herself.  
  
Q. Kia, this is for you because you've been shooting lights out. It's no
secret that your family is super competitive between your brother in the NHL,
you've got a sister playing hockey, your dad, your mom also playing college
sports. Is that part of the reason why you're so good in the postseason,
because of the competitiveness that you get from your family?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, competitive edge is definitely something that my family has
naturally, and it's something that you have to have when you grow up in a
house like that. And I think fortunately enough to have seen all of them
succeed in their sports, and to have seen them do the best they can in their
postseasons, I think you get that experience even though you're not there,
kind of live vicariously through them. And they are people who are continually
supportive, the people who are going to push you to be your best, and just
trying to continue to fill the footsteps that they've left before me.  
  
Q. A lot of players in various sports get pestered by family and friends
for gear, for shoes, for things like that. It's a little bit different
situation for both of you because you both have so many family members who
have played. I'm just wondering, is that an experience that each of you have,
and more specifically, whether it's from family or friends?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, my sister, my best friend from home, and then my
niece's god-mom are all coming up, and I left a huge stack of clothes for them
on my bed for when they arrive. They don't have the -- it's always nice to
give back to everyone else. We do get a lot of stuff, and we're very lucky, so
I love to give my stuff away.  
  
KIA NURSE: Yeah, I would say she's dead on, and it's always fun to have your
family members decked out in UConn gear. Just walking around and seeing them
and seeing the support that we have, not only from our amazing fans, but to be
a part of that. Even if you walk around campus, everybody is in UConn gear,
and I had a friend come up from Canada, and she said that's something that's
so different. At the University campus, everybody is so into your school and
your team spirit.  
  
We do have a lot of stuff. It's fun to have your family decked out in it, so
if they ask, sometimes it's easy to just, here's a T-shirt.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about UCLA? I'm sure you've watched some film
on them, but what's impressed you about what they've done so far this
season?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think the thing that has impressed me the most is their
transition offense, the way they're able to attack off a rebound, off of a
defensive stop I think is a lot better than a lot of teams that we've faced so
far. So we're just going to have to find a way to keep them -- slow them down
basically and keep them off the offensive boards.  
  
KIA NURSE: Obviously they have a great floor general in Jordin Canada, and
what she does, her ability to push the ball in transition, find open
teammates, and keep them running, they kind of go as she goes. So I think
obviously that's a tough match-up on the outside, especially with the shooting
of Korver, as well. And then you have an inside match-up with Billings that's
difficult. So to have those dimensions in a team, that's a big reason why
you're in the Sweet 16 and you've been as successful as you are this season
for UCLA.  
  
Q. Kia, obviously this team the last few years had a ton of people
contributing, but the idea was that Stewie was the clear No. 1 scorer at the
end of the day, someone who got the ball the most. It doesn't seem like there
is that person on this team. It could be any one of four, five, six people.
The change there, do you think it matters? Do you think that someone needs to
be identified? The other night it was you, it's Katie Lou at different times.
What do you think that impact has on this team, and does it matter?  
KIA NURSE: I mean, I think every team has a different identity, and the team
this year is much different than the team that we had last year. I think for
us personally, the ability to have five or six different people who can be the
leading scorer one night or be the leading rebounder, to have an impact on the
game every single time they go in there, it becomes much more difficult for
teams to play against. To have that match-up nightmare that you have as
apparently a center in Gabby, to have that, to have that dimension to our team
is extremely important, and we're very fortunate to have it.  
  
Q. Gabby, just the extent to which you've been able to dominate on the
defensive end, do you view that as your stock in trade, or do you see offense
as a really significant part of what you're trying to bring on a night-to-
night basis, as well?  
GABBY WILLIAMS: I think this team has a lot of offensive threats, so I kind of
took it upon myself, and Kia does it, too, where we try to set the tempo
defensively. I think my defense is a lot better than my offense, so I try to
take pride in that, and yeah, I would say I try to make defense a big part of
my identity.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 76, Notre Dame 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Erica McCall, Karlie Samuelson, Brittany
McPhee, and Alanna Smith. We'll begin with an opening statement from the head
coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I am so excited that this team battled in the second half and
came back. We're so excited to go to Dallas.  
  
First, I wanted to congratulate Notre Dame. They're an excellent team.
Obviously, it was a really tough, tough game, a really well-fought game.  
  
I thought our second half -- at halftime, we tried to make some little
adjustments, give some people ideas. But really the leadership of our seniors,
Bird (McCall) talking, "Stay with it!" I kind of used the analogy a little
bit, we're in Kentucky, and this is horse-racing country. What Kentucky Derby
winner starts out and goes pole to pole?  
  
It took us a while to get going, but then when we got going, we were charging
down that stretch and came across that finish line. Great plays by Karlie
knocking down shots. Huge second half defensively and offensively by Brit.
Bird rebounding, staying in there and battling. I thought we made some really
tough shots. When we needed our defense to step up, we stepped up really well.  
  
These four women, plus I thought Marta (Sniezek) did a really nice job and
stayed with things. They're an excellent team and we have to play really well,
and we did. So we're going to Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. There was a moment in the third quarter where you seemed to be almost
begging Marta to push the ball up the court, to push, push, push. There was
still 16, 17 minutes left at that point. How much did it feel like a race
against time at that point?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think just pushing on them, being aggressive was what we
wanted to do. Push them back on their heels. They were up coming into the
second half. I was just trying to get the pace going, and she did a really
good job.  
  
Q. Brit, the change in defense on you with Ogunbowale, I know you went
against her pretty much the entire game, but what did you do differently in
the second half to shut her down?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: I think I'm not used to guarding someone who can take it in
transition like that. At the beginning, she was getting easy buckets coming
down because I was late and looking at other shooters. I think finding her and
sticking with her the whole time was helpful.  
  
Q. Bird, can you describe what was going on in the last 2.3 seconds and
how you got the block on Arike?  
ERICA McCALL: A lot of prayers. I was talking to God the whole time. "Please
don't let her make this shot!" She came out and I was like, oh, my goodness,
she's about to get the shot up. She took a dribble, and I'm like I'm going for
it, whether I got the foul or not. I got a nice clean block off of it. We got
the win. Whew, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Her getting the ball in that situation? It looked like she's their
big gun, obviously.  
ERICA McCALL: Oh, yeah, we knew she was going to get it. We prepared for it.
Brit covered out, and we just had to help her out on the shot. So we got that
blocked shot and got the win.  
  
Q. What did Tara say during that timeout? There were two timeouts. One
was a 30-second. Do you remember specifically what the instructions were?  
ERICA McCALL: Each of us had a specific assignment on each person, like no
threes, no fouls, don't let the ball go in. Me, it was just make sure my
player doesn't get the ball. Just really chased out and just it really showed
itself out.  
  
Q. Brittany, I guess considering how the team shot in the second
quarter, did it kind of surprise you, or maybe do you think that was why Notre
Dame kind of let off on you and maybe some of the other shooters in the third
quarter when you all got it going?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yeah, it was a little bit different. We thought they were
just going to come out in the triangle-and-2 again. The biggest thing about
the second quarter is Karlie wasn't out there. She really draws a lot of
attention. When she was back in, I had a little more space to attack.  
  
Q. We expected what we saw from the three ladies next to you, but you
were a very key ingredient, Alanna, at the end. Can you talk about your game
in the second half?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I was just trying to play my part, play my role on the
court. And whether that's playing good defense and helping up or staying on a
shootout or posting up big and taking an open shot, then that's what I'll do.
I'll play my role.  
  
I think that pass from Marta was very smart. I had a huge height advantage
inside, and I was able to get it. I think that was a really good play for us.  
  
Q. For Karlie and Erica, how does it feel to be going back to the Final
Four? First time since 2014. What are your thoughts and emotions? What are you
going to tell your teammates about it?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Going our freshman year was pretty amazing. I thought about
that since then. I thought about it my sophomore year, junior year. We wanted
to get it this year for sure.  
  
I mean, after the game, I started crying, just the emotions. It's an amazing
feeling to be back, and we're ready to play.  
  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I've been trying to get back to the Final Four ever since
my freshman year. One thing I really wanted to make the seniors we went with
proud, Chiney (Ogwumike) and Mikaela (Ruef), and show them that the people you
played with, trained us and brought us up. Hopefully, we're making them proud.
It's a really exciting moment. I'm exciting I get to share with my teammates.
It's just amazing.  
  
Q. Karlie, your dad has put in a whole lot of frequent flyer miles. I
guess he was saying earlier -- I don't think he's even really seen the inside
of the hotel room. Obviously, with that finish, that rewarded him coming back.
What were you kind of thinking there at halftime when you all were down?  
I guess, how does it really feel to give him that kind of reward for him
coming in here and sticking with it?  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I went to hug him after a little bit of celebration. He said
I made him cry too. I'm just so thankful that he's coming out here and my mom
is supporting me at home with the dogs and Bonnie.  
  
Yeah, he hasn't slept. He went from my game to Lou's game to our game back to
Lou's game. I'm just really thankful to have so much support from my family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Are you folks all done with finals now?  
ERICA McCALL: Yes.  
  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Yes.  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yes.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yes.  
  
Q. When was the last final?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: Thursday night.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Spring break.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, they can
be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, elaborate on what turned the game around in the third
quarter.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I just think that in the locker room -- you know,
we've been down before. Our team just said, "We've been down more. We've come
back. Just keep fighting, keep battling. Believe in yourself."  
  
We had that great third quarter. We got right back in it. And one of the
things our whole team -- like the whole bench was so excited -- screaming,
cheering, running out on the floor to bring everybody in -- played with
tremendous energy.  
  
In the beginning, I don't think we played the defense that we needed to or
wanted to, but I thought we played much better defense in the third quarter. I
think that that really contributed too. And people knocked down some shots.
They just said, heck, we don't want to go home. I think more than anything
this is a group of people that really love playing with each other.  
  
It's a long season, and you can always try to find a time to take a play off
and people really stayed focused the whole game as much as they could.  
  
Q. Tara, what was the strategy in the final 2.3 seconds? Obviously, you
got a big block. Did anybody take her off the flare? What was her strategy?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think, first of all, Kate Paye scouted the team. She did a
great job. She knew what they were running. We went over it with the team. We
wanted a big presence on the ball so they couldn't lob in. We knew they were
going to lob. We thought it was going to go to 24. We had a big presence on
the ball. We were switching off screens, getting out and contesting each shot.  
  
I think, as people really -- they just focused as much as you could and
understood it just came down to this one play. If you want it, you've got to
make this one play.  
  
So we had used -- we had no more fouls to give. We had another time-out in
case they scored. So if they had scored, we were taking a time-out and
advancing it. Obviously, they didn't. So we didn't have to go there.  
  
Q. Now, Ogunbowale only had four points in the second half.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. Was it strictly McPhee, or what was going on?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She worked really hard on her. She told me in the locker
room, she goes, "I want to guard her in the second half." Because I just --
I'm like, well, do we need to change up on her? No, I understand what she's
doing. Brit had a big game on both sides of the floor -- I mean, both ends of
the floor, playing great defense, and also knocking down her shots.  
  
I think that in the beginning sometimes it takes us a while to figure out what
combinations look good. Marta made some big plays, made some great passes.
Karlie shot, Brit shot, Alanna hit a shot, and we were off to the races.  
  
Q. In the first half when things wasn't going well, Notre Dame was in a
zone.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, Triangle-and-two. They were Diamond-and-one on Karlie,
when Karlie came out, they were zone mostly. When Karlie and Brit started
going, they put two people on them. Notre Dame is a fantastic offensive team,
but we knew we had to work really hard at defense. I was not pleased with our
defense. I was kind of on people about it.  
  
The first shot of the game, I'm like, "Bri, where are you? You're a defender."
I didn't want Karlie getting another foul either. So I just said, "Second
half, you got to let it go and be real aggressive." I thought we got more
aggressive.  
  
Alanna had a big steal, and we got that three in transition that Brit hit.
When we got to six -- I think when you're down sometimes a lot and then you're
only down like six, it looks like nothing. Then you're up, and you're like
whoa. We just had tremendous energy in that second half.  
  
I think also playing against the teams we played, playing in Washington -- at
halftime too, I told our team, Ogunbowale had 21. Well, she's on track. She
only had 42, not 44 like Kelsey Plum did. So keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Coach, I mean, with all the comebacks this team has made, obviously,
this one means the most. What about this did you kind of see in their resolve
that maybe was different from some of the other ones? Maybe just one you had
two days ago.  
TARA VANDERVEER: We've been on the road for 11 days. We had mixed success
here. We kept keeping things really positive and talking to each other. We
joke about omens, that we wore black last time we played Notre Dame. This was
the hotel that Washington was in. Just little things to kind of -- there's
another good omen.  
  
And just I think the fact, again, that this team, no one cares who gets the
credit. They just want to win. And everyone's excited for everyone else. And
they're a very close team. I think that sometimes, when you get a one-point
win, it's just that one rebound. It's just that one free throw. It's just that
one stop when you need it. They just were able to, I think, stay very focused
and really want it for each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: All right. Thank you very much.

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 76, Notre Dame 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Arike Ogunbowale and Lindsay Allen.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: We lost it in the third quarter. I don't know what happened. We
just couldn't score, and we couldn't defend. I think the more they got on a
run, the tighter we got on offense. That was a killer.  
  
I thought (Brittany) McPhee was fabulous. She was the difference in the game.
We were worried about (Erica) McCall and (Karlie) Samuelson, and McPhee did
it.  
  
Q. That last play and/or any options you had on the last play from out
of bounds.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think the last play we were just trying to go up and get a
good shot. Just see our options. We had Arike coming off the screen and we
also had Marina (Mabrey) coming off that flare in the corner. We figured we'd
get a pretty good shot, and we did. It just didn't go down.  
  
Q. Arike, you were named Most Outstanding Player. Talk about your play
and looking forward to next year.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, awards don't really mean anything when you don't
reach the goal that you planned at the beginning of the season. But we have a
good team next year. I'm just going to look forward to that.  
  
Q. Arike, how did you see the last shot? And then part two, what did you
think happened in the third quarter?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Like she said, we had a good look, and it just didn't go
down. The third quarter, I think they just -- they were hitting shots and
going on a run. We weren't responding at times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Lindsay, obviously, not how you wanted it to end. Could you just give
kind of a summarizing talk about your experience at Notre Dame, your four
years here.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I mean, these four years here have been something beyond my
imagination. I could never imagine coming here to Notre Dame and playing for
Coach McGraw. I just wanted this so bad for my teammates. It's so sad to end
at this moment.  
  
These four years have been the best years of my life. I've had some of the
greatest teammates ever. It's just been a really great experience to play here
at this elite level and play for Coach McGraw.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any final questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, after 56 percent in the first half, I think it was only 33 in
the second. How much of that was just fatigue?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we just got outplayed. I think we just felt some
pressure. We weren't as loose as we were on Friday. Our shot selection was
really questionable.  
  
Q. Coach, could you describe the play that was set up in the final
seconds. Obviously, McCall might have been anticipating. I'm not sure.  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was a screen for Arike. She was wide open, and she probably
could have shot it. That's hindsight.  
  
We got her open. She got the ball, and she made her decision. I thought it was
a good one.  
  
Q. If you could, talk about the defensive rotations that left their
shooters open on the perimeter, particularly there in the second half.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We played a lot of different defenses, but we had trouble
seeing when they ran through the baseline. I don't know if it was
communication or just not being aware. I thought we left them open pretty
consistently in the third quarter, and that obviously was the difference in
the game.  
  
Q. Coach, with Stanford's height, how much did that magnify Brianna's
absence?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think that's where we lost the game. I think we lost it
on the three-point line. We talked about, do we need to go big? But I mean, I
thought we did a really good job on McCall. She didn't have her normal game.  
  
I thought Smith made some shots late that we really -- we could have guarded
better. But really, I thought it was McPhee was the problem. So it was more
than the wings and the zone and the guards.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Bri Roberson, Karlie Samuelson, Kaylee
Johnson, Brittany McPhee, and Erica McCall.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Let's start with Karlie. This is a 9:00 a.m. game West Coast time. Is
that any kind of a factor for you folks, or do you feel like you could play at
3:00 in the morning?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I don't think time is a factor. We were in Kansas for a
while, and we came straight to Kentucky. I think we're acclimated to the time.  
  
Q. Let's go down the list. Bri, playing against Lindsay Allen again, can
you talk a little bit about what the challenge there is. You've played against
pretty top point guards this season, but what about her specifically?  
BRIANA ROBERSON: She's a very composed guard, a great guard. She has a lot of
tools in her arsenal. I'm very confident in our game plan and preparation for
her as far as guarding her and guarding every guard on their team.  
  
Q. Brit, I don't know who's going to be playing against Arike
Ogunbowale, but she looks like a scoring machine at this point, and she's
really strong, and she's only 5'8 ", but they throw lob passes to her. What
are you seeing from her? And what's the challenge of facing a kid like that?  
BRITTANY McPHEE: She's just always looking to score, so just being at ease,
guard her right when she gets the ball and knowing her favorite moves and
tendencies is going to be key. Obviously, she's going to get some points, but
trying to contain her to a reasonable amount.  
  
Q. Erica, you had, obviously, a huge game against Notre Dame last year.
They claim revenge is not a key motive for them because everybody wants to get
to the Final Four so bad, but revenge not a motive? Do you buy that?  
ERICA McCALL: They said so. Like I said, everyone wants to get to the Final
Four. We just compete well together, so I think they're just looking forward
to this exciting game the same as we are. So it should be fun.  
  
Q. I might as well, since I've got the microphone, I might as well ask
Kaylee. You had a huge game against Notre Dame too last year, probably the
best game you ever played, I would imagine. Do you guys feel you're playing
with house money at this point because you're playing against a top-seeded
team that has been gearing up for the Final Four all along? Do you feel like
you're loose as the underdog?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Like Bird (Erica McCall) said, we're just really excited for a
great game. We know we have to compete. We know they're going to come out and
be competitive. I mean, we definitely have like this sense of urgency they
instilled in us at this point. We're ready to go. We're excited. Just got to
know our next game is our biggest game.  
  
Q. For Erica, does it seem repetitive or -- I mean, to be playing kind
of the same team, I guess now for three straight Marches. Is it kind of
repetitive, or is it one of those things you kind of want to see maybe the
same team you faced to really show how far you all have come, and especially
since they're top seeded, how good you all can be?  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I think it's good to play the team you're comfortable
with, that you know some type of -- like I know the scouting report on them. I
think the NCAA committee just really likes this matchup, and they want to see
it time and time again. It means it must be pretty iconic.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you know, of course, they lost (Briana) Turner. Were you
surprised at anything you saw that they did Friday that may have been
different from what you expected?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No, honestly, I really was focused on Texas. I watched --
obviously, last night I watched Notre Dame. They have a very challenging team,
and it's hard when someone goes down, but it was the next person up. I thought
Erin Boley played really well. (Kristina) Nelson played well. They've got some
great players.  
  
I don't think I was surprised. They're a very talented team, and they knew
they had to play well, and they did.  
  
Q. When this bracket was coming together, did you kind of see the
potential for this kind of matchup looming? Maybe in your mind, especially
given the history, kind of prepare yourself -- well, you know, we could see
them again.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know you can see them again when you're in the bracket. I
guess you could say that about anyone in the tournament just because you never
know what's going to happen. I think this year especially there have been more
upsets, closer games with higher and lower seeds. So I don't think anything
was predictable per se. Obviously, when you have an injury with a key player,
anything could happen in the Purdue game. I don't think we were guaranteed
coming out of Kansas, and, obviously, Texas is a great matchup. So we really
focus on the one game that we're playing, and today we're focused on Notre
Dame.  
  
Q. Being from the Pac-12 the last couple years in the postseason, what
we're seeing now with Oregon against Maryland, what role did your program play
in setting a standard that other programs had to raise themselves to meet?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think Stanford made a commitment to women's
basketball back when I was hired by Andy Geiger, and we were able to recruit
nationally. Now I think with -- I think it's Pac-12 Network, we've had great
teams and great players in the Pac-12 for 30 years. A lot of times, people
haven't seen them or heard about them. And without maybe Pac-12 Network or
without even sometimes the opportunities to see these teams, an Oregon team
might not have even been in the tournament in the past.  
  
Obviously, they're doing really well, and it's something that I'm really proud
to be a part of the league that is a premier league with great players. I
think that this tournament swing last year, this year will only make it kind
of harder, my job harder in a good way -- more competitive top to bottom.  
  
But the Pac-12 has always been extremely competitive with great players, and
people sometimes haven't known about them. And a lot of those teams have not
gotten maybe a first round home game or gotten a decent seed so they can even
move on. But having five teams in the Sweet 16, I think, has been awesome.  
  
Is Oregon winning right now? Great. That's great.  
  
Q. Tara, is the loss of Turner sort of the equivalent of what it would
be for you to lose McCall?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You never want to lose anybody. I think their team has --
they have a lot of offensive weapons. She did some things that are really
special, but I think that they're able to -- you know, they're able to kind of
put the puzzle together differently with different (players) -- they have
really outstanding, outstanding offensive players.  
  
I think Erica, for us, we can -- I mean, we've had games where she has
struggled or maybe hasn't played that well. She, for us, is -- she's so
important for us emotionally. So in some ways, I think it would be probably a
bigger loss for us.  
  
Q. The players didn't seem to have much worry about a 9:00 a.m. Pacific
game. Do you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No, not at all. Part of it is because we've been on this time
zone. It was a little -- I think it was a little difficult in the bracket to
be in the real, real late game and then real early morning game. But I think
we learned a lot from last time around in that we're working really hard to
get right back, get hydrated, do some recovery, and get a good night's sleep,
and we've emphasized that with our team.  
  
Q. Coach, Notre Dame, we saw last night, they can hit four, five, six,
seven threes in a row. Have you played a team this year with that kind of
prowess from outside the arc? How do you feel you defended them? Does Notre
Dame remind you of somebody you played this year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Actually, Washington is a team that can really hit threes.
There are a lot of teams in our conference. Oregon is a very good three-point
shooting team, UCLA. A lot of teams that are doing really well in the
tournament.  
  
We know that that's something that we'll have to contend with, but they really
-- both teams were shooting 50 percent last night at halftime, and I'm not
sure for the whole game. But I just thought, wow -- I told our team when I
went into the locker room, I said the baskets are working.  
  
So it should make for a very, very exciting game.  
  
Q. Tara, Muffet McGraw was saying the reason they don't play you in the
regular season is that they generally try to use their trips for recruiting
purposes, in part, and they haven't been recruiting in California a lot. Would
you like to play them in the regular season?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It would be fine, yeah. I think that football has a good
home-and-home series with them. I think we probably -- you know, we had never
played Notre Dame in the NCAA until two years ago. In all my 30 years, I can
never ever remember playing Notre Dame. But I think next year we'll be
probably in a different bracket.  
  
But it would be great to play Notre Dame. They have a great program. We did
play them home and away just in a regular, like just home and away, I think in
like 1993 -- with Molly Goodenbour, Molly's year, so '92, '93, something like
that.  
  
Q. So for next year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm just thinking variety maybe. I don't know. Do they just
like use the same -- I don't know. You know, maybe, just thinking maybe.  
  
Q. I just wanted to finish up with a question about Arike Ogunbowale
because it was sort of a revelation to those of us who really haven't seen a
lot of her.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah.  
  
Q. This kid is 5'8 ", and they're throwing lob passes to her, and she's
doing everything all over the court. First of all, who's going to guard her?
And what's the challenge of stopping her?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I just said, first of all, she's versatile. She's strong.
She's got great hands. She gives you inside and outside dimension. I mean, if
you have a small person on her, she'll post them up. If you have a big one,
she'll pull them away.  
  
I think we'll just have to try the spaghetti approach and throw it up on the
wall and see if it sticks.  
  
Q. Along that line, when a team has that much balanced scoring as Notre
Dame did, how much tougher does that make preparing for or adjusting for them?
It's one thing to focus maybe on someone like Turner, but without her, they
spread the ball around, how much tougher is that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, we do analytics, and their offense is in the 98th,
99th percentile in catch-and-shoot and finishing at the basket. I mean, their
offense is phenomenal. So I think we have a good offense too, but we're going
to have to come out and play well offensively, and we're going to have to play
well defensively.  
  
I think the job that Bri and Marta did last night with McCarty was a
phenomenal job. She ended up with eight points, but I know at least two or
four of them may have been way at the end of the game, no threes.  
  
Our team is a blue-collar team. Maybe Notre Dame isn't, but we have to be a
blue-collar team, and we're going to have to bring our hard hats and boots and
come to work because it's not going to -- it's not going to be just playing
like a pickup game out there. We're going to have to really be aggressive and
play hard.  
  
Q. From an appeal standpoint, when you have two powerhouse programs like
this meeting each other, how much do you feel like -- even if it is year after
year after year, how much do you feel like that could really kind of raise the
profile of a sport in general?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think last year -- last year when we played, it was a great
game. The year before, I don't think we were as competitive as we needed to be
with them.  
  
They have a great, outstanding players, and have been, I think, one of the top
teams year in and year out. That's a real credit to Muffet. She is an
excellent teacher and an excellent basketball coach. And they have very
talented players.  
  
I think it's a real credit to her that she played so well yesterday without
maybe their leading scorer, and other people stepped up for them. I think it's
great for women's basketball to have marquee teams playing each other. We want
to play well, and our team is very excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: All right. Thank you all. We'll see you tomorrow.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined at the podium by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Lindsay Allen, Erin Boley, Arike Ogunbowale, Marina Mabrey,
and Kathryn Westbeld.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. For Arike, when you look back on last night's game, are you still
kind of amazed by some of the shots you got, and by how they fell?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think it was a great game in total. I think our whole team
played really well together without Brianna (Turner), and I'm just really
excited to play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know coaches don't like to talk about revenge, but I
wonder about the players. You know, especially since you had such a
disappointing upset against Stanford last year. Obviously, the big motivation
is to get to the Final Four, but how much is revenge, sheer revenge a factor
in this game?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I don't see it as revenge, I don't think, because, I mean, we
beat them two years ago, and they beat us last year. I guess this game could
technically be a tiebreaker type of game. So I think the real motivation is to
get to the Final Four and continue to play.  
  
Q. Any of the young ladies, what do you recall about last year's game
against Stanford that still sticks with you?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I think something that really sticks out to me is the
feeling in the locker room afterwards. Our seniors were heartbroken. I think
for me that just kind of stuck. It's something I don't want any of our seniors
to have to go through, especially Sunday. So I think that's the motivation
that's sticking with me.  
  
Q. I know each year is different, but, Lindsay, when you face a team as
often as Stanford, how differently do you kind of prepare for them this time?
Is it just because of the stakes, or do you just kind of rely on past
experience against them?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think it's mostly just looking at their team and their makeup
and then looking at their offense and what they run. Most teams run the same
kind of sets year to year, just different players in different spots. So I
think just noticing who's hot at the time, who they have, who they normally go
to in crunch situations, and then just kind of figuring out from there.  
  
Q. Marina, this is almost like a home game for you in the sense that you
have way more fans than Stanford has. You had a large contingent the other
night. How much of a factor is that for you folks? Do you hear the crowd? Is
that something you feed off of? What kind of a factor is that for you?  
MARINA MABREY: We have the best fans in the country. So we always like to see
them in the stands cheering for us. It definitely helps us with momentum when
we score a couple baskets and they're loud and encouraging.  
  
Q. Anyone else?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I agree with her.  
  
Q. How much time with your coach would you expect with one day to
prepare, is it just a matter of refining what you put in for last night?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it is. Obviously I think it's tough to go over
everything that Stanford does in one day. I think with this team it's just
kind of refining things, looking at mismatches we have and making sure we're
exploiting those and just remembering those and having that muscle memory to
continue through this game.  
  
Q. Lindsay, when a team has a game like last night where six players
were in double figures and you're able to spread it out, especially under the
adverse circumstances, what does that kind of say about the team? Or what did
that kind of reveal about this team that you didn't know before?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think just overall it was a really fun game to be a part of.
When we're sharing the ball and we're being unselfish, we're happy for
everyone's success, and everyone's getting hype and everyone's laughing and
smiling and things like that, it's just a fun game to be a part of. It's just
been fun over the past season to just being able to enjoy it, especially this
past game.  
  
We're playing with a ton of confidence, a ton of swagger, and just trying to
continue that into the next game.  
  
Q. Question for Erin: You coming back last night and having a home
crowd, kind of the same homecoming theme, how much of a release was it for you
to have that kind of game and kind of get that whole thing behind you and just
look at it as just another game?  
ERIN BOLEY: I don't know if I would say it was a relief, but like Lindsay
said, it was a fun game to be a part of. Now I'm just focused on the game for
Sunday. I think it's the same kind of mindset going in tomorrow as we had
yesterday.  
  
Q. Lindsay, for those of us who haven't seen a lot of your games this
year, how interesting is it to have a 5'8 " player that you're throwing lobs
to down low, somebody who's so strong as Arike? It seems to me that she's an
extremely unusual player. What is it like from your vantage point to watch her
in action?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Watching Arike play is just like -- I mean, it's always a fun
experience. Sometimes I just get caught watching her when I should be playing
alongside her.  
  
But she's such a unique player because she's so strong, and just able to kind
of bully people down low, but also she's super quick with the ball, and she's
able to slash and find the driving lane and can also shoot the three.  
  
She's worked on her game so hard and so long this past summer. So you see what
she did this past summer. I think playing with her is a lot of fun because you
get that energy from her, you get that swagger and that confidence from her,
and it's just really infectious and it kind of just spreads throughout the
whole team.  
  
Q. Last night was the most minutes you played in a long time. How's the
ankle today?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: Not too bad. I've got to do a little work, but it feels
pretty good right now.  
  
Q. Arike, with the kind of game you all had last night, now is the kind
of thing where there's no defined go-to player as it might have looked with
Brianna. Now all of you have to be accounted for in some way.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we all just need to step up, which we did, and we
all have amazing players. The freshmen were both national players of the year
and we have a lot of McDonald's All-American players. I think we just work
well as a team, and we all bring individual traits that will help this team be
successful, and it showed last night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
Q. Coach, do you like matching wits with Tara (VanDerveer)?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's a phenomenal coach. Definitely a Hall of Fame coach who
always gets the best out of her teams. She is just incredibly smart, which
makes her teams really smart.  
  
It's not a really fun game to play. I always look at teams that are just well
coached and really smart. They're very, very difficult to beat.  
  
Q. Muffet, what is the specific challenge of playing this Stanford team?
Obviously, this is the post-Ogwumike era for them, but they have a lot of
weapons now, and they play great defense. I was just wondering, from your
standpoint, what do you see in this particular team that may be different from
previous Stanford teams?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think experience and poise. They definitely scored the ball a
lot better than they did last year, but just their game experience, they never
get rattled, never lose their poise. They have a lot of different weapons, a
lot of different people that can hurt you. Everybody plays their role exactly.
Nobody tries to do too much. So they're a really tough matchup for us.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of what your program has done over the last eight,
nine, ten years and the ability to kind of maintain the standard class after
class, could that have happened without the National Championship in 2001?
Even though it was a different era, did you need that building block for this
current era?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think it helped me a little bit, just knowing that
we were capable of getting there. But I really think Skylar (Diggins) did so
much to change the culture of our program when she came in. She just set a new
tone and changed things, changed -- really brought the level up in terms of
practicing. We were able to carry it on after she left. That was probably her
biggest legacy for us.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you try not to look too far down the road, not past the
next game, in fact, but when this bracket was set up and you saw that Stanford
was in it, did the thought cross your mind, oh, no, we've got to go through
them again possibly. Did that kind of prepare you for this moment?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think the first look at the bracket actually came
when the three were revealed and we hadn't been up yet, and my first thought
was Ohio State is going to be in our bracket. Then we started thinking, uh-oh,
we got Texas. We got Stanford. That's a tough four teams we're going to have
to eventually play.  
  
So, you know, I think it was good to look at it that way, but without Bri, it
kind of changes things a little bit for us. But it was an opportunity for us
to look at what we did last year and to see if we could take one more step.  
  
Q. Muffet, the players kind of downplayed the revenge factor, and I was
kind of curious to hear what your point of view is on that. Is it the rubber
game of a three-game set? Or are you itching to pay them back for last year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think whenever you lose a game during the year, you lose a
game, you want to play that team again. When it's the last game of the season,
you don't get a chance to do that again. I think we know what we're up
against, we know how good they are.  
  
I won't say we look forward to it because we know it's going to be a tough
matchup.  
  
Q. Do you recruit many players -- do you and Stanford go after the same
players a lot?  
MUFFET McGRAW: All the time. Yes, we have very similar things we look for in
players, and we constantly recruit against them.  
  
Q. Which brings me to the other question, though: You've only played
twice in the regular season. Why is that? Your football teams play each other
every year. You've got two schools that are high-caliber basketball with big
academic reputations. Why don't you play each other in the regular season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we've talked about playing. The biggest thing, we
don't have any kids from the West Coast generally. When we set our schedule,
we like to go home so players can play in front of their home crowds. We're
not really recruiting a lot in California right now. If that changes, I think
that's a reason to go out there.  
  
We had been playing USC and UCLA. We'd been going out with football. When USC
played, we'd go out and play the night before. So it was kind of a rivalry
game.  
  
But it's something, I think we would look to explore, but you travel so much
being in the ACC, it's not exactly a great footprint for us. So we try not to
travel too much outside of the conference season if we can.  
  
Q. You were talking last night how proud you were of the underclassmen
and how they kind of came together. Maybe you'd seen this kind of coming
along, but for them to step up in a game like that without your top player,
what, in retrospect, did that reveal about these guys?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think I really envisioned the game going like it did,
as well as it did. I knew that Arike would be terrific because that's the kind
of player she was in high school. She's really sacrificed a lot to get the
ball to Bri.  
  
I knew Marina was capable. So I think it was an opportunity for them to
showcase what they could do while still playing team basketball and still
having a lot of assists.  
  
I think it showed we are a team that's hard to guard. We are a team that you
have to respect everyone on the floor, which makes us really hard to guard. I
think it opens up different things for us in the offense that we didn't get.
Obviously, it took away a lot of things that we normally get, but we're
playing a little different right now, and I think it's kind of a free, loose,
fun type of game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? Thank you very much.

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Shayla Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28374)

### [Kelsey Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28375)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Notre Dame 99, Ohio State 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Ohio
State women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Kevin McGuff and
students Kelsey Mitchell and Shayla Cooper. We will begin with an opening
statement by the head coach.  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: We can take questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll go straight to questions. Questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did this Notre Dame show you guys anything you weren't
expecting? Was there anything you guys didn't see in preparation that that
team brought out?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Everything they did today was something our coaches touched
on, and we harped on for a whole week. I just think they outplayed us
defensively and offensively.  
  
Q. Kevin, from a program standpoint, is this a good measuring stick of
really where you want to go still? Because they had an answer for everything,
and they were just a buzz saw at the end.  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Notre Dame played great. They really did. They played an
excellent game. Give them all the credit in the world. Any mistake we made,
they made us pay for. They executed on offense extremely well and clearly shot
the ball also extremely well.  
  
They played a great game. They were certainly the better team today and
deserved to win. As we aspire to continue to grow the program, that's what we
kind of want to look like in a game like this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we can stick to questions for the student-athletes, then
we'll open it up for the head coach.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did this game have the feel of maybe reversing the Maryland
game, where maybe you guys weren't necessarily playing poorly but the other
team was just hitting a lot of consecutive shots?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Yeah, exactly what you said. They kept getting possession
after possession, and after a while, they got themselves in a rhythm, and we
couldn't run them off the three like we needed to, especially in the clutch
time. Like the second quarter was really important and crucial because that's
when they kind of took it away from us.  
  
Q. Shayla, with the way that Notre Dame can move the ball, how difficult
was it to close out, especially on threes and long jumpers and things like
that?  
SHAYLA COOPER: It was not as difficult as it may have seemed. It was just
knowing the scout a little better, knowing where the shooters are, knowing
who's on the floor and who's going to shoot it. I think we could have done a
better job with that.  
  
Q. Shayla, how would you describe and maybe summarize your Ohio State
career with all that you've been through the last couple of years?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I would summarize it as a great experience. I've grown as a
person, as a player.  
  
I just want to thank Coach McGuff for giving me the opportunity to play here
and my teammates for picking me up when I was down and the coaching staff for
making me a better player.  
  
Q. You described this group as a special one since the start of the
season. I know it's still fresh, but when you look back on this group and what
you guys were able to accomplish this season, what were your initial
thoughts?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: We've been through a lot as a team. We've been through
everything. From the ups and downs, the losses, the crazy practices that we
have sometimes, to the arguments among teammates. I think it's made us great
people. I think we can only go up from here. I think this game has taught us a
lot about ourselves and where we need to grow as players and as people in
general. And specifically, as a culture and as a team and as a program, Notre
Dame is a fantastic team. I think they've done a great job with the things
they've accomplished.  
  
I think us playing them tonight can only show us where we need to get better
at. I just want to say thank you to my teammates and this program for
supporting us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Coach, how much was a load was (Arike) Ogunbowale tonight?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Arike played great tonight. She's an outstanding player. What
she did tonight, she scored from the three-point line, she drove the ball, she
posted up. She really showed her versatility, and that really gave us
problems.  
  
Q. Kevin, it seemed like the response was a little bit better to start
out the third quarter. What do you think changed over those next six, seven
minutes that kind of put the game out of reach?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, we had a great start to the third quarter. I really liked
what we were doing on both ends of the floor. We started defending better
during that stretch, but then we quit rebounding, and I think ultimately
they've got some easy put-backs and kind of got the momentum back in their
favor. I think that's what really kind of put them on that path to pull away.  
  
Q. Kelsey said this was sort of a gauge also of where the program is. I
guess it's dangerous to take one game as a barometer, but what can get better?
How do you get to that level?  
KEVIN McGUFF: We have to continue to evolve. We've grown as a team and as a
program, but we're not there yet. I think, culturally, we've taken some great
steps, but we're still not where we want to be. Hopefully, this game will give
us some experience that we need, and we can carry that forward to next season.  
  
I told the team afterwards that, when I was an assistant coach at Notre Dame,
we lost in the Sweet 16, then we lost in the Sweet 16, and then we won a
National Championship.  
  
So a lot of this is you've got to stick to it. You've got to keep fighting.
You've got to keep grinding. Year round, you've got to make sure you
continuing to get better. You've got to evolve culturally, and that stuff
takes time. I think we've grown leaps and bounds, but we're not there yet.
Hopefully, this is another experience that will help us continue to grow to
get to where we ultimately want to be.  
  
Q. Do you have a comment on Erin Boley and how much of a load she was to
handle tonight?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, she shot the ball really, really well. For someone her
size, she's kind of a unique player that way. Her three-point shooting was
really hard for us to handle. Our post players kind of tried to chase her
around on the perimeter, and it was a problem for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you return a lot next year. Obviously, lose Shayla, but kind
of going off what you just said, how encouraging is it to know that you return
nine players who played significant minutes? And then could you just touch on
what Shayla meant to the program and to you.  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Shayla, it's been really fun to see her grow. She's grown
off and on the court. I'm excited for her because she's got a great future
ahead. She's done a great job academically. She's a really bright kid. She'll
play basketball for a long time, and after that, she'll put herself in
position to have a great career, whatever it is she chooses to do. It's been
really fun to see her grow. That's the biggest thing.  
  
We have a great opportunity. We return a lot of great players and a lot of
good kids. Hopefully, as we continue to get experience in games like this,
that can be really valuable for us. It's a big off-season for us. It's hard in
women's basketball to really jump into that elite group at the top. Notre Dame
and Connecticut and Baylor, they've been doing it for a long time. They're not
going to go anywhere. You have to really, really fight and scratch and claw,
and we've got to have a phenomenal off-season.  
  
But I think we have the right kids in the program to do that. So I'm
encouraged about that. We'll get back. We'll get a little bit of rest, and
we'll put a plan together to make sure we have a great spring, summer, and
fall, and we'll be ready to go next year.  
  
Q. Obviously, this is a disappointing game, but how do you compare that
with some of the successes you've had this season?  
KEVIN McGUFF: It's tough. It's really hard because our kids have really
invested so much in this season, and all of a sudden it comes to a screeching
halt when you lose.  
  
It's hard to reflect back right away. We won the Big Ten. We got to the Sweet
16. So we've accomplished quite a bit. It will probably be a little bit easier
in the coming days and weeks to really reflect. Right now it's just so tough
after this loss.  
  
Q. Early on in the game, the three-point game is what kept you guys in
it. Was that something you practiced on or prepared for? Was that part of the
game plan?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I knew they were going to play a lot of zone. So we were
going to have to hit some shots on the perimeter. I don't want to totally rely
on that because I thought with Tori (McCoy) and Alexa (Hart) and Steph
(Mavunga) we'd have a size advantage. So we trying to get some balance in what
we were doing. So we shot the three well early. Now, we missed some shots
early that we normally make, and Notre Dame got off to a really good start,
and I thought that kind of affected us a little bit. But we certainly did
shoot the three well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: Thank you.

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Erin Boley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33293)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Notre Dame 99, Ohio State 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Erin Boley and Arike Ogunbowale. We'll begin with an opening
statement from the head coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm just so proud of this team right now, especially our
freshmen and sophomores. Our young players stepped up in a big game. I thought
Erin played her best game of the season. Arike with a career high in a huge
game without Bri. It was a struggle for us this week trying to overcome that.
Just so proud of the resilience of this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Erin and Arike, you just came out confident and loose. Can you
talk about that?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think -- well, Coach said it's evident we don't have Bri
in the paint. So it spaced out a little bit more. Coach told us to shoot our
shot and be confident in, so that's what we tried to do.  
  
ERIN BOLEY: We came out focused. Everybody was pretty loose and focused. I
thought we did a good job of coming out prepared and ready to play.  
  
Q. Not an oversimplification, but was the lane open because there aren't
two people down there guarding Bri?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah. There's a lot of usually help side with her, but they
have to really honor us because we have four or five plays players on the
court that can shoot the three. So you couldn't sag off too much or we would
get a three. So they had to really step up to their man.  
  
Q. Arike, did you feel any pressure to step up a little bit more on the
offensive end to make up for Brianna's loss?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: No, not pressure. I knew I had to play like I normally do
and work within the offense and just be confident.  
  
Q. Erin, how is it to be back in this state and play in front of family
and friends?  
ERIN BOLEY: It's good to be back in Kentucky. I had a lot of family and
friends that came that don't usually get to see a game. It was good to be back
home.  
  
Q. Will you guys stay and watch this next game? What do you know about
either Stanford or Texas? To either one of you.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we'll probably watch the fourth quarter and go and
get some rest -- or the first quarter.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.  
  
And we'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Again, Coach, not perhaps an oversimplification, but in terms of what
you devised, did you just tell them go?  
MUFFET McGRAW: What we looked at was the ability to post up our guards. So we
wanted to take advantage of that because we had Erin and Kat (Westbeld) at the
free-throw line. They had to guard them, so we could stretch the defense a
little bit more. They had to guard everybody and it opened things up for Arike
and Jackie around the basket. Then they had some mismatches with their post on
the perimeter. So I thought we did a really good job of taking advantage of
those mismatches.  
  
Q. Just elaborate a little bit on how good was Arike tonight.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she was fabulous. I had to chuckle when she said she felt
pressure. That's a word she doesn't know the meaning of. She is absolutely
fearless. She was somebody, I think, who was pretty excited when we talked
about how we're going to play from here on out because she's capable. She
sacrifices a lot for the team willingly, and it was great for her to be able
to open things up and play her game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the play of Westbeld playing with Bri
out.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Kat is the glue to our team. She's somebody we have to have in
the game. 11 rebounds, but she works the high post and the zone offense so
well. She works the pick-and-roll so well. She makes it hard to guard because
you have to guard her on the perimeter as well. Just such a smart player. She
was hurting a little bit, and she really just kept on going.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the significance of the way Erin played
given that she's coming back home and given the increased role she had?  
MUFFET McGRAW: A lot of times I worry when a kid goes home because they're
trying a little too hard to impress their family and friends. It's a big game
for them. I was just so proud of her because she was able to relax, to play
her game, and play the best game of the season in such a big game coming home.
It was just so rewarding to see that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 77, Texas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined by Tara VanDerveer and student-
athletes Erica McCall and Karlie Samuelson. We'll begin with an opening
statement from the head coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're really excited to be playing in the Sunday championship
game. I'm really proud of our team's second half effort. First, I want to
congratulate Texas on a great game and a great season, and just an awesome job
that Karen (Aston) is doing with her team.  
  
We really had to battle, and I'm really proud of the two young women next to
me and everyone in the locker room. Our staff did a great job scouting,
working really hard to get ready for Texas and we are absolutely thrilled to
be playing Notre Dame on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, 23 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists -- not a bad game. Do you
feel that you saved your best games for the big stage?  
ERICA McCALL: I certainly don't try to (laughter). It just happened to be this
game. Me and Tara talked about how well I played last year. I just feel really
comfortable in this gym. My teammates got me the ball, and I'm happy with how
I finished down low.  
  
Q. What was it like facing Joyner Holmes in this game? I mean, they
obviously had Kelsey Lang had 12 rebounds, but what was it like specifically
with Joyner Holmes?  
ERICA McCALL: She's really fast, aggressive. She's really impressive how she's
playing as a freshman. We knew it was going to be a battle, and we knew we had
to get her on the boards and box her out, because she was going to be a beast
on the boards. We knew, if we did that job, it was going to be easier for us
to push the ball in and make shots.  
  
Q. Karlie, Coach Aston was saying that your team's quick start in the
second half really kind of rattled their players. And those two threes you hit
obviously were a big part of that. Did you have any difference in mindset?
What got you going in the second half? Was it just you hit your shots and
simple as that? What was it like for you?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think we talked about coming out with more energy in the
second half. In the second quarter, our energy was a little bit low. Coach
Kate tells me to keep shooting no matter what. But threes get people going.
Brit (McPhee) hit one right after, and that was a good six-point play we had.  
  
Q. Erica, second time so far this tournament you guys have erased a
seven-point deficit at the half. What does that do confidence-wise knowing
that this team is never out of it?  
ERICA McCALL: That just shows our heart. I definitely feel confident going
into the next game knowing that we're just a fighting team. No matter how far
down we get, we're going to come back and fight with every rebound, every
shot.  
  
I was really proud of how we performed. Definitely going to give us a big
boost going into the next game.  
  
Q. For both players, obviously, you beat Notre Dame here last year.
You're going to get another shot at them. They're obviously going to be out
for revenge. How exciting is it or how strange is it for you two to be going
back into the same place against the same opponent in almost identical
circumstances as last year except that this is the finals rather than the
semifinals?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think it's exciting. We're here in Lexington again,
playing Notre Dame. It is the next game this time, so it is a little bit
different. But we're excited. They're a great team. I think it's going to be a
really good game.  
  
ERICA McCALL: I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I think they have really
great players that we can match up well with. It's going to be fun, and I'm
really excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Following up on what you said earlier about their second-half fight,
what things did you talk to them about at halftime? Particularly with that
second quarter, where they went ahead and seemed to have the momentum at that
point.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I don't know that it's anything that I'm telling them at
halftime, to be honest with you. I think you have great senior leaders with
Karlie Samuelson, Bri Roberson and Erica McCall. This is a team that really is
a very close team and they want to keep playing together. They know that there
was 20 minutes they had to play better to keep playing because that's the only
way you keep playing.  
  
Obviously, hitting those two threes at the beginning of the second half helped
a lot because then it erased the lead. But we have been down -- we've been
down 18 and come back, and our team really has confidence in their ability. I
feel like we are a second-half team, and we played a lot better in the second
half, moved the ball better. You know, we were able to get a lot of different
people in and try to keep people fresh, and I think that's going to be real
key for us on Sunday.  
  
Q. Tara, Karen was saying that she thought your team just executed
better, and part of that was just because of better, more experience. Would
you see it that way too?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think that they have -- I think they have some real
experienced players too. I think that our team buys in to what we have said.
These are the things we're looking for, and they don't go rogue. They don't
just go do their own thing.  
  
I think that we really ask our team to focus and execute, and I think this
team is executing really well, but a lot of it is people are willing to do the
dirty work. Somebody like Kaylee (Johnson) is setting great screens, or
someone like Marta (Sniezek) is very unselfish making passes and getting
assists.  
  
Just the leadership on this team, the cohesiveness is why we're in the
position we're in as far as I'm concerned.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk a little bit about the job Briana Roberson did on
Brooke McCarty. It was, I guess, partly Marta Sniezek too.  
TARA VANDERVEER: It was both Marta and Bri. Brooke is a terrific player. She's
a leading scorer. You cannot leave her open for threes. How many did she get?
She got one off, but she did not score a lot of threes on us. People worked
very hard on her.  
  
Other people -- you know, we played against such great players in our
conference, Kelsey Plum, Jordin Canada. I think this gave our team confidence.
Bri hangs her hat on her defense, and she really worked it, and Marta knows we
need her to play defense too, and she really stepped up tonight.  
  
I think Brooke is a tremendous player. So we knew we had to work hard on her.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a stretch late in the fourth quarter where they had
gotten within four, and then you all started a parade to the foul line. I
think you made 7 of 8 at one stretch. How did you tell them to really kind of
attack? What kind of vulnerability did you see with Texas inside where you can
attack them and draw those fouls, even if they don't make the basket?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that that is something that we identified, spreading
out and looking to take people off the dribble a little bit. But they're a
very, very good defensive team. I think that we tried to get out in
transition. I thought we ran some good sets. I thought Bri's three was one of
the biggest baskets of the game, and I think that's when it was a four-point
game. Bri hit that three and put it up to seven. You can double-check that.  
  
But we need people -- Marta had some good looks. We need more contributions
defensively, and I thought we got some from -- obviously, Bird (Erica McCall)
played well, Brit, and Alanna (Smith), and that spurt we got going with other
people. And we rebounded well. We didn't give them second shots.  
  
Q. Just your memories of last year's game with Notre Dame and how big of
a victory that was for your squad.  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, it was a big victory. We were the four seed, and
they were the one seed, and they have a terrific team. I was just feeling,
just coming in here, I think the fact that we played the late game and it was
so emotional -- I think our team felt so high that we had a hard time turning
it around.  
  
We're excited, obviously, that we beat Texas, and we're excited to be playing
on Sunday, but we know the big game is on Sunday, and I know that our team
will be ready.  
  
It's kind of the rubber match. We beat them last year. They beat us the year
before. I'm a bridge player, so here we go. A bad bridge player. A bad one.  
  
Q. Is it kind of crazy it's in the same place? I know it's a different
round, but the same place, same court?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think that -- I don't try to second-guess kind of
where we're playing or what we're playing. I'm excited to be playing on
Sunday. Would we rather be playing them in Stockton? Probably, with our fans
there. But I'm excited to be playing, and we're looking forward to the game.  
  
We want to play better than we did tonight. I know our team is extremely
motivated, as their team will be. We will have to play very well.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford 77, Texas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Texas
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach Karen Aston
and student-athletes Ariel Atkins and Joyner Holmes.  
  
We'll open it up with an opening statement from the head coach.  
  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, just congratulations to Stanford and to Tara
(VanDerveer). I thought that their team showed a lot of resiliency and
toughness in the second half. In turn, I thought ours showed a lot in the
first half.  
  
We got off to a rough start, and then we regrouped and played really well in
the first half. They just executed some things in the third quarter that got
us a little off balance, and we just couldn't answer. We didn't answer at
times. We didn't answer their quickness to the ball, and at times we didn't
answer from an execution standpoint. I thought they executed some things down
the stretch really well. And we just didn't.  
  
Some of it, I think, is just the difference in experience. It reminded me a
little bit of last year when we played UCLA and we had some older players that
had been through some things and really knew how to execute down the stretch
and be tough down the stretch in a Sweet 16 game. It looked almost flipped
this year where we had young players make mistakes they'll learn from, and we
didn't execute as good as we need to. But, again, a lot of credit to Stanford.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, the first few minutes of the third kind of changed things. Can
you say specifically what Coach is talking about, the execution part of what
Stanford did right that you guys didn't do right that you did in the first
half?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Kind of like she said, they had experience. They were using
their angles well on the court. They were running their plays. They are
finding the open man, rebounding.  
  
Q. Ariel, you guys struggled most of the second half with shooting. Was
it more that they played great defense or that you just couldn't get shots to
fall?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think it was our execution. I think we kind of got antsy, and
I think they did a good job of packing the paint on us.  
  
Q. For Joyner, your rebounding has been this team's strength. Had you
seen a team that kind of got in the lane like that, like Stanford?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Honestly, it kind of reminded me of the beginning of the year
against South Carolina. They had some big girls, and they out-rebounded us
down the stretch, and I just felt that was the turning point of the game.  
  
I know we got a couple offensive boards, and it changed the momentum of the
game. I just feel we could have gotten on the offensive boards a little bit
harder.  
  
Q. Both of you are coming back again next year. Can you talk about the
team that you'll have and how you can use this experience to hopefully make a
deeper run next season in the tournament.  
JOYNER HOLMES: I know as we were walking down here Coach was telling Ariel
that most of the things I've done this year and the team has done this year we
wouldn't be able to do without our older players. I just feel this game here
and this feeling here is our motivation for next year. I know we have a lot of
players coming back, and we have a transfer. So I think we'll be pretty good
next year. We've just got to put the work in over the summer.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we have a lot of work to do, but we can't go without
giving credit to our seniors. They came in with Coach Aston and her staff, and
they helped us bring this program back to the national light. I'm really
thankful for them. They really helped us become who we are. I'm definitely
going to take a lot from them going into the next year.  
  
JOYNER HOLMES: I don't think we could have got as far as we got without them.  
  
Q. Ariel, great season no matter what, but three straight Sweet 16s.
What do you think it's going to take to get over that hump?  
ARIEL ATKINS: If I knew the answer, I would tell you, but I'm going to figure
it out this summer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Joyner, you're only a freshman, but what did you learn this year that
you can apply to next year to make the team even better with you being a
sophomore?  
JOYNER HOLMES: I just feel like just listen to my older players and listen to
my coaches. I don't think I've ever played on a team that just has so much --
I think, not just experience-wise, but people that actually motivate you and
talk to you and tell you what you're doing wrong and tell you what you're
doing right. I feel like, just coming back, I've got to work hard in the
offseason. I didn't really participate in the offseason as much as I could
last summer because I was injured.  
  
I just think going into that with a good mindset and just remembering this
feeling, like I said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Brooke had a very uncharacteristic game. What did they do to
stop her on offense?  
KAREN ASTON: I thought that -- I mean, they had some quickness on her that was
able to shadow her. I mean, they did a great job of shadowing her most of the
game. They beat screens. Did a good job helping when she was screened for.  
  
But I also think that that goes back to my statement in the beginning, which
was that I just didn't -- I didn't think we executed things at the level that
you have to in the Sweet 16. There's a lot that goes into that -- I mean,
screening, angles, passing the ball at the right time, setting good screens,
you know, people waiting on them. There's just an execution that has to be at
a really high level.  
  
I thought that we made some adjustments in the first half to open things up on
the inside, and we just -- we got antsy once they made the run, and I thought
we didn't wait on things to happen offensively like we did in the second
quarter and like you need to at this level.  
  
Again, there's always times when you shut people down and someone else has to
answer. We just didn't necessarily have that tonight. I thought we did a great
job with them in some areas. They had other players answer the bell. You have
to have that happen when people focus on players that have been scoring.  
  
Q. In the last game against NC State, you said in the final four or so
minutes, you could just tell in your players' eyes and their communication
they were going to win. Did you see that same urgency at the end of the game
today?  
KAREN ASTON: You know, there's times -- and I felt this in the locker room --
that I have been disappointed in their effort in games. I felt like we didn't
have a sense of urgency that you have to have, and there's only been a couple
of those this whole entire year. But we did have a few that I was quite
disappointed in.  
  
That's not what I would call this game. First of all, I'm really proud of our
seniors. I thought they laid it all out there today and gave their best
effort, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished here at Texas. And I
wouldn't say that our team didn't have urgency. I just think they executed
better than we did. And we made some mistakes on defense that they made us pay
for, and that's execution.  
  
And they were just better than we were in that area. Some of it was youth, and
some of it was we didn't -- we got antsy, and we didn't execute well.  
  
Q. Samuelson took eight threes, and Brooke didn't even take a three
until about 1:30. What were they doing right to set her up in situations where
she could be effective?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, she's a really experienced player, and, again, execution
has a lot of pieces to it. It's the passing. It's the people doing the
passing. It's the ones doing the screening. And it's the one reading screens.  
  
When she got free a couple of times, quite honestly, we just made mistakes. We
made mistakes on defense, and if you look at the first half, we didn't make
very many mistakes, and we just made a couple of mistakes, and they made us
pay for it. I think that's what gave them the confidence and maybe shattered
ours a little bit. It rattled us a little bit.  
  
Q. Going back to Bri and Kelsey, they both have had huge milestones this
season, and they're the first group that you recruited and have kind of come
full circle. Can you talk about what they've meant overall to the program the
last four years.  
KAREN ASTON: I told them in the locker room that we're absolutely supposed to
win games, and that's what we're all here to do at Texas. But when I look at
those two, and when they came to Texas, I mean, we weren't very good, and they
bought into a vision, and they trusted the vision throughout their career. I
mean, they've been to three Sweet 16s in four years.  
  
More importantly, it's really how much they've developed as people. I mean,
when you look at their academic success that they've had, it's pretty amazing.
When you look at what kind of leadership skills they've learned, what kind of
young women they are now as they begin to think about walking across that
stage in the spring. I mean, that's what I'm so proud of as a coach. And,
again, I understand what I'm here for, but I also know that -- I guess maybe
I'm getting old, but when you get a little bit older, you really begin to
appreciate the maturation of a player and what they become as a woman.  
  
I can't say enough about those two and what kind of people they are and what
kind of student-athletes they've been at Texas.  
  
Q. Coach, two questions: One, do you label this a successful season? And
two, with the players you've got coming back, coupled with the two All-
Americans you've got coming as freshmen, do you think the expectations will be
even greater next year?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I don't think they can be any greater because we expected
to go to a Final Four. I mean, that was our goal. And it was a realistic goal.
So I don't know that our expectations will be any different next year. We
expect to be challenging for the Big 12 championship. We expect to be a
contender. We expect to win 20 games. I think that's always a benchmark of
when you asked me if it was a successful season, we won 25 games. Last year we
won over 30, and I think when you get to 30, you're really special. I thought
last year was a really special year. Any time you start winning 30 games, as
Stanford has done this year, you have a really special team.  
  
I definitely think that, when you look at the journey this team had, starting
at Stanford, it was quite a journey. And a lot of people really grew up. A lot
of young players really grew up this year. I'm tremendously excited about the
future, as I have been, not just because of who we have coming in, but just
who we have returning.  
  
You're talking about a lot of young players that got a lot of really valuable
experience against quality opponents that they'll be ready and they'll learn
from it, and they'll be motivated by it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Tara Vanderveer. We'll open it up for questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. With what we've seen over the past month and a half from (Alanna)
Smith, just what got her to that kind of production, averaging 5.5 points a
game for her first year and a half at Stanford and then going to averaging
almost 18 a game?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Her freshman year -- actually, Alanna and I were talking
today about her freshman year being a very big adjustment on a lot of fronts.
First, they were done with school in November. So she had a whole year off in
school. Getting back into academics was a challenge for her. Being homesick,
being away from home, being that far from home -- she actually, she was ill,
so she wasn't 100 percent in the fall. And it was just a big adjustment for
her.  
  
Then I think the beginning of this year, she really developed and really put
in some extra time, and I think gained her confidence in a couple games, had a
couple games where she scored well. I think her dad is a former basketball
player, and her parents have been always really supportive of her.  
  
In talking with her dad, I think we're just on the same page in terms of what
we tell her, and I think that's helpful for her. She's just being more
aggressive.  
  
Q. How much value is that earlier victory over Texas at this point in
the season? Is it just like ancient history at this point? Obviously, Smith
was not what she is now at that point. Their great freshman, Joyner (Holmes),
was not what she is now. How much value is that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think there's value in the fact that you've matched up with
them before. You can look at different matchups and see if you like them or if
you don't like them. Obviously, they've improved a lot. They've had a great
season, and I think we've improved a lot.  
  
I think it's -- I call it kind of a heavyweight fight. We know what to expect,
and they know what to expect. We just have to get it done. But I do think it's
helpful for us to have played them and to know their style and to have played
against a lot of their players obviously.  
  
Q. Currently, Samuelson, she's obviously been a great three-point
shooter for years, but her development this year is pretty interesting. She's
really become a much more well-rounded player. Can you talk a little bit about
her improvement this year.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that it's happened on a lot of fronts. As a senior,
she recognizes what she has to do. She's really stepped up to be a leader,
number one. She's a great leader of our team, scorer, defender, and we really
asked her to do everything.  
  
Her game is anchored by her 3-point shot. You've got to get out on her, and
then she can take her pull-up, or she can take it to the rim, and her passing
has improved a lot. But she's always been an extremely intelligent player, and
now I think, in some ways, the game slowed down for her even a little bit
more.  
  
But she is having a great senior year.  
  
Q. You've obviously played in many big gyms but maybe none bigger than
this one. Do you as a coach do anything to prepare your team for depth
perception and any other things that Rupp Arena makes challenging?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Nope, I don't talk about it. We've played really well here.
We like this gym.  
  
Q. Follow-up question: You obviously have coached before the advent of
the three-point and after. When the three-point first started, did you know
that it would have as dramatic an impact on the game as it has? And do you
think it has had that dramatic of an impact?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I like that question a lot. You know why? When we were
looking at it, the women's basketball committee, whoever was adding that rule,
we actually took our team to China the summer before that rule came in, and we
played in a game where one player made 10 3s. Now, I'm going to say 20 years
ago or even 25 years ago, that seemed outrageous, but now it's not that
outrageous. That just shows you how far -- but for me, I'm like, we're going
to take advantage of that 3-point line.  
  
In my first year back with the 3-point line, there were coaches who did not
allow their teams to take 3s. So it has come a long way. But I will say that,
for us, I think the use of the 3-point line was one of the main reasons why we
won our first National Championship. We embraced the 3-point line. We didn't
have the biggest team, the most physical teams, and we had to be more of a
finesse team, a shooting team. So someone like Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding,
Sonja Henning, those are players that really took advantage of the 3-point
line. I've always liked it.  
  
Now, the other thing, just to let you know this too, the way they encourage
their shooters to be 3-point shooters, they would, at a certain point -- and
I'm not sure what number it was, but your first 3 was a 3, like as a team, and
then when you hit a certain number, you could get four points or five points.
So they would, in their games, in their scrimmage games or whatever, Chinese
games, not FIBA games, they would do things to really encourage three-point
shooting because they felt that was a way they could compete.  
  
Q. This is your second year back here in Rupp. Having played on Monday
night, could you talk about how you all traveled from there to here. How much
of an adjustment time-wise or jet lag-wise do you have to make when you have
that kind of short turnaround?  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, it's great to be back. A lot's happened since
last year. We're really excited to be playing here. Originally, we planned to
go after our game on Monday, to go back to California, kind of regroup, do
laundry, get organized. Kids would have some finals to take, things like that.  
  
We were also the only one in the pod that had a Monday game. Everyone else
played Sunday. So I was a little -- I was already kind of in my mind thinking
maybe that was something we should be doing. And once they said our airplane
had mechanical problems, I'm not really excited about getting on an airplane
with mechanical problems. And once they said it was maybe going to go get in
by 2:00, we might get out by 3:00, I'm like, I think we should just bag that
plan A and go with plan B.  
  
So we went back to the hotel. There were some people that did go back to
Stanford, but the team and myself and most of our staff stayed in Manhattan,
Kansas. They were phenomenal. They did our laundry. They helped us stay in the
hotel and get a bus, and then we were able to get a flight to come out here on
Tuesday. I think that was a really good thing for us. Our team was really
tired. We were able to get a good night sleep Tuesday night. Monday night, we
got a decent night's sleep because you're not traveling. Tuesday night, a very
good night's sleep. And Wednesday night -- I feel we're in really great shape.
We don't feel rushed. Everything's been great.  
  
Q. Just as a follow-up, when you talk about all those circumstances, but
when you kind of look at some of those logistics to begin with, was it ever
kind of on your mind to maybe do that anyway, maybe just come straight looking
at the --  
TARA VANDERVEER: I did think about it. I actually talked to a couple of
players on the team about it, but we kind of went back and forth a little bit.
We had done that before with a team, and it just felt too long. I think the
fact we were planning to go back didn't get weighed on our mind like, oh,
we're going for a long trip. When it became staying the extra days, it worked
out great.  
  
I think it just worked out perfectly. We're in great shape. We're very excited
to be here. I think our team is well rested. Most players are finished with
their finals. That was another thing, figuring out final exams. When we got
that all worked out, I think, when they're done, they'll feel better.  
  
Q. What stands out to you watching the recent tapes of Joyner Holmes
compared to what you saw the first week of the season?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She didn't play much that first game. She's a terrific
freshman. Sometimes, honestly, she's a woman with girls. She is so physically
strong, and her rebounding is off the charts. They really rebound well. She
gets on that glass. She's versatile. I saw her knocking down 3s, handling the
ball. She's just a terrific player. I think Karen and her staff has done a
great job with her and the whole team.  
  
Q. Was Monday's game more indicative of how you thought this team could
play in the postseason?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, it was sure better than Saturday's. You know, we had
been off for a while after the Pac-12. I'm really excited that we had seven
teams in the tournament, all seven teams won, and we had five teams in the
Sweet 16. I think that that just really is validation of how strong our
conference is.  
  
When you're playing teams that really know you and you're playing -- it's a
brutal schedule. The West Coast, you're traveling a lot, and you're just -- I
just think that the teams know you, and the kids know each other. So it's kind
of fun to get out of your league a little bit and play against different
teams.  
  
I don't know that that was any more indication of how we can play. I think
it's good that -- I hope we can bring that momentum here, just continue to
play well. I think it's good for our team to go on the road and maybe not have
the comforts of home. But you have to battle, and you have to stick together.
I think it maybe brought our team closer.  
  
So all those things hopefully will pay off for us when we play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys play Texas every year. One, how did that all get
started? And, two, what do you like about the rivalry?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm not sure exactly how it got started, but we started quite
a few years ago. We haven't played every year, but a lot of it has to do with
the fact that we like to play places where our kids are from, and Texas is a
great recruiting base. We've had players on our team. (Chiney/Nneka) Ogwumike
is from Texas. So we kind of promised players they'll go back to where they're
from.  
  
So playing Texas, and we actually did that with Baylor for Ogwumike.  
  
Texas, they're not in our league, but it's a direct flight from San Jose. You
can get in and out of Austin a lot easier than some of the other Big 12
schools that you have to make a lot of connections to. They're a great
program, and I think those are pretty much the main reasons.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Great. Thank you all very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for Stanford
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by Erica McCall, Briana
Roberson, and Karlie Samuelson.  
  
We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, could you tell us what your thoughts are about playing Texas
again after beating them back in November. What kind of a game are you
expecting from them this time? What are the lessons that you learned from the
last time you played them?  
ERICA McCALL: I'm really excited. Texas is a great team. They've won a lot.
It's been cool to see both of our progress. It's just going to be a big match.
It's going to be very aggressive. It's going to be tough, but I think we can
pull it out.  
  
Things we learned from the last game, I think our defense. I think we've
totally transformed our defense from just playing with the Pac-12. I think
they're going to see a different defensive style that they didn't see the last
game. So I think it's going to be fun. I think that answers your question.  
  
Q. How do you think Texas has changed since the last time you played
them?  
ERICA McCALL: I think that they've really grown into their own offense,
especially the freshman Joyner Holmes. I've been seeing her going crazy in
games. Her rebounding abilities are absolutely crazy. And, of course, Brooke
McCarty, her shot is really good.  
  
I think that's the best way to improve. Like Tara said, they've really grown
into their offense. Everyone seems to know their own role, same with us too.
So I think it's going to be exciting.  
  
Q. Karlie, No. 2 in the country in 3-point field-goal percentage, but
you don't take a lot of 3s. You just make what you take. One, what makes you
effective at that particular shot? And after you answer that, why don't you
take more?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: That's the shot that I practice the most. Every day, I
think, before or after practice, I'm shooting 3soff the pass. So that's just
the shot I practice the most. And I think what you practice the most will be
what you're best at.  
  
In terms of taking more, I think sometimes teams do a good job of finding me,
and there's not really a point of like forcing up shots. I mean, you got to
take what the team gives you. So I think we have a lot of great shooters on my
team, and my teammates find me really well. I think you have to guard
everybody on our team. So it's just take what the defense gives you.  
  
Q. Bri, you're playing in a huge arena here as you did last year. Was
there a problem with depth perception in this place on shooting last year that
you had to adjust to? Does it help having played here before?  
BRIANA ROBERSON: I would say most definitely, coming back and being in a
familiar environment is really good. Yeah, as far as depth perception, I feel
like we all did well last game. But definitely coming back and being familiar
with the arena and knowing kind of how the courts are and everything, I think
that's good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 23, 2017

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our head coach is on his way to the podium. Thank you for
joining us for the press conference for the Ohio State head women's basketball
coach, Kevin McGuff. Again, if you could please check your cell phone and make
sure the ringer is turned off and raise your hand prior to asking any question
and please identify your name and which organization that you represent as
well.  
  
We will open it up with questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, obviously, this is a very different team you're coaching this
year, but what do you take away from last year's Sweet 16? Is there a certain
sense of hunger you feel it created with this team?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think last year we were happy to be there. We had just had a
tough injury with one of our starters, kind of like what happened with Notre
Dame. We showed up. We played really hard. We didn't play particularly well
against a very good Tennessee team.  
  
But I think we're certainly a different team with a different mindset. I like
the way we've been playing. So I think it will be a different situation for
us.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. Brianna Turner injury, does that change your approach at
all, either offensively or defensively?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, I feel really bad for that kid. It's just terrible,
like you hate to see an injury like that at any point in the year, especially
right now. She's such a great player. It seems like to me she'd been playing
her best basketball here late in the year. So it's really tough.  
  
It doesn't change a whole lot. I think Notre Dame obviously will be very well
prepared. They had this week of practice to prepare themselves without her.
They may play a little differently, which may force us to play a little
differently in how we guard them and so forth. But I know they'll be ready,
they'll be prepared, and they'll probably have a real sense of urgency to
prove to everybody that they're still the great team they were before she got
hurt. I know they'll be ready, and we have to make sure we're ready for them
whether she's playing or not.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've been deep all year, but now your production with your
depth seems to be kind of at another level. Could you explain maybe what
you've seen in that.  
KEVIN McGUFF: We've got some kids coming off the bench playing really well.
Obviously, with the injury to Steph(anie Mavunga), Tori (McCoy)'s been playing
really well. We've had more people have an opportunity, and they've stepped up
and been real productive. We're at our best when we spread the ball around and
spread the scoring around. Hopefully, we can do that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about wanting to play your best basketball and this
team to play its best basketball towards the end of the season. Throwing out
the Purdue game, do you feel that's been the case these last couple of
weeks?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I do. We played really well in February, and things
started really coming together for us. Towards March is when you've got to
play our best basketball. We had a really good week of practice so far, and
hopefully that shows up tomorrow night.  
  
Q. With the kind of game that Linnae (Harper) had last week, was that
kind of -- I don't want to say the pinnacle game, but was that the kind of
game that you know she was always capable of?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, Linnae's a great player. She's a very unique player
because for a 5'8", quote, unquote, perimeter player, she rebounds and plays
around the basket as well as anyone I've seen for her size, and she does some
things that most kids her size can't do. We saw it all come together from her
against Kentucky. We needed a game like that from her, and she delivered.  
  
Q. I guess it's one thing when it's against a former team, but maybe my
question was more, had you kind of seen her building up to that kind of
game?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yes, yes. She's had -- you know, she's had games where she's had
double-digit rebound games. She's had games where she's had a lot of assists,
and she kind of put it all together with the points and the assists and the
rebounds in that Kentucky game. She's shown that she could do that, and
certainly that was great to see her put it all together.  
  
Q. Kevin, we've seen a couple of better defensive performances for the
team, especially the last couple of weeks. What do you think in particular it
is about the team that's allowed the defense to get better around tournament
time?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Our preparation has been a little bit better. We've been a
little more focused and sharp in practice and showing up in the games. That
will be one of the big keys tomorrow night. Notre Dame is one of, if not the
best teams in the country in terms of offensive execution. So we'll have to be
really on point defensively if we want to give ourselves a chance to win.  
  
Q. I'd asked you this last week, I guess, about travel and adjustments
and everything if you had gotten to this point. I guess it's one thing when
you're just a couple of hours away, or three hours away, but how has your
routine kind of been affected by being back in the same venue within a week?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think it's great. I think just some familiarity with -- we're
in the same hotel. Heck, I'm in the same room I was last week. So it's been --
we had a good week so far. We got back. We got a little bit of rest. We
started practicing. Got the same bus driver, same bus, came back down. So I
think our kids are comfortable with that.  
  
Among all the other things, there's certainly going to be some nerves and some
jitters, but just hopefully that will at least give us a level of comfort that
we otherwise wouldn't have.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked about the team last year being happy to be there
given the circumstances. Did you notice earlier this year that this team kind
of had higher expectations of itself, and what do you think played into
that?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I mean, we added some really talented players. So I think
our kids from day one have had high expectations for what we could accomplish
this season, and we should. We've got a good team. We've got a lot of talent.
We've got a chance to do something special. It's going to be very difficult
here. There's great teams, starting with Notre Dame, but you get to the Sweet
16, and you've got to play somebody good.  
  
But to your point, we've had high expectations from day one.  
  
Q. And I know we saw her practicing earlier this week. Is Steph still a
game-time decision at this point?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, she's been good so far this week and further along than
she was last week, but I would say that would be a game-time decision.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
Q. I guess in kind of facing a former mentor of yours, any kind of
emotions in that? Or is it just a thing where it's just a basketball game at
this point?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I have great respect for Muffet (McGraw). She's a close
friend and her family. I had a wonderful, wonderful experience working there,
both personally and professionally. It was a real important time in my life
and my career. I couldn't say enough positive things about that experience.  
  
So it's no fun to coach against somebody you're close with, and I root for
them every game except for when they play us. So we're going to go out, and
we're going to compete, and one of us is going to win, and one of us is going
to lose, and we'll both move on.  
  
Like I said, I have great respect for her and her program and wish them
nothing but the best except for tomorrow night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The press conference has concluded. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for Notre
Dame head coach Muffet McGraw. If you can raise your hand to identify
yourself, we'll bring you a microphone. We'll go ahead and open it up for
questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Obviously, with Brianna's injury, that has forced some adjustments. I
guess the immediate question is, what was the initial adjustment like for this
team, mentally as well as strategically?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's most difficult mentally, for sure. I think she's
everybody's kind of favorite player. They like her so much and respect her so
much. So it was a lot more than just about the game. Everyone knows what it's
like to go through an injury and how devastated she was, a player of her
caliber, so important to our team. I think it was just a lot of things going
through everybody's mind when she went down. It was really difficult to try to
kind of get our focus back.  
  
Q. In the days since, how have you kind of tweaked your strategy toward
this game?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have really good guards, and I think we can still run a lot
of the same stuff. We'll just have to score in different ways. We probably
won't throw as many lobs. That's the biggest thing to change. I think
defensively, she's a huge presence for us defensively. So that's going to
force us to make some changes defensively.  
  
But offensively, I think we'll still be able to run a lot of the same stuff.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you expound on your relationship with Kevin and maybe
what you recall from his six years with you at Notre Dame.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, he was a terrific coach, I thought from the first moment
I hired him, I knew he was going to be really good with guard play. He was a
very good teacher of the game, having played the game, understand the game.
X-and-O's-wise, I thought he was very proficient. He was somebody that could
remain fairly calm in situations on the bench where he could not let the
emotions get in the way of what we were trying to do. So I think he always had
that sort of presence on the bench for us.  
  
Q. Specifically, which player on your team takes Brianna's spot in the
lineup? And does the role of that player/position, is it different because of
the nature of the injured player?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, no one can take her place. She's just a very, very
special player. So to lose her, we really need a lot of different people doing
different things. We'll look to our freshmen. We'll look also to Coco Nelson.
And between of three of them, try to figure out how many minutes we can get
out of each one. It will clearly be different than when the guards are in for
Bri than for Coco.  
  
Q. You had alluded to this earlier about your guards and how they can
score. How much does having so much balance throughout your lineup scoring-
wise kind of mitigate that? I mean, as much as you talk about her being a
special player, that you do have depth?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, not quite as much, but I definitely think our guards are
capable of having big nights, any one of them. I think the ones coming off the
bench, I think we look at Jackie Young and Erin Boley, they're big scorers
coming out of high school. You've got Arike and Marina who have already had
big games. Then you've got Lindsay Allen at the point putting everything
together.  
  
I definitely think our guards coming out of high school, they were the focus.
They were the ones that did the scoring. So mentality-wise, it's an easy step
for them to look to score a little bit more.  
  
Q. Speaking of Erin, what has her adjustment been like in this
program?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she's really gotten comfortable. I think it probably
took her until January to really get comfortable. Offensively, I think she
figured it out pretty quickly. She's a really smart player who knows how she
can get her shots. She knew how she could fit into the offense. She's not had
any problems adjusting at the offensive end.  
  
I think the difference was it's a little complicated. There's a lot to learn.
It's difficult for all the freshmen coming in and to see how quickly they can
assimilate the pace of the game into what they're doing.  
  
Defensively, we probably do a few more things she didn't do in high school,
and that's probably been her biggest adjustment. But she's somebody that
really wants to learn and wants to get better and wants to contribute.
Whatever you tell her, she's going to go out and try to do it.  
  
Q. Talk about the fact that this isn't your first rodeo. You've been
through this a few years ago. After all the different places you've coached,
there has to be a time, five or six minutes at least, where you realized what
happened, and then you figure out how to adjust to it. Talk about that
transition that goes on and how experience helps you move on to figuring out
what you're going to do.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have been in this position before, unfortunately, and I
think, as a coach, it's fun. It's a little challenging. You kind of look and
go how can we retool the offense in a couple of days? What new things can we
do? What can we stick with that's working? We just have different people in
different spots. So there's been a lot of meetings, a lot of X and Oing with
the staff trying to look at defensively what's our best plan, offensively
what's our best plan. So it's something that you don't expect to have to do in
March, but it certainly has been the kind of challenge that you loved as a
coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned your staff too. You've got two coaches that have been
head coaches at other places. They've gone through this. Niele Ivey herself
had a similar situation with injuries. So much experience there, and the staff
has really been a source of strength for you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, they're terrific. They're the best staff in the country.
I definitely -- I lean on them all the time. It's great to have that kind of
experience in the room when we're looking around and deciding how we're going
to approach this game and what's going to be the best way for this team to
play.  
  
Q. Coach, this might be the biggest arena that your players have played
in. Maybe they've played here before, I don't know. It's the biggest one I've
ever been in. Is depth perception an issue with you as a coach? And if so, how
do you go about the day before to adjust yourself, acclimate yourself to a
place like this?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We did play here last year, and it is a very big arena. We
played at Louisville, which is a pretty big arena, played in a couple other
places. We were in Oklahoma City one year. I think we played in some big
arenas, but I think it's a little different. I think, when we go out to do our
pregame shooting and our practice shooting, I think the guards will be able to
adjust. It will be a little different with people back there, but I don't
think they'll have any problem adjusting.  
  
Q. When you look at Ohio State, obviously, you talk about Kelsey
Mitchell, but what's the hardest thing about trying to slow them down or stop
them?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, Kelsey is a special player. She really is phenomenal.
She's a lot more fun to watch when you're not sitting on the other bench.
She's just so up tempo, and she can get her shots so many different ways.
She's just dangerous in the open court. I think she's obviously the player
that makes them go, but she's certainly not their only player. I don't think
you can really key on her and leave anybody else, because they have so many
people capable of scoring. They're maybe the team with the most depth in the
NCAA Tournament. They're just a really, really solid team at both the guard
and post positions.  
  
Q. You played here in this tournament last year in Sweet 16. Have you
used that as motivation at all for this team to go back here again and maybe
hoping for different results?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're definitely hoping for different results. You know,
I think losing in the round of 16 last year was really disappointing for us. I
think it definitely motivated us throughout the year. It was something I think
that we didn't talk about a lot during the year, but I think it was in the
back of everyone's mind.  
  
Q. What has this winning streak kind of revealed about your team that
maybe you were missing before or maybe you hadn't seen before?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We don't ever talk about that because we've won a lot of games
over the last couple of years. We really try not to get hung up on how many
we've won in the past. We're always looking forward to the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach? If not, then the press
conference has been concluded. Thank you. We will begin the Notre Dame
student-athlete basketball press conference here in a minute.  
  
Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre Dame women's
basketball team. We're joined by Lindsay Allen and Arike Ogunbowale. We will
open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you all talk about being back in this regional year two. I
asked Muffet if she used it as motivation because of the loss last year, and
she said not really. But she thinks, just without saying, it motivated you
guys. Can you just each talk a little bit about that.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's good to be back here after what happened
last year. Obviously, because of that situation, we're motivated. But also
because of Bri's injury, we have a little more motivation from that. So I
think Coach doesn't really have to say anything to us. I think we're all self-
motivated, and we're all such a close team that we're all kind of on the same
page.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I would have to agree with her. It's motivation in its own
to try to get to a Final Four or Elite Eight or whatever. But also losing here
is just a year away, and it's just really exciting to be back here.  
  
Q. Lindsay first, Arike second: You lose maybe one of your best friends
to the ACL injury. Can you talk about behind, off the court, how you guys
react to that emotionally, mentally, whatever?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's very, very tough to deal with, I think.
Especially just in the moment. I think it was tough emotionally to recover
from because it happened before halftime. So we had the whole halftime period
to kind of dwell on it and kind of sit on it. So that was tough. And then
actually finding out the news, it was hard because we just feel for Bri. We're
not concerned whether she'll be back or not. We're just really concerned with
Bri as a person. So I think that was a tough thing to deal with there.  
  
I think Bri has been so positive about it. I don't know how she does it. I
personally would be devastated. But seeing her and how she dealt with it kind
of makes you feel better. IT makes you realize she's taking it well, so why
can't we take it well? Her energy that she has is so very important to us.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I have to agree with her. Usually people, they get down
about ACLs. Anybody would, but Bri's been the same person, same personality,
still petty, still sarcastic, still making jokes. Her energy lightens our day
and makes us want to win and do well for her because she's one of our best
players. It's really good she's in high spirits, and it keeps our team,
honestly, in high spirits.  
  
Q. How do you think you'll adjust to it? How did you adjust to her loss
on the court? Do you think you'll do better with it now you've had a few days
to absorb it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think Coach gave us a clear plan of attack, and that was good
for us to be able to have that to be able to move on to not having her on the
court. I think it's going to be much more open in the middle. So I think, with
the guards, we are going to be able to drive and kick more, just find our
driving lanes, kick for threes, play with just kind of more open space and
just being able to read. We'll be able to have five people out there that
should threes at times, so I think that will be really huge for us, just
stretch the defense out and be able to play our game.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Ohio State, and what makes them strong?
Also, any indication on who will guard Kelsey in the game tomorrow?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think Ohio State, obviously, has one of the best
players in the country in Kelsey Mitchell. She's incredibly tough to guard.
She can shoot the three. She can drive by you. She finishes really well. She's
super fast, and they really like to run out on transition. Make her miss, make
sure we're slowing her down, and make sure we know where she is at all times.  
  
Q. Ladies, you had a chance this season to go against Kelsey Plum.
You've had a chance to go against Lexie Brown. You went against Asia Durr.
You've gone against Morrisette from Purdue. You've played a lot of teams that
had that one guard, that prolific scoring guard. How important is that
experience this year defensively playing against a player like Kelsey
Mitchell?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think it's just good practice. Those games aren't one and
done. No matter what the result, even though you want to win, it doesn't
matter. Now I think we've had a solid five games against players who have had
that one guard that you have to really focus on. I think it's just great
practice for us going into the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you guys played here last year from what I understand, but
when you play at an arena this big that you don't play in very often, is there
an adjustment that you have to go through as a guard? Especially with the
depth perception. What can you do to get ready for that?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it helps a lot having practiced and then having
shootaround tomorrow before the game, just getting a bunch of shots up as
guards. We're going to focus on that a lot today probably. Just getting
comfortable out there, getting comfortable with the air quality, little things
like that, the depth perception behind the basket. And just being able to kind
of get a feel for the arena and just get adjusted to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then they
can be dismissed. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the Texas women's basketball team.
We're joined by Ariel Atkins, Joyner Holmes and Brooke McCarty.  
  
We'll go ahead and open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, what is the biggest growth you guys have made as a team since
last playing Stanford in the season opener?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think biggest area we've grown in is learning how to prepare
for teams. I think we take it a lot more serious, and I think we take it day
by day.  
  
Q. Brooke, as I mentioned to Coach earlier, you guys already play in a
big gymnasium. I don't know if you've seen this place yet, but this may be the
biggest one you'll ever play in. Do you as a player have to get accustomed to
a gym like this for depth perception? What can you do to get ready for a big
gym like this?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Well, we do have a big gymnasium at home, but like you said,
this one is huge. I think it's just going out there and getting a feel for the
gym and the stands and everything that's going to be in it. I think it's just
in practice getting more comfortable in there.  
  
Q. Joyner, can you talk a little bit about what that first game against
Stanford was like for you personally. It was your first college game, I guess.
You obviously struggled. I was wondering what it was like just going into it,
how did you feel after it, and how do you feel about how things have
progressed since then?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Going into the first game, I was real nervous. It was my first
college game. So I think, like when I got on the floor, I wasn't really
comfortable with myself like I am now. I knew my teammates are going to be
there for me.  
  
I know I didn't have my best showing, but recently as I've been playing and
going along, I think I've gotten more comfortable. My teammates have made me
feel like I'm part of the team and I can do as much as they can. I know they
have my back, so regardless of what I do, they're not going to put me down or
anything like that. Just as the season progressed, they talked to me and my
coaches talked to me, so just making sure I listen to them and follow what
they say.  
  
Q. Ariel, Stanford has the No. 2 3-point shooter in the country, as you
probably know, (Karlie) Samuelson. You've seen great 3-point shooters on other
teams, but what can you do to help prevent her from going off? And will you,
as the biggest guard on the team, are you going to be assigned to her? Or can
you talk about things like that?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think as the game goes on, it will probably be between me, Bri
(Taylor), Lashann (Higgs), between our guards. But like you said, she's the
second best 3-point shooter in the nation, and I think she's going to make
shots. That's what she does. So we just got to play basketball.  
  
Q. Joyner, Coach VanDerveer has boasted a lot about how the Pac-12 has
done so well this year and how the Pac-12 prepared her team for this
tournament. The Big 12, you've seen a lot of good teams in there. How has the
Big 12 prepared you for this kind of competition?  
JOYNER HOLMES: Playing in the Big 12 this year, I mean, going up against girls
bigger than me, taller than me, stronger than me, I think it's just made me a
better player.  
  
I think this year mainly I'm just trying to focus on players' tendencies. I
think playing against a lot of forwards and stuff has been the hardest job for
me this year. Just focusing on their tendencies and stuff, but I think the Big
12 has prepared me a lot just for the upcoming tournament and the upcoming
games that we have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then the
press conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Ohio
State women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by student-athletes
Sierra Calhoun, Shayla Cooper, and Kiara Lewis.  
  
We'll open it up with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shayla, obviously, it was different circumstances last year in the
Sweet 16 with injuries and things like that. What do you feel like this team
took away from that experience? And how do you think you'll use that this
week?  
SHAYLA COOPER: From that experience, we just learned how to fight through it.
Adversity is going to come, but you have to fight through it. I feel like this
team has been through a lot this season, and I feel like we fought through it,
and that's something that carried on from last season.  
  
Q. Sierra, I think you're shooting 56 percent from three in the last 11
games, something pretty remarkably good. What has attributed to that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: I think I've just been focused. My teammates have been finding
me in the right areas, and I've just been ready.  
  
Q. Kiara, your first tournament experience last weekend, what was that
like for you? What kind of emotions and feelings do you take into this week?  
KIARA LEWIS: It was exciting. Just watching when I was in grade school and
high school, I wanted to be in this position. I think it's exciting to be in
the Sweet 16. It's one of the reasons I came to Ohio State.  
  
Q. Shayla, Brianna Turner goes down with injury. How does that affect
you guys in preparation? Do you do something different because she's not
there, or just status quo?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I don't think we do anything different. I think we are going to
approach the game with the same mindset, attacking them. Without having her in
the paint as a shot blocker, I think it will open it up a little bit more.  
  
Q. You guys are playing in a different gym this week, but is there some
benefit to being back in Lexington, having the same bus driver and having the
different hotel, things like that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: Yeah, I think, but I feel we're coming into the game ready.
We've got some confidence in us. We're in the Sweet 16. I feel like we're
really prepared. We've got a great game plan coming in, and I think we should
do well.  
  
Q. Shayla, Coach talks a lot about playing your best basketball toward
the end of the season. Obviously, throwing out the Purdue game, do you think
this team is playing its best basketball going into the deeper rounds of the
tournament?  
SHAYLA COOPER: Yeah, I think we are playing great Ohio State basketball. I
feel like everyone's giving their all on the court. No matter what it is, if
it's offensively or defensively, I feel like everyone is tuned in to what
Coach is saying and we're communicating well. I just feel like it's a great
atmosphere for us.  
  
Q. Kiara, how do you feel this team has done defensively the last couple
of games? I think you've held back-to-back teams to under 35 percent shooting.
What do you think has been different for the defense?  
KIARA LEWIS: I think just knowing the scout, knowing who each player is. And
just playing team defense, knowing that we can't let one person just get off
on us. So I think just being real focused and locked in.  
  
Q. Sierra, this might be the biggest gym you guys will play in all year,
if not ever. As a three-point shooter, do you have to prepare for depth
perception in a place like this? If so, how do you prepare for something like
that?  
SIERRA CALHOUN: I think, as a shooter, you treat every gym the same. This is a
big gym. Nothing changes, yeah.  
  
Q. Shayla, Coach was saying a few minutes ago that last year you guys,
coming into the Sweet 16 you had the mentality of being happy to be there,
given the injury situations. Do you think the expectations were a little bit
different and greater for this team early in the season? What kind of told you
that, that the expectations were better?  
SHAYLA COOPER: I think because of the competition level that we had started in
practice. Coach knew we were a special group of kids, and I just feel like
that, with that, we had a lot of goals in mind, you know, making it to the
Final Four. So this is just one step closer to what we had in mind.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? If not, then the
press conference has been concluded. Thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

## March 23, 2017

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Texas
women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach Karen Aston.  
  
If you would raise your hand, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions for
the head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Tara had mentioned earlier that she watches Joyner Holmes
sometimes, and she's a woman playing against girls. I'm just curious how she's
grown into who she is over the course of the season from that first game
against Stanford.  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I definitely think that Joyner has matured as a basketball
player. I mean, to go back and look at that film in that first game against
Stanford is almost comical, just from the standpoint of how young we were in a
lot of areas and how really disconnected we were, in particular on the
defensive end, mainly because of youth and inexperience.  
  
With Joyner, the special thing about her is not necessarily that she is, I
think, a woman yet -- and I think she would definitely admit that she's not --
but her kind of unique ability to be able to learn from her mistakes pretty
quickly. Sometimes freshmen and even -- I would say even as they become
sophomores, it still takes them quite a long time to adjust to things and get
over failures and move on. She has a pretty good grasp of that. As probably
as, I would say, immature she is off the court a bit, she has gained some
maturity as the season's gone along.  
  
Q. Tara told a funny story about three-point shots. Their team went to
China the year before it was introduced as a shot here, and some girl hit ten
threes on them, and she didn't know what the heck was going on. Do you as a
coach remember when the three-pointer was instituted and what your thoughts
were at the time of what it might do to the game?  
KAREN ASTON: I definitely don't remember what year it was. I do remember some
different things about the game, just because I still played a year or two
even with the six-on-six, when I was young, when I was in high school. To me,
the most significant difference as a player was when we changed the ball, the
size of the ball I thought was really, really significant.  
  
I was not a college coach when we went to the three. So I don't necessarily
remember that significance as much as maybe Tara does, but it has absolutely
changed the game. It is a huge part of, I think, women's basketball and men's
basketball at this point.  
  
Q. Karen, your team is obviously a lot better than it was back when you
played Stanford earlier, especially with Holmes. In what ways do you think
Stanford has also improved since then? Especially with the emergence of Alanna
Smith down the stretch of the season.  
KAREN ASTON: I think that is probably the most significant change in them from
a personnel perspective is Alanna, and we know her well. We recruited her. We
were well aware of Alanna as soon as she showed up on Stanford's campus.  
  
She has definitely grown as a basketball player, and that just speaks to the
evolution of kids. As they get into, I think, that second semester of their
sophomore year, second round of conference play is usually when those lights
start to shine bright if they're really talented players, and she is. So she's
made a big difference in them.  
  
I think the other piece of growth in Stanford's team has been probably on the
defensive end, not necessarily that they're better defensively or different,
but I think that they look like their attention to game plans is really,
really good, and their solidness on defense is -- it jumps out at you for
sure.  
  
Again, when we played them, it was early. It was the first game of the season
for us, so we had not even seen their team at all, other than I think they
played one game before they played us. So not near as much film and a lot of
growth from both teams.  
  
Q. Coach, Samuelson is No. 2 in the country in three-point field-goal
percentage. What makes her effective behind the three? Is it anything
different than you've seen? And who might guard that?  
KAREN ASTON: I think what makes her effective, it's her team. You wouldn't
just -- it's not just her. It's the fact that they have a really good concept
of their offensive flow. I think they screen really well. That's another thing
that jumps out at me is their efficiency on screens and screen angles. They're
really good at it, and they understand their job. When you get to this part of
the season, when you get to the Sweet 16, nothing is easy, and people are
paying attention to detail at a very high level, and they do their job to get
her the shots that she needs.  
  
The other part about Samuelson that's grown in her game -- I wouldn't even
necessarily say just recently, but in her career -- has been her ability to
play off the bounce. I think, when she first started, it was catch and shoot,
and she's added other dimensions to her game, and it's made her more difficult
to guard.  
  
Q. Since that three-game losing streak in late February, you all have
won 5-of-6. What do you feel like you all learned from that losing streak
that's helping you right now?  
KAREN ASTON: I think what we've learned the most is to sort of try to stay in
the moment. Our team won 19 games in a row, pretty much staying in the moment.
I don't know if fatigue set in with our young kids or whether we just got out
of the moment. I don't even know that they've know. We've talked about it, and
it's a pretty honest group of kids. They always manage to tell you how they
feel, even if it's something you don't want to hear.  
  
And we've talked about it at length, and I'm not sure it's even something they
know, but I think it's definitely something they learned from in the sense of
either you have to get over fatigue and you have to fight through it, or you
really just stay in the moment and try to do the best you can do that day or
for that team that you're preparing for.  
  
That stretch we went through at the end of that 19-game win streak was really
tough, and it would have taken a very mature team to go through that stretch
and then go through the two or three games that we fell short on, and we may
have just not been mature enough to handle that. I say that, but all three of
those games we lost were in the last second and could have easily all three
have been won. So shots didn't go our way. That's part of life.  
  
I think the other thing was just to handle adversity because the first one,
the other team made a shot at the buzzer, and that may have bled into the
other losses. You know, you have to have a short memory in this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the head coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you play in a big gym, but Rupp is probably going to be the
biggest one your players will ever play in. Is depth perception something that
you guys talk about? And how do they go about their business of getting
accustomed to a big open space like that?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I think that's what today is about. That's why you come
here and have a chance to practice the day before. Fortunately for us -- I say
fortunately that we're playing at 9:30. I'm not sure about that. But we do get
a shootaround. So we have an opportunity to get two different times in the gym
before we play tomorrow night, and I think that will be helpful for our
players.  
  
But you hit it right on the head, we do play in a big gym. We've played in
some environments that have been different. I mean, that's the thing about
this team, there's not a whole lot we haven't seen, and it may be a little bit
bigger than what we're accustomed to, but we've been in an awful lot of
different environments this year. Schedule allowed us to do that. So it's a
reflection for our kids and for our team. It's pretty significant. I don't
know that there's anything we haven't seen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: The press conference has been concluded.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 94, Baylor - 85, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, congratulations.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you very much. I'm honored and humbled to be here. So
proud of my girls and our team. What a tremendous effort today against a heck
of a basketball team in Baylor University. Kim and her team are absolutely
phenomenal. It took a gut-check, gut-wrenching performance by our kids today,
and we delivered.  
  
I thought our kids were unflappable. I thought they were resilient. They
showed tremendous toughness, a lot of character, and their heart. You have no
idea what's inside their breastplate, but you saw it today displayed
firsthand. They just played with a tremendous amount of poise. Our point guard
was as good as they get today. She put us on her back. She led us. She was
obviously feeling it.  
  
Ran a couple different things for her. Just had to keep going back because
they were having a hard time dealing with it. She wanted the ball.  
  
Thought Tori was back to herself today. I welcomed her to the party about
midway through the third quarter. Told her that.  
  
It sure helps to have that out there on the perimeter, that big two guard that
can get you a bucket, can rise up and jump over people.  
  
For our seniors, they believed in a vision when it wasn't real easy to
believe. I'm really happy for them. I know how hard they've worked. I know the
blood, sweat and tears, the commitment they've put into this.  
  
I couldn't be happier for them. I couldn't be happier for our university,
administration. Tremendous basketball at Mississippi State. We're seventh in
the country in attendance, and our administration supports these young ladies
and gives them every opportunity to be successful. They're reaping the
dividends, because these kids are doing everything that they're supposed to do
right now.  
  
I'm awfully proud of them. Giving God the glory for number 33 today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Morgan, 41 points today, 7 assists. I don't think you had a turnover.
What allowed you to do what you did tonight?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Just confidence. I mean, I came out here early to shoot
because I had issues the last couple games. I was feeling it. Coach let me
make them. It opened shots for my teammates, too. When I was open, I knew I
could knock down the shot. That really helped us from inside-out. It was just
tough to guard us.  
  
Q. Morgan, I didn't see the interview that you and Coach gave to TV.
Looked like a very emotional interview. You said you did it for your dad.
Explain what the thoughts were. Were they going through your head during the
game? Were they there afterwards? What were the thoughts?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I mean, I was just using it as motivation. He's the reason I
am where I am today in basketball. He just did so much for me working out when
I was younger. Everyone doubted me because of my height. Did so much work in
the gym. For me to come out and do that, it's amazing. I just wish he was here
to see it.  
  
Q. Victoria, a big moment in the ballgame you get called for a charge on
one end. How difficult was it to kind of maintain your composure there?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: If you was on the court, you wouldn't say I maintained my
composure.  
  
I just tried to keep it together for my teammates because if the call didn't
go my way, another call would go our way on the other end. I just kept playing
and knew we had to keep playing in order to win the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, I know you've been struggling to hit shots. What did it
feel like to get those first three under your belt? What did it feel like to
get back in the groove and start hitting shots again consistently?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It felt good. But mainly today I was really focused on my
defense, because I knew our defense was going to win the game. Like Coach say,
keep shooting, the shots will fall eventually. I was just mainly worried about
my defense.  
  
Q. Morgan, 24 lead changes. What was it like to be in that sort of
matchup with the stakes as high as they were tonight?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I mean, that's why it's a game of runs. We live for moments
like this, back-to-back lead changes. We just know we got to make a run when
they make a run. Got to get stops in. Once we make our run, we got to get
stops and keep running from there. I feel like we did that. We got a stop, and
we kept executing. After that, we got a lead.  
  
Q. Dominique, you spent a lot of time on the bench in the second half.
When you were inserted into the game at a pretty critical moment, what was
that like? Could you share why you weren't in the game more?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I just knew I had to stay ready. I knew my time was
going to come to play defense. So I just had to keep myself ready. I was just
happy for my teammates. They played really well tonight. Coach needed a little
more offense tonight. I'm completely fine with that. I was ready when my time
was called. I was ready to play defense.  
  
Q. Dom, Bre, Victoria, can you tell us your feelings about watching
Morgan be huge tonight.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I'm just so happy for her. I'm just so proud of her. I
know she does it for her dad. I just feel so proud for her because I know how
hard she worked for this moment. I know people doubt our team, but people
doubt her as a point guard just because how small she is. They're not that
valid in that. I love the way she plays. She was just awesome tonight.  
  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: That was really good. Basically same thing Dom said. We
live and die by Morgan at times. So her and her point guard play, she just
gets us going. We know when Morgan's going, we're all going.  
  
Just to see her come out, six of eight from the three, it was amazing. When
you just see her going, we're like, Give her the ball. We can't stop her, so
just keep giving her the ball.  
  
To see her have a game like this, it's amazing. Like you say, everybody doubts
us and they always doubt her. I just got to say congrats.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Thank you.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Well, I know tonight she got my assists up. I had six.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Career high (laughter).  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I'll take that (laughter).  
  
But I'm just proud of her. She can do this on any given night. You never know
with her. If she's in attack mode, she's going and doing it. I am super proud
of her. She's my point guard. We're together a whole 'nother year. I don't
know about those two down there, but I'm happy to have her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student-athletes go back to the locker
room, and we'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Vic, we talked about the size yesterday a lot. The guards were really
critical in this game. How big were those guards, especially with Victoria and
Morgan, against a team that we kind of hyped up as having a lot more size?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I thought even though Kalani went 11-13, and Nina was 7-11, I
thought the game turned into a guard game toward the end of the half. I love
my guards. I am not trading 'em for anybody.  
  
I thought after watching them against Louisville in person, I thought we could
do some things.  
  
You know, again, at some point I think you've got to learn to stop -- stop
worrying about trying to guard somebody and try to figure out, Okay, let's
just try to score more than they do.  
  
Boy, I thought we were really good offensively. It starts with Morgan. But it
also starts with Tori making a couple shots early, because you can just see
our team relax. When she's taking good shots, she took a couple bad ones in
the first half, but just getting her back to the party. I mean, I did, I told
her in the -- I think it was the second or third quarter, I said, Welcome back
to the party, baby. You're playing good. It just relaxes the whole team when
she plays like that.  
  
Morgan obviously was feeling it. I was running about three different things
for her, just trying to mix it up so they couldn't get comfortable with her.
They had two different people on her. Every time we switched, she switched
somebody on her. We went right back to the first play.  
  
Just tried to really be engaged offensively, hoped that we could get enough
stops down the stretch.  
  
Q. About the size, you talked about the size of the heart of the kids
that you have. How much has Morgan used the death of her father as motivation?
Has that been throughout the three years of her career?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously it was a tragic thing. It was sudden. I still
remember where I was standing when I got the phone call. Her dad was so proud
that she was coming to Mississippi State. I had just been with him at the
Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Game. Like she said, he ate, drank and slept
training her.  
  
You know, yesterday was the three-year anniversary of his passing. I remember
going to the funeral and all that, again, before she ever stepped foot on
campus.  
  
It's tough for her. That's the kind of kid, though, she is. She appreciates
everything that he done for her to get her to this point. You know, Morgan
rooms with Blair. She's at my house probably more than anybody on the team.
She's very, very special to Holly and I.  
  
You know, she's obviously very special to Blair. So it's tough sometimes for
kids. But I thought she bottled it up nicely today and really played to an
audience of one.  
  
Q. You mentioned you told Victoria, Welcome to the party. Do you know
what she was doing wrong or if she was doing anything wrong prior to this
game, or was she just not hitting shots? Was it as simple as that? Was there
something she needed to adjust or anything like that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think, again, nobody knows us better than the people in our
league, number one. She gets everybody's best defender, everybody's best
defensive game plan. But the other piece was, you know, we watched some film
together one morning. We talked about good shot, bad shot, you're running out
of your shot here, stay in your shot.  
  
Sometimes it's just as simple as, you know what, you're making three out of
ten, how about following your shot and go getting some of those misses? What
that creates is a little more focus.  
  
If you tell somebody, Go follow your shot every time you shoot it, now they
tend to stay in their shot and they don't tend to drift, they tend to follow
it. Now they stay with a good foundation. We talked about that a little bit.  
  
She's been shooting it great in practice. Last four, five days, those kids
were chomping at the bit to get back in the starting lineup. I knew yesterday
I was going to do it, get them back in, so...  
  
What a great day to get back in and play like they did.  
  
Q. Vic, you told Victoria, Welcome back to the party. What do you think
got her into the party?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, all I've done is just tried to tell her, Hey, you're
shooting it good. You shot it well today in practice. You're making good
decisions.  
  
I think you've got to fill her head, anybody, you got to keep being positive
with kids. I think that was the biggest thing with her, is just trying to stay
positive with her.  
  
But at the same time, you know, the definition of insanity is to do the same
thing over and over again if it is not working. Just trying to coach her,
teach her, let her know the importance of getting her back.  
  
I told her before we left town, Hey, we won't win this weekend without you. We
won't win without you being an impact player.  
  
But I've told y'all every press conference, I don't worry about Tori. I've
just seen her do it way too many times. She made that shot off the glass, I've
seen her make a hundred of them. It's not that she's calling it, but I've
still seen her make 'em.  
  
So, it doesn't surprise me.  
  
Q. Coach, when Geno Auriemma goes out to recruit, he's able to tell the
players, Come play for us at UConn, you have better than even odds of playing
for a national championship. Till now you haven't had that ability to say
that. Could you describe what goes into taking a program from where you
started to this level this quickly? What does this accomplishment now means
for you and the future at MSU?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I do have a little experience of being with a national
championship team when we won it in 2011 at A&M. I know what it looks like. I
knew what this looked like with this team. I've told them since day one, I
thought they were a Final Four team. I thought they were good enough to win
it.  
  
What it takes to get it to this level this quick is a tremendous commitment
from your administration. We knew what 13-17 looked like that first season. We
didn't panic. We signed those four freshmen, though, before we ever played a
game, because we might not have got them if they'd have seen us play that
first year.  
  
At the same time, those kids, we went and got kids that could impact our
program at that time, then we backed it up with a top-20 recruiting class.
Since then we've had another top-20 recruiting class.  
  
But I tell you, the biggest key for me was Johnnie Harris coming with me. I
couldn't have done it without her. I wasn't coming to Mississippi State
without her. This would never have happened if she said, Vic, I'm not going.
That was the first thing.  
  
I'm smart enough to know I cannot do it by myself. I have to have a great
staff. I have an unbelievable staff. Great role models, great coaches, great
teachers of the game.  
  
What goes into it is a commitment and a love for kids that it's got to be your
every thought every day all day long. I mean, we're in the kid business.
Sometimes you have to make decisions that have nothing to do with basketball,
but if you really care about the kid, and that's first and foremost with us, I
think those are the things you have to do.  
  
My staff deserves so much credit, so much credit, for where we are today, what
we're doing with these young ladies. Again, I think, just like Geno would tell
you, it's the quality of the young ladies that we have, their character, what
they're made of, what's inside their breastplate. That's the piece that is
hard to get to know when you're recruiting. That's the piece that I want my
staff to get to know before we ever make a commitment to a young lady.  
  
We got to make sure they're committed like we are because nobody works harder
in the country than my staff, I promise you.  
  
Q. I wanted to comment both on the number of turnovers against a pretty
good ball-handling team and your ability then to capitalize on those. I
noticed in the first half especially you didn't face much foul trouble at all,
but you were pulling players almost immediately after they were blown for a
foul. Is that part of your normal practice, to keep people conscious of
defending that well, but not doing it without swatting at the ball?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Those two bigs, I try to rotate them in and out. I don't want
them to get back-to-backs. Chinwe was starting earlier. Teaira came off the
bench, she was SEC Six Player of the Year. Teaira has been playing better, so
I've been starting her. I don't need Teaira in foul trouble. Those two good a
little bit of yo-yo, so to speak. The rest of the kids, I don't think I pulled
them as much as those two.  
  
Just trying to keep them in the game, impacting the game, is really big for
us. Teaira obviously had a huge game for us on Friday.  
  
I knew Baylor was probably going to come after her a little bit today. They
went right to her early and often, got a quick one on her. So that's kind of
the game I have to play with those two down there. That's two aircraft
carriers that do a great job for us and have really impacted our team and our
program.  
  
Those two have great chemistry. When one's in, the other's out, they're both
cheering for each other. There's a lot of love between those two.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck next week at the Final Four.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 94, Baylor - 85, OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. Questions for Coach or the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Kalani, particularly for the seniors, how difficult was this?  
KALANI BROWN: It's a disappointment. Just sorry I couldn't get them there.  
  
Q. Kim, the sets where Mississippi State ran, how much had you guys seen
that in film preparation? What was the difficulty in stopping it?  
COACH MULKEY: In stopping William?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the kid hit 41 points. They doubled the number of threes
they even make all year. I've said all year that when you beat us, you're
going to have to hit 10 or more threes or beat us on the offensive boards, and
they did.  
  
Their one kid kicked our rear. We saw all those screens, to answer your
question. Vivians, she did more of it than she usually does, because the
ball's usually in her hands.  
  
But kudos to her. I knew we were in trouble when they were hitting bank shot
threes to start the game when the shot clock was winding down. What do you do?  
  
Q. Kim, what did you think about your team's resilience despite them
hitting shots at the biggest times?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, we had a shot to win the game. Jones I thought took a good
look there at the end of regulation, blocked it, or two or three of them
collapsed on her there.  
  
I'll say it again. As good as they played and as poorly as we played in
handling the basketball, we still had an opportunity to win, and we didn't.  
  
Guys, I played the position of point guard. If you look at Nina Davis' stats
and you look at Kalani's stats, she didn't miss much. The problem was we
couldn't get them the ball enough. That goes back to ball pressure, being able
to run the show out there. 17 turnovers to 4, you shouldn't even be in the
ballgame, not at the Elite 8 level.  
  
We hung around. We hung in there. Ended up being a high-scoring game. But when
you've got that much down the block, you better find them every time and have
the ability to get them the ball.  
  
Then you turn around the defensive end of the floor, you let a point guard
score 41 on you. Don't know how to say it any simpler.  
  
Q. Kalani, like Kim said, the posts were scoring. You only had 13 shots.
Were they denying? Were you not showing your numbers? What was the difference
down low for you not to get more shots?  
KALANI BROWN: I guess they were denying me the ball. That's pretty much it. It
made it hard for me to get open. Made it hard for me to get post touches.  
  
Q. Kim, Wallace didn't have her best game. What do you tell her after a
game like that?  
COACH MULKEY: Nothing. She's crying. She's upset. I just went in the locker
room and apologized to the four seniors that I couldn't as their coach get
them to a Final Four. I thanked them for four wonderful years of Elite 8
basketball. Many players and schools across the country would trade places
with them in a heartbeat.  
  
But at Baylor, we have expectations that are higher than an Elite 8, whether
that's egotistical, fair, it is what it is. We have to keep feeding that
monster we started 17 years ago. You don't really say anything to anybody's
else. You say the Lord's prayer and come to the press conference.  
  
Q. Coach, you turned and smiled to your bench after Morgan hit that bank
three at the end of the first quarter. Was there a sense, as the game went on,
that you could tell when a player gets that hot, that just about everything
she throws up is going to go in?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, you can get a sense of, you know, the kid's playing
unbelievable. She did. Is that her career high? Have they made 10 threes all
year?  
  
We seem to be very poor defensively or bring out the best in people. She was
very good today. She took her team on her shoulders, and consequently they're
there in the Final Four.  
  
Q. Kim, Vivians got off to a hot start as well. Y'all cooled her off. I
don't know if that was all Alexis? You went to zone a little bit. Talk about
what you were able to do against her.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Alexis Prince fought through a lot of picks today, and was
late on a lot of them. That's tough. When you're constantly being hit on
screens, you know, it wears on you.  
  
She took it off the dribble a lot. She hit big shots. She hit big shots. She's
a big-time player.  
  
I don't know that we did anything to her. She hit 26, 24. Those two players
really beat you.  
  
Q. Coach, what legacy has your senior class laid out? What kind of
foundation have they laid for those coming back?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think their record speaks for itself. I think the number
of Big 12 championships that they've won, both regular season and tournament,
four Elite 8s. Looks pretty good on someone's résumé.  
  
Those kids are all graduates, or are getting ready to graduate in May. You
have just four outstanding players, All-Americans, All-Conference. Good
students.  
  
Their legacy is what it is. They've kept us at an elite level. I just hate for
them, because they really are Final Four type of kids. This was a Final Four
type of team. But we just didn't get it done today.  
  
Q. Coach, Kalani had a great game, despite the difficulty of getting the
passes in to her today. Could you compare her potential as a sophomore right
now to Brittney Griner and some of the other bigs you've coached.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think Brittney Griner's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of
player. She plays above the rim. It wouldn't be fair to compare Kalani or any
player to Brittney Griner that is a post player.  
  
I think Kalani, from her freshman year to a sophomore year, is a completely
different presence in the paint for us both offensively and defensively. I
think she worked extremely hard in the summer to be able to play for longer
periods of time.  
  
I think everything that we really do goes through Kalani. Unfortunately we
couldn't get her the ball enough today.  
  
Q. This game was previewed by the media - hopefully we're not the fake
media, but as the media - as being a battle of the bigs, given the height you
have inside, their potential as well. You clearly got the better of that
battle today, but it ended up coming down to the guard play for Mississippi
State. Can you comment on that, please.  
COACH MULKEY: I think you said it best. I don't know what else I can add to
what you said.  
  
I thought, as I said earlier, that we didn't get the ball to the bigs enough.
Credit Mississippi State's defense for creating turnovers. It was ridiculous.
I mean, guys, it was just one turnover after another after another after
another after another. What do you do?  
  
We got to fix it, because we have all those bigs back. We have Cox and
Beatrice and Kalani. They're as good as any bigs in the country. But we have
to fix this turnover problem. We got to fix, I guess you'd say, point guard
play.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to Vic Schaefer after the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Congratulated him and wished him nothing but luck. I can't
remember any more than that. They were so excited. You don't want to take away
from their excitement by talking too much. But just congratulated all of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season. Take care.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, your thoughts.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: It's a great day to be a Bulldog. Really excited about the
opportunity in front of us tomorrow. Again, awfully proud of my team.  
  
Just to rehash with Washington, how good they are, how well-coached they are.
It was a tremendous victory for us.  
  
Proud of our second and fourth quarters. I thought those were big for us. I
thought our conditioning, just our physical presence, really took over.  
  
Looking ahead to Baylor, obviously extremely talented, well-coached basketball
team. I've known Coach Mulkey a long time. Had a little bit of experience
dealing with her teams. This team is no different.  
  
They are big, strong, physical. They were even more impressive -- I told the
kids this morning in film, I don't watch a lot of film, I don't watch a lot of
games during the season, of people outside of our league. But for some reason,
it worked out, I know I saw them more than anyone else outside of our
conference.  
  
Seeing them yesterday in person was really impressive. Again, it's kind of
like the old days. Some of y'all haven't been around long enough to know. In
the old days, you could have one in-person off-campus scouting of opponents.
Today the rules don't allow that. In the old days you could do that one time.  
  
When you scout in person, the thing that the film doesn't show is quickness,
speed, how truly big someone is. Yesterday I got that up close and in person.  
  
We're excited. We've had a good film skull session this morning with our team.
We're excited about the opportunity. Again, I think our league hopefully
prepares us for this moment. I think our kids are excited about the
opportunity in front of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Teaira, when you look at Baylor, if you've had a chance to see much
of them, what stands out to you about their interior players?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, they're all tall. They're a very tall team. Just going
in guarding them, like we have smaller guards, but I think it will be a good
matchup.  
  
Q. Teaira, Coach Schaefer mentioned yesterday trying to bottle up that
performance and get back-to-back big performances out of you. What are you
doing to try to prepare yourself to come out with the same kind of intensity
as yesterday?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It's nothing that I don't do on an everyday basis in practice.
Just put myself in that situation. Just telling myself you have to go out,
have another good game, put two good games back-to-back.  
  
Q. Dom, can you describe the different challenge of facing, like Teaira
just said, a team with as much size as they have in the post, in the
backcourt, how that's going to be different from the last two?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Last game at Washington, they didn't have as big of a
post player as we do in Osahor. She could step away from the basket, hit the
three. DePaul, they could step away from the basket, hit the basket.  
  
Baylor, they're more pound it in, inside. We prepared for this all year. We
played South Carolina twice already. I feel like they're very similar to South
Carolina. I think we're prepared. We'll have a good game plan.  
  
Q. Victoria, how long can you celebrate yesterday, and how quickly do
you have to get ready for a team like Baylor?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I feel like we celebrated all night last night. This
morning, we focused on Baylor now. We started with film. Now we just got to go
to practice and put what the coach says in.  
  
Q. Morgan, Dom just mentioned the South Carolina comparison, which is a
pretty strong comparison. You played them three times. They have the big
guards, the big women inside. Talk specifically about that guard matchup.
Baylor has a lot of guards. Is that similar to what you faced when you went
against South Carolina?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, pretty much every opponent I face is pretty much bigger
than me, so... I just feel like we got to play tough, physical and aggressive,
like Coach Schaefer always tells us. We just got to play our game plan,
pressure the ball, make sure they not getting no easy looks.  
  
Q. This program, this team in particular, seems to thrive on the
underdog mentality. Coach was talking about how y'all deserved a little more
respect. What was y'all's thoughts going into the game last night when you see
experts picking Washington? What was y'all's thoughts? How do you feel like
you guys have thrived under that?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I believe we were the higher seed, so we believed we
should win. I believe with Coach Schaefer that we don't get the respect that
we should. We've worked so hard to be here. I don't think we get the credit we
deserve sometimes. We've beaten a lot of great teams already this year. We're
going to try to beat another great team on Sunday.  
  
Q. Dom, anything different about this year's training and conditioning
program? Why has it been so successful?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: We have a new strength coach this year, Coach Harvey. I
think he's practically pushed us to our limits, past our limits. I think he
gets the best out of us. He knows us. He's very personable with us. I think he
knows how to get everything out of us.  
  
He's really just been great with us this year. Our practices, like Coach
Schaefer said yesterday, we're not sitting around every eight, ten minutes
getting water. Our infrastructures are very fast-paced. Play a game every day.
It's called Bulldog. We play multiple times a day. It's a really fast-paced
game. If you're not in shape, you're not going to be able to play.  
  
Practice really helps with our conditioning.  
  
Q. Teaira, have you ever gone against anybody else that's 6'7 " like you
are? How do you see that matchup unfolding tomorrow?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I don't think I have. Well, I played against Kalani in AAU one
summer. That's the last time I played against her. That's probably the last
time.  
  
But Asia, I played against Asia. She's kind of my size.  
  
I think it's just going to be size going against size. It's going to be a
great matchup.  
  
Q. Breanna, defensive theme. What is the challenge for the threes and
the fours to try to negate some of the size that Baylor is going to bring?  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: I think for us, the main thing is a high-level matchup.
With us to help Teaira and the bigs out, we just denying the high post. We
might give her a couple of shots. Other than that, we're defending her off the
bounce. We deny high/low, it should shut most of their stuff down.  
  
Q. Teaira, was Baylor part of your recruiting process at all? Who was it
for you, Mississippi State and other finalists?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Baylor recruited me a lot in high school. Like, they were on
me hard. I had to look at how many bigs they had, like, what all was said
there.  
  
I just came to where I thought I would be best fit and could contribute to the
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you return to the locker room. Have a good
practice, and good luck. We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Victoria Vivians' stats for the season. The thought
process behind her not being a starter at this point in the season, how that
works for you. Looks like it is working for you.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, it's not just her. We've shuffled our lineup here in the
NCAA tournament a little bit. I think it's really worked well for us. We've
had some kids step up. We actually rolled four new starters out in our
regional.  
  
Morgan was the only one that remained. Teaira was the sixth Player of the Year
coming off the bench in the Southeastern Conference. I've been starting
Roshunda Johnson, Blair Schaefer, and Ketara Chapel at two, three and four.
Been bringing Victoria and Dom and Bre off the bench.  
  
The switch with Teaira and Chinwe really was Chinwe has been getting in foul
trouble early. I thought maybe she would relax a little bit coming off the
bench. Teaira has earned the right to start. She's had a heck of a year.  
  
I didn't want to put her in the starting lineup in the middle of conference
'cause, number one, it was working. Number two, I wanted her to be the sixth
Player of the Year in the league. That was a goal for her. About halfway
through the year, she deserved to start. She never said anything, but you want
to be honest with your kids. I was honest with her. I said, Hey, you're
outplaying Chi right now. Let's keep it the way it is. Go win the sixth Player
of the Year award. She kind of lit up. That was kind of a goal for her.  
  
For young kids, sometimes that's what they need. They need a vision. They need
someone to point 'em in the right direction. She went and got it.  
  
These other three, it's just been something that's worked. Who is to say that
is going to be what we'll be tomorrow. The unknown has kind of worked for us
the last couple weeks. I'm not going to change the unknown right now.  
  
Q. With all the talk about Baylor's size, I'm not sure if it gets lost
in the shuffle, but one player who is not talked about as much is Nina Davis.
She was conference Player of the Year. What kind of challenge does she present
when she's not the focal point of a team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I can tell you, we talked at length morning about Nina Davis.
I'm very familiar with her, her accomplishments.  
  
We're having to deal with a great team that has size. I think that's the best
way we can do it. I think y'all picked the size piece this morning. We
addressed it.  
  
As for the coach, Baylor's a great basketball team. Tremendous leadership at
point. Big, long two guard that can rise up and shoot it over the top of you.
Athleticism everywhere.  
  
But size and strength certainly stands out. Again, when you're sitting there
press row last night, at one point they rolled out 6'7", 6'5", like we have,
but we don't play ours together. They do. Then they had Nina Davis at the
three.  
  
Really obviously a tremendous basketball team that's highly skilled, well
coached. There's a reason why they're a No. 1 seed. Been in the top four all
year.  
  
That being said, in film this morning, it wasn't about size, it was about
everything. There's probably not enough time in the day to deal with all that.  
  
Q. Coach, your daughter averages five points for the season, but is
averaging 16 in the NCAA tournament. What has clicked?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, Coach is playing her a little bit more. That's probably
helped a little bit.  
  
You know, I think for her, it's just -- she has seized the moment. I watch her
and Roshunda every day. They have great chemistry together, playing together,
in that game we call Bulldog. When I insert both those kids in the starting
lineup, I've been looking at that all year long.  
  
Again, the media is caught up in who is out there when we're jumping center.
I'm caught up with who is out there during the course of a ballgame, who is on
the floor when it's really important, compared to when there's 20 minutes in
the first quarter, 10 minutes in the first quarter.  
  
For her, again, she's prepared all her life for this moment. There's no moment
too big for her. She's shooting the ball well. If y'all want to start trying
to figure things out, figure out that this time of year, it's about getting
hot.  
  
I got 13 players, really good players. Some of 'em are hot right now. It's my
job to play those that are hot. She's making shots. She took a couple bad
shots last night, but it's 'cause she's trying.  
  
Nobody wants to win more than her. She's a competitor. She's tough. Step in
front of a freight train and take a charge. She's my best help-side defender.
Brings a lot to the table. Probably best thing she does is she sets good
screens. If anybody is paying attention to what she does, she is a hell of a
screener. Tough.  
  
There's a lot of reasons to play her right now. Again, I think it's a kid
coming of age, maturing. Even though physically she might not look as imposing
as some others, she's smart. She's always a half a step ahead in her brain, in
her mind. That's what you got to be when you're only 5'6" playing at this
level. You better have something else going for you.  
  
Right now she's got a pretty good shot and she's smart.  
  
Q. Vic, back to what I asked about the underdog mentality. Is that
something that you harp on with some of these players? Morgan might not be
bigger than some of the girls she's up against. Jazz talked about the other
day she has a chip on her shoulder. Is that something you harp on with this
group, that not many people expect them to go as far as they've made it?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, not really, to be honest with you. I was a little
disappointed last night. I think everybody in the room got my message. We
finished second in the Southeastern Conference and played for two SEC
Championships. I think the lack of respect I feel like our team got, it's also
kind of a slap in the face on our league.  
  
Our league is a monster of a league, as y'all know that's covered us. It's
more of standing up for my league, standing up for the second-place team in
our league, a team that played for two SEC Championships within a week, has
played for three SEC Championships in the last two years.  
  
Sometimes these people that are picking people, they hadn't seen us play. They
don't know anything about our kids. They don't know anything about what we do
or how we do it.  
  
What's important to me is what's in our locker room. It's not what you do, but
how you do it that separates yourself from the rest of the country.  
  
I don't really talk to these kids about that. I think, you know, kids, they're
all about social media. I don't have to tell them too many things that they
don't already know. I think they saw it before I did, to be honest with you.
Somebody had to tell me who picked who. I could give a rat's you know what.
Doesn't matter to me.  
  
I'm just going to get these kids ready. You tell me who we're playing, when
and where, we're going to be there. That's how I feel about it.  
  
I think throughout the course of our season, it prepares us. You better have
that kind of mentality, because if you don't, you'll never get to this point,
dealing with the monsters we got to deal with in our league. I mean, it's just
a heck of a league.  
  
So anyway.  
  
Q. Vic, in building this program as quickly as you have, obviously your
need to recruit talent, but what were you looking for? What made you say, This
is a girl I need to get? What kind of qualities?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, again, I think if you see us play, we talk about being a
tough, physical, aggressive basketball team. That doesn't say anything about
your jump shot.  
  
Two kids transformed our team in a really short period of time. Let me back
up.  
  
The senior class that I have is the all-time winningest class in the history
of the program. They'll go down as the four best players to ever play there.
Dominique Dillingham and Savannah Carter, a junior college kid, I recruited
those kids not because of their jump shot, I recruited them because of their
toughness and their competitive spirit.  
  
The little team that I inherited when I got there in 2012, it's what we were
missing. That first year, when we went 13-17, I knew that was coming down the
pike. We didn't recruit anybody. When we took the job in April, we didn't add
anybody to the team. We took those kids that we inherited, we coached them
just as hard and just as tough that we're coaching these kids.  
  
Those kids made a commitment to change. I give those kids a lot of credit. But
when we were recruiting, we had to recruit the competitive spirit. We had to
recruit a toughness, because we just didn't have any.  
  
Again, to survive in our league at this level, you better have some toughness
to you. You better be competitive. If you're not competitive, you got no
chance. You'll be gobbled up and spit out. It's just the way it is.  
  
So that was a piece we had to have. Those two kids changed practices. They
brought it every day. So then, with those two kids, that whole first class
with Bre and Ketara added to it, Chinwe, they kind of transformed what it
looks like today. But the next class was the same way: tough, physical,
aggressive, but skilled.  
  
Remember, that was a top-20 class with Victoria, Blair, Morgan. That was a
real competitive class that had a skill set. Then every class after that I
think has had both.  
  
Again, if you're going to live at this level, you've got to recruit, not only
tough, physical, aggressive kids, but they have to have a skill set. You can't
function one-dimensional. We got too many good coaches. They'll just take that
away, then you'll be miserable because you can't do anything.  
  
I think that's the piece that we've been able to do at Mississippi State and
kind of change our program.  
  
Q. Coach, this game called Bulldog keeps coming up. How does it work?  
COACH SCHAEFER: So there's 24 seconds on the shot clock. You play for four
minutes. There's 24 seconds on the shot clock. We don't call a lot of fouls,
except for the obvious.  
  
Whenever you score, you're trying to score as fast as you can. Whatever's on
the shot clock, that's how many points you get. So if you get an offensive
board and a stick-back, you might get 23 points, okay? If the other team
scores, you get it in, streak down the floor and score with 18 seconds, you
get 18 points.  
  
That's the game that we're playing. I mean, we're pressing. Both teams are
pressing. We're picking up full court. It's one of these (indicating back and
forth).  
  
Just like last night, we get down 7 in the first half, but these kids have
been down 77 in Bulldog and come back to win.  
  
What you guys haven't seen, what I'm telling you, we have a maroon and gray
team. The gray team, by the way, has been starting lately. The gray team has
been beating the maroon team for about two weeks, more often than not.  
  
Everybody in the media wants to know, Gosh, how do you all of a sudden flip
the switch, play these kids? I've been watching them kick their butt for two
weeks. At some point, you know what, they've earned the right.  
  
So that's the piece that you don't see. But that's, in essence, the game of
Bulldog. You're trying to score as fast and as quick as you can, get up and
down, really have a fast-paced tempo.  
  
I think you saw last night in the second and fourth quarter, tempo, we got
down, tempo got sped up. We started playing good. We start doing some good
things.  
  
Q. Vic, depth and conditioning have been a big reason why you're here.
Baylor is very similar in that regard. Got me thinking about, what has been
Anthony's role? Why did you go with him? He has had a lot of credentials. What
has he implemented that's been different this year?  
COACH SCHAEFER: It's the first strength coach we've been able to hire strictly
for women's basketball at Mississippi State. Obviously he came from the NBA,
worked for the Detroit Pistons. Had been with the Orlando Magic. He had some
experience at a pretty high level.  
  
He really wanted the job. He wanted to get back into college athletics. Took a
pay cut to get into college athletics. That says volumes about him personally,
his involvement, his investment in our program.  
  
He's a stickler. He wants the kids to send him pictures of what they're
eating. He's on 'em when he knows they're not eating right. Which, you know
what, our kids don't eat right. I wish I could sit up here and brag about how
good they eat. But they're kids. They like to eat junk. They like to eat fast
food.  
  
You know what, 10 to 15 years ago, I'd have probably been right there with him
complaining. But at the end of the day, as I get older, I've kind of -- our
football coach at Mississippi State, pregame meal for our football team, he
doesn't care what they eat as long as they eat. If they want burgers, give
them burgers. If they want wings, give 'em wings.  
  
You know what, if you're going to put a piece of grilled chicken in front of
somebody and a dry baked potato and green beans and they look at it and go,
Huh-uh, I'd rather them eat the burger and fries. If the kid doesn't want it,
they're not going to eat it.  
  
I've changed. I'm proud of myself. 20 years ago I'd have been shoving that dry
chicken in front of them and making them eat that. I think that's good. I
think you've got to adapt to kids.  
  
He's been good in that regard. You know, he pays attention. It's been good.  
  
I think what they probably would tell you, too, is our practices, even though
we're really intense and go really hard, we probably aren't going as long as I
have in the past.  
  
Again, maybe that's me getting a little older and a little wiser, I don't
know. Maybe that's me getting soft. That's how I feel about it. At the end of
the day we're 32-4. Maybe I need to soften up.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a chance to visit with one of your former players last
night. She said you have made an impact in her life; that she would not be
where she is today. To get a chance to visit with someone like that from more
than 25 years, what does that say about the journey that you've been on, even
though you might have grown a little soft, that you've still made an
impression on someone from that far back?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, it was really special to see Jennifer here. Y'all don't
know this, but in 1990, when I got my first head coaching job at Sam Houston
State, I'd never been a women's coach. I had coached women's tennis at Milby
High School in Houston, Texas. That was the extent of my experience coaching
women. I'd been a freshmen boys high school coach. Coached the first ninth
grade boys team that ever went to campus in HISD at Milby. Had been an
assistant at Sam Houston State from '87 to '89, then went back to Milby as the
freshman boys coach.  
  
In 1990 when I got the job at Sam Houston State, there were three kids on the
team, I didn't have the first contact or know where to find the first
basketball player. I recruited Jennifer out of the newspaper. She was All-
Greater Houston, in Houston, Texas. That's where I found her name.  
  
To see her at the game last night, to know she just got on an airplane with
her son and flew up here to watch us play. She stopped by Starkville four
years ago. She was in the area working. But that's pretty special.  
  
Back then, y'all, I was a young guy that was pretty naïve, too, to what I was
doing, in understanding the importance of what I was doing. I probably wasn't
the easiest guy to play for.  
  
I give her a lot of credit. I give all those kids a lot of credit. I'm a lot
different today, have a much greater appreciation for where I am, what I'm
doing, who I'm doing it with.  
  
You know, Jennifer, for her to say that, that's awfully kind. She's pretty
successful. I'm proud of her for that, so... Thanks for bringing that up. I'll
try to get out of here without crying.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let you go at any time.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't have practice till 12. Anybody got anything else?  
  
Q. Coach, historically the best players in the state of Mississippi went
out of state for their college basketball careers. How have you been able to
change that?  
COACH SCHAEFER: You know, I think the thing that most impresses me about our
state is we have so many good people, good families. It's a down-to-earth,
hard-working state.  
  
I think those kids and their families realize, they don't have to go somewhere
else to play top-10 basketball. They can come right to Mississippi State. They
know their kids are going to be well taken care of. They could put their head
on a pillow at night, close their eyes, go, Coach Schaefer and his staff are
going to take good care of my baby. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter
how old those girls get, they're always going to be somebody's baby.  
  
I have a tremendous staff. We take great pride in making sure we are taking
good care of these kids. It's not just about basketball. My staff is the best.
I have great role models for these young ladies. When they come down the hall
every day, sign my door, which they have to, outside of basketball, I want to
see them outside of a practice uniform.  
  
When they come sign my door every day, they have to walk by three full-time
assistant coaches' doors. They get to see firsthand what a professional looks
like, how they act, how they talk on the phone, how they dress. These are
things to me that are very important in today's world. They're a great role
model for our young ladies.  
  
So I think that's what it is. I think we've done a good job of closing the
borders and keeping those kids at State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go now.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Baylor. We'll go straight to questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, can you talk about how the offense has evolved, is different
from last season, how you guys have broken up the shot disparities, because
the numbers of shots everybody is taking is different from last season.  
NINA DAVIS: We're a team with a lot of talent. We have a lot of depth. We can
score at every position one through five. We share the ball well. As you can
see, we have a good assist-to-turnover ratio. We're just a team that know how
to play together.  
  
We get out and run. We take great shots. We kind of go from the inside-out. We
have perimeter players that can knock down the three. We have bigs that can
pound it on the inside.  
  
Q. Kalani, what are your initial impressions of Teaira McCowan?  
KALANI BROWN: Big, strong. Big in the post. Got to block her out and do my
work early or get punished. You can't get deep. Just do my work early, run the
floor hard.  
  
Q. Alexis Jones, you're working your way back in. How are you feeling
going into this game tomorrow night?  
ALEXIS JONES: We're excited. We're back at the Elite 8 again. It's our last
year for me, Nina, Prince and Kay-Kay. I'm excited. I'm ready to go.  
  
I think everybody on the team is ready to go, excited to take on for the Elite
8 tomorrow.  
  
Q. Nina, how would you describe your role on this team?  
NINA DAVIS: Whatever the team needs me to be. Whether that's to get the
rebounds, to score, to play defense, to push the ball in transition. Really
just being the overall team player, just helping them in any way they need at
that time.  
  
Q. Kristy, you guys showed signs of this team last year, having so many
weapons. It's really gelled this year. Can you talk about from a guard's
perspective what it's like, how many different weapons you have, the different
ways that you guys can play depending who is out on the court for you guys.  
KRISTY WALLACE: It's great because we can score from any position. We can
share the ball. As Nina said, we work it from the inside-out. We have people
that can hit the three, bigs that can, you know, battle inside and score the
ball.  
  
So it's great having a team that's really gelled. It's the right kind of time
to be doing it, too. It's good to play with.  
  
Q. For all the players. What would a win tomorrow night and a trip to
the Final Four mean to you?  
ALEXIS JONES: It would mean we made it to the Final Four (laughter).  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, it would be a huge deal. It's a goal that me and the
team have had for a while now. We've made that Elite 8. I've made it twice. I
know Nina has made it three times, Prince has made it three times.  
  
NINA DAVIS: It's no secret what our goal has been all four years I've been in
college. We've been granted another opportunity. Of course, we'll be thrilled
and excited to finally get over the hump and get to the Final Four.  
  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It would mean a lot to finally get over that hump, see how we
play once we get there.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I know how much it means to Coach and our seniors. It means it's
that much important to me that we get our seniors to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Alexis Jones, how important is it for you to start out quickly?  
ALEXIS JONES: I think it's important for us to start out maybe not necessarily
quickly, but it's important for us to start out strong. It's important for us
to start out with energy. It's important to start out and let them know that
we came to play, to let them know we're going to come to play defense, we're
going to rebound, we're going to do all the dirty work; that we ready to play
this game.  
  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, I think it's important for us to set the tone early, not
only for the other team, but for us, to give us confidence. Starting out on
our defense to help get our offense going.  
  
Q. Alexis Prince, can you talk about how your game has evolved from last
season to become as big of a contributor as you have been this season.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, I feel like I'm being more aggressive, just more healthy,
able to move more, play defense better, just contribute any way I can.  
  
Q. Kristy, I saw it looked like your little sisters were here holding up
a sign last night. You're here from Australia. What is it like to have them
make this big trip? How long will they be here?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, it's very exciting. I'm so thankful and blessed to have
the support I have, a family that made the effort to come see me play, which
is really exciting.  
  
They're going to be here till it's like April 6th, I think it was. They'll be
here for a little while, yeah.  
  
Q. Kalani, you have gone against McCowan, you're familiar with her. What
are the challenges when you're facing somebody who is as big as you as opposed
to maybe somebody who is trying to guard you a different way? What is that
like? Probably doesn't happen that often.  
KALANI BROWN: It doesn't. Worry about a double-team. You may not have to worry
about it. But definitely getting my shot over her length is probably going to
be the biggest challenge.  
  
Q. Kristy, going back to the guy from Seton Hall, a long time ago, Patty
Mills, how did basketball become so big in Australia?  
KRISTY WALLACE: I don't think it's as big for women's basketball back home in
Australia. It's kind of grown over the last few years a little bit.  
  
But, yeah, it's such a big difference from playing in Australia to playing
college basketball. The fans, the media, the gear you get is incredible.  
  
I'm so thankful and blessed to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Nina, one of the things Mississippi State does, they're sort of
comparing you to South Carolina in terms of personnel, a team that they've
played three times. Is there anybody you have played that reminds you of
Mississippi State?  
NINA DAVIS: I can't say that we have. I'm probably wrong, but off the top of
my head, I really can't remember.  
  
Mississippi State is a great team. They have great guards. You have Vivians
that is a great player. She puts up a lot of shots. She can shoot it from
deep.  
  
You have Dillingham that can come off, a great offensive player with midrange.  
  
They also have a post presence.  
  
It's definitely going to be a good game, a good challenge, we're going to have
to come out ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you go back to the locker room. We'll take
questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how the kids have bought in, if there's
necessarily been a buy-in, to sharing the basketball as much as you have this
season, if you think that's a good way to describe what you do offensively?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I've never had a problem with kids sharing the ball. My
biggest challenge as a coach this year was this much talent, this much depth,
to make sure I have the right people on the floor at the right time,
combinations on the floor.  
  
Look, I can only start five. I've got more than that that can start. You know,
that's been my challenge as a coach.  
  
I just think we're hitting on all cylinders right now. We knew we had the
depth, but the depth sometimes wasn't producing on a consistent basis. You'd
have one kid that would have a great night, and the next game you wouldn't
hear from them.  
  
I think right now, if you've seen our three games in the playoffs, they're all
hitting on all cylinders. You hope you can extend that.  
  
Q. Coach, they've done something different in the tournament than during
the regular season in terms of the starters, how Vivians and the other three
that started for most of the season haven't started. Does that change anything
in terms of preparing for them?  
COACH MULKEY: Why are they making those changes, you'd have to ask them. Is
that a chemistry problem? Is that a who's playing better problem? I don't
know.  
  
It doesn't change anything for us. We've got to guard 10 players because even
when the other guys were in the starting lineup, he was playing those same
players.  
  
It's just a group is starting now that wasn't starting. In fact, I think he's
starting kids now that didn't start an SEC game at all. So he's very confident
in his team.  
  
Q. A lot of times when you're talking about a team that's big and has
depth at the inside positions, you're not necessarily talking about a team
that pushes the ball, is averaging 90 points a game. How are you able to
balance those things, have that size, but push the tempo the way you do?  
COACH MULKEY: We run. From day one, in recruiting, you know, this is a game of
entertainment. We're going to run.  
  
Now, that doesn't mean games aren't won and lost in the halfcourt when you get
down to crunch time. But our posts are going to run foul line to foul line.
They know that.  
  
I think Kalani Brown is a great example. Her freshman year she was bigger and
slower, softer. Now you look at her, and she's just a different player.
Beatrice runs well anyway. Cox runs well anyway.  
  
We like to push it and run. We've got enough depth that when you get tired,
we'll give you a break.  
  
Q. With this being one of the best senior classes in program history,
how much of a responsibility do you feel as a coach to get these players past
the Elite 8, into the Final Four, and a hopeful national championship?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I don't feel responsible at all. I'm not going to make the
first pass, shoot the first bucket or dribble. All I can do is help them
develop as players, show them the film, show them what I think will work. It's
their job to go do it.  
  
I think when they came to Baylor, they wanted to get to a Final Four. I think
anybody that comes to Baylor wants to get to a Final Four. We've set the bar
that high.  
  
But if they don't make it, I think there are a lot of kids, a lot of programs,
that would love to change places with four Elite 8s.  
  
Q. With Jones being out for the time she was, how would you assess the
way she has gotten herself back into a groove coming off the bench as opposed
to starting?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she's in there quickly. Like I said, I can't start but
five. I could start her the next game.  
  
She has an extremely high tolerance of pain. The injury was a bone bruise.
They tell me that's just a matter of time, what your tolerance of pain is. I
don't see her as being a liability out there at all.  
  
Certainly going to need her for ball handling tomorrow, with the pressure that
Mississippi State brings. Kristy is good, but Kristy is going to need a
breather every now and then.  
  
It helps us against a team like Mississippi State to have her back.  
  
Q. Mississippi State's first trip to the Elite 8. In your mind, what
does it take to build a successful program? What have you seen from Vic
Schaefer, what he's done, to build them up?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you have to have a commitment from your administration
first, then you have to have a great staff that's not out looking for a job
every day, that wants to stay and help you build it. Then you have to go get
players.  
  
When we built it at Baylor, we weren't necessarily able to get in the doors of
the blue-chip recruits. We had to go build it with kids that were I don't want
to say second tier, but they weren't the tops on the big-time programs list.
We built with those kids. That's how we built it at Baylor.  
  
I think Vic does have better players than I had within my five years because
he's got a McDonald's All-American in the paint in McCowan, Vivians. He's got
a heck of a lot more talent than I had in my first five years.  
  
Q. You went against his defenses when he was an assistant at Texas A &M.
What are the things most specifically that are difficult to go against with
Vic Schaefer defensive teams?  
COACH MULKEY: You're going to see pressure everywhere. Just handle the
pressure, realize there's not going to be an easy pass. You're going to have
to work to get open. You're going to have to work for everything you get.
They're going to guard you.  
  
You know, just prepare for that. I think we're going to guard them, too.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer is coaching his daughter Blair right now. You had
experience coaching your daughter. What was that like for you? How has your
relationship with her grown now that she's on your staff?  
COACH MULKEY: He's probably a lot smarter than I was. He's playing his
daughter earlier than I played mine. I kind of made her suffer a little bit
more because you tend to be a little bit harder on your own kids.  
  
It's good to see. I wish there were more, you know, fathers, mothers coaching
their kids. Tricia at Quinnipiac -- is that how you say it? -- I'll never
forget a communication I got from her when I was coaching my daughter, because
her daughter was getting ready to go into her program. The words she said to
me, to see the success her team is having, it just touches my heart.  
  
I just have a special place in my heart for coaches who can coach their own
kids, do it fairly, and win. He's doing that with his child.  
  
Q. Does this team remind you of anyone that you have faced this season,
similarities?  
COACH MULKEY: No. Just their defense is different than anything we've seen.
Now, we've seen size. I mean, Oklahoma has Mulkey at 6'9". We've seen the
height, I should say. She's not built like Teaira.  
  
Beatrice played against Big T. Kalani has, Cox. They've all played against
each other during the summer.  
  
On the perimeter, I can't think of anybody that just really stresses defensive
pressure like that. Other teams I've had, obviously when we played A&M, but
I'm not sure any of these kids, you know, have played against A&M.  
  
Q. Dealing with the combinations, trying to figure out the right combos
to throw at certain times, is it a gut instinct? How do you go about with so
many talented players to figure out the right moment for the right
combination?  
COACH MULKEY: There is no perfect answer. It's just the flow of the game, the
feel of the game, what's working, what's not working. Give that kid a chance,
foul trouble. It's all of that.  
  
There's no plan that I have going into a game where, Okay, at this minute,
when we get to this minute mark, we're going to put this one in. It's just a
feel for the game. Sometimes you make the right decisions, and sometimes you
don't.  
  
Q. We've seen some fire in the belly from Kristy. Does she remind you
personality-wise on the court of yourself? Has she carried that onto the
court?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Kristy does have that fire in her belly. I think that
may be close to what I used to play with. But Kristy needs to have more of a
confidence within; that it's okay to point your finger, it's okay to tell them
where to go.  
  
I think she's become better at that. It's difficult when you have four
seniors, you have All-Americans around you. I think she's had to grow into
that role. If you'll remember, last year, she was our off guard. She's really
kind of in a new position, but a comfortable position, because that's what she
plays back home.  
  
Q. Vivians has had some struggles in terms of shooting, but she's also
the kind of player that can take over a game shooting-wise. What are some of
the challenges when she's playing well?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, not that we have seen in our league, because we see a lot
of great perimeter shooters in our league. When they get on a roll, you just
have to figure out a way to stop it. Either deny them the ball or, you know,
take away their dominant hand.  
  
You can't let them just get comfortable. Change your defense maybe. But, yeah,
she's a tremendous player.  
  
Q. For the seniors that this is their last chance to get to a Final
Four, how do you make sure that pressure doesn't get too big?  
COACH MULKEY: We're not the kind of team that gets all nutted up. That's just
not who we are. We're all business. We go over detailed scouting reports. We
give them a game plan. We make sure they're prepared.  
  
I just never left the floor where I felt like we've lost a game because -
what's the word - we choked or nutted up.  
  
When we've gotten beat even in the worst upsets, we got beat by a team that
played darn good and played better. Whoever wins tomorrow, two good teams.
Whoever plays the best is going to win. Whoever makes plays is going to win.  
  
At this stage, got some good coaches and some good teams left. A little
wrinkle here or there, a little execution here and there, is usually the
difference between the ballgames.  
  
Q. Kim, earlier this month your comments were what kind of grabbed the
headlines after Senior Day. Do you feel like the attention has turned back to
your team, especially with the way they've been playing through the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll see you tomorrow night.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 97, Louisville - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Louisville. Coach, your thoughts about
tonight's game.  
  
COACH WALZ: Well, first off, I'd like to congratulate Baylor on a very well-
played game, and thank everyone with the support staff, everyone involved with
the NCAA. It's been a wonderful experience for not only myself but our entire
program, these young women sitting next to me here, our support staff,
everyone that's been involved with it from the University of Louisville. I
just definitely would like to thank the NCAA.  
  
Then on to the game. They played well. Unfortunately, we did not. We did not
put up a performance that even resembled anything that I had seen from our
ballclub the last month.  
  
You know, we knew coming into it that we were going to have to play very well
and really do a lot of things in the post to try to give some post help.
Unfortunately, we just did not respond very well.  
  
The first play of the game, we got them to take the shot that we wanted to
take. They miss it. Then we don't follow through with the box-out. It turns
into a layup.  
  
When you're playing a team with the talent of Baylor, the depth of Baylor, you
have to be able to finish out plays. Unfortunately for us, we did not.  
  
I thought we actually took care of the ball decent. But the problem is, you
know, every time we turned it over, it led to a point. It's a staggering stat,
when you look at it. They have 21 points off our turnovers, and we only turned
it over 12 times. Every turnover led to a point, a basket. It's unacceptable.  
  
We've been talking, if we're going to turn the ball over, we need dead-ball
turnovers, we need to throw it into the stands, hold onto it, but they can't
lead to baskets. They led to 21 points.  
  
Unfortunately it's definitely not the way we wanted to end this season, in
this fashion. I'm proud of the young women that I coach. They've worked their
tails off. They've had a great season.  
  
We're looking forward to getting back in the gym and start working for next
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes or Coach.  
  
Q. Asia, it seemed like in the beginning your shots weren't really
falling. You started to get into a rhythm as the game went on. The team
overall didn't really. What do you think it was that was keeping you from
getting started in the beginning? Was it the same thing that was hampering the
entire team throughout the game?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think, starting off in the first quarter, I mean, I started
off too hyped. As the game went on, I calmed down. We started to get a few
stops here and there, but we didn't shoot the ball too well.  
  
We just tried to make a few runs. They didn't get enough stops, so... That's
what really hurt us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, the second quarter was where you all made some adjustments to
what Baylor was doing. You made a run to close the gap just before halftime.
Talk about that.  
COACH WALZ: Well, we really didn't make any adjustments. We just actually
followed through with the game plan. We actually executed correctly and did
the right things, which we struggled with.  
  
We knew it coming into the game, that we had to be on point. Then, like Asia
said, we came up with some stops. We had some great rotations. Our effort was
really good.  
  
Went into halftime feeling good. I really felt good about things. I'm like,
Hey, it's a 12-point game, people. They had it at 18. We cut it down to 12. We
got to get a stop, score, stop. It led to a score, turnover, and-one, a 5-0
run.  
  
It was like, Golly, you went from 12 to 17 in a hurry.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you compare this Lady Bears team to the team you saw
in 2013? Do you think this team could potentially be better than that squad?  
COACH WALZ: I think they're deeper is what it is. I don't see anybody on the
team that's the caliber of Brittney Griner. I'm not sure there's going to be.
I think she's a once-in-a-lifetime player to come through. Odyssey Sims was
pretty darn good, too.  
  
I think once you get into five, six, seven and eight, I think five, six, seven
and eight on this year's ballclub, you have to guard 'em all. There's only one
or two kids that I thought on the roster, when they got into the game, we were
going to try to make 'em shoot and score.  
  
In '13, I thought they had four or five of them that we were going to
challenge. It makes it much more difficult when they can put five on the floor
that can score, four out of five most times can score.  
  
I think that's your difference, the fact that they're just deeper.  
  
Q. Myisha, did you feel like this game was at all comparable to any
other losses you had this season?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, because this is our last game. This is the last game
for the seniors. You're one-and-done if you lost this game.  
  
It hurts a lot because we knew we could have played a lot better, and we
didn't follow through with the game plan for the whole 40 minutes. We didn't
come up with stops when we needed to.  
  
You know, it just hurts a lot because we know we could have done a lot better
than what we did.  
  
Q. Jeff, you've had probably in your career a few of these undersized
kids, like Nina Davis. Seemed like today was the kind of game where her senior
leadership and the things she did made a big difference. Talk about how tough
a kid like that is.  
COACH WALZ: No, she played extremely well. She plays hard. She's crafty. She
knows how to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Then, you know, she fits what they're doing. She's a very important piece to
their puzzle. Kalani Brown -- I thought Beatrice played extremely well, Kalani
played well. They're able to throw so many big kids at you, they're big
bodies, but they're also talented.  
  
I tell people all the time, they always used to tell us, You got to go get a
big kid. I'm real excited about Kylee Shook and Ciera Johnson, what they're
going to be able to turn into. They're efficient right now.  
  
Kalani and Beatrice are very efficient. They score around the basket, which
then opens things up for Nina. I thought she does a great job of taking
advantage of that. She did it tonight.  
  
10-15 from the field...  
  
Q. Coach, I know you said yesterday that you wanted to force Baylor to
use players that they don't normally use to score. 34 bench points tonight.
Seemed like they kind of did do that. Is that what you envisioned?  
COACH WALZ: No. They really didn't do that at all. The ones that we knew could
score coming off the bench scored. We had a few of 'em that were shooting the
ball early that we wanted them to shoot, but we couldn't get the rebound. That
just eliminates everything you're trying to do.  
  
You know, the ones that we were going to want to shoot really shot it. But,
unfortunately, did not shoot it enough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season.  
  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 75, Washington - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Mississippi State. Coach, congratulations
on the win, and your thoughts about tonight's game.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you. I'm awfully proud of my kids tonight. They just
really played extremely well. I was so proud of what they were able to take in
three days from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Wasn't rocket science, but there were some little things in there we needed to
do a little differently and be concerned about I think more than anything.  
  
That's a heck of a basketball team. Mike, as I told y'all the day before
yesterday, he's a tremendous coach, one of the best. He's got an unbelievable
mind for the game. What he's done with Kelsey Plum is really incredible. I
mean, she's the best offensive player in the history of the game.  
  
I said it before. It was like playing against James Harden of the Rockets. You
got to really be careful about floor spacing. You got to really be careful
about allowing lanes to exist. Then you can't come off of those kids that can
stand out there and play HORSE and shoot it.  
  
Our kids were special today. No question about it. Dom came in and was
Dominique. She's one of the best in the country. It's a reason why she's been
on the all-defenses team in the Southeastern Conference two straight years.
Did really a tremendous job on Plum.  
  
I don't know when the last time she's been held to 10-25, or 40%, whatever it
was. We made her work for everything.  
  
I thought our press wore them down a little bit. Then Teaira, I jumped on her
back when we got in the locker room, because I felt like she was carrying us
most of the night. Offensively she was really special down the stretch. Had
that look in her eye, wanted the ball, got to her spots where she needs to get
to.  
  
Osahor was special tonight for them, as well. She's a problem. T had her hands
full with her on that end, as well.  
  
You know, you hold that team to 64 points, you're playing your guts out. It
ain't like we're standing around playing hope you miss your defense.  
  
I couldn't be prouder of our kids for their energy, their effort. We talk
about being connected, having chemistry on that end. That's the piece that
doesn't come early in a season. Your defensive cohesiveness and your
chemistry, it's not the first thing, it's the last thing.  
  
This group is really doing a good job right now. Again, I'm so, so proud of
'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach or the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Dominique, I think we were 7-11, then y'all held 'em to 3-15, went on
a run from there. What was the battle like between you and Plum? How did you
feel like the defense did once y'all were able to settle in?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Plum is just an amazing player. It was a great battle
all night long. My teammates helped me out a lot. We were able to switch a lot
of things, which helped me personally. My team just did a good job of sealing
up the line. We had umbrella defense. Everybody was there to help. It was just
a team effort, I think.  
  
Q. Teaira, what changed for you in the fourth quarter?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, during media, they told me, they said, T, you got to
dominate. Just taking that in, listening to my teammates, knowing I had to
step up, take my team, like, further, that's when I had the look in my eye
like, Nobody can stop you. You have to do what your teammates are asking you
to do.  
  
Q. Teaira, can you give me a one, two, three, 11 straight points, block
party where you have back-to-back, then taking high fives up in the stands?
Rank those things one, two, three.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I think the blocks would come first, then the points, then the
high fives. No, the high fives would come first, knowing my teammates are
proud of me, then the blocks, then the points.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you put in perspective what you saw? Teaira, you
watched her all season. She took over that third quarter. Can you talk about
what that did for the confidence of the rest of the team.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think she just put us on her back, honestly. Once she
got going, it's hard to stop her, honestly. She was running from transition,
so she was getting a lot of rebounds since nobody was there to block her out.  
  
Once she gets rebounding, no one is going to block her shot. It was an easy
bucket for her. She was getting the out and ones. She loves that turnaround
jump shot. When she gets those tips, she's money from that spot. When she's
scoring for us, I think that gives us all the confidence in the world because
we can go inside-out. It makes it that much easier for us guards.  
  
Q. Dominique, talk about the second quarter. It seemed to be where you
all as a team gathered yourselves. Coach talked about defense.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think we just finally decided we're going to lock down
on defense. I think it was all about playing together. It's not about one
person locking down one person, it's about the team locking down them.  
  
I think when we decided that we were going to guard together, not let them
have any easy looks, I think that's when it really started to click.  
  
I think their first four looks were threes, made threes. For the rest of the
game, I think they only made four.  
  
Just after we got them off the line, stopped them from making threes, we were
fine.  
  
Q. Coach, your take on that.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I wasn't real pleased with how we started the ballgame. I was
disappointed in our energy defensively. We had a major lapse on an out of
bounds play. We let the best player in the history of the game have a wide-
open three. Like she said, I mean, their first four made baskets are all
three-pointers. They're uncontested.  
  
It was really frustrating because that's a focal -- that's being focused. We
kind of were playing catch-up.  
  
The second and fourth quarters were special offensively. We obviously got some
things going on offense. You score 25 and 27 points in a quarter, you're doing
some good things offensively.  
  
I thought those quarters obviously were the big turning points in both the
first half and the second half.  
  
Q. Last year, couldn't get over the hump of the Sweet 16. You get to do
it this year. This is the first Elite 8 in school history. What does that
mean? A lot of records over the last few years. What does it mean to see your
team get over another hump, get another record?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, as you know, it's only been five short years that we've
been here. The last three obviously we've been in the NCAA tournament.  
  
To be in the Sweet 16 in your second go in the NCAAs is pretty special. This
is our third now in five years, and we're in the Elite 8.  
  
I've got a good team. I'm a little disappointed in the country right now that
we're not getting the respect that these kids deserve. It's disappointing.  
  
This is a heck of a team. We got a bunch of really good players. We've beaten
a bunch of really good people.  
  
You know, for me, I have so much pride in these girls 'cause I know how hard
they work. You stick your head in one of our practices, we ain't standing
around out there having water every 10 minutes, you know, getting a towel, all
that. I mean, they work their tails off. They pay the price.  
  
They're not getting a lot of credit right now. That's fine. You know what,
we'll fly under the radar the whole way if we have to. These kids work awfully
hard. We beat a heck of a team today.  
  
I'll say it again, Mike is a heck of a coach. Washington is obviously a
tremendous basketball team.  
  
We believed it. We never doubted that we couldn't do it. These kids went out
there and competed today and got it done.  
  
Elite 8, third trip to NCAAs in five years, it's pretty gratifying.  
  
Q. For the players. What does it mean for you to be part of the first
Elite 8 team? What was it like in the locker room after this game?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: In the locker room after the game, we were all just really
happy for each other. I feel like every game this year we've had different
people step up. It's really hard to guard a team who you just don't know who
to guard, honestly. That's what I feel like we have with our team. You don't
know who is going to go off, you don't know what they're going to do.  
  
I feel like we're really proud of each other. We're really proud we're working
so well together. We're happy to keep this journey going.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Like she said, we were really happy in the locker room.
Just happy because we know how hard we worked to get to this point. It's a
special moment for our team.  
  
But we're not done yet. Tomorrow, it's time to get to work and focus on the
next team we're playing.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: We're just earning the respect that we should get.  
  
Q. If I figured this right, Teaira had 16 consecutive points at the
start of that fourth quarter. Have you ever had one player in your coaching
career do something like that, score 16 points for you? Also, we talked in the
SEC tournament about her growth, how much she's grown even in this short
amount of time between then and now.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Right. I think maybe Tori has done it. I've emptied the
playbook on Tori before, when she's making everything she's looking at.  
  
Tonight we kind of emptied the playbook for T. We ran a lot of different
things to get her down there. But we wanted to get her to her spots, where
she's really comfortable. We flipped the sides of the floor midway through
that run, just to give them a different look.  
  
But, you know, T continues to grow. She's come so far, yet she's got so far to
go. Her upside is out of sight. I mean, the kid can be an All-American before
it's all said and done. She can dominate the game. As y'all saw tonight, she
dominated the game on both ends of the floor. She was interested in dominating
the game on both ends of the floor.  
  
When I can get that out of her, it changes the dynamic of our team. That's the
impact that the kid can have.  
  
Now, if we were all going to sit out here and air out our laundry, she would
tell you timeouts were not a lot of fun tonight, just because I was demanding.
That's because I know what the kid can do. We needed her to step up, but we
needed her to step up on both the defensive and offensive end. She'll tell you
that. Our conferences in the huddle were more about defense than offense. The
last thing I said coming out is what we were going to run, that would click,
okay, that's for me.  
  
The conversation in our huddle all night with Teaira was mostly about defense.
You saw the impact the kid can have in a ballgame on both ends. Not many kids
can do that. Not many players can have that kind of an impact like T can.  
  
She knows. I'm not backing off. I'm going to keep coaching her, loving her,
and demanding it of her.  
  
Q. Teaira, the battle against Chantel, she came in as the nation's
leading rebounder, does such a good job of putting herself between the basket
and the offensive player. What did you try to do to either get around her or
get position on her, especially in that stretch where you scored those 16
points?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: In practice, we work on boxing out. Long shots have long
rebounds. Just putting myself in the position to either box her out and not
let her get the ball, or neither one of us get it, and somebody else cleans it
up.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can, at which point in the season, either at home or on
the road, did the team show, in your eyes, as you talk about day after day
defensively, they looked like they were headed in the right direction?  
COACH SCHAEFER: They'll tell you I've never -- I've not seen it yet (smiling).
They'll tell you that I've told them at times they're one of the worst
defensive teams I've coached.  
  
It's just a level of expectation that I have. I know what's in 'em. You know,
she gets six blocks tonight. There's one little person right here going, Yes,
she could have been doing that all year. Why haven't you gotten that out of
her all year? It's just growth for her.  
  
I've told them at times, We just don't have it. We're just not that good
defensively. Yet I know, looking at the stats, what the points-per-game number
is, it's pretty good; what the turnovers caused is, it's pretty good; field
goal-percentage defense, it's pretty good.  
  
I just know what a good one looks like. I think they got it. We ain't got it
yet, but the good thing is the season isn't over.  
  
I'm still waiting. I'm going to coach them tomorrow, trying to get them to be
the best defensive team I can get them to be. I'm not giving up. We're not
status quo. We know that. We've worked all week on getting better. Every
minute we want to get one play better.  
  
It's a good question, though (smiling).  
  
Q. Teaira, we were talking about the fourth quarter. When was the last
time you felt like you were that dominant in a basketball game?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: A&M, when we played them at their place. About the same time
in the fourth quarter, I took over, too (laughter).  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: She had the game winner there. We took the lead. They got it
back. She made the game winner there down the stretch. We went to her quite a
bit down the stretch there. She was the difference.  
  
That would probably be the last time where she was that way. Then Florida at
home. She had 25 against Florida. Think she missed one shot all night. She was
11-12, or 12-13. Pretty dominant that night.  
  
The kid has it in her. No doubt about it. Tonight she was really, really
special. The challenge now is can I get that out of her back-to-back. I think
that will be the challenge tomorrow, then we'll come back Sunday, you know
what, we'll lay it on the line, see how it all turns out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the win. Get some rest. We'll see you
tomorrow.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord, go Dogs.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Mississippi State - 75, Washington - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Washington. Coach, your thoughts about
tonight's game.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Congratulations to Mississippi State. Been a tremendous team
all year long. Have really started to peak, even more so in the NCAA
tournament.  
  
We got their best effort tonight. I think it took that because our kids fought
and fought and fought, and never went away. Congratulations to those guys.  
  
Really proud of our team, not only what they've done this year, but what this
group has done for our program over the last four years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our coach or student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, when Dominique Dillingham came in the game in the second
quarter, what was she doing defensively? Also Victoria Vivians, what allowed
them to catch back up and take the lead?  
KELSEY PLUM: They're a very good defensive team. I thought Dillingham did a
great job on me. She just stayed down and just contested late on shots. She
blocked a couple of 'em, tipped a couple of 'em. Just made it difficult for
me.  
  
Credit to her for playing a great game. Their team, it was just congested in
the paint. They're very big, very athletic. Difficult to get my shot off.  
  
Q. Chantel, can you describe what it was like to go against 6'5 ", 6'7",
especially McCowan, what you tried to do to try to keep them away from the
basket?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I didn't do a very good job today. Something I take pride in,
she was the difference maker, McCowan was. She had 26-12. She had some big
baskets at the end. That was my fault.  
  
I just didn't box her out hard enough. But credit to her, she had a good game.  
  
Q. Coach, is Chantel being a little bit hard on herself?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Chantel is absolutely being hard on herself. But that's who
she is. I got her back. She played incredibly hard. McCowan is a tough
matchup, really tough matchup. She was very motivated. She got going, got
really confident, starting hitting some turnaround shots. We simply can't do
anything about that. She can't. None of us can.  
  
But that's who Chantel is. She has always been the consummate teammate, the
consummate dream player that you hope for as a coach.  
  
It's hard when it's the end of it. It's a matchup, again, that's just really,
really hard. Hard tonight.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just talk about your matchup tonight. Seems like in
conference play, every time you stepped out, had your hand on the ball, there
was somebody always in your face.  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, they did a great job. They shadowed me with the big player.
They switched plays, hedged screens. Credit to them. They had a great
defensive game plan. You know, I didn't make shots, just throughout the game,
which I usually do.  
  
They made it difficult on me. I mean, there's not much else to say. They just
played great defense.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I'm not sure if you're in the reflecting mood right now, but
the end of your college career. You put Washington basketball on the map, done
some incredible things here. Can you put into words at all what it's been like
for you, what your experience has been.  
KELSEY PLUM: (Tearing up.) I'm so grateful to have been able to go to the
University of Washington. You know, when I first came on campus, I had big
dreams, dreams for our program, dreams as an individual. A lot of 'em came
true.  
  
So for that, I'm very grateful. The university has been classy, just
supporting me throughout this entire thing. There's no way that I would have
been able to accomplish the things that I have academically, athletically,
build the relationships with my teammates. It's been one of the best decisions
of my life, not one of the easiest, but definitely one of the best.  
  
I'm really going to miss my teammates, just the people that I see every day.
You know, my coaches, some of the staff, I've really built a family there. So
it's going to be difficult saying good-bye.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Yeah, this team is my family. I wouldn't be here without them.
You know, it's hard now 'cause we lost.  
  
I've made sisters for life, you know. This girl right here will be in my life
forever. That's the most important thing, is the relationships.  
  
If that's what I leave with, I'm happy about that.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned about Mississippi State peaking at this time.
Did you gather that from film, especially for McCowan? She showed flashes of
it all season, but tonight it seemed like she raised her level.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: When you can do what Vic Schaefer did going into the NCAA
tournament, put four starters down, you got your team. They have responded.
The starters have played great. The subs have come in and did not do anything
but what they were doing when they were starters.  
  
Now you've got a team that's really, really deep. Look at the quarters. It's
20-9, 25-9. Those lineups...  
  
I think he knows his team as well as any coach right now in the country, to be
able to push that button, take that type of a risk.  
  
The way they played in their home pod, yeah, absolutely you saw it coming. We
were wondering all week whether or not the week off would have been, did they
change. When I saw the other lineup, the normal lineup they'd been using, I
thought they've just been getting better all week.  
  
I thought they played outstanding.  
  
Q. Mike, you watched these two come up. You did some special things. Can
you reflect at all, say what it's meant to you, what this ride has been
like.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I wouldn't be a basketball coach without these two kids,
period. I'd be probably back working at Blockbuster Video, if they still have
them, Netflix, something.  
  
You know, they believed in what we had started talking about when I was an
assistant coach. They believed all the way through and built. Taught me way
more about coaching than I've taught them about basketball. There's a lot of
nights I won't sleep because I feel like I've let them down.  
  
I'm going to be coaching a lot longer. You know, I've been coaching for 20
years, I'll still be talking about these guys. Haven't coached a game without
them. I don't know how you do.  
  
But they've made me so much better. They've said things to me I don't think
most players would feel comfortable saying to some coaches, but I listened.
I'll owe them any longevity that I have in this game, to these two guys, Katie
and Heather.  
  
Q. Coach, this particular season, was it a home game, a road game that
you saw in their eyes, not just in the staff's, or practice, that the team was
headed in the right direction? If it all came together, something special
might happen?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I think it was on the road at Notre Dame. We got punched in
the mouth in the first quarter. They stuck together. It was relatively early
in the year. It was in the pre-season NIT. We had a lot of returning pieces.
We had a lot of new pieces, too.  
  
To see our returning pieces get our new pieces set, that's when I knew we had
something special. I think we've got six losses, and they're to teams that are
all in this tournament. Unless Ohio State beat Notre Dame? Notre Dame won.
Every team we've lost to is still in this tournament. That's pretty good.  
  
We had 29 winners. We're not a result's-driven team. But to hear these guys
say the words, to talk about their teammates. These guys have -- Kelsey has
had a microphone and camera pointed in her face all year long. Chantel has,
too.  
  
They've missed some jump shots, turned the ball over some. But they have not
missed a question posed to them. They haven't put anything negative on social
media. All they've done is continued to help build the University of
Washington and their teammates up.  
  
I think that's their greatest accomplishment. The 98 wins, we'll all remember.
We'll probably have reunions for a long time with a group. Again, I challenged
them not to look at this on a timeline, like we all do now that we all have
Twitter and social media. We look at our timelines.  
  
If you look at a collective group of first-round NCAA tournament, a Sweet 16,
a Final Four. You don't put what years those are, it's a hell of a career.  
  
When you go to a place that hasn't been doing any of that when they called you
and offered you a scholarship, none of that, it wasn't even a consideration.
And to leave with those expectations, the standards in that locker room that
are so high, it should be written about for years and years and years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 97, Louisville - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor. Coach, opening statement tonight?  
  
COACH MULKEY: No.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I tried. We'll go for questions for coach and student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, this looked like your kind of game, up and down, able to get
out in the open floor. How much fun was this for you tonight?  
NINA DAVIS: I mean, it was a lot of fun. We came out and got off to a quick
start, which is something we needed to do, something we've been focusing on.
We were getting out running, everybody was getting out on the fast breaks.
They were feeding me the ball. We like to push the ball and play up-tempo.  
  
Q. Nina, Jeff was in here talking about how efficient your game was
tonight, in particular the way you were able to play off of the two big
players in there. Talk about, was it a case of you were able to sort of pick
your spots in there tonight?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure. Coming into the game, we know they focus a lot on our
bigger-sized players. They try to double them. I try to release the pressure,
get into the open spots, cut to the basket when they're doubling them, just
try to make it as easy as possible.  
  
Q. Beatrice, earlier in the week it was said that in the game of
basketball you don't really know what to expect. Did you expect that kind of
game for you today?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: No. I just expected a tough game, going out there,
rebounding, helping my team, doing whatever I could do to help my team.  
  
Q. Kalani, y'all outscored them in the paint. What did you like about
your interior defense today?  
KALANI BROWN: We just took what the defense gave us. I was able to get some
passes to Nina. Nina was wide open. If they're collapsing on us, we just go to
the next option. I think that's what we did. Guarded shots, opened up the
paint a little bit so we could score.  
  
We offensive rebounded, got put-backs. Just did the dirty work today. It was
split between all posts. We all did well.  
  
Q. Kalani, in the first game, Teaira McCowan had 26 points. She's about
6'7 ". Talk about on Sunday you'll be facing another player your size, what
you will need to do to combat Mississippi State's inside game?  
KALANI BROWN: I've actually played her before, on the AAU circuit. She's a
big, strong post. If you let her bury you or get you deep, she'll punish you
in there.  
  
I've got to be smart on defense, keep my hands high, meet her, run the floor.
Just do what we've been doing, play our game. Also stay out of foul trouble,
as well.  
  
Q. Kim, it looked like you guys did a good job against Asia during the
first half. She got going a little bit in the second half. What did you do
during the first half to hold her down?  
COACH MULKEY: We hedged somewhat on the screens. I didn't think that they did
a lot of handoffs that we expected, that we've seen them on film do. Maybe
that's because we played good defense.  
  
I thought that every shot she took early was a contested shot. We didn't foul
her on any perimeter shots. I thought that every shot she took, I just wanted
a Baylor player to make it difficult.  
  
I think she got five points there at the end on some kids that don't get
significant minutes for us. Guys were on a roll. Just playing good basketball.  
  
As I said before the game, yeah, you should talk about our post players, but
you better not forget about those perimeter players. Those kids get
overlooked. They're hitting big-time shots. They're shooting unbelievable from
the three. It's because of the big guys that they're able to get those open
looks.  
  
Q. Kim, Nina has had to take a lot of different roles for you in the
four years. She's done that pretty selflessly. Not necessarily all players
would be able to do that. Talk about the attitude and everything that she's
brought.  
COACH MULKEY: Sure.  
  
Unfortunately, All-American teams are picked by people who never see kids
play. They might see them occasionally on TV.  
  
Nina Davis didn't have help around her for two years that she made all these
All-American teams. She had to do it every night. She had to take all the
shots. She had to get all the rebounds, play all the minutes.  
  
She just kept stopping at an Elite 8. Like all good programs, we wanted to get
help around her, to relieve some of that pressure.  
  
She's handled it like a trooper. She wants to get to a Final Four before her
career is over. You're right, selfish, huh? Parents that you see on TV today,
selfish players that you see on TV today. They want everything today.  
  
Yeah, well, this kid, all she wants today is a Final Four and a chance at a
national championship. Send me those kind of kids and I'll coach 'em anytime.  
  
Q. Kim, sort of a first impression of going against Mississippi State
with what you've seen of them.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Teaira McCowan, guys, lives in our backyard. Watched her
grow up. She's in the same class as these two kids.  
  
Unfortunately, you have to make decisions in recruiting. I'm proud and happy
for her because I've watched a young lady grow up really right before my eyes,
from the time she was a seventh grader.  
  
I'm familiar with Vic and his style of defense, because he was at A&M for so
many years with Gary Blair, and that's kind of what they did. They play in a
conference where they've seen the bigs before in South Carolina. They're big
themselves.  
  
It's going to make for a great Elite 8 game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations to you and the young ladies.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Get a little rest, and we'll see you tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Jeff Walz from Louisville. Welcome
and congratulations on a great season. Your thoughts on the tournament?  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you very much. First off, just want to thank everyone
involved here in the Oklahoma City region. We've had wonderful hospitality.
Everything has been first class, and very, very much appreciate that, and I
know our players are enjoying it so far.  
  
We're looking forward to a great basketball game tomorrow night. I think the
game before us is going to be fantastic, also. I think everyone that comes out
to watch this renal on is going to enjoy some very good basketball and have
the opportunity to see some great players. So we're just excited to be here
and looking forward to the opportunity to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. This has been set up as a battle as you guys having really strong
perimeter players and Baylor having a really good post game. Is that the case
or are there more nuances?  
JEFF WALZ: I think when you look at them on tape, they are very deep in post
play but they also have some very talented guards. So I think it's going to be
a basketball game where, you know, we're going to have to do a good job on
scouting report defense. We're going to have to try to make some players that
possibly don't score a bunch for them, score, and limit the ones that have
been their leading scorers.  
  
But the teams that, you know, allow them to just throw it down and low block
and score often have problems. So, you know, we're going to try to not allow
that to happen. But that's not an easy task.  
  
Q. You coached Lauren Cox and Beatrice Mompremier with USA Basketball.
How have you seen their games grow this season?  
JEFF WALZ: Both of them were a joy to work with. Just two great kids. They
worked extremely hard.  
  
You know, Bea has done a really nice job of developing her eight- to ten-foot
jumpshot. Very active around the glass. She's done a very, very good job for
them.  
  
Lauren, she's done great things all throughout her high school career, USA
Basketball. So it really has not surprise me to see her playing as well as she
is.  
  
Q. When you had the back-to-back losses against N.C. State, which was a
tough loss, real close loss, and then the one to Notre Dame, that could have
been a time when the kids lost their confidence but seemed like that didn't
happen. Can you talk about how you came back from that?  
JEFF WALZ: For us, we go into that N.C. State game and find out the day
before, Myisha is not going to play because she injured her knee at our talent
show that we have for our athletic department. She didn't show much talent at
the talent show in order to get injured. So she missed that ballgame.  
  
And then we turn right back around and go up and play on Big Monday at Notre
Dame, and she played a minute in that game, and then Briahanna Jackson goes
for about three and a half, four minutes and has to come out with back spasms.
We weren't really concerned about it, knowing we were playing without our
leading scorer. Briahanna brings so much to our team defensively. It's one of
those, you take it with a grain of salt and you move forward and I thought our
players did a very good job of that.  
  
Q. The 2013 game here against Baylor, what do you remember from the game
and what do you take away from it?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we scored one more point. You know, it's what it all comes
down to. And I said it, you know, four years ago: You have to be able to score
against Baylor. You know, everybody talked about, what this great job we did
defensively and all this. I think we gave up 81 points in that game, and they
averaged 81 points.  
  
So the way I look at it, and I said it four years ago: Our defense was
average, but we scored the most points anybody has ever scored against them
during the Brittany Griner era. So you have to figure out a way to put points
on the board and that's the same way with this ballclub right now. They have
so much size inside. Their guards are very good. Kristy Wallace does a
fantastic job of leading that team; that we are going to have to figure out a
way to score.  
  
I don't expect it to be a 61-58 basketball game.  
  
Q. I know the personnel is different and four years is almost a
lifetime, but does it make it sort of similar in that fact, them having the
dominant center, and you guys needing to score, does it make it similar in
terms of game plan and just the fact that your kids have been shooting the
ball pretty well in the first two rounds, kind of give you a lot of optimism
about that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we are not going to come out with the same approach that we
had four years ago. Our goal four years ago was to take 40 threes. We are not
going to look to do that right now. We have a very strong inside game, mid-
range game. Myisha Hines-Allen, Kylee Shook, Ciera Johnson; we have some kids
that can score on the low block, where four years ago, that really wasn't our
strength.  
  
You know, when you've got Antonita Slaughter, Shoni Schimmel, Jude Schimmel,
we had kids that could shoot the ball from the outside; Sara Hammond, that
could do it very well. So we went with what our strength was at that point in
time.  
  
Now, would we look to shoot it? Of course. But I wouldn't anticipate us to
take 30 to 35 threes; but we might.  
  
Q. You talked about Briahanna being out and what she brings. How much
growth have you seen in Mariya and Asia with BJ being out and their added
ball-handling responsibilities a lot while she couldn't play?  
JEFF WALZ: Asia has done a great job. She's really grown throughout this
entire year. You know, going back to her freshman year, she was really just
trying to deal with her off-season surgery that she had. She wasn't 100
percent. She was fine physically.  
  
Mentally, was her challenge. It was the first injury that she had really had
throughout her career, and it took her awhile. And now, she's finally back
playing like the kid that we had recruited out of high school. She's
confident; she's playing loose; she's playing free; she's making her teammates
better.  
  
When BJ went out, we just had to slide her over to the point guard spot and
she's handled those responsibilities well. I think the most impressive thing
to me has been how she's defending this entire season. That's one thing I told
her all last year: We didn't recruit her to guard people. And actually, she's
turned into one of our better perimeter defenders because she worked at it.  
  
And then Mariya, you know, she's shot the ball very well the past -- the first
two rounds, which is something we have to have. She's got to be able to knock
down open shots when she's open. I was excited for her; that she had been
struggling there for awhile come before the tournament started. But now she's
playing with some confidence. She passes the.  
  
Ball as well as any player that I've coached in my 22 years. Her court
awareness, her court vision, is the best of any player that I've coached. If
she will continue to work on her ball handling, where she gets more confident
with her ability to see the floor, and then her ability to shoot it, it makes
her an all-around player.  
  
Q. Last weekend, you said the past NCAA Tournament games you had, they
were bad. Why do you characterize them like that, and do you have more
confidence in this year's team to avoid playing those bad games?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I don't think said that the team had played bad -- Mariya, we
had talked about, she had struggled in her past NCAA Tournament games coming
up to this year. But she's really been playing well right now. She's shooting
the ball with confidence. And it's not just the shooting. She had nine
rebounds on Monday night. She passed the ball extremely well. She's back to
playing like we had seen her play for three regular seasons. So I'm really
excited for her.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that. Do you see this year's team as having any
similarities to any of the past teams who have gone on to the championship?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we have a group of kids right now that believe in what we're
doing, which is something that we've talked to them about, you know, this past
month, this past two months. The teams that we've had here that have had great
success, would buy into whatever we told them as a coaching staff.  
  
You know that, team in '13, we truly believed that we could beat Baylor, and
the kids came into that game with the belief and confidence. Now, no one else
out there thought we could.  
  
Then in 2009, everybody was like, who's this? And it's a group of kids that I
remember, we get sent down to LSU to play, and Western Kentucky had an open
spot, and they were hosting the first and second rounds; and we get shipped
all the way to LSU to play. I told the kids, I'm like, hey, if you get us past
the first two rounds, we'll get to the Final Four.  
  
And they all were like, okay. And they just believed in what we did. I'll
never forget Des Byrd, our starting point guard in 2009 after we beat LSU in
the second round, we are in the locker room celebrating, and she's like, "I
guess we're going to the Final Four, right?"  
  
I said, "Yeah. We sure are." And it's not what we do as coaches, because we
can't play. I've never made a shot. I've made one in my college career myself.
So it's not like I made a bunch of them.  
  
But the players having to out and execute, but it's our job to get them to
believe in what we're doing. And that's something that the teams that we've
had here in the past that have had great success, they believed in it and then
went out and did everything they could to execute it. That's one thing right
now, I think we are in a good place. They are excited.  
  
You know, we beat a Tennessee team on Monday night that very possibly could
have two of the Top-10 draft picks if the kids come out early on it; a team
that beat two No. 1 seeds, two No. 2 seeds. I mean, a really good basketball
team. We know that. And now we know we have a ballclub that we have to play
tomorrow night that has unbelievable talent, unbelievable depth.  
  
They are well coached and we are going to have to figure out a way to come out
here for 40 minutes and execute it and believe in what we're doing, and also
be able to withstand some runs. There's no doubt. I mean, this is a team that
can put up some points in a hurry. You can't be sloppy with the basketball.
We've talked to our players about that. I've told them, I said, if you're
going to turn the ball over, throw it up into the eighth row.  
  
So at least we can get set back up on defense and then make them score over us
instead of going by us.  
  
Q. Asia, Coach Walz was in here and talking about your commitment and
improvement on defense this year. How do you see yourself having developed in
that this season?  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think it starts from when I went home in May. Me and my
trainer spent so much time in that. Every single day, we worked on that. Just
to see it paying off now, I mean, it means a lot, because Coach Walz, he never
doubted me, as well, and neither did my teammates, as well. It's just trusting
the process.  
  
Q. You came in a little before Asia obviously. There's a lot of history
with this team in this city against Baylor. Cortnee Walton, the only
connection on the team left from that team that made the national title game
run in 2013. Have you looked to her, given that she's been in this situation
before against the same team in the same city?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, we always look to Cortnee for advice. It doesn't
matter who we are playing, we always look to her for advice because she's a
leader on this team. She's been through a lot, not -- like on the court and
off the court. So we always look to her for advice, whether it's basketball-
related or not. We've also talked to her about the Baylor game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you had to ask your own question, what would you ask?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Asia Durr, this one's for you. What would you do if
Russell Westbrook came to our game?  
  
ASIA DURR: Honestly, I know his favorite songs, and we would turn up to it.
Like 'Now I Do What I Want,' that is our song, and I think we could jam that.
But I would lose my mind if he came because he's a beast and I bet he's a
great person, as well. I hope he comes tomorrow. Hopefully they don't have a
game.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I don't think they do.  
  
ASIA DURR: That would be awesome.  
  
I think it's fair to ask the same question. Since you were talking about it on
the bus yesterday, how would you feel?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I would be really happy. You know, Kevin Durant came to
the game when Louisville beat Baylor last time, so why not get Russell
Westbrook there and help us repeat history.  
  
ASIA DURR: Well, I think that's fair to say. (Laughter) you never know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow night.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season, and your thoughts about the
tournament.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you very much. I'm awfully proud of my team and excited
about the opportunity to be here in Oklahoma City at the Sweet 16, and
certainly we have a big test in front of us, but this time of year,
everybody's really good.  
  
You know, I'm excited about my group. I think we're playing well. We had a
great weekend in Starkville, tremendous atmosphere for our two ballgames.
Played two really good opponents, and so we know that coming in, we've really
got to deal with a well-coached Washington team. I've known Mike a long time.
We go way back to our Arkansas days when we coached back there in '97 to 2003.
He does a tremendous job. He's one of the great coaches in our country. I have
to throw in, he's one of the great young coaches, as well, because he's ten
years younger than me.  
  
But doing a great job and obviously they have got Kelsey Plum who is the all-
time leading scorer in the history of our great game. She's got pieces around
her that I think really makes them unique and special. He does a lot of things
with them. I compare it to playing like against James Harden in the NBA. They
run a lot of stuff that the Rockets run. They spread the floor. They play off
of her. She's smart enough to find who is open, and those kids can make shots.  
  
And so you watch the other night against a really good Oklahoma team, another
well-coached team, and I mean, they just really played well, scored over a
hundred points and everything ran off of Kelsey. But it was a lot like
watching the Houston Rockets play, in my mind. And I'm a Rocket fan, so it's
easy for me to compare, being a Houston boy.  
  
So it's easier for me to compare them, and that's a tall task, as everybody in
the big league has found out. But really just excited again about the
opportunity. So proud of our program, where we are today and where we were
five years ago. Proud of my fan base. I expect a big crowd from Mississippi
State coming here to watch us play.  
  
And again, I've got great kids, hard-working, determined, and obviously our
league has prepared us for this moment. So I know I'm on a ramble. But you
know, when you come from my league and you play the rival; we play 16 rival
games every month, for two months straight, and when you do that, it prepares
you for this moment.  
  
Q. Your guards, NCAA Tournaments you need great guard play, and it seems
like they really have come together especially of late. So what's been your
impression of them? And secondly, I know you hired Dionnah a couple years ago
to coach that position. How has she impacted what they do?  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, our guards have been really special all year. I
think in our level, our league, you win with great guard play and certainly we
are blessed with a couple of aircraft carriers down low that don't hurt you.
Guard play has always been kind of our bread and butter, our base of
everything we do, especially from a pressure, defensive standpoint. And so
we've got tremendous depth at guard, too, at every position, and three at one.  
  
So that's probably where it starts for us. And those kids are playing well
right now, especially offensively. I think that's what everybody is seeing
right now is that we've got some kids making shots, and that's what's been fun
from an offensive standpoint with our group.  
  
As far as Dionnah goes, as is my entire staff, I feel like I have the best
staff in the country. I mean, Johnnie Harris has been with me since day one
when we came to Mississippi State five years ago. And she's been so
instrumental. She's got to be one of the top five assistance in the country.  
  
Just going off of what's happened in the past five years, where we were, where
we are today, and how important she is to our program and how many things she
does for our program. And again she's in charge of our post players and
everybody wants to talk about how improved our post game is. Dionnah was a
home run, as well.  
  
What she's done with our point guards with Jazz and Morgan, that's her
position that she handles, and she's done a tremendous job with those two,
bringing them along. I think everybody knew, Morgan's pretty special. I think
she's had a break out season and really taken her game to another level, as
far as the points she's averaged.  
  
But I think Jazz has come on late, and that's been a project throughout the
course of the year. She's just a sophomore, but Dionnah spent some tireless
days with her just talking to her about the mental piece as well as the
physical piece. That's what a good coach will do. These post players, for
instance, you drag people up and down the floor, you do the dirty work, you
get the rebounds and you sprint the floor and Europe and the guard doesn't
give you the ball. Well, that's mentally hard on some people. Same thing with
point guards. They get the blame for everything.  
  
I think she's done a tremendous job with Morgan and Jazz from a coaching
standpoint of bringing those kids along. She's a tireless worker. Works hard
in recruiting. I mean, she's a great coach. It was a home run, as my entire
staff has been.  
  
Q. Your memories of Dionnah in the early days; she was kind of quiet as
a player and didn't say a whole lot. Curious how she's matured and progressed
as a coach now?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I'll answer the second one first. She's very real, and I
love that about her. She speaks her mind and she has so many good things to
say. I've walked out of team meetings with her before, patting her on the back
going, "Hey, that was a great comment; our kids needed to hear that."  
  
And so I'm going to guess, from that standpoint, I didn't know her from that
side as a player, but you know, maybe that's why she's so good with my point
guards because really both my point guards are quiet and that's a bad position
to be quiet at.  
  
Maybe she's seen and heard from her own experiences, maybe from Coach Coale
for four years, you have to speak up and you have to have a presence about you
and run the team and maybe that's an evolution for her where she is today in
her coaching career. She's not quiet any more, and that's a good thing.  
  
The first question? She reminds me all the time how she dominated us for three
years. And I told her, the first two years didn't count because we weren't
very good at A&M and a lot of people dominated us. I think we got her one time
her senior year, if I'm not mistaken, and I tend to want to talk about that
game more than the other six she probably beat us.  
  
She was a heck of a player, competitor. Big, strong, physical point guard,
hard to deal with, hard to handle. Whenever I get my head down a little bit,
she reminds me of how miserable she was as a point guard at Oklahoma when we
played her with our defense. She remembers those days and again, I think as a
competitor, she brings that to the table as a coach. And that's what I like
about her. I call it that bulldog mentality which happens to fit well with
Mississippi State.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's experience?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I believe the good Lord helps you go through some things to help
prepare you for the next opportunity. Certainly last year at this time, wasn't
the best. But at the same time, I think our kids not only learned from that
experience for this game, but I think they learned from it the entire season.
I think it's obviously prepared us.  
  
Again, you live in my league, you live with live with dealing with the players
we deal with, night-in, night-out, the coaches, so many Hall of Fame coaches.
But certainly this time last year what we had to deal with, going to
Connecticut to play, I don't think anything can help get you ready for this
opportunity.  
  
Q. In your experience of coaching, have you ever seen any kind of
comparison, the comparison game is overplayed, but comparisons to Kelsey, how
she plays --  
VIC SCHAEFER: Actually, I had to go against Jackie Stiles three times at
Arkansas. So I've got experience dealing with both of the latest two all-time
leading scorers. We had a couple bad experiences with her and one good one.
I'm hoping tomorrow in my only opportunity with her, we have a good one.  
  
Again, I think I deal with some pretty good ones throughout the course of our
season and throughout my career in 32 years. Obviously Jackie Stiles, Kelsey
Plum, those are two of the best to ever play the game, and from an offensive
standpoint, they are just so multi-dimensional. Their coaches use them in such
a good way, smart, and so it's a tall task. There's no question about it. But
to answer your question, I have some experience with that, yes, sir.  
  
Q. A lot's been made of the starting lineup, but how much do you feel
like the two-week break helped reset the game and get them focused and
starting a new season with the tournament?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I think the two weeks certainly gave us an opportunity.
One, I gave the kids two days off, which we desperately needed, and even the
third day, all we did was shoot. We didn't do anything else. I think that kind
of rejuvenated us a little bit.  
  
Then it also gave me a chance to work on some different things and some
different combinations. Again, Robby, a lot's been made of it. But the bottom
line is, those kids that made an impact starting have been making an impact
coming off the bench all year. They have made big shots all year long. They
just did it earlier in the game instead of later in the game, and that's
really how we look at it.  
  
Who is out there when we are jumping center, I don't think bothers any of our
kids. I think they just want to win. And I give them a lot of credit for being
that way, being unselfish, and just wanting what's best for our team. So the
two-week period, while I'm not a fan of it, I don't like it; but in this
situation, in this circumstance, it probably worked out best for Mississippi
State, no doubt about it.  
  
Q. A couple of Washington's players jump off the page with their
statistics. How good is the supporting cast?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, the whole team is good. Tremendous -- I think they are a
tremendous basketball team obviously. They play in a great league also out in
the Pac-12, but their supporting cast, they know their roles and they execute
it very well. Mike puts them in a position where they can do what they do
best. And that's all we as coaches -- that's our job, to put our kids in the
best spot possible and the best place possible where they can be successful.  
  
And I think that's what Mike's done with this team. So those guys can all
shoot it. Romeo, they can all shoot it. They have got kids that can do a
number of different things and hurt you in different ways, and he puts them in
the right spot to do it.  
  
So the challenge for us is in a three-day period, try to figure it out and be
prepared to deal with it. You know, again, I think my staff's done a
tremendous job of getting us ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We appreciate your comments and good luck.
See you tomorrow.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: First question for our student athletes.  
  
Q. I don't know if Dominique, Blair, both or either of you want to
answer this, but Dionnah's role in coaching you guards, but what have you seen
as the biggest impact on that position and what you guys do?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: She keeps us disciplined, and she expects a lot out of us, and
she doesn't accept anything short of perfection. We work on a lot of ball
handling and just getting shots off of plays and she's really good about
footwork and making sure we rub shoulders with screens and just the smallest
things.  
  
So I feel like her coming in and just focusing on little things makes a
difference in the long run.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I agree with Blair. She doesn't let us cut corners and
she expects a lot for us and I don't think she let's us make excuses for
anything. She holds us accountable, and I think she's a great leader for our
program. She's a lot -- she brings a lot to the table and it's awesome
learning from her.  
  
Q. This question is really for all of you. This is your second Sweet 16.
What are some things you took away from last year that have prepared you for
this time around?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Last year, you know, we lost in the Sweet 16. We were very
excited just to get there because it was like our first time.  
  
But this year, I feel like we expect more. We're coming into the Sweet 16 and
I feel like we can go further than the Sweet 16. We are happy that we're here,
but we want to go further.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Just like she said, we're happy to be here but we expect
to go further. So it's just another game for us, and we are just ready to play
and we are focused in practice and we just want to get better and keep
competing.  
  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: This year, I think marks a milestone for our team and what a
veteran team is supposed to do and I feel like every year, you're supposed to
build on what you've done the previous years.  
  
I just feel like with the players we have on our team, we're getting the job
done and focusing on one game at a time and we need to continue to do that to
reach our goal which is to get to the Final Four this year.  
  
Q. Dominique, a lot of people are talking about Kelsey Plum and what
she's able to do offensively. Obviously much more than just a scorer. What
makes her so good, I guess? What makes her so difficult to defend in your
eyes?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: She is really versatile. She can spot up two (ph), she
can shoot off the dribble, she can get all the way to the rim. And I think one
of the things that sets her apart is she loves to get the ball to her
teammates.  
  
A lot of times she beats her defender and she gets to pass it to one of her
teammates and they knock down a three. So I think that's what really makes her
dangerous is she can set up her teammates for shots, and she also rebounds.  
  
Q. For one of your teammates, this is a bit of a homecoming with Ros
Johnson starting her career at Oklahoma State. How do you see her progressing
as she becomes a senior?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Ro has brought a lot of offense to our team. She's a
great player overall: She can shoot, she can get to the rim; she can do
everything. As I see her career progressing, I see her becoming an even better
defensive player. She's a pretty good defensive player right now, so I think
move on to next year, I see her becoming the lock down defender for our team
and her role just expanding.  
  
Q. Blair, I know Washington, kind of Plum-centric, I think your dad
compared him to James Harden and the Houston Rockets, but you guys, it can be
anyone on any given night and depth is what does it for you. How do the teams
contrast the differences of style and how does it affect the game when they
run into each other?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I just think that it makes both teams focus more. It's all
about your mindset going into the game. I feel like you have to adapt,
depending on what each team brings, and Washington brings Plum, who obviously
can do everything, and Osahor, who is a great three-point shooter but she is
also a post and leading rebounder in the country. So I feel like we have to do
our job on trying to stop those two or limiting their touches.  
  
But with them, I feel like it's a difficulty for them because they don't know
who is going to go off on our team because we're so deep. They don't know who
is going to have the game that's just setting other people up. They don't know
-- they just don't know what their role is going to be. They don't know who on
our team is going to shoot. They don't know who is going to drive. Because I
feel like we have such a versatile team who can do a bunch of things, and it's
hard to get teams who are really prepared for us, because I feel like we're
just so versatile, I guess.  
  
Q. More so than the lineup changes, do you feel like the two-week break
was a big deal for you guys to get a chance to kind of reset and kind of
refocus on the tournament?  
BLAIR SCHAEFER: I do. I feel like we had a lot of things we need to work on.
Sometimes when you play so many games, you lose some of your habits that
you've worked on all year, so we had to reestablish those habits, defensively
and offensively, but we also had to focus on scoring.  
  
I feel like we kind of got into this period where we weren't scoring as much,
or it was just because of the small things not rubbing off on screens, not
setting your team up -- teammates up right, or not communicating. Just small
things that we had to fix in practice, and it's showing that when you pay
attention to the small things, the big picture on offense and defense comes
together better.  
  
So I do feel like the two-week period really helped us look ourselves in the
mirror and figure out what wasn't going right and what was going right and I
feel like we have adapted really well.  
  
Q. How many cowbells can we expect to hear tomorrow night?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I don't think out here, cowbells, they are not allowed in
the arena. If they were allowed, I'm pretty sure we would hear a lot. You'll
probably hear a lot of our fans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow night and we'll see you after the game.

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on a great season and your thoughts on a great
tournament.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Our kids are fired up to be here. I hope our diehard Seattle
Sonics fans will forgive us for going to the Thunder game last night, but we
had a great time getting here. Kid are settled in and we're ready for
practice.  
  
Q. What did Kelsey have naturally when you first got a hold of her, and
what did she have to work on to enhance her game over the years?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She had and has an ability to stay singularly focused better
than any human being I've ever been around: Not kid, not player, not
Millennial; anybody I've ever met, any businessman, anybody. She has a
singular focus to strive for excellence.  
  
She is not the kid that walked out of the airport and walked out in the
Thunder became last night and was immediately recognized as a basketball
player. She could be a lot of different things. So that focus is what makes
her special.  
  
I don't know that there's anything that I've tried to get her to work on other
than just enjoy the moments a little bit along the way. That's my constant
strife with her because she is so dedicated to the process that sometimes she
for gets to stop and look around and enjoy things like this, and that's all
I've tried to help her with. Put her in great situations, challenge her.  
  
From the recruiting process all the way up, she wanted to do something that
was hard. She didn't want to take the easy way out; thus, choosing a program
that had not been to the NCAA Tournament for a number of years and did not
have a built-in guarantee of success. She wanted to do something that was
hard.  
  
Tried to make it challenging for her, from naming her captain as a freshman,
to counting on her to be a focal point of our offense, redesigning a lot of
our offense around her and the rest of the players that are on our roster. And
she's handled it like no other person I've ever been around.  
  
Q. UCONN's dominance in recent years, people say it's been good for the
women's game, a lot of spotlight for women's basketball. Is it starting to be
a negative? Everybody's playing for second. Do we need more parity in the
game? Do we need somebody to win the national title besides Connecticut?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I don't think so. I think what they have done is the reason
that you're starting to see some parity -- maybe not winning it. We had three
unique teams last year in the Final Four, us being one of them, Oregon State
and Syracuse. Those were three new teams, and I know for a fact that we use
what UCONN does as a model: The way they approach the game; the way they
prepare.  
  
He's got great players, but they also out-work a lot of people. He gets great
talent to work hard, and that's why the combination is so unbeatable right
now, is they have both of them going. I think a lot of us are getting there. I
think now kids see that it can't just be talent and it can't just be hard
work. It's got to be a combination of those two teams.  
  
And I think you have seen, you've got more teams talked about this year. I
think it's great. I think we should all embrace it, and if we spend one second
worry about it being negative, then we are just adding to that argument that
it is, and I don't believe that it is a negative.  
  
I think it's great for our sport. I think it's brought a lot of attention, and
anybody that wants to dismiss it, I just don't think's paying enough
attention.  
  
Q. Sorry to take you back to Kelsey. A know a lot's been written about
her success story the last few years. Is there an underrated part of her story
that people are missing along the way, do you think?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Just that she is a great teammate. I think -- I've been there
every step of the way with her. She has not missed one interview question. She
has not put one negative thing on social media. She has not provided bulletin
board locker room material for an opponent. She's humble.  
  
And the records, she only wanted the records to occur if we were winning and
our program was winning and our team was winning. And that's genuine. There's
not one ounce of fakeness in her. She is very genuine. And I think a lot of
times when you are chasing records and you are under the spotlight, that can
get undervalued, but she is a tremendous teammate. And has been, you know, a
star in her role since the second she stepped on our campus.  
  
Q. In that sense, has her personality changed much?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: A little. I think initially, she's always been a chip-on-her-
shoulder-type kid. Didn't make some teams she wanted to make. She wasn't as
highly regarded maybe coming out of high school. She's always found something
to have a chip on her shoulder about, and I think that's driven her.  
  
I think over time that chip has gone away to just now be: Strive for
excellence. Don't worry about outcomes. Focus still on that process, and the
results are going to take care of themselves. I have seen that change. She's a
happy kid.  
  
She's really, really become a role model off the court, as well, very giving
of her time. She stays well after our normal autograph sessions at home. She
stays on the road to sign autographs. And I haven't seen her one time step out
of character when you've had plenty of opportunities to do it. She's missed
some free throws, she's missed some jumpshots, she's missed some layups, but
she has not missed one chance to take a selfie with a 10-year-old or an
80-year-old. She's really been given plenty of opportunities to do it, and she
has not.  
  
Q. A few minutes ago, Vic was comparing your offense and the way you use
your personnel to the Rockets, and James Harden, spreading the floor, kicking
out to shooters. Is that something that -- have you adopted your style from
other coaches, or is this a natural progression of what you have with your
personnel?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I obviously watch a lot of sports, any level, FIBA, college,
high school, and I'm constantly doodling plays. We picked stuff up from
Harden. There was social media, people that did a side-by-side comparison of
Harden and Kelsey. Obviously you start looking at some of those things.  
  
I used a lot of Stockton and Malone. Those were my two guys growing up. I
loved watching Stockton and Malone. Chantel is very Malone-ish and I think
Kelsey at times could be Stockton-ish.  
  
So we've got a few of our sets, actions, the way we space, from the Rockets
specifically. Also a lot from the Clippers. The best play we run I got from
the Portugal team in the FIBAs a few years ago, and you just kind of tinker
around with it in practice. Anybody that's been in our practice knows we like
to tinker a little bit and find things, and those do come from that area.  
  
He knows. Obviously Vic and I are very, very close friends and I spent three
days in Starkville last summer talking about offense, and so there's no
secrets. He knows exactly what we're going to do and not even what but how
we're going to do it.  
  
Q. How have you seen Collier and her game perhaps evolve and get to this
point at this season?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It started last summer, before last season even. She really
spent that summer, for the first time since she was diagnosed with leukemia,
and overcoming leukemia, had a full summer where she could work on her skill.
She was constantly working on conditioning and it really paid off for her this
last year, and this summer she just kept it going.  
  
And when we talk about people starring in their role, you know, she's done as
good a job at starring in her role as Chantel and Kelsey and Natalie and the
people that sometimes get a little bit more of the spotlight.  
  
But that's who she is. If you were there the day she was diagnosed with
leukemia, she was on an official visit to our school: She never cried. She was
just making a plan on how to beat it. How are we going to guard, ball screen
with her? It's not that big a deal when you've beaten cancer. I think she's
drawn from that. She inspires us every single day that she steps on the court
from coaches to players, everybody in our program.  
  
And I think, you know, this year, what you've seen is you have to guard her,
as well, because she's going to make 15-foot jumpshots. She's going to make
every lay-in that Chantel throws her, so she can score on top of the things
that she's been in in the past in screening and defense. She's continued to
add to her game just as much as the other players have.  
  
I've got great pictures of Vic if anybody needs them. He may have some of me,
too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Joined by Chantel Osahor and Kelsey Plum.  
  
Q. If you guys can just say, how has Katie maybe grown and matured over
the years, and especially this year? And I would ask Kelsey first and then
Chantel.  
KELSEY PLUM: Katie's just one of the big glue pieces to our team, and a lot of
the things she does doesn't necessarily come up necessarily in the box score
and stat sheet. She's a tough competitor. Her energy: The way she runs the
floor; the way she gets people open, setting screens, and then just in there
with Chantel battling on the board. Sometimes defensively she's got to guard a
guard, or she's got a different type of mismatch.  
  
But Katie, can't say enough about her resilience, her strength, and just her
positive attitude. She's always the first person to say, "Hey, I love you," or
"keep your head up," or stuff like that. She's been great.  
  
Katie and I are roommates, so that's somebody that I spend a lot of time with
outside of basketball, as well.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Katie is like the prime example of being a superstar in your
role. I know Neighbs is all into numbers, so if you ask him, I know like you
don't see them in the stat sheets, but her numbers for us are ridiculous. And
on the defensive side and on the offensive side, our efficiencies are great
because of her. So yeah, Katie is just, I'm glad I play beside her because
she's a rock for our team.  
  
Q. What came naturally for you? What have you had to work for versus
what came naturally in terms of your basketball skill? What would you tell
me?  
KELSEY PLUM: What came naturally is my competitiveness and what came
skillfully because I worked on it, everything else. I don't know, I guess I
just, I've grown up around sports. I've grown up playing in an atmosphere
where I've always been super competitive and stuff like that. But basketball,
I don't think it came supernatural to me. I was actually a volleyball player,
and my family, I grew up playing volleyball.  
  
When I made the transition to basketball, I had to work a lot at it. I think
maybe just being fearless. Being able to shoot the ball any place on the
floor, maybe that's natural, I don't know. But probably just my
competitiveness, I guess.  
  
Q. How old were you when you made that transition and why did you do so,
from volleyball to basketball?  
KELSEY PLUM: I stopped playing volleyball when I was a freshman in high school
and that was because the high school coach made me pick between the two. I
loved volleyball more -- sorry, basketball.  
  
I loved basketball a lot more and I decided to go for it. If it wasn't for
that, I don't know if I would be here because volleyball was something I was
really good at and I liked it, as well. So I don't know, everything happens
for a reason.  
  
Q. What do you see from Mississippi State's defense? They are one of the
top defensive units in the SEC. What have you seen from them in preparation?  
KELSEY PLUM: Coach Vic Schaefer is a defensive guru. Just watching on film,
their intensity and pressure they put on opponents, the way they play is very
apparent right from the start. They try to turn you over and try to make you
take bad shots. They force a lot of charges, and then just the rotations on
defense; they play together as a team and they are very deep.  
  
You know, subs come in and they play with that same type of high energy, and
they are physical, very athletic. It's going to be a very tough matchup.  
  
Q. Coach Schaefer compared you to James Harden and said your style of
offense is like the Houston Rockets. What do you think about being compared to
someone like James Harden?  
KELSEY PLUM: It's very cool. I think that that's happened a couple times this
year. Just can't say anything. I mean, he's playing like the MVP right now. So
to be compared to somebody like that is just an honor.  
  
Q. Your coach also mentioned that even when you guys will go on the
road, there will be people asking for your autographs, kids being there. When
did that first start happening, when the opponents, you would have the fans
come out and what has that experience been like as you've traveled to these
different sites?  
KELSEY PLUM: I think it started to get a little bit overwhelming the beginning
of this year. Just some of the exposure and the attention. But it's a good
problem to have I think.  
  
I think that I take it as, not necessarily a challenge, but if I can be
somebody that could be a role model and grow the game and have people watch
our games and stuff like that, I'm definitely willing to be an ambassador for
it and I take on that responsibility wholeheartedly.  
  
Q. All the scoring marks that you've reached this year, when the year
began, did you have any idea that you would be in contention for some of those
records? Did you have people telling you about it? And kind of talk, as you
got closer, sort of the pressure that comes with reaching those marks.  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, I knew that it was possible, but it wasn't something that I
was striving for. I was just trying to go out, be the best player I could for
my team and play basketball, because I love it and because it's fun.  
  
I think that towards those days and those games that I could possibly have
broken it or whatever the case may be; yeah, I would lie if I said that it
wasn't extremely stressful and kind of disheartening, because people expect
miracles.  
  
You know, it's tough, because it kind of took a love away from the game.
That's not why I play. I was just grateful for the support I've had from my
teammates. It's been unreal. There's no way any of this stuff happens if they
are not there and they don't have my back. I'm just glad that the weight is
off my chest and I can just play now, because we just want to win the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. If others compare you to James Harden, is there an NBA player that
you compare yourself to?  
KELSEY PLUM: My favorite player in the NBA right now is Steph, but I don't
compare myself to him. I don't think -- he's like a unicorn. I don't think you
compare yourself to that.  
  
Probably James. Just the similarities. We are both left-handed, the way we
create our own shot is very similar. I didn't realize it until some of the
tape I've been showed on just his game and the way he moves with the ball.
It's been interesting to see the comparisons. But I mean, I have to say James
I guess.  
  
Q. Did I read where you played against, was it Nate Robinson at some
point? Were there other guys that have NBA connection that is you've run with
at the gym and whatnot over the years?  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, UW has a great alumni, and this summer, I play a lot of
pick-up games with people: Nate, Jamal Crawford, Spencer Hawes, Markelle
Fultz, Tony Wroten, Isaiah Thomas. It's just been great, and they are so cool
and they are really down-to-earth. You would expect these superstars not to
give you the time of day, but they are certainly very gracious.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, would you like to make an opening statement?  
  
Okay. We'll go straight to questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. You've won a national title; it's been a few years. Connecticut has
been hogging them the last few years. How badly does the sport need somebody
else to win a national title, whether it's you, or somebody else?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't look at it UCONN's dominance and a win streak as a bad
thing, and the reason I don't is because I was a part of that when I played. I
didn't think it was a bad thing then.  
  
They are good; until somebody beats them, they are going to continue. I just
have such respect for what they have been able to do, because I do know how
difficult it is. And I do know some people don't agree with that, but I don't
think it's a bad thing for the sport. It's challenging for me as a coach and
for us as a program to win another National Championship, and that's been
Storrs, Connecticut for a long time.  
  
Q. It seems like both these teams, Louisville and you guys, are coming
into this matchup really hot. Both teams played really well in the first two
rounds. Can you give us your assessment of what you think of Louisville at
this point?  
KIM MULKEY: I think of Louisville as a team that -- they are good. They are
talented. They play in a great conference that has prepared them for
postseason play. I think Coach Walz has been in this stage many times and
he'll continue to build his team through the course of the year, which he did.  
  
If you're in the Sweet 16, obviously you must be playing well. And I just
think that they are really, really good, and I think it starts with Asia Durr.  
  
Q. How do you feel Alexis Jones has played since her return?  
KIM MULKEY: I think she's done well. She gave us 22 minutes the other night,
and she looked good to me. She missed some shots, but I think, you know, I
don't know if that had anything to do with her being off for a month, but she
just gives us a sense of security.  
  
Q. I know that you and Louisville have both been on this exact same page
a couple years back in 2013 and obviously the rosters have changed since then,
so it's not really going to be a rematch of sorts. But what do you think about
the history that both of you guys have playing in this round?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we've only played once in this round -- I'm sorry, twice,
when they had McCoughtry, and I think it was at N.C. State. So we've only
played twice. So we really don't have a lot of history.  
  
History to me is when you've played many, many, many, many years. We've been
unfortunate to be on the losing end of those two, but I don't know that we
have a history of playing each other.  
  
Q. With all the minutes that your freshmen played last weekend, how have
you seen their confidence grow over this last week?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think Lauren Cox and Natalie Chou are good, and they are
really surfacing now and showing their talents, and it's because they are
confident now. They have been through a whole season, and I really think those
two kids, they are playing well and they are going to see the floor, and
hopefully because they are playing well now, it makes us a better team.  
  
Q. I know the past is something coaches don't like to talk much about
but people are going to look at this matchup because it was such a monumental
upset in 2013. Do you just try to block that out?  
KIM MULKEY: It brings back memories to me just because I was involved in it.
I'm not sure -- well, Alexis Prince may be the only kid on our roster that was
here because she's a fifth-year senior. But the rest of the kids, heck, I
don't even know if they watch current basketball games.  
  
I'd have to go ask them what they were doing when we played that game. Some of
them may have watched it on television. Along with -- who was on my staff
then? Maybe two current staff members were a part of that. But we don't even
have the same media relations. I don't even have the same athletic director.
Don't even have the same president. I mean, there's probably three of us in
that locker room that member that.  
  
Q. Was there anything after, you always talk about getting something out
of losses and I know that was an incredibly painful loss. Was there anything
you got out of that, or that you carried with you after that, that loss?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I remember things about the game. I think any loss, it eats
on you and you think of things maybe you could have done better as a coach.
But the longer you're in the business, you're going to be upset. You're going
to upset people.  
  
You know, our first national -- actually, I would say the semifinals of our
first National Championship, we beat LSU. They were the best team in the
country. Had the best post player, the best player, the best point guard. So
the longer you're in the business, those things happen to you. You win some
you shouldn't and you lose some that you probably shouldn't.  
  
But you can't let them just kill your spirit. You can't let them run you out
of the business. You just motivate yourself, pick yourself back up and keep
coaching.  
  
Q. You mentioned Asia Durr. What stands out to you about her as a
player?  
KIM MULKEY: That I recruited her and didn't get her (laughs). She's a
phenomenal player. She can score from the perimeter. She can take you off the
dribble. She was not healthy last year. Now she's healthy, and you're seeing
the real Asia Durr, and she's just a handful to guard. They do a lot of things
with her and through her. She is the catalyst that makes them go.  
  
Q. Just can you maybe talk about where -- with this guard matchup, what
do you think are going to be the big keys, because there's so much talent at
guard for both of these teams.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'm not so sure, I'm not going to go inside. I think my
strength is my post. They have got to guard my bigs. I think that obviously
we've got our hands full with the three perimeter players for Louisville, and
yet on the other side, I think they may have their hands full guarding our
post.  
  
So it should be a great defensive ballgame. It should be a ballgame that fans
should enjoy seeing, because I think that you're going to see a lot of great
players at different positions on the floor for both teams.  
  
Q. Do you think that Louisville's perimeter game is going to be kind of
the decisive thing in this matchup, or is there something else that you think
you need to worry about when you're looking at them?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I hope my post game is the decisive thing. You're talking
about their strengths. I want to talk about our strengths.  
  
I think that I'm going to make you guard 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, but I don't want to
make you think that our guards aren't good. Our guards are good. I think
Alexis Prince is having a great senior year. I think that Alexis Jones is a
premiere guard in the country. I think Kristy Wallace is an international kid
that's played a lot of international basketball and has had two years prior
experience of losing in an Elite 8.  
  
You know, I think that if you look at stats, we lead the country in three-
point field goal percentage. We're not going to shoot as much as others across
the country, but we can shoot it if we need to shoot it.  
  
So I think we'll hold on out there, and I'm sure they think they are going to
hold their own inside. We'll all try to figure out ways to stop each other and
try to win a basketball game.  
  
Q. You've lost the Big 12 Championship game here, which I'm sure is a
disappointment. But was it a motivating factor in some ways for your kids? You
guys kind of plowed through those first two rounds. Do you think they were
energized or maybe refocused at all?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, what are we, I don't know, something-and-three. You
don't overplay it. I've always said the regular season of conferences are much
more important than conference tournaments. Unfortunately conference
tournament championships, you see on TV and you see the confetti fall but we
don't ever celebrate that when somebody wins a 16- or an 18-game season.  
  
So you don't overemphasize it, and sometimes you just acknowledge that the
opponent, gosh, they were just good. West Virginia came in here, and none of
us could beat them. You just withstand the Storm, you know. You don't let it
devastate you. I didn't feel like that we were any more motivated, more did I
feel like we were devastated. Just get back to work.  
  
The MODERATOR: Coach, good luck. We'll see you tomorrow evening.  
  
We have Alexis Jones, Kalani Brown and Nina Davis.  
  
Q. Looking at how well both teams have been playing coming into this
game, what do you think is really going to be the deciding factor?  
NINA DAVIS: Probably the team that turns over the ball less. Both teams are
great and both teams, we're kind of different in different ways. They have
three great perimeter players that we are going to have to try to slow down
and us, more so, we're going to take an inside, outside take, try to get the
inside going and try to get it to the outside. Both teams are coached by great
players and it's just going to come down to who wants it the most.  
  
Q. Kalani, what did you see from Lauren and Beatrice this last
weekend?  
KALANI BROWN: They stepped up big time. But it's nothing I didn't expect from
them. They are both great players and both do great things well: Beatrice
rebounding and doing great post moves; Lauren hitting outside shots. It's
nothing that I don't see every day and don't expect from them. They were just
given a chance and they executed.  
  
Q. Your past games in the tournament have been such huge margins of
victory. Do you think you are ready to have a closer game or do you think
you're on such a roll, it will be another blowout?  
ALEXIS JONES: I don't know if it will be a blowout, but I think we're ready
for this game. We've been preparing for this game, so I feel like we're going
to come out focused and ready to play.  
  
Q. Asia Durr is obviously going to be a really big perimeter threat for
Louisville. Have you talked about how to defend her?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely. We know she has deep range from the three, so we are
going to have to close out pretty far out. If you're left with a switch, just
move your feet, I guess. She's a very good player, strong left-handed guard,
so we are going to try to take that away from her. But she's a good all-around
guard.  
  
Q. This can be for Alexis. How did you see your help-side defense really
improve last weekend?  
ALEXIS JONES: I think it has improved. We lost against Texas and when we lost
against Texas, I think our help side improved a lot. I think our energy has
improved. I think a lot of players has grown since then and I think we are
just -- we became a better team and I think we are getting better and better
each and every game.  
  
Q. You have been pretty unmatched in the post all season in terms of
rebounding. Do you think that that has been the greatest strength that's
allowed you guys to win games so far, or has it been something else?  
KALANI BROWN: I think that has, and our defensive ability to stop people from
scoring, and it's very important to get offensive rebounds. I wouldn't say
out-matched, because Louisville, they may be not as big as us, but they are
just as aggressive.  
  
So I'm just going to have to bring that same aggressiveness when it comes to
rebounding. Nobody is just going to let you have it. So I'm just taking that
approach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Good luck tomorrow. We'll see you after the game.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 27, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Tyasha Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33304)

### [Kaela Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26929)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 71, Florida State 64  
  
DAWN STALEY: Just really thankful. God has been good to our program. He's been
good to me personally. And this wouldn't be possible without Him. And at the
same time, I'd like to thank the Florida State Seminoles, who are coached
well.  
  
And although we see the victory side of it, the defeat side of it is, some
seniors won't get to experience going to a Final Four and I do feel for them.
But at the same time, I'm happy for our players. I'm happy that they put
themselves in the position to go on and realize their dreams, as well.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your performance here in Stockton, your
confidence, just in terms of what you wanted to accomplish in terms of
bringing offense it the team, and do you think you succeeded doing that?  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. I think the biggest thing tonight was our defense, though.
We found ways to get stops. You know, I think we started the game off really
well.  
  
But you know, obviously it's just being aggressive. I think my main point was
just to come in and be aggressive and then our goal was obviously to get to
the Final Four, and managed to accomplish that.  
  
Q. When A'Ja got in foul trouble, did you feel like that you needed to
step up at that point? It seemed like that's when you really started scoring a
lot of points.  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. Obviously with A'Ja, she draws a lot of attention. So you
know, with her being out, we had to start scoring and get buckets. We were
getting stops, but they kind of went on runs here and there. We had to find a
way to counter that and balance out a little bit.  
  
Q. At one point, Florida State got it to within three points. Did you
say anything? Did you, personally, say anything to the team to get South
Carolina to settle down? In the end, Florida State ended up missing seven of
its last eight shots. Was that part of the on-the court leadership?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I think in that situation, I feel like it's a time-and-
score situation. It was one of those things where we didn't necessarily need
to get a shot unless we had a good one, and we just had to find ways to get
stopped. They really started pushing the ball at us late in the second half.  
  
We had to find a way to slow them down. But at the same time, like I said, we
were trying to find a way just to work the clock and take good shots.  
  
Q. You transferred here to get a shot at this. Does that make this
incredibly satisfying for you?  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. Absolutely. It makes it ten times better to be able to say
that you want to do something and accomplish it. You know, it's been a long
year, a lot of ups and downs, but I think we're finding a way to end on a high
note and to, you know, just put everything together.  
  
We've had our fair share of adversity but this team has found ways to time and
time again, just fight through it and find a way to be better because of it.  
  
Q. Late in the game, I think they had cut the lead down to three, with
about a minute and 40 seconds left when you made that drive to the basket to
score. That essentially sealed it, in addition to the free throws. What did
you see there, and what was working? You seemed like you were having your way
as far as driving to the basket.  
KAELA DAVIS: I think just attacking them. We weren't settling for jumpshots,
which I think is the best thing we could have done. I think towards the fourth
quarter, we were just kind of passing it and waiting for a good shot to come.
But I think it was one of those things, we kind of had to create a good shot
for ourselves.  
  
They were doing a good job of keeping us outside the paint, and really making
us, like I said, pass the ball around the three-point line. So I think it was
one of those things where I kind of saw everybody was a little raised up and
found a gap somehow.  
  
Q. Florida State had some big three-point shooters but you didn't give
them a lot of good looks. Can you talk about the message Coach gave to you,
and also the last steal late in the game to seal things.  
TYASHA HARRIS: We kind of just stuck with the game plan. We just focused on
defense and trying to stop our man. And the last steal, I just saw it coming
and just grabbed it, and, I don't know, that's what happened.  
  
Q. Tell us a little bit about that dance that was spontaneous there, and
did A'Ja start that?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I think A'Ja started it. I don't know, it's just one of
those in-the-moment things, having fun. We love our band. They are funny --
funny, funny people. They are just really good people to be around. So I think
it was just a way to kind of show that we appreciate them.  
  
Q. Sue looked at the stats and said if she just looked at those cold,
she might have thought they were going to win that game, given the rebounding
totals and some stuff going on. Do you feel like -- do you feel like you guys
won, despite maybe some things you didn't go as well as you needed to do
tonight?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we won despite turning the ball over. We won despite their
runs. I thought them going to a zone and slowing us down and taking away some
driving lanes really stalled our offense a little bit. But it also took
possessions away.  
  
We didn't want to take quick shots, so it almost played into our hands, minus
the turnovers. So we ran the clock a little bit, and if that game is maybe
five minutes longer, we could have a different result.  
  
But I just thought we were timely with getting stops. We were timely with
getting key rebounds. I thought Doniyah Cliney came in and gave us some great
minutes, and got some rebounds when I didn't think we were in the play. We
just made plays and we were very efficient on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Kaela stepped up tonight? Seemed like she
dictated the offense when you needed it the most.  
DAWN STALEY: Since we've gone to a smaller lineup, it's created more scoring
opportunities for Kaela, more driving lanes for her to get to the basket and
more opportunity for her to pull up, as well. She's seeing it and she's
hitting those holes like a running back. You know, for her to perform the way
she does, she did this past weekend, it just goes to show the type of player
she is.  
  
You know, obviously we wanted this all year long. But it takes some adjusting
to not having the ball in your hands. But not having Alaina Coates, puts the
ball in her hands a lot more; had we had Alaina. So Alaina, you don't want
anyone's career to end, but it's been a blessing in disguise for us. We got a
little bit more balanced, and you know, Kaela has benefitted from it.  
  
Q. Two offensive rebounds, only eight assists and obviously a lack of
second-chance opportunities. How did you guys find a way to adjust despite not
having that many second-chance opportunities?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we exploited -- we exploited putting the ball on the floor
and challenging them to stop us one-on-one. That was the game plan, to attack
their feet, put them back on their heels. When it's like that, you're not
going to -- if you get all the way to the basket, you get all the way to the
basket; and if you couldn't, then you kick it out.  
  
So there weren't very many opportunities to assist the basket, because we
found a way to get to the basket. And when it's working, you continue it.  
  
Q. After watching what Florida State managed to do against Oregon State,
did you get a sense even when your team was up by 15, this team is still going
to make a run; they are still going to come back; there's no settling down?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, they are a team that they never find themselves out
of the game because they play so fast, they take quick shots, they get the
ball up-and-down the floor and they turn you over, as well.  
  
We wanted to make sure we got shots at the basket and unfortunately for us, we
had 18 turnovers and that allowed them to get back in the game. So they had a
lot to do with getting back in the game by turning us over. Obviously we have
to clean that up before we take on a Stanford team.  
  
Q. Now that the Final Four is set and you're going to have the
opportunity to coach possibly against two of your USA Basketball mentors,
starting first with Tara VanDerveer, what are your thoughts about being able
to matchup against great basketball minds at that level?  
DAWN STALEY: I think it's great. As a coach, you want to coach against the
best. That's why I left Temple to come to South Carolina to coach in the SEC
with what I think is some of the greatest coaches in the game. And then you
get to this stage at the Final Four, and then it's another tier of coaches who
have won national championships, have won Gold Medals, have won a thousand
games.  
  
I think it's just great. I think I'm going to be amongst greatness and
hopefully with that, you know, it will be a great experience with South
Carolina.  
  
Q. How is this different? How is this feeling different than two years
ago when it was the first time when you guys earned a trip to the Final
Four?  
DAWN STALEY: Probably 7,000 less Gamecock fans. It felt different because it
there was no confetti, there was no screaming. There wasn't any passion behind
it. And obviously we're 3,000 miles away from home, but when you're a little
bit closer, your fans are right on top of you. It just seemed like everybody
was kind of far away, and it almost, it took you back, because you're like,
did this really happen? Are we going to the Final Four?  
  
But it sank in. It sank in when we were standing out there and enjoying each
other's company.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on both your team and the men's team making it, and
what that means to the university?  
DAWN STALEY: It's incredible. I mean, it's something that Frank and I have
both worked hard for. When we came to South Carolina, I'm quite sure he felt
the same way, and I don't want to speak for him -- but Frank is a great coach.
He's a great coach. He does some great things.  
  
And as a coach, you feel like there are things that you can control; that you
can get people to execute; you can get people to believe in your vision, even
the talent, this group of players that you assemble. But you can't do it
without talent, you can't do it without belief. You can't do it without a
togetherness. You can't do it without the support of your administrators, your
president on down, without it working; and we felt this for -- you know, I've
been at South Carolina for nine years. This is Frank's fifth year.  
  
For us to be able to experience three Final Fours in the short time that we've
been here, there's a lot of love on our campus from everyone, and our fans.
Our fans are so deserving of this because, you know, they have been there. You
know, when we won two SEC games, they have been there. When we have been left
out of the NCAA Tournament, they have been there. And now they get to share in
the joys of us playing, being one of the last four teams to participate in
this long basketball season. They deserve it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 27, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Chatrice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33310)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 71, Florida State 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good evening.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: It was a heck of a game and I just a.m. so proud of the young
ladies and the team that has developed here. Obviously we're disappointed. We
didn't shoot the ball well. They shot the ball great. In every other category,
we win. But unfortunately you have to put the ball in the basket, and 71 shots
to 45 shots; 18 offensive rebounds to two; 12 assists, 11 turnovers to their
eight assists, 18 turnovers. You look at that: We beat them in points in the
paint, points off turnovers, second-chance points, fast-break points, bench
points, and it goes on and on, and that's just this game.  
  
It's tough. I wouldn't trade our scorers for anybody. I thought they made a
valiant effort, and give ourselves some chances, but congratulations to South
Carolina. They are a tremendous basketball team.  
  
Q. They kind of held you at arm's length for awhile, and you made that
furious run at the end. What changed for you guys? Was it just the urgency
that time was running out?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it was, and we kept talking the whole time to each
other. I think we were realizing that this could be our last game, and we
didn't want it to end like that. You know, we were down by, you know, ten, 12
points, and we wanted to try. We became more aggressive. I think everybody
believed a little more, and that gave us -- that keep us going.  
  
Q. You guys have been a part of some pretty big comebacks throughout
this entire tournament. In the fourth quarter, did you guys really think, hey,
we've got this; we can make this comeback; we can complete this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Yeah, I think we believed the whole time and that made a huge
impact on how we played. I think we, you know, again, the communication that
we had to each other during the whole game, and especially at the end of the
quarter, somebody will steal the ball, Brittany's layup in the end when we
were in zone. Ivey getting charges; I think that gave us a lot of energy to
come back and try to win the game. But I mean -- yeah.  
  
Q. To have the rebounding advantage and for to you have a pretty
efficient game, seven of nine from the field, but to not get the win and to
see the shots not fall, what was it out there? Was it disappointing when the
shots weren't falling but you were still getting those good looks?  
CHATRICE WHITE: Yeah, I think the whole game, we got all the looks we wanted
to. The shots just weren't falling. It was frustrating on the court, but we
tried our best not to let one mistake lead to the next and just continued to
fight. But you know, we wanted it to go in the basket and didn't tonight.  
  
Q. Senior year, I know it's kind of raw, but can you sum up your year
and time with Florida State and coming here from Kansas State and making
something special out of this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I would say this has been really positive, and honestly what I
take from all of this is how much we've grown and how much we've come together
after all the things that we've been through, and even, you know, having a
start -- I remember when I came from Kansas State, that I wasn't playing at
the beginning. I loved how this team played and I wanted to play so bad. And
then being able to play and what a season we had; it was amazing.  
  
The next year, we struggled a little bit, but we never let all that split us
apart. We always try to come up with new things, new ways to come together,
and I think this season has, you know, has been that change, that growth, that
we really seek last year. So I'm really proud of everybody, the coaches and my
teammates.  
  
Q. Kind of a similar question I already asked. When the team was
starting to make that comeback, you've watched this team Storm back from 17
down; did you believe, too, this is the Seminoles I've seen all year?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, one thing goes your way, at that point, it was a five-point
game and we missed shots and really we had held them for a long time without
scoring.  
  
Again, I don't know why we rushed so much, but it felt like we rushed. We took
a lot of quick shots. I mean, obviously 71 shots, that's a lot of quick shots.  
  
Again, it's kind of the tale of so many coaches: When the ball doesn't go in
the basket, it affects your confidence and your mentality. And started going
in; I thought we could maybe pull it out.  
  
Q. Offensive rebounds were very hard for them to come by but they got
one late that was a big one.  
SUE SEMRAU: That was huge.  
  
Q. This box score, are you going to look at this box score for a while
and figure out how you didn't win this game?  
SUE SEMRAU: No, we just didn't hit shots. That was the big bottom line. And
why didn't we hit shots? I thought we rushed. I thought they played some good
defense, but I thought that we felt the pressure of them scoring, and rather
than being more deliberate and getting the looks that we wanted, I thought we
took the first open look. And it hasn't been -- that's not what we've been
throughout the season, so credit South Carolina for that.  
  
Q. They got out to a 5-0 start like they did the previous game, and you
guys only tied it for 11 seconds. So how frustrating was it to not be able to
get over the hump, even though you were close?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, we talked about it in the last time-out; the last time we
played them in 2015 in the Elite 8, we led for 37 minutes, and it was kind of
the tables were turned; and they had led for 37 minutes, basically, and let's
go do this thing.  
  
But rebounding is critical, and that rebound that gave them that extra
possession was really big.  
  
Q. Kaela Davis, can you just talk about -- I was very impressed with her
this weekend. I had not seen her in person a lot. How difficult is she a guard
for people?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think she's been better for them since Alaina Coates has been
out. She knows -- she wants to be a scorer and she's an excellent scorer. So
she knows that it's her and A'Ja, and so she loves that fence. I remember when
she was at Georgia Tech, she was the only one, so she would go take 31 shots.
Now she gets an opportunity to get great shots. She's just become much more
disciplined. Just she's a great kid and a great basketball player.  
  
Q. What was it like seeing Leti miss shot after shot and open look after
open look?  
SUE SEMRAU: I was just really proud of her for continuing to shoot it, because
she is, you know, a 50-50-90 kind of kid. And again, I thought they were maybe
more rushed. I don't know why; I guess the sense of urgency and the
opportunity. I know she's disappointed in herself, but I couldn't be more
proud to have coached her.  
  
Q. You guys win the rebounding battle, especially on the offensive
rebounds, but you offset that with the amount of fouls. Do you think that had
a big difference in the total outlook of the game?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yes. I wish I could say more. I just -- I don't know. I thought
that it was a physical game. Yeah.  
  
Q. Thomas being on the bench for the entire second quarter, how much did
that really mess with the flow of the game for you guys and your offense?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, it's not our favorite situation to be in. So that, really, I
thought Chatrice stepped up and she did a great job. I thought Ama Degbeon did
a tremendous job defending A'Ja Wilson. And just Ama and Ivey haven't been the
go-to scorers that Shakayla has. I thought Chatrice stepped up and did some
good things, but we would have liked to have her on the floor.  
  
Thanks so much.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome the South Carolina Gamecocks head coach, Dawn
Staley and student athletes A'Ja Wilson, Bianca Cuevas-Moore, Kaela Davis,
Allisha Gray and Tyasha Harris.  
  
South Carolina defeated Quinnipiac to advance to the Elite 8 for the third
time in program history. The Gamecocks will face Florida State tomorrow at
6:00 PM Pacific. First we will have an opening statement from Coach Staley.  
  
DAWN STALEY: We are excited to be in this position. This is a position in
which we've worked so hard. We control our own destiny, and hopefully we'll
come out and perform like we've performed all season long, and we're just
excited to play a very competitive Florida State basketball team.  
  
Q. A'Ja, Florida State, two years ago in the Elite 8 in Greensboro: What
do you remember about that game, really competitive one that went right down
to the wire. What do you remember about that first game?  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, like you said, they are a very competitive team. They
compete for 40 minutes. They are very physical, and that was something that we
really kind of -- helped bring us to the win is that we became physical and we
became even more competitive.  
  
So that's most that I remember from that game. Of course remember going to the
Elite 8 and just the feeling -- I mean, going to the Final Four and just that
feeling. That's something that I really want these girls to experience and,
that's what we're going to go out there and try to do.  
  
Q. Kaela, what had you giggling just now? And secondly -- I just have to
know. I'm so confused over here. And how excited are you for the opportunity
to get that chance to punch a ticket to the Final Four?  
KAELA DAVIS: There's just a lot of jokes on this team. Yesterday we shot a
nice video for our men's team and Coach couldn't --  
  
DAWN STALEY: That's T. Don't give the T out.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I'm just excited, though. Obviously this is -- I came here to be
in these games, to be in this situation. You know, wouldn't want to be on
another team and you know, trying to get to the Final Four with another group
of girls. So I'm just excited.  
  
Q. Kaela, could you talk about growing up the daughter of an NBA player,
and I understand your brother is in the NIT. Can you tell about growing up
with Antonio and your brother, was there any sibling rivalry between you?  
KAELA DAVIS: Oh, all the time. My twin brother. Yeah, one-on-one games, got
shut down a lot. So that stopped at a early age.  
  
But it was just fun. Obviously getting to -- just to see my dad's work ethic
and what it takes to kind of play at the highest level, you know, that was
always fun. I was just always excited; Excited to see him play and I've got to
live a lot of different places and experience a lot of different things. It's
been a blessing. It's been a really cool opportunity.  
  
And obviously like I said, my brother, they are flying out to New York today
to play in the final for the NIT. A lot of basketball going on in my family
right now, but it's an exciting time for us.  
  
Q. Bianca, what was that 2015 game like for you, kind of being a
freshman who had to step up?  
BIANCA CUEVAS-MOORE: It was good I guess. I don't know.  
  
Q. Allisha, how does this team always seem to look so relaxed and loose?
The stakes are rising but I can't tell by looking on the podium right now that
you guys are ready to play the biggest game of the season tomorrow?  
ALLISHA GRAY: We are just a funny team, goofy. We know there's a time and
place for everything, so once we're on the court, we're serious and ready to
play but right now it's a time where you get your all -- your giggles out and
stuff and you can be lackadaisical and stuff. But once you get out on the
court, we know it's game time and we'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Allisha, your time in the ACC, does that give you extra familiarity
with Florida State and does that help in your preparation?  
ALLISHA GRAY: I wouldn't say an advantage because they are definitely a
different team than they were two years ago, so I just have to come in and
prepare for them like I haven't met them before and like they are a brand new
team.  
  
Q. What do you remember from a couple years ago playing them? Romero
said last night her body just hurt after that game; it was so physical. Sue
was mentioning last night how special it is to scrimmage with this team the
last couple of years in the preseason.  
A'JA WILSON: Wait, could you repeat, that first part of the question? Oh --  
  
Q. Romero said her body, it was such a physical game. You won by six and
her body was sore afterwards. It was one of those battles; a fight, she called
it.  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, just kind of going off what I said, last time it was a very
physical game. I mean, when something is on the line, you're going to come and
fight for it and you really want it. I think it just comes down to want. I
think we all know that the talent is in the room. I mean, we all know we're
talented, but at the same time, when you're playing something such as the
Final Four, it comes down to heart and want.  
  
And I think after that game, I think we really wanted it and we went out and
fought for it, and the results kind of showed. But I haven't really got a
chance to scrimmage them, but it's always good to scrimmage a great team like
Florida State. So it's good, a good little rivalry.  
  
Q. You're obviously up for the top Player of the Year Award in college
basketball. Do you feel like in this tournament right now, you've made a
significant statement that, hey, I am the best player in basketball right
now?  
A'JA WILSON: I honestly don't even really know how to answer that question
honestly. I think I'm just kind of doing the same thing I've been doing. My
biggest thing is just being efficient and just going out there and helping my
team get a win. I credit all my teammates for giving me the ball and just
looking for me and just keeping up with me and staying with me.  
  
I'm probably a hard person to deal with but they really do a great job of just
handling me. So I really just give it all to them, and I wouldn't be in the
position that I am to even receive those awards and even be a finalist for
awards such as the National Player of the Year without them. So I really
credit them for just being and keeping up with me.  
  
Q. A'Ja said she didn't really remember or didn't really scrimmage
against South Carolina -- you're South Carolina. Didn't really scrimmage
against Florida State. Does anybody remember scrimmaging against Florida State
and when you learned from that?  
DAWN STALEY: We actually aren't supposed to talk about the scrimmage. So let's
leave those questions alone, because it was a closed-door thing and not
supposed to be publicized.  
  
Q. For A'Ja, and forgive me for not knowing, watching you play last
night, we don't ever see players wear shin guards, and you were talking about
the physicality -- you guys were talking about the physicality. Is there
anything, you want to tell us why you do that and how it helps?  
A'JA WILSON: Last year I was battling with shin issues and I always had kind
of a bad habit of a person kind of kicking me in the shins, and it would
really, really hurt. So they have these things that are molded to my shin,
kind of shin guards.  
  
They really help me because then I know I'm protected, because kind of getting
hit by a bunch of people in that shin area, it doesn't really affect me any
more now that I have my shin guards. That's why I wear them.  
  
Q. Not asking specifically about the scrimmage, but is there a slight
rivalry growing now because you have met in the Elite 8 before and you guys
are getting a little bit more familiarity with each other? For any of the
players, particularly for A'Ja.  
A'JA WILSON: I guess. I feel like we've seen them. We've seen them a lot. I
don't really know exactly. I don't know how they feel about it. But hey, it's
just a game. It's just a game we play.  
  
Q. In watching your opponent last night, they gave up a lot of easy
baskets early in the game and seemed to really make some changes defensively.
I think Oregon State only scored 17 points in the second half. Just for any of
the players, did you see any changes in the way they approached the second
half, and does it make you think you're going to face a team that plays
defense like that tomorrow then, too?  
KAELA DAVIS: We only saw -- we only really got to sit down and watch the
second half. Obviously I feel like that's when Florida State looked the best.  
  
I mean, yeah, obviously like we said, it's a game to go to the Final Four, so
you know, we imagine it's going to be as competitive as possible.  
  
Yeah, I mean, they really turned the defense up, and I think they just --
their whole energy. I think they had a completely different energy, a
completely different focus in the second half. I don't think we need to be
prepared for for a half; I think that's something we need to prepare for for
40 minutes.  
  
Q. For Ty, this might be an awkward question because Coach is sitting so
close to you. How has that relationship grown throughout the year? You've
played the position that Coach obviously demands some of the most of being the
point guard. How has she helped you grow into that role to handle the
responsibilities that you have to be able to run the floor like you do?  
TYASHA HARRIS: She's always in my ear in practice and even in the game. Like
when they are about to shoot free throws, the other team about to shoot free
throws, she'll pull me over and tell me what needs to be done. So just, her
just being in my ear and telling me what's right and what's wrong.  
  
Q. The questions about the scrimmage came up because Sue last night just
talked so much about the respect that she has for your program; that once they
get to know a team like they know you a little bit, she finds herself cheering
for you all year. What does that mean to you to hear that?  
DAWN STALEY: I think it's part of the game. I think when you watch as much
film as we watch, there are certain teams and certain styles that you like.
And certainly, I hope that our team plays a style of play that, you know,
could make any coach proud.  
  
We play hard on both sides of the ball. We try to do the right things. We play
a disciplined type of basketball on both sides of the ball, and when you watch
it so much, you learn to appreciate that. She does have a team in which plays
extremely hard. A lot of us, the players that she has on her team, she won a
recruiting battle.  
  
So I mean, she has the type of players that we like to have in our program and
it's a mutual respect.  
  
Q. You were able to rest a number of your starters in the fourth
quarter; they were not. How much do you think/hope that will make a difference
tomorrow?  
DAWN STALEY: That won't make a difference tomorrow. I can assure you that at
this stage of the game, you just -- just play. You find the energy. You
persevere and you find what it takes to win the game and get to the next stage
of this NCAA Tournament.  
  
So we're not -- they have got a day of rest. They will have a practice today.
They will have the rest of the day to enjoy and rest and watch the NCAA men's
games and the women's games. So I don't think that will play a part in
tomorrow's results.  
  
Q. I know you recruited Shakayla pretty hard way back when. Do you
maintain any relationship with her and what's it like meeting her again two
years later?  
DAWN STALEY: Recruited Shakayla and Nicole Ekhomu both pretty hard. Shakayla
played on the USA team two summers ago, the U-19 in Russia. I kept up with her
because she played for another team. I don't really try to talk to them
afterwards, because I don't like to, you know -- I don't want to meddle in
other people's teams. But got to know her family well, and she's progressed
nicely. She's always one that got away, that you think about what could have
been.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kaela's performance yesterday, maybe break it down
a bit, and how -- the matchup, the backcourt she will have tomorrow against
Florida State, how that matchup looks?  
DAWN STALEY: Kaela is playing some of her best basketball. She saved it up for
this time of the season. She is a player in which -- it's a hard guard for
anybody. She's big. She's 6-2, a perimeter player that can do a lot of things
with the basketball.  
  
I'm impressed with what she does from a defensive standpoint. Obviously it's
well known what she can do from an offensive standpoint. And she's living up
to -- she's living up to her reputation as being a tremendous scorer, and she
does it in so many ways but defensively she is a big presence out there on the
floor.  
  
What we're hoping to utilize, everything that she's doing on both sides of the
ball against a Florida State team which will be very physical, fast, play
fast. So hopefully we'll be able to use some of our length on the perimeter
against their speed.  
  
Q. Last night, I saw you sitting down watching the Oregon State/Florida
State game. What surprised you about the way Florida State managed to come
back after being down 17?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I wasn't surprised. I just think that over the course of
a 40-minute game, wills are going to be imposed on different teams.  
  
I just thought that Florida State imposed their will after the start of the
game. The next 35 minutes, or 32 minutes of the game, they just would not --
they were relentless and would not allow Oregon State to run their sets and be
comfortable in what they were trying to do, and they disrupted them. So it was
really impressive to see them disrupt for as long as they did.  
  
Q. We talked to you the other day about just the challenges of playing
across the country. You have such a good following, and Oregon State is gone,
and they brought a big crowd. Do you think tomorrow night, being that it's a
night game, do you feel like the crowd will be -- there's a good chance of a
better crowd, and what are your thoughts on the attendance?  
DAWN STALEY: I think there were like 4,500 people. And we do lose probably one
of the closest teams to the venue.  
  
I think people are excited to be here. I think you're going to see two of the
top teams in the country vying for a Final Four spot. I think the people here
in Stockton have done a great job of trying to promote it.  
  
I don't know what the turnout will be, but surely, surely, to have, you know,
us and Florida State playing tomorrow night, it's at a decent time, too. 6:00
PM is a great time in which you can come and still get dinner afterwards. We
should have some people coming in, as well. Hopefully our fans, some more of
our fans, can make the trip west after watching our guys play in New York.  
  
Q. You've won I think 151 games in the last five years. You lead the
nation in attendance by a wide margin. What are some of the things that South
Carolina as a program that you're most proud of with how things have developed
to this point?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I'm probably most proud of, you know, how it's all come
together. I think the biggest common denominator in all of it is the type of
people that we've recruited and the type of people that come out to support
our games. It is truly a lifestyle to support our program and the families
that come into our program.  
  
You know, they get a chance to have an experience like no other. The way the
fans support us, both on the road and at home, and just every day life, to go
to the grocery store, to go to the malls. It is somewhat of a hardship because
some of our players are just going out to pick up some things at the mall and
it turns out to be a selfie session, which is, you know, it comes with the
territory.  
  
The way they support us, we make them feel very much a part of our family, and
that's probably the biggest -- the biggest mutual respect that we have for
each other, our fans and our program.  
  
Q. Just seeing your players up here on the podium just laughing, joking
with each other, what's that like for you as a coach? Is it refreshing to see
your players just being so relaxed before such a major game?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, you don't want them uptight. I think tomorrow will bring
a lot of pressure and it won't be a laughing matter at this point. But they
are pretty calm. They are cool. They get along with one another. You know,
they are kids. I want them to enjoy the moment.  
  
There is a time and a place for it all, and I want them to be comfortable. I
want them to be loose. Because the team that gets to play at its normal
composure is the team that is going to probably win the basketball game;
that's closest to what they have played like all season long; approaching it
when the adrenaline settle the down, is the team that will probably get out to
a good start.  
  
Q. Because we like to tell balanced stories, your players talk about a
Lifesaver habit. Do you really eat 20 a game and when your mouth is full, does
it keep you from yelling at them quite so loudly? We have to give you a chance
to respond to these thoughts from your gals.  
DAWN STALEY: Probably more than 20. I would say more than 20. They probably
only see 20 because half of them are in the game.  
  
I don't know, I used to joke around that I wanted fresh breath when I'm
talking to the officials (laughter). No, it's just become a habit. I like
mints. I like mints outside of -- outside of actually coaching. I do,
sometimes, pop one in before a time-out and I'm talking to them, and they have
made a running joke of, things flying out during the time-out. I have yet to
see that yet, though.  
  
Q. Does this go back to even during your playing days in college when
you would snap the rubber band? Are these, maybe not superstitions, but ways
you deal with pressure or coaching or playing?  
DAWN STALEY: Coping mechanisms, huh? I guess it's become a habit. I don't eat
-- I eat probably more fruity stuff outside of the games. But you know, the
way -- I don't know who lines them up, but they line them up so perfectly,
it's enticing. So I have to go out and grab a few of them.  
  
Q. What a great year for South Carolina basketball. The men's game is
about to tip off, if it hasn't already, and the success you are all having
this season. How might this bode for of your programs, the rising tide lifting
both ships?  
DAWN STALEY: It just goes to show, when you are supported like we are
supported from the president to the administrators to our fans, to other
coaches that are at the University of South Carolina; when that type of
support is there, you can succeed abundantly and that's what's happened to
both of our programs from a basketball standpoint.  
  
But our women's soccer team is great. Our football team went to a bowl game.
Our equestrian team, they have been No. 1. They won the National Championship.
Our track team's won national championships.  
  
So when you're supported the way that we have been supported, I think it
becomes part of what can happen, and I'm super proud of Frank. In the five
years that he's been at South Carolina, I know the pain that he's been
through. I used to tell him, "This will be a distant memory." Although he's
probably fueled by what happened maybe five years ago when he first got
started, but I'm sure it makes up. Today, moving forward, it makes up for some
of those hardship years that he had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, again, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon and please welcome Florida State head coach, Sue
Semrau and student athletes Shakalya Thomas, Ivey Slaughter, Leticia Romero,
Brittany Brown and Imani Wright.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're excited to be here and it's a nice ACC/SEC matchup here out
west and have a lot of respect for South Carolina and the job that they do and
looking forward to the matchup.  
  
Q. What do you remember about that South Carolina matchup, your freshman
year, the team playing in its Elite 8, just how tough was that game, and how
much are you looking forward to the rematch tomorrow?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: It was a great match-up. I remember them coming out and it
was a great game. We started off a little slow but as we picked up, it became
like a really intense game. This matchup, to me, it's going to help us redeem
ourselves, like this is what I've personally been looking forward to for the
longest, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit with everybody last night about defense, but
South Carolina hit ten of 16 threes yesterday, and your defense was able to
take that away from Oregon State. How much is that going to factor in tomorrow
in terms of doing what you did yesterday to take players out of the perimeter
game?  
BRITTANY BROWN: It's a big factor, but it's just something, that's what we do.
That's been our bread and butter all year, our biggest difference-maker and
why we're here today is because of our defending and rebounding ability.  
  
So that's just what we're going to hone into again. That's with every opponent
that we play, but as we talked, even with Oregon State, it's a team effort.
It's a collective effort from everyone on the team from our guards to our
post. And a lot of people think that just because you're guarding on the
perimeter, that it's just the guard's responsibility, but it comes a lot from
our posts and hedging and things like that.  
  
So it will be a team effort but we'll just continue to do what we've been
doing all season.  
  
Q. Leticia, and Coach, correct me if this is incorrect. I came across a
note that said in the first 42 years of this program, Florida State had never
had a team hold opponents to 60 points or less over the course of a season,
but in the last two or three years, you all have been able to do that. Does
that sound close to the --  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that sounds like a Steve Stone stat if I ever heard one.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the commitment to defense that this team in
particular with this program in general has made in the last couple three
years?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it's part of us. It's part of our game. It's something
we've been working on since preseason. There are a lot of teams that can
score. So if you want to make it to the top, I think you have to have a really
good defense. I think we have great defenders here, starting with Brittany and
Ivey. I think they are our team leaders in defense, and that gives us a lot of
energy just seeing them, how they fight, they defend, they help each other.
It's just a team effort, like she said. But I'm really confident about our
defense and that's what's going to take us to the next level.  
  
Q. Early in the game, they not only scored baskets but got a lot of
really easy shots, but in the second half, you held them to 18 points. Was
there anything specific you tried to change around defensively from the
struggles early in the game to the absolute shutdown late in the game? And if
you could talk about getting nine steals in one game. It seems like quite a
few.  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think we just picked up our defensive intensity in the
second half. I think in the first half, we kind of played a little timid, and
we had like a lot of jitters, I believe, in the first half.  
  
I think just coming out in the second half, we knew that we had to fight and
we knew we had to get defensive stops, because once we play great defense, it
dictates our offense. And for the steals, I think I just tried to play my best
defense and I think the ball just kind of fell in my hands.  
  
Q. Brittany, we've talked before, and you've told me about how you've
wanted to change this program when you got here and how to build on that. But
you're one gym away from a Final Four. What would it mean for you, for I guess
Ivey and for that senior class to be the program that broke through?  
BRITTANY BROWN: That's just the culture here at Florida State. We're big on
honor and legacy and honoring those that came before us. They set this path
for us and we basically just kind of carried it on.  
  
I think it will be really special for our seniors, but it's just this group,
period. All these girls, if we make it to the final -- we win, we win and make
it to the Final Four, that will be something that Florida State has never done
in program history. So it will be something that we always remember as a
group, so I'm excited for it.  
  
Q. In the first quarter of each NCAA Tournament game, you guys have only
scored 12 points in each first quarter. What is going on with the slow starts,
and what is Sue saying to you guys to snap you out of it and get you back to
where you can play strong offense?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I don't know what's going on. I think if I knew, it wouldn't
happen. Honestly I think we just start really slow, I don't know if it's
confidence or we don't know how the game is going to be or we need something
at the beginning to start playing our game.  
  
What Coach was telling us was to come grab the game. Just attack them, be
aggressive and not wait or hold back or wait for them to make mistakes. We
have to wait for them to make mistakes. That's going to be our biggest focus,
too, starting the game well against these teams.  
  
Q. Going off the slow starts, but coming back off of slow starts, you've
outscored opponents, I think it's 192 to 118 over the final three quarters.
What does it say about this team that you are still managing to dominate
opponents, even after slow starts?  
SUE SEMRAU: You know, it's interesting, I don't think that players always hear
you in the huddles. And so what Leti is saying, and you're asking, what are we
saying, it's to remember who we are defensively. We can't -- we got great
looks. We didn't knock them down it.  
  
Now we have to not allow that offensive -- it's efficiency, but we haven't
gotten productivity, effect our defensive end of the floor. I don't know what
that's been because we were exactly opposite the beginning of the year. You
know, we would come out really strong.  
  
So I don't think it's necessarily a habit. I don't think it has anything to do
-- I think it's a big stage and we hadn't played in a week, so that's part of
it, as well.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on what's being said in huddles, I looked over and
it looked like Leti is leading the huddle. How good is it to see players
taking responsibility for what's happening on the floor?  
SUE SEMRAU: That's something we've worked really hard to develop, and as
coaches, we stay away. I mean, we've got a 2:45 timeout. So if your players
are sitting there waiting for and you walk in with two minutes or 2:30 to
talk, they are only going to hear the last bit, anyway.  
  
So that communication that they have developed and the confidence to hold one
another accountable to give instruction and to receive instruction and to
respond to each other, we've worked really hard at that and that's a big
difference in our huddles right now.  
  
Q. There's a lot of communities around the country that have held Sweet
16s for either men or women, but Stockton is obviously something new for this
community. Could you reflect on the days you've been here and how things have
gone?  
SUE SEMRAU: Stockton has done a tremendous job. I didn't know what the crowd
would look like yesterday. We had three teams from the East Coast that were
here. It was a tremendous crowd. There were people that came down from
Sacramento, up from San Francisco, here in the local area. It was really
impressive that we had that kind of atmosphere for an NCAA women's game.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played in 2015, looking back, I think you guys
either, they didn't lead -- they barely led for I think the first 38 minutes
and then took it right at the end but it seems like you guys don't really talk
about it as one that got away. Did you feel that way in the moment, or what
were the emotions coming -- thinking back on how that kind of went?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, we did feel like that. I remember it was; it was three
possessions, and Tiffany Mitchell hitting that one in the corner that was a
dagger for us. It was disappointing.  
  
At the same time, there was a lot of growth in those young ladies and in our
program as a result. You know, I don't -- I think it's two really good
programs, two elite programs, that get a chance to matchup here tomorrow
night. A lot is on the line, but more importantly, these two programs and how
solid they have become and the young women that are being produced from these
programs, I think that's what's so important. A possession or two here or
there, there's a lot bigger things in life.  
  
Q. A'Ja Wilson is one of those kind of impressive physical specimens
when you look at her and then you watch her play. What's kind of your thought
on that matchup tomorrow, your front court?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, A'Ja is outstanding. Not only in her ability and her
stature, but her work ethic. Her skill, her determination; she's one of the
most elite players to ever play college basketball.  
  
And it doesn't stop there. They have tremendous players and two of them have
played in the ACC, with Kayla Davis and Allisha Gray, we have seen them for
another of years and they are tremendous player. We recruited Tyasha Harris,
tremendous guard.  
  
I think you just go down the line and they have a tremendous lineup. And I
like the matchups. It's interesting that they are having to play a little bit
differently now without Alaina Coates, but they are doing a great job with
that. If you look at their postseason numbers, they are doing some great
things.

_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 100, Quinnipiac 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley,
and student athletes Kaela Davis and Allisha Gray.  
  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it was great to get out, to get out there and play another
game. It seemed like we were off for a long time. I thought our players came
out ready to play on both sides of the ball and it was a really exciting game
for us, and we were really up for the challenge of playing Quinnipiac, and I'm
glad we get a chance to move on.  
  
Q. What were you guys doing early in the game defensively to shut them
down? You started with a 16-0 run, and seemed like they couldn't do anything
on offense.  
KAELA DAVIS: I think our biggest thing was obviously pressuring outside the
three-point line. I've honestly never seen a team that could shoot the ball as
well as them. So our biggest thing was just making them put the ball on the
floor, you know, and if we had to give up a two, we'd much rather give up a
two rather than a three.  
  
ALLISHA GRAY: And like Coach said, just staying engaged. Like Kaela said, they
are a great three-point shooting team. So we tried our best to run them off
the three-point line, also.  
  
Q. For the players. Even though Quinnipiac had a great run so far in the
tournament, a lot of people didn't really know much about them coming into the
tournament, and obviously you guys didn't take them for granted. How did you
-- what was your mindset of not taking a mid-major like that for granted and
coming out so fast?  
ALLISHA GRAY: When we come out, we play every team the same. Doesn't matter
what name is on the jersey. We come out to play. Obviously they had a good
run, but we still got a mission to complete and that's to make it to the Final
Four National Championship.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I second that.  
  
Q. Kaela, you had a nice offensive game today. Was the basket really big
for you out there?  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, I guess so. It doesn't matter, get my feet set, just making
sure, kind of staying in rhythm. Like Coach said, it feels like we've been on
for a long time with the gap between games. I think it's just like I said,
just finding rhythm and staying in a rhythm.  
  
Q. How much of an emphasis was there just to be able to get off to a
fast start, especially after the way the first two NCAA Tournament games kind
of went?  
ALLISHA GRAY: The main thing for us is to come out strong the first five
minutes and then take the game from there. We definitely want to stay
aggressive and continue playing South Carolina basketball.  
  
Q. Kaela, the Elite 8 game, players through the years have said this is
almost one of the hardest games because you're just one step away from the
Final Four, which is where everybody wants to get. What are the priorities for
an Elite 8 game mentally and also from an X's and O's perspective?  
KAELA DAVIS: Honestly I have no idea. It's my first time being here.  
  
But no, I think it's, like I said, we're going to play basketball. We're going
to play the way that we know how to play. No matter who is in front of us, we
have to play hard. We have to come ready to play no matter who it is, as it
was today.  
  
But for us, we're going to sit here, watch both these teams. It's two really
good teams. Two really experienced teams. Like I said, we are going to come
out and play our game and play hard.  
  
ALLISHA GRAY: I second that.  
  
Q. Is there something specifically challenging about the Elite 8 round,
because you're so close to the Final Four at that point?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I mean, I think for teams that have a goal of going to the
Final Four and winning the National Championship, it is that step that, you
know, can prevent you. Either you can overlook it -- not overlook it, but you
can try to get ahead of yourself. I think for us, we just need to stay in
character.  
  
We need to approach it much like we approached every game of the season.
Although the stakes are a little bit higher. Just keep it as normal as
possible, and the teams that are able to stay the course and keep it normal
are the ones that can open up a game.  
  
Q. You guys started off 9-0 run, they called a time-out and you go up
16-0 before they finally score. Almost a shutout. Being the type of player you
were, how proud of the team were you for the way they played defense?  
DAWN STALEY: I was incredibly proud of our team to be able to lock in to the
game plan, and execute it. I thought we did have a few lulls in the second
quarter where we got careless with the basketball, and we also let some
shooters loose. They had a really good second quarter.  
  
So we have to continue to not have those lapses and put 40-minute games
together at this stage of the game, because we'll play another great team on
Monday night, and if you, you know, allow teams to play to their strengths,
they can really make you pay for it.  
  
Q. Just defensively, what did you feel like was working and executing in
that first quarter?  
DAWN STALEY: The biggest thing for us in this particular game is our speed. We
wanted to speed them up. We didn't want them to be comfortable in their sets
and allowing them to read what our defense is. And then staying in front of
them. Just staying in between them and the basket and not allowing them to get
ahead of the possession, because once they are ahead of the possession, it's
hard to fight your way back, and they will get open threes when it's like
that.  
  
Q. You had a lot of concerns about this team yesterday, but you were
also very complimentary of them in getting this far. Where do you see the
program going? Do you see them as a team that could be here regularly?  
DAWN STALEY: I do. Because the style of play at this time of the year, if
you're not used to playing this. And we're not -- we weren't. We had four days
to prepare for this style of play, and usually you get, you know, if you
advance, if they advance past the first round, you have one chemistry and they
believe in each other. This type of thing can happen on a regular basis.  
  
Q. You've had a handful of games now without Alaina in the starting
lineup. What are you liking about the team and your starters, in particular,
at this point, and what can they do that maybe they didn't quite have with
Alaina there?  
DAWN STALEY: With Alaina out, I think it just leaves a big void. Like driving
lanes were there for us. It gives A'Ja Wilson an opportunity to work the paint
a little bit more and maybe feel like it's not so clogged up. And I thought
tonight, or today, they played, almost double teamed her.  
  
But for the guards, like a Kaela Davis, she's getting to the basket a little
bit more. Allisha Gray can play more downhill. Bianca Cuevas thrives off of
the space that's left with the void of not having Alaina Coates in there. But
we do, we feel from a rebounding and defensive standpoint, we feel her
presence missed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach Staley. We'll see you Monday.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Ivey Slaughter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28385)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
FLORIDA STATE 66,  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're thrilled obviously with the win over a great Oregon State
team. You know, to win 31 games, you have to be a very, very good basketball
team, and they do a tremendous job with the program. And having lost some
players last year and having some new kids step into roles, just really want
to compliment the job that Scott has done with his team.  
  
As far as our team goes, it all starts on the defensive ends. Ivey Slaughter
and Brittany Brown have really been the two catalysts in that area. We started
slowly. Again, that big gap of time, I think maybe is what's kind of tough for
us, but started slowly.  
  
But for Ivey to open up the second half with that big steal, I think gave us a
ton of energy, and that's what she can do. Nine steals in a postseason game, I
understand is a record, that couldn't go to a more deserving young lady. For
Shakayla Thomas to have another double-double; for Leticia to work as hard as
she did to get the ball, they made it really, really hard.  
  
You know, I thought Brittany did a tremendous job on Sydney, and when we said
it was going to be a team effort to stop somebody that is as talented as
Sydney Wiese, and to keep her in single-digit scoring is a tremendous fear for
our basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start of the game and maybe what you guys
were thinking and saying in huddles when you were looking at the scoreboard?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I honestly don't know what we were thinking, because we start
really slow. I think -- I don't know, I think we hold back, we weren't being
aggressive. I mean, they start really good. They knew we could shoot the three
point line, the three pointer, and they just didn't let us shoot. They denied
us. We didn't know how to play, and I think the biggest thing for us today was
that we were able to come back and to overcome that.  
  
Q. Ivey, 11 points, nine steals, against a very tall Oregon State team.
What was it like out there for you, and was this the most physical game that
you've played in as a Seminole?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I would say it was one of the most physical games that I've
played in. Yeah, they were very big. They had really good posts. They can
rebound really well, and I think that I just tried to use my athleticism as
much as I could, and I think it really helped us.  
  
Q. Your coach touched on this, coming out in the second half with
defense, but for both of you, what were the things that stuck out in your mind
as what you needed to do to come out that fast and just take over?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think getting stops on defense. We know how good our defense
can be, and honestly, like for me, seeing what Ivey was doing in defense,
getting steals, just being everywhere, gave us a lot of security, and that
confidence transferred to the offensive end of the floor, too. I think she
really changed a lot of things in this game.  
  
Q. For Ivey, when you see Leti come out the way she does, just how much
confidence does that give your basketball team, and how much does that open up
your offense?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: It gives us confidence. I believe like Leti said, we came out
a little slow. We had a lot of jitters and I think that we all just tried to
fight as much as we can. We have nothing to lose. You know, it's win or go
home, and we knew that, and especially when Leti start going, when she starts
going, everybody else gets going, especially on the offensive end. I think it
was amazing that she got going.  
  
Q. How much pride do you take in doing all these plays that are
considered the dirty work. You take the charges; you get the steals; you are
always up in someone's face. Talk about the level of pride you take in that
type of play.  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think the whole world knows that I'm not the best scorer or
I'm not the best defender on the team, but I just know that --  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Yes, you are.  
  
LETICIA ROMERO: She definitely is.  
  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I just know that with my rebounding and me taking charges and
helping the team, that's what they need for us to win the game and I do it to
my best ability.  
  
Q. When did you realize you had good hands and quick hands, and were
able to make those kind of plays, and have you ever had a game like that?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: Well, funny story, I started doing gymnastics when I was
younger, and I guess that helped me with flexibility, quick agilities. But
then my mom made me decide I had to play basketball or do gymnastics, and
gymnastics was very costly and I chose basketball. And I think that really
helped me a lot with just my hands, my hand-eye coordination.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We're happy you did.  
  
Q. What age did you decide this?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: It was fifth grade. Around 12 years old.  
  
Q. When you're down 21-4 in that second half, that third quarter, was
that kind of the moment when you first took the lead that you felt like all
the momentum shifted?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think it was the steal from Ivey honestly. Because I was
confident that, you know, after -- in the second half, we were going to have a
different kind of game.  
  
I saw everybody was locked in. So everybody, you know, ready to go to fight,
and just seeing that the first possession you get a steal and get it going.
That gave me so much energy to just play my game and help the team.  
  
Q. This is going to be a familiar opponent in terms of this round, and
you guys a couple years ago played an Elite 8 game against South Carolina.
What do you remember about that game and what do you bring into this game
now?  
LETICIA ROMERO: What I remember, is that it was a fight. Like we -- I remember
finishing the game and my whole body was hurting. We fought and they did, too.
It was a really good game. We ended up losing by, I think it was four points
-- six, actually.  
  
I cannot even tell you like the little details, but it was just a battle, and
whoever want it more and made plays and all of these things, I think it's
what's going to come down to.  
  
Q. What kind of experience do you gain playing for Spain? How does that
help in moments like this, in pressure-filled games like this?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think leadership you see in other players. I think I learned
a lot from professional players. You see the national team, and they are all
professional players playing overseas. They had really good careers, and they
know how to change things. They know how to act whenever we're down. They know
how to motivate teammates.  
  
I think I try to bring that to our team this year, and especially the
mentality of, you know, we have to make the most of it, every single day. You
cannot just go throw the motions for the whole week and expect to come to the
game and be good. I think our team this year has been really good this year in
terms of coming prepared to every practice.  
  
Q. You nearly had a triple-double on Russell Westbrook. How do you
attest to the versatility you have? Most of your rebounds are offensive. So
how do you attest to your versatility all across the board?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think because I'm quicker than a lot of posts that I'm able
to get around them and use my feet to be able to get rebounds, and our coaches
told us from the start of the week that when we knew we were playing Oregon
State, that they were an amazing rebounding team, and we couldn't just have
one shot. We had to go get second- and third-chance points, and I think I just
took that to heart, and knowing that I can rebound really well, that that's
what I tried to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the start of the game, and what you were thinking
when you looked up at the scoreboard, and was it a change that you needed to
make to get things to shift, or do you think it was doing what you guys
usually do?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that's a great question. I was stunned. I was stunned that
we were missing the shots we were missing. I felt like the defensive end was
affected by our offensive in-production; unproduction.  
  
But we knew that if we could convince them how good they were defensively, how
good we are defensively, that things could change. Yeah, I think Brittany
Brown really started to become an aggressor, and a lot of people followed
suit.  
  
Q. How do you convince a team in the Sweet 16: You're really good on
defense. How do you say it? How do you motivate them to actually do?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, that's a great question. This team, I wanted to spend
another week with this team, because I want them so badly to believe in
themselves even more than they do. I don't know if you've seen the Dove ads
where they sketch a woman who is describing herself, and then they sketch a
woman who has just met this other woman, and they ask that woman to sketch the
same woman.  
  
And we describe ourselves often as not as beautiful as we are, whereas another
man or woman, will describe us as more warm and open and the smile. So we're
our worst critic.  
  
They also did a guys's commercial with that, too, and it was pretty
interesting that the guys thought they were a lot better looking than they
really are.  
  
But we talked about that, and I thought it was interesting that Dove sponsored
some things in our locker room, and we were able to go back to that, because
we had showed them that, that clip, and really to help them believe that they
are better than they are.  
  
Q. It seemed like the last media time-out of the game, you guys were
only up maybe a basket or two. That time-out, it seemed like your seniors were
doing most of the talking in the huddle. What were they saying, and then just
how proud are you of them for finishing the game the way they did?  
SUE SEMRAU: They were locked in. And we were talking about the adjustments
that we were going to be making, and they did a phenomenal job of
communicating those things to each other in the huddle, and then on the court.
And you can have one person mess up, and bam, game changes. And they locked
each other in: Nikki Ekhomu came in and did a great job as a young freshman on
Sydney Wiese; they locked her in as well; Ama Degbeon coming in the game for a
defensive adjustment. All the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Just what memories stand out from the 2015 game against South
Carolina, and what does it mean to meet them again at this juncture?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, you know, it's really not even that game. We scrimmaged them
the last two years, and we love that opportunity, because we have so much
respect for South Carolina and the job that Dawn's done and the program and
team that they have put together.  
  
Really you look back to those scrimmage situations, and as a scrimmage
partner, you follow them throughout the year because you're a fan. Just have a
ton of respect for who they are and how far they have come.  
  
Q. What is it about the Elite 8 game? I've talked to coaches and players
through the years who say this is the toughest of all of them, because you're
sitting at the foot of the Final Four; if you can talk about that a little
bit. And Ivey, you talked about not seeing yourself. She's sitting up there,
saying I'm not the best at this; I'm not the best at that. She had a game-
changing performance for you guys tonight.  
SUE SEMRAU: I'll address that first, because there's so many young women that
just -- and you love it, because they are not cocky, and at the same time,
it's a confidence that we're trying to instill.  
  
We talk in our program about becoming strong, beautiful, powerful women.
That's more important to me than whether or not we go to the Final Four is
that that character is developed in these young women, and I have an amazing
staff that helps us with that.  
  
This game, you know, it's so interesting, because I remember when I was a
young coach hearing people say, why is your goal the Final Four? Because then
you're going to get to the Final Four and you've achieved your goal.  
  
And so I think, but that's what, again, what people hear. That's the pinnacle.
And for so many programs, that seems to be the pinnacle, and so there's a lot
of pressure that is put on to get to that game. So I think that's probably a
big reason for it, and you know, we've experienced it before, so I think that
is a benefit for us that we didn't have maybe a few years back.  
  
Q. What are some of the quirks or the intensity that you see in Dawn
Staley and wanting to scrimmage with her program every year?  
SUE SEMRAU: Quirks?  
  
Q. Her team was talking about her Lifesaver chomping habit, and Tara
VanDerveer was talking about snapping rubber bands when she was playing at
Virginia. She's intense, and you've seen her over the years and want to
scrimmage her each season.  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, absolutely. I have so much respect for her as a member of
the ACC. We're really proud of the level of play that she brought to the ACC.  
  
As a competitor, I don't look at the quirks. I look at her team and what her
team is able to do. I think that really speaks -- her team speaks volumes for
who she is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations, and we'll see you Monday.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 25, 2017

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Gabriella Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30898)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
FLORIDA STATE 66, Oregon State 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State Beavers head coach, Scott Rueck and
our student athletes Sydney Wiese and Gabriella Hanson.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I don't know at this point if there's anything real
profound to say, other than the obvious. I love this team. I just absolutely
love them. This is -- I just told them, you know you're doing something right
and you're part of something special when you never want it to end. And this
was a group that was just an absolute blast to go to work with every day. They
gave everything they had, every day. Every day. And it was demanded out of
this group by these two sitting next to me.  
  
Today, you know, obviously started the way we wanted. We were playing against
a great team, and Florida State played an awesome game today. Their
athleticism hurt us. They hurt us on the boards, even though we won the
boards. You know, this game had so many stretches in it that were big runs for
us, for them, and then finally for them. And the hot team wins in March, and
they were that today.  
  
And so, so it ends for us. But I could not be more broad of what this group
has done. It's hard to look at the big picture at the moment, but the big
picture is crazy, all the firsts that these two have experienced, over their
four years, along with our other seniors, gives me a huge sense of pride to be
a part of it. It's a blessing to be their coach.  
  
It was also a blessing to look up and see so much orange today. We knew Beaver
Nation would travel and they didn't disappoint. We hoped for a longer weekend,
but credit Florida State for a great game today and a great win.  
  
Q. What changed when they started chipping away at the lead?  
SYDNEY WIESE: They were starting to sag in the paint a little bit more, and so
in the first quarter, we were able to get a few layups, and we were really
aggressive drawing fouls, getting to the rim.  
  
But I think in the second quarter they adjusted, and they have always played
aggressive on on-balls, and so that threw us off a bit. We weren't able to see
or make reads as quick as we should have, and I think we called plays to try
and get down low, but they were doing a really good job taking that away.  
  
Q. Sydney, at halftime, what was this team's mentality like?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, everyone was speaking during halftime. We were saying, to
go back to being that aggressive team offensively, and they got a roll going
on their offensive side of the floor. And so we were talking a lot of
strategy, getting through on-balls, trying to slow down Romero from getting
any clean looks and getting our hands up. We were just trying to come together
and focus on things that we can control and fix going into the second half.  
  
Q. Coach was saying it's the type of run that you don't want to end.
What's going through your mind now that the career is over and that there's
not a next game coming up?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: Well, I'm proud. I'm very proud of what we've been able to
accomplish over our four years. I don't think anyone expected us to do what
we've done, and for that, I'm extremely grateful and proud. I'll never be
ashamed to say that I was a player at Oregon State. But it is hard, because
you put so much time and effort into four years, and no one sees what goes on
behind the scenes. No one sees all the -- just everything that goes on.  
  
So it's tough, but at the end of the day, I'm so grateful to have played with
Sydney Wiese. What she's been able to do is uncanny. It's unlike anything I've
ever seen, and I'm just extremely proud to call her my friend, my sister
[tearing] sorry. Just proud.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: I agree with what Gabby said. It has exceeded expectations
[tearing] and we're a family forever. And so as painful as it is, we've done
some incredible things that we will be able to cherish for the rest of our
lives. And incredibly thankful for Coach Rueck especially. He started all of
it, and so he's the one that brought us all here. He had faith in us from the
beginning. The senior class is so special. I think once we set foot on campus,
we were sisters right from the jump, and we have maintained that throughout
the four years and it's going to continue on. More than just basketball, I
think the season might be over, but these friendships and these relationships
are going to go on forever.  
  
Q. What was the most surprising about the way today went?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: I can't say if it's really a surprise. I think, you know,
you just -- you expect everyone's best effort this time of the year, for sure,
and they certainly -- like we started well but they started coming back and
hitting really, really tough shots. And it's kind of hard to do something
about that. But you just try and make it as uncomfortable for them.  
  
I think we could have done things to adapt a little bit better but it's tough.
They played a great game. Just give them credit. They hit tough shots and you
know, we tried to get back. It's definitely hard, once you've kind of dug a
hole to get back against a team like this. Their athleticism is very
impressive.  
  
So you know, it's nothing really surprising, but I think we just, you know,
thought we had a great chance.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Florida State's guard, Leticia Romero,
she ended up scoring 18 points and one of the first really big games she's had
in a little while. What was it like out there against a Spanish Olympian?  
SYDNEY WIESE: She's good. I mean, bottom line, she's a great player. She was
hitting tough pull-up jumpers. I know our game plan going in was to take away
the three-point line because she's one of the best three-point shooters in the
country. So we were doing what we could against her, and it felt like we were
right there, but it's never close enough with her. And so she did a great job
running the show, hitting shots, and whenever they needed a big play, she came
through for them.  
  
So I mean, Gabby did amazing stuff against her in the second half, and really
made it tough for her to get any good looks. And so we adjusted and we did the
best that we could against her, but I think that she got going early in the
first half and carried that through for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that stretch to open the second half, because
obviously coming in at halftime, there are things you want to do and they come
right back out at you again and take the lead.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, starting it off with the turnover, you know, didn't help.
That hurt. That created momentum for them.  
  
You know, we talked about being the team that did what they did coming out,
and you never know exactly how it's going to go. But you give them credit.
Offensive rebound put-back, transition bucket, and then the turnover number
jumped obviously in the second half a lot for us as we were pressing a little
bit.  
  
And so, what can you say? I mean, you give them credit. They came out and hit
shots.  
  
Q. After the first quarter, how confident were you in your team's
ability to put this away after being up as much as 17 in the first?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I don't know if you're ever confident against a team as
good as this. You know you're playing well but you know they are capable of
it, as well, so you want to sustain.  
  
I thought our defense, I thought we had a little stretch early in the second
quarter where we did not have the same intensity and that gave them momentum,
for whatever reason that is, I'm not sure why. But we're not challenging quite
the same, and shots go down. When you're not within arm's length, you don't
have a chance. Those shots are going to go down for them. I thought we did a
phenomenal job for the most part, making them take tough shots. They hit tough
shots. Transition hurt us, turnovers hurt us, and offensive rebounds hurt us,
even though we won the boards, they had 11, and they only had 5-0 boards in
the second half but they converted every single one of them or drew a foul.
Those hustle plays and their athleticism I thought was the difference.  
  
Q. Both teams had a tough time behind the arc. Was that the defense by
both teams or just off shooting?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great question. I think that we both made each other
really work. We chased them hard all day, and when this team scores below 60,
typically they are susceptible to losing. Same is true for us. And that's
usually one of our advantages, is knocking threes down and having the
discipline to eliminate other teams in that regard. If you would have told me
before the game, they don't hit a three, I would have said, we probably won
the game.  
  
So for us, you know, obviously it wasn't a great shooting game for us,
especially from out there. Why, I'm not sure. The shots that Syd got,
definitely a few of them were forced, but she also got shots that she hits.
The ball just didn't go down. I thought we got some good looks and it just
didn't drop. And when you look at this game, you look at every statistical
category, the one that really stands out is turnovers. But other than that,
it's shooting the ball, and we just did not shoot well enough to beat this
team today.  
  
Q. Florida State, 0-5 from three point range, Thomas -- what does it say
about Florida State being able to survive and advance against you guys, even
though their bread and butter was kind of taken away from them?  
SCOTT RUECK: Great teams have ways of winning, any which way and that's what
we've done all year. That's how you get to near 30 wins; 31, 28, you get there
by being adaptable, playing fast, playing slow, playing through adversity,
playing through foul trouble, whatever it may be.  
  
Today we took that away and they hurt us inside. I think it just put more
emphasis on offensive rebounds, on transition. If you look at their transition
points or points off turnovers, those were created by their defense, and so
they rode their defense today and their defense created points for them. Our
defense did not.  
  
Q. What do you tell them after something like this?  
SCOTT RUECK: There's a lot to tell them. There's a lot to tell them. I had
three minutes and maybe not even that long in there with them, and I just told
them I loved them. What they have done is incredible. And last year's group
was very similar, and this group carried it forward, and they have established
a culture that is going to remain after them, and they have been everything a
coach could hope for; and how hard it was. For what this team accomplished
this year, to be picked fifth, and some people thought fifth in the Pac-12 was
generous, to be honest, before the season; to barely be ranked before the
season and to win this conference for the third straight year, which is the
best in the country this year, you know, that speaks directly to their
leadership and how hard we had to push, and that's what Gabby was alluding to.
Nobody sees all that stuff behind the scenes that got this team with so much
transition going into this year to play at a level capable of being a Sweet 16
team or beyond.  
  
And so I'm just so super proud of them. I don't think that their careers are
going to be defined by today. That would be a mistake in my opinion. Certainly
we would like to continue to play. We wanted to win today. But what they have
accomplished and all the firsts; nobody would argue if you hung all four of
them up in Gill Coliseum. I mean, that's what they have done.  
  
Thank you, everyone.

_Stockton, California_  
  
SOUTH CAROLINA 100, Quinnipiac 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, and please welcome Quinnipiac Bobcats head
coach, Tricia Fabbri and our student athletes, Jen Fay and Adily Martucci.  
  
First we will have an opening statement from Coach Fabbri, and then we will
open up to questions for our student athletes.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: I'd just like to congratulate South Carolina moving on into the
Elite 8. I thought they were very good all day long. We knew we would have our
hands full.  
  
And I said yesterday, I think the lone remark I did say, I knew they were
really good defensively and it was very -- they disrupted us offensively in
terms of really feeling comfortable. That said, I thought we were really
playing very quickly with our shots to start the game, and just looking at our
numbers, we ended up shooting 43 percent overall, which isn't terrible.  
  
But South Carolina lived up to their No. 1 seed all game long, and they were
tough. They were really tough today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start and you know, not only from the
scoreboard from the hole that you guys were in, but what it did mentally to
sort of get off to that start?  
JEN FAY: The first two games we played in the tournament I thought we got off
to really good starts. It wasn't obviously the same this time around. But I
mean, they came out shooting the lights out and we just tried to stay in it
and play hard.  
  
Q. What did Coach Fabbri tell you in that last moment as you walked off
the court?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Just congratulated me. I wasn't too worried about like what
was being said. More of just embracing her for the last time, at least on the
court. Just having a moment with her, that's all. I don't know if like I
remember any of the specific words said, but just hugging my coach.  
  
Q. Either one of you, but Coach talked about how defensively, she knew
coming in they were a problem, but offensively, they were an issue, too. Can
you talk about the problems they caused for you there, too?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Yeah, they shot lights out. Our game plan was to really try to
help off of our players to help our bigs with Wilson. And something's got to
give when that happens. Those threes really were daggers. I felt like they
shot 100 percent from the three-point line; it felt like that. They shot very
well.  
  
Q. Defensively, did they do anything that surprised you, or was it
basically what you knew was coming but done exceptionally well?  
JEN FAY: We ran the same offense that we've been running all year that's been
working really well. I think the difference was that they were just a little
bit faster, a little bit stronger and a little bit bigger and I think it took
its toll as the game went on.  
  
Q. What have these past five years meant to you?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Going to make me -- waterworks over here. Indescribable. Life
changing. The best years of my life. I'm just so proud to be a Bobcat and to
be a part of this family. It's really hard to describe my five years year
because it's been so amazing and just the growth that I've witnessed with our
program and within myself. It's life changing.  
  
Q. I'd like both players to answer. Could you guys just talk, what
changed for this program in the last two weeks?  
JEN FAY: We put our school on the map. Not only do people know how to
pronounce our cool now but they also know who we are and what we stand for and
what we're all about. I think that's the biggest thing is that we left our
mark.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: I'm also, I think we inspired a lot of people back home, and
just different teams on campus. And yeah, it's just inspiring to be an
inspiration.  
  
JEN FAY: Also the mid-major teams that can be in our position now; I think
we've given them a pathway to follow. I think that's pretty cool, too.  
  
Q. What changed? Maybe the bar is different for your program than it
was.  
TRICIA FABBRI: Yeah, it's a great question. We clearly had stated prior to the
start of the season, that getting into the tournament was not the end game
anymore for this program; that winning games was the goal.  
  
And accomplishing that, this day today for us, having the experience while
this loss stings; and obviously South Carolina was so good, and the margin of
victory is not easy to swallow.  
  
But it now, for us, we obviously measured up against one of the top programs
in the country. We clearly know where we stand. We clearly now have our next
steps in the program and where we go now, another route and strategy, is being
hatched.  
  
So how we got here, there was a good foundation set. Not many people outside
our region knew about it, and now we're going to use how everyone knows how to
say Quinnipiac; a week ago, no one knew much about us.  
  
Now everyone in women's basketball has paid attention to our story, and we
plan to use that. Now getting a taste of the Sweet 16, being here the second
weekend will now be a part of what we want to continue to build upon for this
program going forward.  
  
Q. Individual coaches and players and individual accounts in the MAC
have been Tweeting and rooting you guys on, and it seemed like they were along
on this ride with you. What does it mean to play in a conference that has so
much respect between all the programs?  
TRICIA FABBRI: The MAC has such great coaching camaraderie that it doesn't
surprise me at all. We have a school and we have a coach in Bryan Georges;
that this has been accomplished before, so we knew it could be done again.  
  
We talk as coaches about the conference getting multi-bid schools in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a goal of ours. We have Joe Frager, who has won a national
II Division Championship. We have Patty Coyle, who has coached in the WNBA. We
have recent hires in Heather Vulin, and if you look at her resumé, coming from
the BCS schools; and you have Ali Jacques, who has done a good job of turning
a program around at Siena U; Jada Pierce, you look at the resumé. In recent
hires, it is a league full of great coaches in the MAC, and the league is --
we bond together because we know that together we can do even more for this
mid-major.  
  
So this is a big deal on our success across the board in the conference. We're
excited about the direction that the conference is going, about getting more
teams into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. In that first quarter what do you feel like they were doing
defensively and what was it preventing you guys from being able to do?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Well, certainly, I felt like we were playing offensive
basketball. Fast forward, we were not as calm as we had been. And then when a
couple of our shots, where the right shot didn't go in, we were trying to play
too quickly instead of calmly.  
  
And I think that was obviously due because of South Carolina, Jen said it:
Their size, speed and length was disruptive to us. And then, we did, we kind
of -- have to credit South Carolina. But I thought (power interruption) and my
staff certainly enjoyed the most, and ultimately that's the greatest joy in
coaching is watching the maturity and knowing that you in some way, hope that
you helped, and that's the beauty in coaching. Adily is no exception.  
  
Q. At the end of the first quarter, obviously the first quarter wasn't
what you wanted to be. What did you say to the team to get back into it?  
TRICIA FABBRI: They were saying it to themselves: One possession, let's
defend, let's get after it. We took good care of the basketball. Let's just
settle down and set screens.  
  
I thought, you know, we just didn't play as well together as we did over the
weekend and I again, certainly South Carolina had everything to do with that,
but we had made so many good plays, good basketball plays playing against
Miami and Marquette, credit South Carolina.  
  
But I thought we could have done, you know, hopefully just made more plays. I
thought we were not as moving and cutting and reading and playing as well as a
unit today. But again, I can't say it enough. I'm being repetitive, sorry,
South Carolina had a lot to do with that.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning. I'm pleased to welcome South Carolina Gamecocks
coach, Dawn Staley.  
  
DAWN STALEY: We're excited to be in Stockton. We got here yesterday and we got
a couple of -- we got a practice in yesterday, and we're pretty excited about
the challenges that we're faced within this region. We play a tough Quinnipiac
basketball team that we've been preparing for for the past couple of days, and
hopefully that will pay off tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Do you feel like with how successful this team has been, sometimes
it's been a little overlooked, kind of how young it is, and how few seniors
there are, especially with Alaina now out.  
DAWN STALEY: We just approach things the same way. We just try to prep our
players to play each game, and obviously there are a lot of moving parts from
the previous years to this year. Just having new faces, and actually our
perimeter play is totally new in the starting lineup. I just thought they
embraced their roles, and when you embrace your role, the team, you, your
individual self shines and the team shines; and we've been able to combine the
two.  
  
Q. You mentioned the word "tough" in talking about Quinnipiac. What else
do you know about them and how much have you seen them?  
DAWN STALEY: Very skilled team. Very unselfish team. You know, when you look
at their stats, the thing that jumps off the page is the amount of assists to
field goals, is quite an incredible stat that jumps off the page. And that's a
team in which loves to share the basketball. Makes it very difficult for the
opponent.  
  
They love to get ahead of the possession. They get you rocking and rolling
from a defensive standpoint. They are very poised and patient, and they wait
until you make the mistake defensively and make you pay.  
  
So very tough, skilled, unselfish, and watching them play, not surprised that
they are where they are.  
  
Q. How is Allisha, and how much -- how effective do you expect her to
be?  
DAWN STALEY: Allisha practiced. Full practice yesterday. So she's ready to go.  
  
Q. What was it?  
DAWN STALEY: Hamstring. Bad Charley horse.  
  
Q. It seems like your team has been out here a lot in recent years, out
West and in northern California. I recall several years ago when you had Tara
come over and talk to that group. Your program has come a long way since then.
Could you sort of take us through what you've done to bring the program to
this level?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, we've experienced quite a lot of success over the past
years. You know, I attribute that to a lot of things. I attribute that to some
of the former players who believed in our vision when there was no vision for
them to believe in. They believed in the people that made up our program, our
coaching staff.  
  
And then when you have that, along with playing in -- I know some of the
Pac-12 teams will beg to differ, but I think we play in the best conference in
the country. When you have that kind of platform that pushes you every day,
every game, you know, if you can get lucky and get some talented players, you
can experience success in a fair amount of time.  
  
And that's kind of what happened to us where the people and the platform
matched up, and we got lucky and got some great recruits and we just stuck
with it.  
  
I think the main thing is, you have to stay the course, no matter what
happens. You'll lose some games that you're not supposed to lose. You'll win
some games that you're not supposed to and -- you'll win some games you're not
supposed to win, and if you just stay the course, success is bound to happen.  
  
Q. Part of the success of your program has been your fan attendance.
You've built such an incredible fan base at South Carolina. Is it tough now
flying across the country and playing so far away from that group of people
that has been so supportive?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it's hard on our fans because they have been there. They
have supported at home. They do travel. We'll have some fans that will be
here, but it wouldn't be anything like if it was a little bit closer to where
we are. And you know, for them, I feel for them because it's a hardship.
Monetarily, it's hard for them to get out here and support us in the way that
they would like to support us.  
  
But at the same time, they will have watch parties and they will send their
support and they will be here in spirit. But second to none; what our fans
have created for us in our program, they make our team and our program a
lifestyle. I've never seen anything unfold like this in all of my years of
being around basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously Ty being a freshman, this has to be a big step for her. How
has she been handling all this?  
DAWN STALEY: Ty's been calm, cool and collected all season long. She's a point
guard that's probably far beyond her years. She's got a great approach to the
game. She's just composed. When you've played as many games and you've started
as many games as she has in our league; she's battle tested. This stage, I
don't think this stage will phase her. She will approach it the same way.
Hopefully she'll continue to have the success that she's had.  
  
Q. You have a roster right now that basically, everyone has only --
getting No. 1 seeds. And getting to the second weekend of the tournament, and
I wanted to ask, does that change things at all culture-wise, and approach to
players who have really only known this kind of success?  
DAWN STALEY: Yeah, it's kind of weird that A'ja Wilson, Alaina Coates, they
have only lost, I don't know, less than ten games over their careers. Maybe
not Alaina. A'Ja, definitely. It's what they have made it. We just coach and
they bring us along for the ride.  
  
They are committed to winning, and when you have that kind of winning culture,
obviously the winning is part of it, but the culture is the other part of it.
It is our leaders leaving a legacy of leadership of how to do things, of
having a culture of excellence expectations, and living up to those things,
and accountability.  
  
So does it help in recruiting? Absolutely it helps in recruiting to say what
we have accomplished over the years and come be a part of this. But it's a lot
of work. It's not easy. I think sometimes people think it's easy because we've
done it over the last few years, but it gets harder having a target on your
back and being the hunted, instead of hunting.  
  
But you get used to it, and you have to -- I'd rather have it this way than
the other way.  
  
Q. You mentioned Quinnipiac does a great job with their assist-to-field-
goal ratio. How do you try to disrupt that?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, speed has to be involved in playing them. They can't
comfortably look you over and come off their screens. Just play comfortable;
shoot practice shots. When they are able to do that, they can beat anybody in
the country.  
  
So we have to try to disrupt the pace in which they want to play and execute.
And you know, you have to be committed to it for 40 minutes, because if you
don't, they can very well win the game.  
  
Q. Allisha and Kaela were transfers, and it seems like they have
obviously played big roles on the team. Why were they able to come in and fit
in with the team so quickly?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, we're talking about the culture. Obviously they transferred
for a reason, one reason for another, and they chose us. They didn't go out
and start their process over again. They made the calls to us, because they
looked at our program as being right there.  
  
So they were looking for something a little bit different. And when you're
looking for something a little bit different, you're more apt to embrace
whatever role that you're given.  
  
And they have done it, you know, with incredible pride. And you know, I don't
think it always has been as smooth and seamless as we may think it is, because
you know, Kaela is used to having a ball in her hands. At Georgia Tech, she
probably had the ball in her hands 90 percent of the time.  
  
Here at South Carolina, when Alaina Coates was available, she had it maybe,
you know, maybe 30 percent of the time. Now that we don't have it, maybe she's
got it 50 percent of the time. And that's hard. That's a big adjustment.  
  
Allisha Gray is probably a little bit different in that. She just takes what
the defense gives her, and she embraces her role and she doesn't have very
much to say. She's just one that wants to go out and compete and win no matter
what. The way that they have transitioned into our program is they embrace
their roles. They embrace playing with other great players.  
  
And we almost -- you know, you've got to communicate. You've got to talk to
them a lot, and we equate it to that next level. They are all going to go and
play in the WNBA and they are all going to go play with other great players.
You're going to have to learn how to play with other great players, and if
you're pretty good at it, you know, you're going to have some success at the
next level.  
  
Q. How much do your own experiences in the game as a player come up this
time of year, or even reflections to playing for Olympic Gold or any of those
things.  
DAWN STALEY: They really don't come up. Our players, you know, they relate to
the here and now. I played 25, 20 years ago. They probably think the footage
is in black and white of me playing.  
  
We just kind of, you know, as a coaching staff, we just talk about the things
that they relate to now. You make analogies to social, what's happening on
social media, what's happened in the men's tournament, things like that they
can relate to. They can't really relate to when I played.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Staley. Good luck.  
  
Please welcome South Carolina student athletes, A'Ja Wilson and Kaela Davis.  
  
Q. This could be for either of you, both of you. Coach just got done
saying that she feels like her players focus on the here and now and haven't
really asked her -- she doesn't really talk about her playing experience. How
aware are the both of you about her playing experience and is that true, or is
she kind of just dismissing what she has shared with you about how to prepare
for games like this and what her experience was?  
A'JA WILSON: Kind of what she said. She really doesn't really talk about it,
and I don't think I was born when she was playing. So I really didn't know
(laughs).  
  
Q. Have you seen any video?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, I've seen some videos. Seen she's really good. Has some
nice handles. I've heard her hair was crazy. But I mean, from her game,
honestly, she hasn't talked about it. Honestly I haven't paid enough attention
I guess to know how she kind of rolled.  
  
But I know she's a competitor and I know she wanted to win every game. She's
won a lot of games and I think that's pretty much all I know about it, and
Coach Staley is the type of person that doesn't really talk about her game
like that. She really kind of just leaves it kind of to us and let us kind of
figure out our own ways of winning and how to, I guess, see the game.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: Same thing. I think she just takes those experiences and puts
them through coaching. I don't think she talks about her personal experience,
but she puts those experience into our every day practice situations. And
every game, I think she takes her experience and just puts that into her
coaching style.  
  
Q. (What do you know about Quinnipiac and their ranking)?  
KAELA DAVIS: Obviously the team that we're playing, you can't take them
lightly, at all. Obviously they are here for a reason and they have earned
every single bit of that. The number next to their name, it means nothing,
honestly. They are just another team that's, like I said, on their way here,
and we have to come out and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Almost seven years ago, I was there when Dawn came to talk to the
South Carolina locker room after a really hard loss at Stanford, and she's
built something since then, and you two are a big part of that. She spoke to
how it's a matter of building that and keep, you know, getting good players
and getting lucky. What can you say about the growth and what you two have
been a part of?  
KAELA DAVIS: You know, obviously I think, you know, I obviously didn't start
my college career here. But to sit back and just kind of watch, you know, I
think just being within D1 basketball, you watch other games obviously. You
watch other teams. You see kind of this whole story kind of unfolding a little
bit.  
  
You know, obviously with A'Ja coming to South Carolina and Alaina and all the
players that she managed to get into South Carolina, for me personally, it
wasn't hard to make the decision to come to South Carolina and be a part of
that, because I think Coach and the staff here, they are on to something
really special.  
  
So for me personally, it's a blessing just to be able to be a part of it and
hopefully be able to just kind of write our own small little part in history
of South Carolina women's basketball.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Just really going off of Kaela, same thing. It's something
special here. I don't think people would have ever thought -- growing up, you
know the UCONN's, Tennessees, Stanford, but now growing up and seeing that
South Carolina is a part of that, it's special. And just knowing that I am a
part of it and just having a great team and teammates; just building a legacy,
and especially with it being in my backyard, it makes it ten times better for
me.  
  
I give it all to the coaching staff and just like Kaela said, they have really
formed something special, and it's the sky's the limit from here.  
  
Q. Had you guys heard of Quinnipiac before the past couple of weeks, and
have you learned how to say it yet?  
A'JA WILSON: No, not really. But looking at film, they are a really decent,
decent team. You really can't sleep on them at all. I don't want to pronounce
it. I don't want to mess it up. I just know that they are the Bobcats and
Connecticut.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: So what is the official way to say it?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Quinnipiac.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: I just say QP -- all those other letters got to go.  
  
Q. I asked Coach a similar question about the fans base that you guys
have built in South Carolina. For you, having your backyard come to see you
every home game, is it tough now to have to fly across the country and play so
far away from that fan base?  
A'JA WILSON: It is, and I know we have some loyal fans, I know my pastor would
cut church short just so he can come to my games. Our fans are really loyal
and it is tough being out west and them -- not all of them not being there,
but we know that they are here.  
  
We just have to just go out here and just pretend that they are there. I think
that we have enough heart and enough talent that we can take care of business.
But it is tough kind of not having your fans out here. But I feel like they
are here in spirit. We get the text messages; we get the Tweets; we get the
Instagram posts. So we know they are there, just maybe not physically.  
  
Q. What went through, really for both of your mind, when you saw Allisha
being carried off the court in that last game? How worried were you?  
A'JA WILSON: I was very worried, but at the same time, I know Allisha and I
know she's going to get over it. Allisha is like my best friend; she's my
sister. So it was kind of tough seeing her get through it, and looking over at
the bench and her eyes are all red and she's crying. And I'm like, "Girl, you
got to get it together." But I knew she's going to be okay. Allisha, she's
tough. She's a soldier. It's good to see her back on the court and doing
something that she loves.  
  
Q. Do you want to give shout out -- will you give us the name of your
pastor and the name of the church?  
A'JA WILSON: Reverend Dr. Jamey O. Graham, Senior. St. John Baptist Church.  
  
Q. Quinnipiac, this is their first time, how much do you think your
experience in this tournament and at this level can help you where the Bobcats
don't have that experience?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it's going to help us, but at the same time, it is March
and crazy stuff happens in March. It can help us, but at the same time, we
really can't overlook them. We really can't overlook the fact that they are a
great team. They are very fundamentally sound and well coached. We are going
to go out and stick with our game plan and understand that we can't take any
slack off. We just have to continue to do us.  
  
Q. Kaela, can you talk about Coach Staley's style and how she motivates
your team and what attracted you maybe to come to South Carolina?  
KAELA DAVIS: Like I said before, her big thing is, I feel like a lot of it's
based off experience. You know, we always laugh at it but she's always talking
about the way things sound, the way it looks, the way it feels.  
  
You don't say that unless you've felt that yourself. Like I said, I think the
biggest thing that drew me there was just her experience. She's been in these
situations before, whether it be in college basketball, professionally. I
think at one point she was playing and coaching at the same time.  
  
You know, just to have somebody that's been in so many different situations.
She's been with USA Basketball and now she's getting to coach USA Basketball.
She's been there, done that, and I think as somebody that aspires to do those
same things and to take their basketball career further, you know, I
definitely think she's somebody that can help with that.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up. You and Allisha have played big roles on the
team after transferring. How easy or difficult was it to transition and become
-- to kind your niche in a big role with this team after transferring?  
KAELA DAVIS: I think last year helped a little bit. You're not so much just
thrown into the fire. You kind of get to sit back and watch a little bit. And
at the same time, just being in practice, you know, obviously we didn't get to
play but we definitely practiced. Just kind of got a feel for everybody a
little bit. It was a process.  
  
I think even up until today, it's still kind of a process. Every game is
different. Some days, it's Allisha goes off; some days I go. You roll with
whatever happens. I don't know, it's like I said, it's been a bit of a
process, but it's been an exciting one. Just because we've gotten to learn so
much about ourselves and each other, and I definitely think Allisha and I will
be a lot better off because of this experience.  
  
Q. Years ago, Tara VanDerveer would snap a rubber band on her wrist as a
player at Virginia; whenever she would make a mistake of any kind and snap
herself with that rubber band. Does that surprise you ladies at all, and are
there any little quirky things she does now, all these years later as a coach
that crack you up?  
A'JA WILSON: I think the snapping of the rubber band -- stuffing her mouth
with Lifesavers. I think that's a switch. I think every time I look at her,
her mouth is all, like just like filled with Lifesavers and she's yelling at
us. I think that's just the flip of the rubber band. And she spits it out
sometimes and it's nasty (laughter). Don't tell her I said that.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: Yeah, she does, she has a ton of candy. I think she just eats
candy if something happens.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Keeps her from yelling at us so loud.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: She'll just eat a Lifesaver and think about what she wants to say
before she says it, which we can be very thankful for.  
  
Seriously, if you look at, right next to the bench next and the little like
scorer's table, it's a line of candy. It's Lifesavers --  
  
A'JA WILSON: I've really only seen the white ones.  
  
KAELA DAVIS: She really only eats the white ones, but there's a ton of candy.
I think candy is a supplement.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Yes, just kind of a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Well, thank you, ladies, and best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Brittany Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28842)

### [Shakayla Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28353)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Seminoles won their first round over Western Illinois 87-66
and defeated Missouri in the second round 77-55. This is Florida State's 16th
NCAA Tournament appearance and the fifth time the Seminoles have reached the
round of 16.  
  
We'll start off with an opening statement from Coach Semrau and then we'll
open up for questions.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, thank you very much. Just thank you so the City of Stockton
for hosting this event. I know it's a lot of work and certainly a lot of
energy has gone into building the interest and the infrastructure for such an
event. So we're extremely excited to be here.  
  
Excited about the opportunity to step into a great match-up against Oregon
State, a tremendous basketball team. Extremely well coached. Very disciplined.
Hard-nosed, work hard. Scott is a friend of nine and does a fantastic job.  
  
Q. You focused a lot on the now with this team. How have they handled
this week and then especially now that you guys have arrived here in
Stockton?  
SUE SEMRAU: That's been really key for us. We are fortunate enough that we
have been able to advance to three back-to-back to back Sweet 16s. So we can
learn, but we certainly can't think back on to that, or think about what could
be or what should be. We've got to focus on a very good Oregon State team.  
  
Q. You mentioned you knew Scott Rueck, Oregon State's coach, and you're
also from Seattle. I'm just kind curious on your thought, not just on Oregon
State's rise over the last few years, but with what Washington has done, the
rest of the Pac 12; as somebody who has been outside of it, but somebody who
is also familiar with this part of the country.  
SUE SEMRAU: Absolutely. I knew Scott when he was coaching at George Fox, and
what a great job he did there and what an excellent hire that they made at
Oregon State.  
  
I grew up a Pac 8 kid and then went to the Pac-10 and now it's Pac-12.
Certainly it's been so much fun to watch the growth of that conference. I
never knew there was much east, because I was always in school when things
were going on out east, and now I don't get to keep up with the West as much
because I'm in bed when things are happening in the West.  
  
But you can't argue with what the Pac-12 has done in women's basketball and
certainly the way they are represented in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. What sticks out most to you when you look at their lineup across the
board?  
SUE SEMRAU: You know, the thing I always think about when I see Scott's teams,
they are just solid. You know, they all play their role. You know that they
are going to come to compete and to work.  
  
And fortunately, we are in a conference in the ACC where we have quite a
number of teams, as well, that were in the NCAA Tournament, still are in the
NCAA Tournament, and we come up against that night-in and night-out, as well.
Both teams are battle tested. We look forward to playing that Pac-12/ACC
matchup.  
  
Q. Brittany has been with you for four years. How have you seen her
evolve as a leader in those four years? And how is she able to turn on being
goofy and turn on being a serious competitor on the court?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, you know, I've known Brittany since she was like a sixth
grader. She came to camp and was a kid that you knew was always going to
compete. I didn't know she would have such a vibrant personality, and that is
something that really makes us go. She's a fierce competitor. Her parents were
her high school coaches, so that's all she's ever known.  
  
But she's also, just loves people, and if you ask anyone in Tallahassee, as
you very well know, Brittany Brown could probably run for mayor. She's
somebody that is always reaching out and giving to so many people. I would
love to watch; and her expanded scope in that. It was just smaller, and now,
it's -- I just received a letter from someone; their 12-year-old girl wrote a
speech on the fact that Brittany Brown was her hero. And one of the reasons
why is because of the way that she gives and the way she fights and continues
to fight.  
  
You know, to get those types of things, you're just so proud as a coach of the
player that she's become and the way that she impacts so many lives.  
  
Q. Why is Shakayla Thomas ACC Player of the Year in your opinion?  
SUE SEMRAU: My opinion is a little biased, but I do think that when you get a
chance to be with her every single day in practice, there's just no question
that she's deserving. She's humble. She works extremely hard. She's extremely
selfless.  
  
And you a lot of times think of Player of the Year as somebody that maybe has
to have the attention, and that's not Shakayla. That's why I'm so proud that
the ACC is represented by a Player of the Year with that type of character.
She's athletic; take that for granted; but there's a lot of great athletes out
there, and she works. She's in the gym before practice. She's in the gym at
midnight. We're fortunate to have 24-hour access to our gym, and she uses it,
and that's why she's the ACC Player of the Year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Florida State's student athletes, Brittany Brown
and Shakayla Thomas.  
  
Q. For Brittany, you've been here at Florida State now for four years.
You've had your fair share of success. Just what's different about your senior
year and playing in one last Sweet 16, Elite 8 and maybe even Final Four?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I think the difference is the group of girls on the team. I
was just telling a couple people earlier that the difference in this team is
just our chemistry, and I don't know, this team's just so selfless. It doesn't
matter who gets the credit. We're fighting for one another this year. That's
been our motto all year.  
  
And I've just seen this team, when adversities hit, that we used to splinter
apart in the previous years, and I think that was a big difference-maker the
further you go in the tournament.  
  
As we hit adversity throughout this season, I've just seen us come together
and it's just made us stronger. So I'd just say the group of girls and how we
fight for one another every day.  
  
Q. We were talking yesterday about your hometown in Alabama and you
being a small-town girl from a small state. Can you give me more of a sense of
your popularity in your hometown, and just kind of the reaction that your
hometown fans have toward what you've done in your career at Florida State,
and what kind of love they might be sending your way this weekend?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Considering, like you said, I'm from a small city, so I have
people come to me every day or every other day and be like, "You're the mayor
of Sylacauga," and I'll just be like, that's not true, yet. (Laughter).  
  
But I feel like the love they show is unbelievable. They send out prayers and
messages to me, literally every day. It could be just like a regular day, and
I feel like that's much needed, considering where we are right now.  
  
Q. Brittany you're known as being kind of a fun person off the court,
but what's kind of the key to being a good leader, being fun off the court,
and then zoning in when it's time to play?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I think that my teammates, they make it easier. Yes, I'm the
clown all the time. But I feel like that's when my team needs to give them
energy. We have a couple of introverts -- well, quite a bit of introverts, but
a little bit of extroverts and I'm one of those. That's just a way that I get
my team going. I do it on the court and off the court.  
  
But this group of girls, they just make it so much easier. If I'm fussing at
them, they respond. If I'm trying to get them hyped, they respond. And that
makes it so much easier to be a good leader, even in times when things aren't
going your way.  
  
Q. Shakayla, I was going through the stats and see that you've not
attempted a three-point shot yet this season. Where and how do you get your
offense?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I get my offense off jumpshots and layups. I never really
needed the whole three-point shooting thing. It's just never been part of my
game.  
  
I'm more of the attacker person. That's the only thing I look for honestly. So
I feel like that's the only thing I'll live and die by. Like that's my bread
and butter right there.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Brittany and her leadership ability, and just
how she rubs off on the rest of the team?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I've had better (laughter). No, I'm just kidding.  
  
Brittany's just like, like she said before, she's this all-around fun person.
So it's like sometimes when she'll be talking to me, getting on me, I'll be
laughing. But it's like, I know she's serious, but it's like, I know you
personally. So it's like -- okay.  
  
I feel like she's actually made me better. Like the way she gets -- like the
way she carries herself on and off the court, I feel that's the greatest.
People need that in their lives and I feel like me playing with her this year
and for the past three years, that's made me a great player, because I feel
like I piggyback off whatever she does.  
  
So like whatever Brittany's doing, I'm doing the same thing, or trying to do
the same thing. So I feel like she's a great leader and that's what we need.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. You can take turns maybe. Can you talk about
the game tomorrow and what you're concentrating on? I'm hearing maybe get out
and run is maybe a goal.  
BRITTANY BROWN: Well, I definitely agree with that just because our
conference, ACC conference, is fast, and that's something that we're really
good at in transition, but in order for us to do that, we have to be really
good on the defensive end. Oregon State, they are known for their size. They
are known for out-rebounding opponents by ten-plus. In a way, that's what we
do well, as well. That's what we're focusing on. Of course, defending and
rebounding, but also a lot has to do with us focusing on what we do best as a
team and just putting that into play tomorrow.  
  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I feel like our main focus is Florida State basketball. We're
not, you know, too shabby with it. We're just going to focus on ourselves.  
  
Now Oregon State is a great team, and we've been practicing countless (ph) for
them and I feel like they are going to come out there and play their game and
we're going to play our game, and it's just going to be a great game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
STOCKTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+STOCKTON)

  

## March 24, 2017

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Gabriella Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30898)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State Beavers head coach, Scott Rueck.  
  
The Beavers won their first round game against Long Beach State with a score
of 56-55 and defeated Creighton in the second round, 64-52. This is Oregon
State's ninth tournament appearance overall and the third time they have
reached the round of 16.  
  
First we'll start with an opening statement from Coach Rueck.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: What an awesome opportunity this team has created once again for
them self. As you think back to this point of the year, you reflect a bit.
This was a team picked fifth before the season in their own conference, and
they have found a way to earn a 2-seed, and then the awesome opportunity to
play within our own region to where our fans can travel, and we're in our same
time zone. And how special is that; that we got to have a meal at one of our
player's houses last night.  
  
You know, just a dream scenario for our program, and an incredible opportunity
with three other incredible teams. To still be playing at this time of the
year means a lot of special things has happened, and that's true of all three
of us.  
  
Three outstanding coaches, three outstanding teams, and an awesome opportunity
against an incredible Florida State team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit more on just how cool it is to play
in your own time zone when the other three teams are all from the East Coast
and had to fly across the country to get here?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, the opposite has been true for us: This is the first time
for us, other than the first two rounds, of course, where we have been in our
own time zone all three years, the last three, anyway. To us it's a bit unique
to be honest.  
  
I don't really see a difference, completely. I mean, for us it's another game,
and it's another scenario; it feels a bit like conference. You are guaranteed
40 and you hope for 80 minutes, of course, of basketball this weekend.  
  
Other than that, it's get on a plane and go to a hotel and go play. This time
of the year, no matter where you're at, that's the case. But the normalcy,
maybe that's the advantage for us. You know, it feels normal.  
  
These teams, though, at this time of year, I think, you know, a year ago we
had to travel to Dallas and we played very well that weekend. So I would
anticipate the same for these three teams. To be playing at this point, you
have a maturity to your program, you have great leadership and you handle any
kind of adversity well. You've been doing it all year to get here.  
  
So I think those things may not be as significant as maybe people think.  
  
Q. I've read how Sydney has wanted to play Florida State. Is that a
program you guys catch or have studied, or just watch from afar with some
admiration over the years?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, you have to have admiration. You know, what Sue's done is
unbelievable. They are always a great team to watch. For some reason, we've
avoided them just by chance.  
  
We've been in a couple of the same places; one, Dallas last year. So we
watched them play Baylor in the round of 16, and certainly thought that was a
team that if we got out of our DePaul game, we could see them; that they had
that much talent that beating Baylor was not out of the question, as good as
Baylor was.  
  
You know, they have been fun to watch. You follow Romero; that was a big story
and you get Shak Thomas, and so it's a program that has demanded attention and
so they are easy to watch, easy to get to know, and therefore, easy to follow.  
  
For Syd, I'm not really sure. You'll have to ask her that when she gets in.
But for me, I've gotten to know Sue over the years and she has northwest ties,
and I know that. So it's a team we haven't played yet. They provide a lot of
challenges, and so it should be a great game.  
  
Q. What goes into stopping a player like Shakayla Thomas, so much
athleticism and she can dunk at 5-11. How do you stop such a strong inside
threat?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great question, and I don't know if you do, completely
stop her. Because of that athleticism, because of her drive and her ability,
her skill set where she can hurt you at the rim, you know, literally, and from
the perimeter; she provides a lot of challenges.  
  
I think what everybody has seen right now, across the country, is the
strengths of our conference. You know, we've got five of the 16 out of the
Pac-12 and could have easily had six, you know, if things had gone right in
the last minute at South Carolina for Arizona State.  
  
I think all of us are really prepared. We've got outstanding athletes within
this conference. You look at Monique Billings, that's one that stands out. You
look at forces like Kristina Anigwe; certainly Plum; certainly, you know, you
just go down the list of all the great players throughout our conference.  
  
And you know, Shak Thomas is another incredible player, and so this team is
prepared to adapt game plans, adapt to prepare to stick with game plan as long
as it takes and to be as gritty as necessary to get the job done.  
  
And with a player that's as formidable as that, that's what you have to do. I
don't know if you stop her, but hopefully, hopefully, we can make her really
work for whatever she gets.  
  
Q. What appealed about Kat Tudor as a recruit and how has that
translated to her first season playing college ball?  
SCOTT RUECK: Kat's a dream. The first thing that stands out is her ability to
shoot the ball. I mean, that's the first thing.  
  
When you get in a gym and watch a team play and you see somebody hit seven
threes in the first half of a game, I don't care what kind of a game it is,
that stands out. And then you start doing your research, and you find out who
she is as a person and where she comes from in regards to her family and
parents, all you see is first class, incredible competitor and high character.
A.  
  
Then you keep looking and find out she played at St. Marys Stockton, of course
I knew that before. And then we have the parallels with Ali Gibson, who was
one of the pillars of our program and our first true four-year recruit at
Oregon State in my time there; same program in high school, same AAU program
and plays the same way. And Ali had an incredible career and started every
game she played for Oregon State. And so, you look at all those things.  
  
And you know, in recruiting, you're basically trying to limit gambles and
you're trying to make great guesses, really, on your research, and everything
aligned for Kat to be a great fit at Oregon State, and that's what she's been
and will be.  
  
So she's an awesome addition. Stretches the floor, is picking up our system,
and joined a team that has turned out to be a Top-10 team and adapting very
well. That was a big-time recruit for us, and she's going to have an
incredible career.  
  
Q. What does it say about Geno's love for women's basketball in general
when he opens up his sweatshirt today and shows a Quinnipiac t-shirt
underneath?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think he can relate and I know I can. There's a lot of coaches
that have been very successful for a long period of time that started at the
bottom. And you look back at where Connecticut was, where he took over, and
where Tricia, you know, what she's accomplished in her career.  
  
I was not familiar with them until, really, this year, because we played them
in December. And researched her and had her Wikipedia up (laughs). And who is
she and why is this team so good? It was kind of funny, because we went down
to shake hands with her, and she said, "Oh, it's great to meet you."  
  
I'm like, "Me? How about you?" I'm like, "I'm excited to meet you," and all
the things that she's accomplished.  
  
So I think Geno just respects that grind. There's a reason he's where he is,
and it's due to hard work and grit. You think with a team that has as much
talent as Connecticut has now and has for 25,30 years, but his job is easy.
Quite the opposite.  
  
It's evident this year, as every year: He know what he's doing and they work
hard and they are as gritty as any team there is. So he respects that story,
no matter where it comes from.  
  
And so I don't know what their relationship is. I don't have the insight into
that. But it doesn't surprise me. And so for me, yeah, I think every coach,
that's a great idea that he had.  
  
But if every coach could do the same thing, I think we'd all do it, because
what an awesome story that is. For a team to go into Miami like they did and
play the way they did and take every punch and just answer it time and again;
it's very similar to what Long Beach State did the other day at our place,
very similar. You've got a team that's pretty much overmatched but just plays
with so much heart and they give themselves a chance and they are fighting
like crazy, and they have veterans and so much grit.  
  
When you think of UCONN, you think of grit and toughness and sustained
excellence. I think that's him tipping his cap to a program that's doing it
right in every which way, every way that he respects.  
  
Q. What does it say and mean that this senior class is the first in
school history to have made the NCAA Tournament all four years?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, you've got a group that believed in a vision and had the
courage and toughness to see it through; the competitive will and the fight to
not only get there but to do every little thing right.  
  
You know, what they have done within our conference is unprecedented by
anybody other than Stanford. To win this conference three straight years and
to go 16-2 three straight years in a conference is absolutely remarkable, when
the conference, as everybody is saying, is the best it's ever been.  
  
You know, for those of us who have been around and have been able to
experience Gill coliseum, I know Dawn's got something very special going at
South Carolina with their fans, and that happens a few places in the country.
But Gill coliseum has some magic to it that I think would be hard to match
anywhere, and that's because of these seniors, and the seniors from last year,
as well.  
  
I don't know if you know the whole story; if there's a better story in our
game, than what they have done. I get to talk about them with so much pride
and I'm so proud of them the way they conduct themselves, because they have
made this whole thing bigger than them the entire time, and they truly have
become an inspiration to anybody they have come in contact with.  
  
For me, it's just been an absolute dream, you know, to be able to be in the
gym with them for four straight years and watch them grow, not only as
players, but especially as people and leaders, and take on, this year, the
expectations in their minds, were to get right back here. No one else, though,
had that expectation.  
  
And so when those expectations on the outside dropped, they said no. No, we
are going to get back to where we were a year ago. And for me, to basically to
get out of the way and watch it happen has been a joy and a dream.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Oregon State's student athletes, Gabriella
Hanson and Sydney Wiese.  
  
Q. Florida State is a team with guards that like to rebound. Brittany
Brown is 5-6 and will go up and get a rebound with the best of them. As a
guard, what do you do to stop that, and how do you limit their impact inside
the paint?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think the biggest thing is to make sure that we stay in
position.  
  
For Florida State, no play is ever over for them, and so the biggest thing for
us as guards is to make sure that we find them and use the fundamentals that
we have been learning throughout the season about boxing out. Put a body on
them early, and at least keep them away from getting the ball. If we don't
necessarily get the rebound either, that's fine. But just as long as they
don't, either, we did our job.  
  
Q. This could be for either player. I asked your coach the same player.
Shakayla Thomas, ACC Player of the Year, on a bit of a scoring tear. What goes
into stopping someone who is so athletic and can really hurt a team from mid-
range?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: Well, I think she's kind of an unconventional player because
she's playing in a forward spot but she's basically a guard.  
  
So I mean, her athleticism is incredible, and so our post players are going to
have to be extremely disciplined in how they play her positioning-wise and
limiting her to one shot, and boxing her out is going to be extremely
important. Then just helping them out as much as we can. It's all about
positioning in this type of game, and especially with athletic -- or as
athletic as she is.  
  
Q. As seniors, you guys know that when it's over, all the seniors are in
the same boat. Is that something that drives you do you guys talk about it? Or
is it just, hey, we're going to lock down and do what we do?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think there's an added sense of urgency this part of the year.
Even in the Pac-12 Tournament, we didn't want to lose, because there's -- each
game could be your last. So you play with that urgency, but you also stick to
what has gotten to us this point. And you stick to the game plan; you focus on
what you can control, and you can't really -- you can't predict whether you're
going to win or lose. You just make sure you do whatever you can while you're
out there and you have the opportunity and you make the most of your time.  
  
GABRIELLA HANSON: I would 100 percent agree. I think it's just a different
feeling knowing that you never again get to have this opportunity. Never again
will I be able to play in an Oregon State jersey on March 27 of 2000, whatever
the case may be.  
  
So it's just a different level, like Syd said of urgency, of will, that for
sure, any game can be your last and you never get a chance to do it again. So
you put your heart and soul into it, bottom line.  
  
Q. Is it helpful that you guys are playing on the West Coast, when all
the other guys are flying across the country?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: It's certainly nice, for sure, traveling-wise, yeah, not
having to travel as far. But we know our fans travel great anywhere we go. We
love Beaver Nation, and they are going to bring their spirit. Wherever we are,
they will come.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think even if the other three teams have had to travel
across the country, it's postseason. It doesn't matter where you're playing,
what time you're playing at. Everyone is going after the same goal, the
National Championship.  
  
Is it an advantage? I don't think we look at it like that. I think we are more
fortunate enough to have our fans so close by, and we're going to do what we
can. And I know our fans are going to show up for us, but the focus is the
same, whether we're on the West or the East Coast.  
  
Q. Sydney, I read that you liked watching Florida State from afar, as
much as you get that opportunity. But haven't played them. Is that kind of fun
to see a team that you know a little bit about but actually get to face?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, Gabby and I were actually talking about that when we saw
the bracket in our ream on come out that we would potentially have the
opportunity to play Florida State, and Romero is -- did you ever play against
her? She played against Romero on the international circuit, and I've had the
opportunity this year and even last year, to watch them play.  
  
They are very well coached, very talented. They have always been fun to watch.
So to have an opportunity to play against them and see what we can do against
them, very fortunate and blessed for this opportunity to see what we can do
with it.  
  
So we are looking forward to it. We are looking forward to getting out there
on the court today in the arena, getting a vibe for it, and then come game
time tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck tomorrow.

_Stockton, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Quinnipiac Bobcats head coach, Tricia Fabbri.  
  
The Bobcats defeated Marquette 68-65 in the opening round becoming one of 21
No. 12 seeds of all time to win their first game. In the second round they
beat Miami 85-78 to become the fourth-ever 12-seed to defeat a 5-seed.
Quinnipiac is also the first team since 2014 to reach the round of 16 as a
12-seed.  
  
First we'll have an opening statement from Coach Fabbri.  
  
TRICIA FABBRI: Thank you. Well, I can say, you know, on the bus ride over,
thinking to myself, and I would imagine my players, as well, that at some
point, you watch the Sweet 16 on TV, and you dream that one day, you're
playing in that game in this tournament.  
  
I know that certainly was my dream a long time ago, and for that dream to
become a reality, and to make this possible, this opportunity possible, to be
playing in the Sweet 16, we're really excited to be here. We're really excited
with the opportunity to play against South Carolina in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Geno is wearing a shirt -- did you see that? Did you hear about this
today?  
TRICIA FABBRI: I did.  
  
Q. What does that mean to you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Well, first of all, Geno has been such a mentor for me going
way back. He helped me in this process, get a job at Quinnipiac a long, long
time ago, 22 years ago. But really just a gold standard, a great guy, and then
he was so excited. He reached out as soon as we won, and so complimentary of
what we were able to accomplish over the weekend.  
  
The fact that he is wearing our shirt in support of our team in this
tournament at this time, just so thankful, and very grateful for his support
and UCONN women's basketball's support of Quinnipiac's women's basketball, and
the two teams in Connecticut here representing women's basketball in the Sweet
16.  
  
Q. You've been here for 22 years now, and to work all that way to
getting a Sweet 16 and to do it with your daughter on the roster, what
experience has that been for the two of you?  
TRICIA FABBRI: The year and the team and the players and the coaches that we
have shared it with, the administration, the university, has been special and
historic. And to share that with your daughter, who is, you know, obviously
helped us so much this year.  
  
You know, when you recruit players, you hope that, you know, you get what you
think you're going to get out of them. But knowing Carly, and knowing my
daughter, I had the advantage of knowing what I was getting when she said yes
to Quinnipiac.  
  
Q. What's it like for you to coach against Coach Staley, and what
concerns you most about her team?  
TRICIA FABBRI: My goodness. I don't think there's enough time in this press
conference to run through the challenges that we're going to see tomorrow from
Coach Staley and her team.  
  
They are so talented. They are an elite program. You just start with the fact
that the experience that they have here in this game and in this round, is
first and foremost. The talent that they possess: From Wilson all the way
down, right down the roster; how they score points. And really what's most
impressive to the staff, as we have prepared, as we continue to prepare our
team, is really how they defend. I think they are a really outstanding
defensive ballclub.  
  
So we have our hands full all day tomorrow.  
  
Q. With Morgan and Adily there, their name cards up here, Adily fifth-
year red-shirt and Morgan a senior, how great is it to see all their hard work
and contributions pay off with this right here?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Ultimately, this answer, it sounds like we're not done -- we
still have another game. But when you already know that you have helped your
team and program make history, it has to feel so satisfying when you Wake up
that you have left and made and helped this program be better than when you
came in. It's an incredible feeling for them, as it is for us.  
  
Q. For people that don't know that much about your team, can you explain
what makes Quinnipiac go the way it does, and how did you guys get here?  
TRICIA FABBRI: My goodness. This year, we have been a really good defensive
team. We have definitely identified ourselves, getting back and playing really
hard-nosed, sound rules, shutting down other teams, their strengths, what they
want to do.  
  
But ultimately our mentality has been one about grit and finding ways and
being unselfish and being a balanced team, and on any given night, we have had
a player find a way to make plays and put the ball in the basket. We have had
balance. We have had unselfishness, but we have talent. We play together, and
our strength is in team.  
  
Q. Last year when this team lost in the MAC Tournament, Maria Napolitano
was the only student that graduated and moved on. How much do you think that
loss has been fueling extra motivation to get to this point?  
TRICIA FABBRI: I think that whenever you come up just a little bit short that,
is always a fire in the belly that never goes away, and it definitely
motivated us all throughout the summer into the spring, into the season, and
into everything that is still going on in this tournament for sure.  
  
Q. With the amount of hoopla going around campus about this team and the
excitement of being the underdog throughout this tournament, how do you keep
this team focused and let them know you still have another game to play?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Because they do that themselves. Again, this is a very
motivated group. They are excited with everything that has transpired in one
week but they are extremely grounded because of Morgan, Adily, the experience
that we have, the expectation that we have to be here; the expectation to have
success in the NCAA; to attain that, that's an expectation that they wanted.  
  
So to be here and still have business on hand, it's very grounding, and they
are task oriented and a goal-oriented group in doing it together. They are
enjoying the moment, but they are very much about taking care of business and
the business trip at hand and being able to stay focused at the task at hand.
They have been extremely grounded through getting on the plane yesterday to
being out -- to being here for 24 hours.  
  
Q. You guys might be known to some as the smaller town community team
from Connecticut, but you have players from four different countries. People
might not know that. What kind of dynamic does that add to the team in terms
of the culture and how they interact with one another?  
TRICIA FABBRI: Again, because I think we have such a close-knit -- we have the
literal piece of family, and that has been all encompassing of, again, tells a
little bit of something of who we are; that that's what makes us who we are.  
  
And even though we have come from all areas from the globe, that we are able
to really become one unique family, from the international parts of the world,
from Latvia, Ireland, Canada, to while we're in Connecticut and out in Arizona
and Wisconsin, our basketball family, when they were going through this entire
process, they found the attraction in each other and what we were trying to
achieve and go forward with with this program.  
  
Getting to the Sweet 16, has been stated with these young ladies on this
roster, and that drew them to being a part of and making history. That's the
dynamic; that's us being very progressive and that's something that they were
excited to achieve here. That's something that had not been done before, but
the attraction to helping us achieve more, was the real, you know -- I guess,
you know, tradition kind of -- the university in and of itself is a very
progressive and dynamic culture. And I think the basketball emulates what the
university is in that we are always progressive in moving forward in
education.  
  
That's how the basketball, how they were; we weren't set. We're young in this
Division I world of athletics and we wanted to go forward and be dynamic and
unique in our own approach and I think that was really attractive to
everybody, regardless of where they were from; that they found a thread that
was going to bind them together through basketball.  
  
Q. Wilson is such a dominant player down low. What are you going to do
to slow her down?  
TRICIA FABBRI: We play tomorrow. I think Coach may have someone watching this
press conference. So I can't let the -- you know, there's a plan in place.
We're going to work extremely hard to make it difficult to have them throw in
with ease and do our best to limit touches as best we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach Fabbri, and best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adily, one of the things that South Carolina has is a lot of length.
I think they have five players at 6-2 or above. How do you try to counter
that, knowing that can be difficult to place?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Definitely a lot of help defense with that. Also boxing out,
since they are so much taller than us, we've really got to concentrate on
getting boards and just pushing them out of the paint.  
  
Q. For all of three of you, can you talk about the opportunity that you
have in front of you, the confidence that you have leading up to this point
and how confident are you going into tomorrow's game?  
JEN FAY: I mean, I think coming off of obviously two huge wins, is going to
make us more confident than ever, and we know this game is probably going to
be even harder than the first two. But there's no doubt in our mind that we
can pull off another upset.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Just agreeing with Jen. Every game you build more and more
confidence after every win. This opportunity, it's amazing. I really can't put
it into words because it's just unreal, the opportunity in front of us.  
  
MORGAN MANZ: I think we are really excited to be here, and just the
opportunity at hand, you know, we're really grateful for it and we're going to
leave it all out on the floor. However long it takes, we'll hopefully get
another upset.  
  
Q. In every situation, except the round of 32, you've been able to go to
Tricia because she's been in every situation, and she hasn't been in this
situation as a coach. How have you handled that? You guys are really the ones
that have as much experience in this situation as she does.  
JEN FAY: We're all in this together, so I mean, just because she -- none of us
have ever been in this experience before. So I think we're all going to go
through it together, the ups and the downs, and just work our way through.  
  
ADILY MARTUCCI: The biggest thing is trust; trust that they will give us a
game plan, and them trusting in us to execute that game plan.  
  
Q. Did you see this photo of Geno in your shirt today?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: Yeah, I did.  
  
Q. And maybe if any of you can reflect on how much that means to you.  
ADILY MARTUCCI: It's awesome. Just the support we've had in general, and then
especially from him and his team. Just being Connecticut teams in general, the
support is amazing. I mean, he's a great coach, and the spotlight is always on
him; a lot of people saw that. And it's just amazing, the support. We really
appreciate it.  
  
Q. Coach Fabbri has complimented you a lot throughout this year, and
your leadership to this team. What can you say about her as a coach and how
she's helped you throughout your five years here with the program?  
ADILY MARTUCCI: You know, our success starts from the top and trickles its way
down, and she is the head of this team. And I look up to her as a role model
for a leader. And it all starts with her to be honest, and, you know, she's
one of my biggest models.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, and good luck tomorrow.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Mai-Loni Henson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34198)

### [Hannah Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34199)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
JODY WYNN: Thank you for having us. We're all rookies here, all three of us.
First time being here, and it's been a great morning so far. We're excited
about what's in store for the rest of the day and to talk to you a little bit
about Husky women's basketball.  
  
Q. Congratulations. Welcome to the conference. What's been your biggest
challenge so far?  
JODY WYNN: Figuring out who can practice every single day. Who do we have in
practice, honestly? We just had a few injuries and knickknack things that are
sidelining some players.  
  
But outside of that, nothing too much. It's been a very welcoming environment,
one in which my coaching peers have helped with the adjustment and just living
in a new city and a new state for the first time.  
  
So, yeah. Just the logistics of maybe getting our whole family up to Seattle
has probably been the most difficult thing.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
JODY WYNN: Lot of heart, lot of grit, lot of toughness. I want people to
recognize that we're playing with full hearts and a whole lot of passion every
single possession, that we don't take possessions off, based on our effort.
Our attitude is high, positive, and that we control the controllables.  
  
Q. In terms of your freshmen, what are you hoping for this year in your
freshmen? Your team is kind of in the middle of some upperclassmen. How do you
see your freshmen contributing? And if you can give us a couple names that you
think will be factors this year.  
JODY WYNN: Sure. We have five freshmen, three I brought in late and two that
signed with the former staff in the fall last fall. They're going to be thrown
into the fire right away.  
  
We only have two active seniors on the roster right now. So a lot of youth.
They bring a lot of spunk, a lot of energy.  
  
To name one or two, that might be a little difficult at the present because we
just started workouts again.  
  
But Kierra Collier is a guard out of Kansas City, and she's athletic,
defensive guard. A long lefty that creates a lot of offense through her
defense. So she's a pretty special talent.  
  
I will say that Missy Peterson, a guard that we brought in late that has a
really good IQ for her age, she understands how to make people better around
her.  
  
But, honestly, all five of them bring something valuable to the table. Khayla
Rooks is a high-IQ kid that can play all over the basketball court.  
  
So just time will tell, but they're definitely going to be thrown into the
fire if they continue to work as hard as we need them to.  
  
Q. Seems like a unique situation you're stepping into. Obviously has
been a great run of success there, but lose two WNBA picks and consensus
Player of the Year, but how have you approached this challenge as you've
settled into the job?  
JODY WYNN: With one foot in front of the other every single day. I think
Kelsey, Chantel, Katie, Heather, Coach Neighbors and his staff did a
phenomenal job of bringing Huskies women's basketball back to national
prominence. It's something where the community continually talks about the
women's pass ball program, and it's not even close to being season.  
  
So our job is to embrace what was before us, learn lessons of how to work
extremely hard and to achieve great things.  
  
And that's what we're taking from those girls that have since graduated and
moved on and to now establish our own identity, and that is just working
extremely hard and understanding that we have a great opportunity.  
  
We're in an amazing city that really loves and embraces women's basketball. So
we have a ton of people that really understand this transition and what we're
going through right now, to really let our players know that it's a phenomenal
opportunity to play in the No. 1 conference in America on such a great stage
in an amazing city for an awesome university and why not them.  
  
Q. For the players, what is the most exciting part about this
transition, and what is the most difficult part?  
HANNAH JOHNSON: I think the most exciting part is everyone gets an opportunity
now. I think people obviously get to step up and play a bigger role, myself
included and Mai-Loni, and maybe roles we didn't play before. But it's just an
opportunity.  
  
There is no pressure. It's just play the game of basketball, have fun, and
play hard. I think that's really exciting. And the system that we run is an
equal opportunity system. So everyone gets an opportunity to score the
basketball and make plays. So just being able to play freely with the
basketball is really exciting.  
  
I think -- I don't think there's been really a challenge with the transition
with Coach Wynn here. She's been great, and it's been amazing. I think just
how she mentioned, the injuries, little nagging injuries that we have, myself
included, it's been a little frustrating. But besides that, the coaches have
made this transition pretty easy.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: I think I'd have to agree with Hannah on that. We have an
equal opportunity. We all have a chance to really show off what we can do and
what we have worked to do in the past to get us to this point.  
  
I think a challenge that we may -- may not for the transition, but in the
future may just be like we're not always going to be on top every game. I
think for us that's just like a learning opportunity.  
  
It can be -- it can put us down a little bit sometimes when we're not coming
out on top, because that's what we are used to, but I think us having a young
team, it's a better learning opportunity for us that we will eventually
overcome. I just think that that will grow from it.  
  
Q. Jody, welcome. This is for Hannah and Mai-Loni again. There are so
many transfers in women's basketball these days. So going off the previous
question, why did you decide to stay? What about Jody and what the program is
doing now? Why did you decide to stay?  
HANNAH JOHNSON: For me, a big part of my decision to come to Washington in the
first place was because of the family aspect. And I don't think that's
something that we lost. I think it's something we continue to grow and gain.
So that was a really big part for me.  
  
And also the girls, the girls are a consistent piece from the last coaching
staff to the new coaching staff. So I think a big part is also the
relationships that I built with these girls. They're like my sisters, so I
can't leave them behind.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: I love Seattle. Seattle is the best place. I want to live
there probably for the rest of my life. So that's a big reason.  
  
But Coach Wynn, I knew her from high school, so obviously I knew about her. I
knew how she was. I was excited. I knew that the change was going to be good,
and I had faith, and I wanted to stay. I wanted to stay, too, because I just
wanted to stay loyal. I think that's important. I've been a -- I'd rather die
a Dawg. I want to take Coach Wynn's place one day as a coach. No, I just want
to stay loyal, and it felt right to stay.  
  
Q. I have a question. You're now, you know, not new to the Pac-12,
you've played there, coached there, but coming from Long Beach State where you
were more a defensive identity team, defense wasn't something they really
talked about at U-Dub as much, like talking about the team. How are the
players incorporating that defensive philosophy in adjusting?  
JODY WYNN: Mai-Loni said to me we ran more in practice than we ran all year
last year.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: It's true.  
  
JODY WYNN: No, until we get all of the personnel in that we need to run the
system that we like to run, it's going to be a challenge, but piece by piece.
One thing that you have to remember as coaches is that they want to learn.
They want to get better every single day they step on the court.  
  
It's just a really positive atmosphere. They're excited. It's not like, oh, we
have to play defense in practice today. And it's not like we do that the
entire practice, but it is half the game.  
  
But I think they're excited to be taught or to be demanded of on the defensive
side of the ball. Yeah, it might not be what we want it to be one day, but
we're establishing a foundation right now and trying to build a culture where
effort and toughness can make up for a lack of size or skill.  
  
HANNAH JOHNSON: I love defense.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: We love it now. Grown to love it.  
  
JODY WYNN: I promise, I didn't brainwash them.  
  
Q. Jody, professionally, coming into the Pac-12, I know you're familiar
with the conference, but, I mean, it's a much different conference than it was
even four or five years ago. What is that like for you as a challenge coming
into a conference that is statistically the best in the nation?  
JODY WYNN: Yeah, that's why I made the move. Being able to be a part of the
No. 1 women's basketball conference in America, I mean, to me, that's why I do
what I do, to surround myself with excellence, to have incredible role models
to look up to.  
  
I mean, I've watched them on TV. I've been recruited by them and coached
against some. But it's just an absolute honor to be a part of this conference
at this time.  
  
I have a lot of respect for Tara and all of the great coaches in this league
that are legends of the game. I just really respect their approach. I really
respect how they're classy people and we do things with integrity, and I
wanted to be a part of that.  
  
Q. How do you view being picked to finish 12th? Do you guys not talk
about it? Is it a motivation tactic for you guys?  
JODY WYNN: Honestly, I really don't care. Even when I was at Long Beach State
and we might have been picked whatever we were picked, it was nothing that we
ever really talked about in the preseason because it really matters on what
you do at the end.  
  
All we're doing every single day is just trying to get a little bit better
every single day. Just a little bit better every single day. That's all we can
ask of each other. It's all I can ask of myself, my coaches, and every player
in this program.  
  
We've always said that sometimes the scoreboard might be a liar, but we won
inside, we won with our effort, we won with our heart, and eventually that
scoreboard will tell the truth.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: Yeah, I agree. Like Coach said, we don't really care. We just
are focused on improving game to game, practice to practice. And it's not
something we're going to go cry about. I think it's something we look at and:
You know what? Let's embrace it. We're the underdogs. Okay. We have nothing to
lose.  
  
I think that's what all of our mentalities have been like, and obviously it's
because Coach Jody has helped us with that.  
  
Q. Kelsey kind of dominated everything in the headlines -- the program,
the leadership -- and was the Player of the Year and did fabulous things. How
have you guys kind of overcome that void from a leadership standpoint in the
locker room, getting in extra work, and yet a whole coaching change? You guys
are the ones that are having to navigate that.  
HANNAH JOHNSON: I think we've obviously taken a lot from Kelsey. Me,
personally, I have a relationship with her where I'll call her and ask her for
advice on being a better leader. She helps me, and she puts me in my place. I
tell her how I handle some things, and she says: You should do this a
different way. So I've been able to learn a lot from her.  
  
But I think it's time we established our own identity. Yeah, let's take what
Kelsey did and what Chantel did, but we don't -- we never want to shy away
from the culture that we built, but let's make it our own.  
  
So I think we can take great things from that and make it into our own type of
thing. So, yeah, we don't have a Kelsey Plum, but how about let's get extra
reps in then. That's what she did. So let's get in the gym. Let's get in the
gym a little bit more because we don't have that so-and-so best player.  
  
MAI-LONI HENSON: I think for me, personally, just not being able to see the
floor as much once conference play started last year. I kind of already
developed this mentality of I'm going to work hard, I'm going to get better
because my time was coming next year, because Chantel and Kelsey are going to
have to leave eventually. They'll have to move on and do their own thing.  
  
I think for me, and maybe Hannah and the other players, we started building
this mentality that we're not going to have as much next year. So we started
early in developing this mindset that we have to establish the new roles and
take pride in them.  
  
That really just started with, you know, hard work, work ethic, and it's just
something that we really need to take pride in and really embrace, no matter
what they put us in the rankings. Don't really care about rankings.  
  
But, for me, I just developed it pretty early.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Brittany McPhee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33295)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, it's great to see everyone. We are very excited
about our upcoming season. I feel like we've kind of started it, and then it
got put on hold. We took our team to Italy. We had a great trip. It's hard to
believe -- even Larry Scott said to me, Brittany's been playing forever at
Stanford. It's hard to believe Brittany's a senior.  
  
We're really excited about Brittany's senior year and Kaylee Johnson's senior
year, and Alanna being a junior.  
  
So we have a great group. We're playing a very competitive schedule, and we're
very, very excited.  
  
Q. For Brittany and Alanna. Can you talk about coming off a Final Four
appearance and what that experience does for you and what it does to
springboard you into the next season?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: I think going to the Final Four and getting a taste for it
left us returners wanting more. We want to go back and we want to go further.
I think that's kind of a drive for us. And I think we're trying to create that
culture for our freshmen, too.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, and just kind of seeing what it takes from last year to
get to the Final Four, because those seniors have gone their freshmen year,
but everybody else had never been. So to get the experience and figure out
just how much work is put into it.  
  
Q. Alanna, where is the rebounding going to come from without Bird
McCall?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think that the rest of our post players, after watching Bird
and the success that she had with her game, I think she's set a really good
example for post players at Stanford to come.  
  
So I know for a fact that I'm trying to emulate Bird as a player. And as a
rebounder, I know Kayl does an awesome job on the boards, and the rest of our
post players would do a great job too. We all look up to former players from
Stanford, and they do a fantastic job of showing the way.  
  
Q. Britt, where's the three-point shooting going to come from without
Karlie Samuelson?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: I think it's going to come from a lot of different players. A
lot of people got to play in Italy, and they did super well. It's kind of
there for the taking because she obviously was phenomenal.  
  
But it should be exciting. I think we have great three-point shooters on our
team, and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. I'm wondering the impact of having so many of your former players on
the WNBA, Ros Gold being a fantastic media representation. What's that mean to
your program, all three of you? How does that feel seeing Ogwumike in the
Finals again?  
TARA VANDERVEER: As a coach, it makes me really proud. I hope it inspires some
of our young players to work hard and be like some of the great players that
are setting that great example.  
  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, in our locker room we have a wall of the past All-
Americans, and we have a wall of some great players. It's just an example of
what hard work can do. It's also a resource. I talked to plenty of alumni who
have helped me out along the way and are just really good sources to go to.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think it sets a culture in our program and sets an
expectation for us to do really well and work really hard to get there.
Because I know after talking to players in the WNBA from Stanford that it did
take hard work. I think it's really good for us to see them getting the reward
from it.  
  
Q. Tara, last year you said that your defense was kind of the thing that
you hung your hat on. During the year you called your team one of the most
committed defensive teams you've ever had. Have you been able to see an
identity for this team yet? If so, how would you characterize it?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I was waiting for that because one of our best defenders
graduated too, Briana Roberson. Our defense is going to be, I think, something
that our team will hang its hat on. We just haven't gotten to that point yet.
We've worked really hard on -- I think offense takes longer to teach and
learn, so we've focused a lot during the summer in going for our trip in
Italy. But we will get right to kind of the defensive things that we want to
do.  
  
But a lot of it starts with the leadership of your team. Someone like Briana
or Karlie and Britt and Alanna, they buy into playing great defense, and
they're going to work really hard.  
  
I think the advantage that I have is the fact that these are girls working in
the gym and getting extra time. They know in order for us to have a great
season, they're going to have to play at both ends of the court. When you have
your best offensive players playing defense, that gives you a really good
chance.  
  
Q. I want to ask you two questions. One, your chemistry, you talked
about that a lot last season. You didn't have one superstar. It was really the
entire team that bought in. But I think you have a chance to have a couple
starters here. How is this team different from last year? I know it's an
evolving thing, but what do you see right now?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I hope that the team chemistry -- it's different.
Obviously you have different people and different players. But I think Alanna
and Britt and Kayl, the leaders of our team, have to realize that chemistry
was a big reason why our team was successful.  
  
People are unselfish, and they're very hard workers. If they do that, I think
that gives us a chance. We'll have different stars every night. It's not going
to be maybe -- might not be the same person. But we have some great talent on
our team, including, obviously, the two that are with me today.  
  
But I think we're going to be a win by committee. It's going to be different
people doing different things. Some of the little things and doing the behind-
the-scene things.  
  
So I'm counting on great chemistry and great leadership and the things that
helped us be successful last year.  
  
Q. Every team loses players each year at graduation. But you lost a very
important staff member in Amy Tucker. How is it with the players having a new
coach? Because you don't have a lot of turnover at Stanford, how is it for
you, too, Tara?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, our new assistant coach, Lindy La Rocque, has fit in
wonderfully. I mean, Lindy was a former player at Stanford. So she knows the
ins and outs. She's now on the other side coaching.  
  
I think that's actually really cool to be able to have a former player who
knows both sides. She's been great so far. I'm really looking forward to the
years to come with Lindy. I'm really excited she's decided to come back to
Stanford.  
  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, without Amy it was super weird. When we went to Italy
and played without her on the bench, it was definitely and an adjustment. But
Lindy fits right in. It's always great to get a different perspective. She has
a lot of great ideas, and it's fun to work with her.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: As far as I think it's going to be really hard for Amy the
very first game, not to want to just yell: Hey, Tara, get out of that press,
or put so-and-so in, or whatever. But, you know I think with basketball Amy
feels really good about her contributions to the Stanford program. She was
part of a lot of these players that are on our team.  
  
The thing that I think we'll miss the most is she was just a quick thinker.
When things happened in the game, I might still be mad about the foul, and
she's moved on to like, hey, this is a play we've got to run.  
  
So I think this will give an opportunity to other people. We're all going to
have to step up our game.  
  
Q. You're starting the season playing against two of the toughest teams
in the nation in Ohio State and UConn. What are the advantages of starting out
with such competition, and what are things other teams may shy away from?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I hope our players are excited. It happened by accident,
honestly. We were supposed to play Ohio State and Louisville, but because of
game times and it got switched to Connecticut. I'm fine with it. They're a
great program and a great team.  
  
The same thing with Baylor, actually. We were supposed to play someone else,
UOP. They dropped us, so we ended up playing Baylor.  
  
But I hope our team is really excited. You don't win championships in November
or December, but I think you can build a really good foundation then.  
  
But you can learn a lot about your team. We have a very young team. It's like
throwing our team into the deep end of the pool early.  
  
When we played in Italy, we played against professionals. I know we have a lot
of work to do. I think it will give our team a sense of urgency. We start
tomorrow with practices, and I think it's going to help our practices. There
is not going to be any fluff. We're going to cut right to the chase.  
  
Q. You've signed a contract extension. You're coming off a Final Four
year. How energized are you? As a follow-up for the players, I want to talk
about emotional tone setting. Karlie was a calm player on the court for you,
Erica was an emotional player. How do you not only replace the production but
the emotional tone they set on the floor?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: As far as emotional, I think we have other players who maybe
don't express it to you guys, but we definitely have people that have a lot of
emotion throughout the game. Kaylee Johnson and Marta Sniezek are competitive
and can get us fired up.  
  
As far as calm, I think a lot of us generally are a little bit more like that.
It's obviously hard losing characteristics like that, but I think people will
figure it out, and we'll be okay.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think (indiscernible) Karlie led the way, too, and kind
of showed how to be those types of leaders. So I think the leaders on our team
have kind of an easy job of stepping into that role because they did such a
good job of showing how to do that.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I was just having lunch with Janie McCauley, and something
came up about, How long are you going to do this? And I said, Well, I just
signed up for three more years. So that's how that story got out there. I
didn't know that was going to be a topic of discussion.  
  
But I'm very excited about our team. I'm very excited about the future of our
program. Just, obviously, we've got the veterans and people like Britt and
Alanna and Kayl and Marta and people like that that are playing a lot.  
  
But we're really excited about our freshmen and our sophomores too. Our main
job is to keep everybody healthy and keep improving.  
  
Q. How does this freshman class with Kiana Williams and the rest of
these people compare with the great freshmen classes that you've had in the
past? Are you going to urge Maya Dodson to dunk in a game?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think Maya will dunk. But it's going to happen. Maybe
she'll throw it down in warm-ups first.  
  
As far as our freshmen, I think as freshmen, they're as good as any freshmen
we've had. I hope they're as great as sophomores as juniors and seniors and
that they are the type of leaders and great people that we have on our team
right now as juniors and seniors.  
  
But they're a very talented group. They have the advantage of having great
upperclass mentors like Britt and Alanna who understand it's not about keeping
freshmen down or keeping them in their place, but really helping them and
building them up in a way that they know that -- I mean, Britt and Alanna are
the foundation of our team and upperclassmen, but we know that they need more,
and they understand that.  
  
So it's a combination of great talent. Really outstanding freshmen, but also
great older mentors.  
  
Q. Britt and Alanna, I hear you guys have some fun outdoor trips you're
doing over the weekends, like Yosemite and places like that. Can you talk
about that and what it does to build team chemistry?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, our teammate Alexa Romano and I always try to go
somewhere on the weekends during the summer, not during the season. We always
bring -- like Alanna came with us, Mikaela's gone on a couple. People come all
the time. We just try to get out and get in a different atmosphere. We went to
Yosemite and Mammoth Lakes last weekend.  
  
It's just fun to get to know each other. It's a lot of time you don't have any
cell service you can't even listen to the radio. There is no radio. So you
really get to learn a lot about each other that you otherwise wouldn't talk
about like on the court. So it's a lot of fun.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, it's not every day that you have to sleep in a three-man
tent with four people. So, yeah. You get up close and personal. It's awesome.  
  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: It was pretty squished. Alanna will tell you we got a little
jumpy, because we were pretty squished.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, it was nice and warm and safe.  
  
Q. This isn't anything new, but surprise, surprise, the Stanford fall
sports are doing incredible. Your women's soccer team is No. 1 in the country.
Bryce Love is in the Heisman conversation, et cetera, et cetera. What's that
like for you kind of in the second season of Stanford sports? What interaction
do you have with the other teams, with the other athletes? Is there
inspiration going on? I'm interested in that relationship.  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, for sure. We go watch the other games as much as we can
when we don't have practice. It is definitely like, all right, you're the next
act. You don't want to have any drop-off. Because obviously our spring sports
are great too. It definitely keeps us accountable. We don't want to be the
scrubs of the campus. So, yeah.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: We all do a good job supporting other sports. We go to every
volleyball game that we can make and soccer and football. We see volleyball
players, football players, soccer players at our games, too, and it kind of
enhances that camaraderie that we have.  
  
It's so exciting to see other teams be successful and kind of join in their
celebrations too. It gives you energy. It's awesome.  
  
Q. First for the potential scrubs of the campus, as you prepare for a
new year, you reflect on the previous year to help your future be better. When
they're done, Coach, if you'd be willing to comment on this. First I'm
wondering what it was like to be part of the entire ride last year with
Coach's milestone and maybe your reflections on last year. Coach, are you
extremely relieved that you can start this year working on 2,000 now?  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Last year was so cool just to see all of the lives Tara had
impacted, because so many people came back for the game and all the videos and
everything we saw. It was just cool to see how basketball is more than just a
game. It's like the relationships you make will affect you your whole life.  
  
So just to experience that and to experience and see how much success Tara
had. They laid out like the 1,000 pennies just to see how big that is. It was
really fun to be a part of.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think it was really a special year for us as well as
Tara. I think we were just so honored to be able to be a part of that journey.
Tara inspires us every day as a coach. To be able to see the other people that
she's inspired was really special, yeah.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I love listening to Alanna talk. You know, I just can't -- I
mean, it was a special night probably because my mom was there, and then I was
really glad because by winning that night, then, she went home too. And I love
my mom, but it was like: Time to go. (Laughing.)  
  
You know, what made it really special for me was the team that I was part of
that year in that just the -- I thought really (indiscernible) Karlie were
going to get me with water, but it was (indiscernible).  
  
But it was such a special team to share something special with. It just
reminded me why we do this. It is relationships. It is the growth that you see
with young women. To see these two right now compared to like when they were
freshmen. It's so exciting how much they've matured and how much they really
get playing basketball at this level.  
  
So that's the one thing as a coach is to see them grow. Then like Britt said,
I heard from so many people I've either coached or have been part of this
coaching journey. To me, that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. For Brittany and Alanna, I'm curious how you saw yourself develop
this off-season, specifically to your on the court game. Like Brittany, I've
seen you be a tough driver, I've seen you start to develop your mid-range
game, and last year you started shooting threes. So I'm curious what you've
added to your game, because Stanford guards always get better in post play.  
BRITTANY MCPHEE: Yeah, for me this summer I was definitely still working on
being more consistent from outside, looking more to get my teammates open when
I drive and draw the extra person. There are so many other people who could
get maybe better shots. So definitely working on that.  
  
Then just being more vocal out there. Because I kind of deferred seniors last
year, so that was something I was working on.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, something I was probably working on over the summer was
kind of extending my game outside of just the post. Which is everything with
ball handling and shooting and passing. Yeah, I think I had a really good
learning opportunity being able to play in India with the Australian National
Team. That was really special. I think that was an awesome learning experience
for me. I kind of opened my eyes to international basketball too.

## October 11, 2017

_San Francisco, California_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: So in my 21st season at Arizona State, I can honestly
say this will be the youngest team that I've ever coached probably at any
school, but certainly in my 21 years at ASU.  
  
So I was trying to think of a story that could kind of relate maybe what we're
going through. Yes, okay, we're going to go -- we've got one for you.  
  
So this was back when my two older sons were like five and seven. Okay? They
wouldn't do anything that my husband and I asked them to do. They just
wouldn't listen. They wouldn't listen. We couldn't get them to do the things
that we needed them to do.  
  
So we tried timeouts. We tried all sorts of things. So finally I went to the
pastor at our church and said, This is what's going on. Can you help us? He's
got kids and everything, and he's like, Yeah, I'll come over to the house. I
want Liam first.  
  
So he puts Liam in a room and sits him in a chair. Walks up to Liam and says,
Where's God? Liam's just sitting there. He's got big, blue eyes. He's just
looking at him. And Pastor kind of walks away, comes back, Where's God? Now
Liam's getting really nervous. He's fidgety and getting scared.  
  
Then the pastor comes back, and in his biggest, boomingest voice, Where's God?
And at this point Liam jetted out of the room, ran upstairs, put himself in
his closet sobbing uncontrollably.  
  
So the older son is surveying all of this. He's next. He goes into Liam's
room, Liam, what happened? What happened? Liam's like, I don't know, but God's
missing, and they think we did it.  
  
So when I think about our team this year, I think about youthful innocence,
but also just an incredible ability to do big things, to do really big things.  
  
Very exciting team. We lost our front line. We lost Kelsey, Sophie and Quinn.
But we've added Courtney; Sophia Elenga, an incredibly talented junior college
post from France; and we get Jamie Ruden back, who did not get to play a
single game in the Pac-12, but you get incredible glimpses of her abilities in
postseason.  
  
We have Kianna Ibis doing the things that we knew she could do. Emerging
really well. And also Charnea Johnson-Chapman looks really, really good in
terms of our postgame.  
  
Then I know a lot of you were enamored by our incredible back-court guards
last year. Very, very young. And, of course, Sabrina and our three newbies.
Last year they didn't know what they didn't know, but now they know. So
Sabrina, Robbi Ryan, Reili Richardson, Kiara Russell are a year older, a year
wiser, have really grown immensely, and we're super excited about how we're
coming together.  
  
So I think it's kind of a fun blend. We don't have any seniors, but we're
really built with some tremendous juniors and sophomores, and we're excited
about it.  
  
Q. So you have a complete change in your front court. But you not only
have those changes, you have changes in your coaching staff. So tell me how as
a coaching staff, because you've got to bring them together, and how are the
players -- or how is everything meshing?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, how's it meshing. So we have two new coaches on
our staff. So Jackie Moore is back with us.  
  
Angie Nelp is really a rising star in coaching, and she -- I kind of liken her
a lot to Amanda's position in terms of being our offensive coordinator. Great
offensive mind. A lot like Amanda. She was a great player back in the day.
Played with Becky Hammon at Colorado State, was All-American in high school,
great pro player. And going to have a baby any second. Just a little sidebar.  
  
But she's really bringing that element to us, which is fantastic. A great
teacher of the game.  
  
Then we've added, of course, one of our all-time greats, Briann January. And
that's exciting. Because Laura Hughes was on my staff for 15 years, and then
two years at NAU, and I coached her for two years, and she was kind of our
defensive coordinator. I haven't necessarily had anybody since she left.  
  
Bri obviously is a great offensive player, but working with our guards and
being able to kind of coordinate the defense, I mean, she understands it as
well as anybody. That's really exciting.  
  
So it's kind of blended really well. And I'll add, it's not a coaching
position, but Terri Mitchell, a long-time successful coach from Marquette is
my special assistant now. So she will be helping us break down film and game
plan. While she doesn't get to coach the players, we are going to be
capitalizing on her basketball mind to help us win championships.  
  
Q. Coach, to follow up on that last point on the staff, what's it do to
have a former player like January on your staff who is so accomplished,
especially for a team that's as young as this one is? Then for the players,
Courtney and Sabrina, what's it been like being able to learn from a player
like Briann January?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: As Charli just said, Briann is amazing. Not only does she
know what she's doing, but she's really positive and awesome to be around
every day. It's really cool because -- I don't know about you, but I grew up
watching ASU women's basketball, and she was on the teams that I used to watch
when I was ten years old. So it's kind of come around full swing. It's really
neat to be able to be coached by her.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think your dad recruited her to be an assistant coach.
She actually helped coach Courtney's little team -- I guess it was a club team
back then.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, it's actually funny because I'm having flashbacks to
when I was 12 years old because she used to coach me back then, and now she's
coaching me again.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, yeah, just like with Youth AAU.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: It was volunteer coaching, yeah.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you, but I'll start with Sabrina. Last year
was hard, right, with Kelsey's injury. You were able to turn it on a little
bit at the end of the year. But it felt like a hard year and you had to fight
the whole way through. So what is the feeling that each of you have coming
into this season? And maybe what are you most excited about too?  
SABRINA HAINES: I think personally I'm super excited for this season. Last
season was definitely we had a lot of adversity, but I think that's really
what made our team so strong and why we had a great run in the NCAA Tournament
and a better postseason than we did probably regular season.  
  
But we have such a great group right now and incredible players. We have all
been working in the gym. The coaches have been helping us get better every
single day. Personally I'm more confident in myself and, of course, like our
team and everything like that. And just knowing we're about to start a great
season and hopefully build off what we left off of, if that makes sense, last
postseason.  
  
Like I said, I'm just super excited.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, adding on to that, just the way they finished last
season, it shows that we can play that way. I mean, you saw Bri step up at the
end. She has like three charges against South Carolina, which is crazy. She's
playing great.  
  
So adding on to how we finish, yeah, we lose some people, but just looking
forward to getting better and having a good year this year.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Okay, should I correct that? We don't say "hard." Hard
is losing a loved one. Hard is some of the things that are going on in our
world today, like in Vegas and stuff. But "challenging," that is the word we
use.  
  
We just love our fun challenges. It was a not-so-fun challenge at times
because of the injuries last year.  
  
But we -- and I say "we," our coaching staff -- could not have been more proud
of the way that our team finished. You know, we could say would've, could've,
should've on our seeding for the NCAA Tournament, with that committee
supposedly knowing we were getting our players back for the NCAA Tournament,
but just the fact that we went down to the last possession with the team that
ultimately won the National Championship and played so well on their home
floor in front of their 9,000 fans, I think really showed this team -- not
that they doubted themselves. They knew they were overcoming things that,
yeah, one of the best teams in the country and we're going to build on this.  
  
Q. Courtney, you've played at UConn, but you're from Phoenix, obviously.
To come back now, what is that experience at UConn -- how has that helped you
and how will that help you at ASU and have the career that you've dreamed
about?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: So, yeah, playing at UConn is great. Won a couple National
Championships. Now I'm at Arizona State, and I'm really looking forward to
playing for Charli, because I love her culture and how not only does she coach
us on the court, but teaches us how to be nice young women and how to succeed
in life as well. So I'm really looking forward to getting back on the court
this year.  
  
Q. Charli, you have very good guards. Will we see a time that you really
play five guards? Seriously? Because those are your best players right now and
most experienced. Will you do that at times this season?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You'll just have to watch and see. You know what, I'm
not going to rule it out. Certainly small ball, we've had some of our best
seasons. For those of you that have followed us for a long time, some of our
best seasons ever were small ball. Small ball has kind of ruined basketball
because look with the Warriors and around the country as well.  
  
So, yeah, we're going to have some small ball lineups this year. We'll want
our best players on the floor as much as possible.  
  
Q. Courtney, what did you get out of last season when you had to watch
and not participate? How are you better even though you had to watch and not
on the floor?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I'd have to contribute a lot of that to my coaches. It was
tough to sit out because I'm a competitor and I love playing, but at the same
time it was also a chance to sit back and reflect and see what's going on and
learn a whole new program and system. I also had extra time for extra workouts
and some extra stuff, so I'm thankful the coaches took their time to help me
get better.  
  
Q. Courtney, I was house hunting last year in Arcadia, and my Realtor
asked what I did for a living. I said Pac-12 Network, women's basketball,
play-by-play. She said, Oh, do you know Courtney? And I said, Yeah, I'm aware
she's at ASU. And she said, Have you ever seen her play tennis? And I said,
No, I have not. Do tell. So I understand you're an amazing tennis player. And
to that point, can anybody on the team beat you?  
SABRINA HAINES: I'm going to just tell you, I like to talk a lot of trash as
far as any sports, so I never knew Courtney -- like I knew she played tennis,
but I didn't fully comprehend.  
  
So we were at Charli's house one time, and I was like, Nobody can beat me in
ping-pong, man. I'm the number one. I'm the goat. Like, Come on. And Courtney
was like, I'll play.  
  
So we go out, and as soon as we start, she gets in her stance. I'm like, Oh,
God. I know ping-pong is definitely different than tennis, but she killed me
in that and put me in my place.  
  
So go ahead, Courtney.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Oh, gosh. My mom actually played tennis in college. She
played at Marquette. My dad loves playing tennis too. We have a tennis court
in our front yard. So kind of was in between basketball and tennis, but I love
basketball. I did play tennis in high school, though.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We're glad you chose basketball.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Foosball, that's Sabrina's.  
  
SABRINA HAINES: Yeah. And soccer. That's me.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Mark Trakh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30760)

### [Kristen Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34203)

### [Sadie Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30362)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
MARK TRAKH: This is my first year. My second stint at USC. And I'm really
looking forward to it. I'm excited. It's good to be back home, good to be back
in Los Angeles and coaching at a university that I really love. It's not often
you get a chance to get your dream job twice in the same lifetime. I've been
able to be fortunate enough to do that. I'm grateful for the opportunity.  
  
Getting the job, we knew we inherited a talented group of young women, and
we've been working with them the last four months. We've been emphasizing
culture as far as them working hard, working together. You know, learning to
trust each other and I think they're really buying in. I'm excited about the
energy and passion they show every day in practice. I think we've got some
good parts, you know.  
  
And these two young women to my left have been exceptional these last four
months. Kristen Simon is a very, very talented post player. She's great. We're
back to the basket. She can face the basket. She's a great rebounder. She's
really evolving into an excellent leader that's being consistent every day in
practice.  
  
And Sadie Edwards, I can't say enough about her work ethic. She plays hard all
the time. She's very receptive. She's like a sponge as far as her learning.
She's always asking questions. She's one of those players that needs to know
why she's doing things. I love her questions. They're always very, very
intelligent, very well-placed. So I'm looking forward to coaching her. Great
athlete, can shoot the ball can get to the rim, and she can really, really
defend.  
  
I'm really, really impressed with these two young women off the court. They're
both working on their masters degrees right now, so they're both going to
leave SC, hopefully, with a great senior season, and more importantly or most
importantly, their masters degree.  
  
Q. Could you have imagined this would happen again? That you would be
back? Can you just kind of talk about the circumstances that brought you back
here?  
MARK TRAKH: No, you know, it's funny. This is something corny, but my
girlfriend had these -- this Japanese tradition where you write a wish and you
burn it, and it goes up in the air and the wish is supposed to come true. So I
was messing around, and I wrote I wish I'd coach at SC again some day. The
thing went up, and the only problem with that in retrospect, I would have
wished for winning the lottery, if I had a second chance.  
  
But that was obviously one of my dreams to come back. We had a great team in
New Mexico State coming back again, it was probably our best team we've ever
had next year. I was excited about that. Figured I'd be in Las Cruces for the
next eight to ten years. And USC called and it was just a great opportunity. I
was really grateful for it to come back and get to coach these young women. So
I'm very, very excited.  
  
Q. You and I have spoken the past few years that in retrospect when you
were at SC previously, you had a lot of injuries. You changed philosophy a
little bit on how you practiced. I don't know if the players are aware of
this. Can you explain are you doing this that you're not as physical or
contact drills?  
MARK TRAKH: We had a lot of injuries at SC. I thought we have really good
talent if we could get everybody on the floor, but we couldn't. The last few
years we were missing four to eight of our best players every game. So when I
got to New Mexico State I just looked and tried to figure out why we were
always hurt. So we modified the practices so kids weren't allowed to dive for
loose balls, I didn't let them take charges anymore, we stopped doing
rebounding drills, and we hadn't had a player miss a game or practice in four
years. They missed a couple practices.  
  
But the biggest ability is availability. So New Mexico State we went 46-2 in
conference, but I always had all my players on the floor. So having your best
players available was a big thing. So coming here, we have the same
philosophy. They hear about it every day. Like be careful, respect your
teammate in practice, you know. I think it's worked out. I think it's worked
out well for us. I want to keep my second stint at SC, I want to keep
everybody healthy and get the kids on the floor.  
  
Q. A follow-up to the players to both of you. Very talented, mark is a
very experienced coach and we're very old friends. So what is the difference
and how is the team doing right now?  
SADIE EDWARDS: I think from day one Coach Trakh and our new staff was very
clear about their vision for our program moving forward. I think every single
day we're taking a step towards that goal. The foundation we're building right
now is very strong, and it's founded on togetherness, unselfishness. You know,
giving your best effort every day, every second. Being consistent is like a
big thing for them.  
  
We have a new slogan that's like stay gold because you want to have a gold
standard of culture. I think just having that, having that structure will go a
long way for us this year.  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: Yeah, definitely. Coach always says in practice we're teaching
plays, but we're also teaching you how to play. Just learning the game of
basketball, the feel of it at such a high pace but a different intensity, it's
really helped not only the seniors but a lot of our younger players are
beginning to understand the pace at a college level and the physicality and
all of that. But also being able to learn the technicalities and all that.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
KRISTEN SIMON: I think this year for me, I personally don't believe it's
anything to do physically. It's more mentally, just being a better leader.
Like Coach said, being more consistent, being the spark that we need. Doing
the little things for our team and making sure everybody is staying on the
path that we're trying to go on. But it's definitely just being a better
leader overall for the team.  
  
Q. Following up on the educational piece, Sadie, my notes say you want
to be a sports psychologist. Is that still true?  
SADIE EDWARDS: Either that or coaching.  
  
Q. So you're getting a masters right now?  
SADIE EDWARDS: Yes, ma'am.  
  
Q. And Kris, where you are in your education?  
SADIE EDWARDS: I'm in the communication management program. A lot of it is
just basically about how communication impacts so many different platforms and
domains in life. Pretty much every organization, a key part of their success
is effective communication on every level, so I think it's kind of priming me
to be a better leader in some capacity. It also helps me. There are so many
parallels that I see between learning in practice, and embracing and relishing
that leadership role. So it's been a blessing to be part of that program.  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: I'm also in the same program. Me and Sadie have a class
together. I think everybody but us in the class has a job. For us, we have a
little bit of a different perspective, but it's very similar, just how Sadie
said. Effective communication, I think, has helped out a lot. Just
understanding how to talk to people, understanding the best way to get through
to people, the most effective ways to handle situations. I think being on a
team and being in the workforce or workplace with people, it's the same type
of dynamic. We have to get everybody to work together to accomplish the same
goals. So it's definitely helped out for us just to be able to communicate
better.  
  
Q. You've both had pretty interesting collegiate journeys. Sadie started
in UConn, coming in, same with you with injuries and stuff. I'd love to know
what maybe both of you have learned from your past couple years from your
journeys. And what you hope to use from that knowledge that you've gained in
this last year at USC?  
SADIE EDWARDS: I think something that was big for me is learning that
everything comes in its time. I think there were so many things I wanted to
help our team accomplish. But as I person, I needed to grow and develop and be
a better teammate. My character needed to change. In retrospect, I wasn't
ready to handle all of the things that I wanted. I think now I'm in a position
where there was a lot of tough times. At the time, I resented those tough
times and I wanted to run from them rather than embrace them and embrace the
fact that it was going to prepare me for this moment.  
  
And I think now more than ever, I'm appreciative and I'm grateful for
everything that I've been through and everything that I've experienced in the
tough times. It's made me who I am and made me ready. Like the time is now. I
think for me, I think this is when it all comes together for us as a team. I
think we've always had talent, and we haven't been able to put it together. We
have a chip on our shoulders and we're ready to turn a new leaf for USC
women's basketball. I think we're all looking forward to it.  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: Yeah, definitely. I think the two most important things is life
is hard. Way harder than I expected it to be. But staying your course, staying
on your path, if you believe in something, to continue to work for it. Like
Sadie said, there are a lot of things that I expected to do as a freshman, as
a sophomore, that I wasn't able to do, but I continuously just worked hard.
Regardless if the results didn't show yet, I continued to work on it
regardless.  
  
So, for me, it was just continuously staying on my course, staying on my path
regardless of the highs and lows, because there are going to be highs and
lows, and just working hard. That's one thing I've really learned in college
is just working hard, as hard as I possibly can.  
  
Q. Sadie, for you, in just looking at your major and what you just said,
one of the things I had in mind about you is you're kind of hard on yourself.
I think cop competitors can be that way. Have you found a way to funnel that
energy, and has anything you've learned in your studies helped you with that
in your game?  
SADIE EDWARDS: Yeah, I think especially in the past I'd get discouraged really
easily. So when things didn't go my way, like if you watch the games sometimes
I'd be like this and then like this over the course of a few games. So I think
a lot of what I'm learning in class is helping me respond more effectively. As
a leader, one of the most important traits you can have is compassion. And the
biggest thing about compassion is it starts with yourself. If you're not kind
to yourself, you're not going to be able to consistently do that for others.
So I think I've taken a lot of time to approach my journey with a sense of
appreciation, and understanding of how things are not always going to be
great, but learning from that and working through that rather than just
letting it take me out of things. I think in the past it did. It discouraged
me a lot, it impacted my play and impacted who I was as a teammate and as a
leader. But I think it's different now. I've grown. I'm just taking advantage
of that.  
  
Q. Coach, now that you have a second track at your dream job, what do
you want USC basketball to be about?  
MARK TRAKH: Yeah, I want it to be about success on and off the floor. It's
really important what our kids learn during their experience. It's really
important that they have a good collegiate experience, get their degree.
They're part of a team where they grow and they learn over the four years of
course, bottom line, you have to win on this level. But I think you do it the
right way with good kids that want to work hard on and off the floor. Doing it
the right way, including good, quality student-athletes, and the dream of
every coach is to go to the Final Four some day.  
  
I think that's our vision, and that's what we want. So I think the kids have a
vision. Coaching staff has a vision. Hopefully, we'll all come together and
work as hard as we can. I just want them to be the best they can be every time
they take the floor. Whether we lose the game by one, win it by one, lose it
by 20. As long as they gave 100% effort and they can walk off the floor and
say we gave it everything we have tonight. I think that's what we've got to
work towards.  
  
Q. Coach, upon your return is, what felt the same and what felt
different?  
MARK TRAKH: As far as coaching the young women, that's what makes this job
great. You get to coach young people. You go every practice. It's like you go
into practice like a kid. It's like you're excited. You get in there, you get
to work, like I can't shoot anymore -- well, I never could shoot. I can't
play. But I can watch, I can teach. You feed off their energy. So that will
always remain consistent regardless of where you coach. As far as SC, it's a
great university, great tradition, great athletic program. Facilities were
upgraded, the John McKay Center, so the campus looks a little different. So I
love LA. That hasn't changed much except for traffic and the housing prices,
otherwise it's a lot the same.  
  
But, yeah, there is not much change yet there is -- I mean, just the Pac-12
and this Media Day, I think it's so much bigger. It serves the student-
athletes so well to get them out there and get them exposure. I just think
this is great. I'm overwhelmed right now at everything that's happening and
everything that's planned today. I think that's definitely changed. I think
that's such a great thing for the young student-athletes.  
  
Q. A couple things for both of the players. There is one true freshman
on the team, Shalexxus Aaron. I've got to know about her. With a name like
that, she's got to be quite a personality. Tell us what it's like playing with
her. Also, I was pleasantly surprised, Jordan Adams on the roster? She's got
eligibility? How's that having her able to come back too?  
KRISTEN SIMON: Shalexxus fit perfectly with the team. Her brother plays on the
men's basketball team, his name is Shaqquan Aaron. And Shalexxus can really
dance. I didn't notice it until two weeks ago, but she can really dance. She's
way more outgoing than it seems.  
  
She's fit perfectly with our team. She's going to be good whether she plays
this year or next. She's going to be a key component when she comes back with
her injury.  
  
And Jordan, oh, yeah, Jordan I don't think anybody on my team is as happy as
me that Jordan is back, and I remind her of that every day. But Jordan does
everything, she rebounds, she can hit timely shots, she can hit a pull-up. She
can play the one through four, and there are not many people that can play the
one through four. I think that's absolutely amazing to me. All around, she's
just a good person. She's a good fit for any type of team, but I'm really
excited that she's back.  
  
She's going to try to get more rebounds than me this year, but we're going to
see how that goes.  
  
MARK TRAKH: I'll tell you a story about Jordan. I started coaching her, and
she came up to me, she said, Coach Trakh? I said, Yeah. She said, You realize
that you recruited me when you were a coach the first time here. That's how
long she's been at SC.  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: It's her third senior year.  
  
SADIE EDWARDS: Yeah, I don't think she's getting another one. It's great to
have her back. She does so much for us like Kristen was saying. It was
unfortunate when she got hurt last year because she's playing unbelievable
basketball for us. She's fought through so much in her college career.  
  
Every time I look at her every day, I'm like, wow, that strength to keep going
is incredible to me. I think it inspires us as a group. I think she's going to
help us a ton. To have her leadership, her experience, her abilities, it
allows us to do a lot more things on offense and defense. So we're looking
forward to that.  
  
Q. I was wondering what kind of impact -- is she eligible, Minyon's
sister?  
MARK TRAKH: She's got a red shirt.  
  
Q. So the two of them together, I can imagine can be kind of a handful,
right?  
MARK TRAKH: You guys want to answer that?  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: I've never met two sisters that are so alike but so different.
They are individuals. Their dynamic is weird.  
  
SADIE EDWARDS: It's different, they are similar in so many ways, but in a lot
of ways they're polar opposites. But Mariya's a great basketball player,
unbelievable instincts. I know she can't play this year, which is unfortunate
because that would have helped us.  
  
But just having her in practice, she's been places that nobody else on our
team has been, and experienced success that nobody else on our team has
experienced. So just her presence, she helps me. I know individually matching
up with her, she helps me every day. I'm grateful to have her around. I think
she'll have a great year. And I think getting a year under her belt of
adjusting to a new program will pave the way for her to have an unbelievable
senior year.  
  
MARK TRAKH: When we were recruiting her, I was watching the interaction
between the sisters, I said, there is no way we're getting Mariya here. I was
shocked when she goes -- she texted me and says I've made my decision, I'm
coming to SC because it's always been a dream to play with my sister. I was
like, who would have known that?  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: Exactly. That's true.  
  
Q. I don't know if you saw the Pac-12 preseason poll came out this
morning, and you see the So Cal rivals UCLA has been chosen to win the
conference again this season. Do any of you have any response to that?  
SADIE EDWARDS: We're ready.  
  
KRISTEN SIMON: We're ready for this year. We're ready. I think we'll shock a
lot of people. We're ready.  
  
SADIE EDWARDS: Yeah. I would say things are different now. That's good for
them, obviously. I'm friends with a lot of them, and they've worked really
hard and to see how far they've come is awesome. But like I said, we're ready
and we're coming.  
  
It's just a different feel this year. I'm so excited to get started. Like
Kristen said, I truly believe we're going to shock a lot of people. So, yeah,
we're just looking forward to it all.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Larry Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22739)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
COMMISSIONER SCOTT: Great to see everyone here. Very exciting day for us,
especially given the success of our women's basketball program and the
trajectory over the last few years. It's really an honor to be able to kick
off the upcoming season.  
  
Each year our women's basketball program has seemed to improve, generating
more interest, getting deeper across the board. We try every year also to
improve this Media Day and make it a more valuable experience for you all, but
also for our coaches and student-athletes.  
  
Last year we tested having two student-athletes from each of our programs
here, got some great feedback, not just from the media who enjoyed meeting
more of the players and having more opportunity to learn their stories, but
interestingly from the student-athletes themselves. They really find this a
very valuable, interesting experience for them to see how it all works and be
able to meet with the media.  
  
Hope you get a chance to spend some good quality time with our coaches, but
also with the 24 student-athletes that we have here today.  
  
Particularly a delight for me to sit here today and preview our upcoming
women's basketball season, because promoting women's sports at the Pac-12, and
certainly from my perspective, it's always been very important to me and a
passion.  
  
A lot of my career, as you know, before I came to the Pac-12 as commissioner
in 2009, was involved in women's sports, leading the WTA. So seeing the
exposure and growth of women's sports in our conference has been awesome.  
  
We're coming off a year where Washington women's rowing won our 500's National
Championship, and that was a great moment to celebrate. And seeing the success
of our women's basketball program is personally very gratifying for me.  
  
The last couple years have been particularly strong. In the 2015-16 season we
had half the Final Four with Oregon State and Washington. And I think that was
an inflection point that year where I think the rest of the country really
recognized the Pac-12 as one of the strongest and deepest, but also with elite
teams at the top.  
  
Followed up last season with a record seven teams in the tournament, from our
perspective, and, of course, Stanford making the Final Four.  
  
We've had four of our programs that have been in the Final Four over the last
five years. So very different from how it felt when I arrived in 2009, going
in the right direction, from my perspective.  
  
As we look at some of the teams that have been so successful, a lot of stars
coming back. Think about the great program that Scott Rueck has developed at
Oregon State, their terrific track record and a star player like Marie Gulich
that's coming back that's here with us today. He's coming off a great run in
terms of regular season championships. '16 and '17 was a historic year for
individual performances, Stanford and Washington as well. We took a lot of
pride in seeing Tara become the third coach in history to win a 1000th NCAA
game victory. We were able to celebrate that on the Pac-12 Networks.  
  
And, of course, Kelsey Plum at Washington with the standout season that she
had, and seeing her achieve the scoring record on the Pac-12 Networks in her
last regular season game at U-Dub, that was awesome.  
  
A lot of the bedrock of the successes our coaches, of course, we've got a
great group of coaches. One of the proud things as well is to see some former
student-athletes that are now successful coaches in our conference. Adia
Barnes, a standout at Arizona. Charli Turner Thorne, a stand-up, played for
Tara at Stanford. Funny how things come full circle.  
  
And I think the great coaching group we've got, some of the coaches that have
been here for a while and have a great track record, and some of the newer
coaches, that there is a lot of excitement around and that gives me a lot of
optimism for our program going forward.  
  
Lot of stars coming back. You'll have a chance to get to speak with Kristine
Anigwe at Cal, certainly one of the most exciting players nationally. Sabrina
Ionescu, Freshman of the Year, coming back. Oregon has got a very young,
exciting team.  
  
If you look at UCLA's team, Jordin Canada, Monique Billings that are here.
Very experienced, successful team that's going to be really strong.  
  
So, so many story lines in terms of individual stars. Some new, young talent,
some seasoned veterans that we've got, great coaches, so I really like the way
the season is shaping up.  
  
We've placed a great focus as well on how the season finishes. We love our
partnership with Seattle with KeyArena, Seattle Storm, Seattle Sports
Commission. That event continues to grow. I've had a chance to see many of you
each year up there. We're delighted the way that is developing. Last year's
tournament was amazing. We had so many games, and six games decided by 10
points or less.  
  
If I reflect back on my first year, 2009 or 2010, our Pac-10 Championship
didn't feel quite the same way. So the quality of play and the competition,
you just see it in addition to what you see on the stat lines. It's just
really been fabulous.  
  
You know, creating a first-class, prominent stage for the student-athletes and
our teams at the end of the season has been one of the big areas of focus. Of
course, the other one has been creating a media platform for the Pac-12
women's basketball to get exposure, to have the talent, the success of our
programs, the quality of play be available and recognized nationally as well
as to help those recruits and young stars that are interested coming out of
the Pac-12 to see it and know that they're going to get exposed and their
families are going to get to see them play.  
  
So if I think about all the reasons why the Pac-12 Networks was conceived and
created in the first place, there is no better example, from my perspective,
than women's basketball, and what it looked like before the Pac-12 Networks to
what it looks like now.  
  
There were no more than five games during the regular season that would have
been telecast nationally before the creation of the Pac-12 Networks. Maybe a
handful on a local RSN.  
  
This upcoming season, we're going to have 110 games, season games, telecast on
the Pac-12 Networks, in addition to the five that ESPN are going to telecast.
We're going to have 11 games from our Pac-12 Tournament that are broadcast
nationally on Pac-12 Networks and ESPN.  
  
I think it's probably obvious to many of you in here, but if the sole focus of
a television company is just ratings and advertising and return on investment,
you know, it's only a small handful of women's basketball games you're
probably going to telecast. If your mission is to promote your sports that
mean a lot to you, to give equal access, to use your media platform, to give
exposure to the amazing student-athletes that you have and the programs that
you have, you invest and you telecast more of it.  
  
So that's why we created the Pac-12 Networks and being able to telecast 110
events plus our tournament games, plus all the storytelling that we're able to
do, which will start today. Every student-athlete that's here will get
interviewed, and the stories that are going to be put in the can to be
peppered into the telecast during the year, it's very unique what we've
created.  
  
But it's very mission driven and a great source of pride to be able to
telecast 110 of these regular season games and to see the role that that's
played in addition to tremendous efforts by our campuses and the priority our
campuses have put on women's basketball.  
  
The combination of the work and the leadership on our campuses with the
resources that we've been able to put into it at the conference level related
to the television network, our marketing support, and the Pac-12 women's
basketball tournament at the end of the season, I think all these things have
come together in a beautiful fashion to result in the Pac-12 now being the
deepest and I think most successful women's basketball conference in the
country, where you know you're going to see great competition, top to bottom,
throughout the season, and we're going to have elite teams at the top.  
  
So it's an exciting moment to start the season. I want to thank all of you
that are here. Looking around the room, I know you're not just here for Media
Day. You follow women's basketball throughout the season. I tend to see most
of you at our tournament in the end.  
  
Really appreciate your support for women's basketball. Hope you have a great
day to day, and happy to take a few minutes to answer your questions before
you hear from our coaches and student-athletes.  
  
Q. With the construction of KeyArena on the horizon, probably starting
next fall, what are your thoughts on the tournament, if it's not available,
and what would you do?  
COMMISSIONER SCOTT: We're in close touch with our partners in Seattle, aware
of the possibility that it will be under construction. There will be no impact
on the 2018 championship that we have there. There could possibly be an impact
for 2019.  
  
So we're staying in close touch with them and starting to explore what our
alternatives would be in any years that we could not compete at Key. But we do
not have any specific plans in place at the moment.  
  
Q. With the bidding cycle open in the next round of Final Fours, are you
strongly encouraging anybody -- it's been a long time since it's been on the
West Coast. You and I discuss this every year, but it's time to open up the
bidding again. Are you looking forward to a Pac-12 bid for the Final Four?  
COMMISSIONER SCOTT: We are. We're obviously delighted to have the Final Four
men's in Phoenix. We've gotten behind Regionals recently. We announced the
Men's Regional '22 or '23 that we're working with the Warriors on at their new
arena, Chase Center.  
  
So we as a conference have gotten much more on the front foot in terms of
supporting these bids. We certainly see the benefit in having postseason men's
and women's basketball tournaments at different stages out here. So not sure
exactly where we are in the process, but it's something we're keenly
interested in.  
  
Q. I hear from a lot of fans in our area in regards to the Pac-12
Networks. The regional outlets, regional stations aren't available on most of
the basic cable packages. They're only available on the upper-tier packages.
The point of those regional outlets is to provide fans with access to the
games. Do you have any influence on ever maybe changing that in the future so
that those regional outlets are more accessible to fans?  
COMMISSIONER SCOTT: Yes. Each of our distributors handles the seven networks
in a different way. So there is no one answer, depending on the part of the
country that you're in. But in the case of Colorado, you're probably talking
about Comcast as opposed to Dish.  
  
Yeah. With as many events as we have, 850 events, they are split. I don't know
the exact number. But we have people in the room that do that are on the
national network, then the idea of the regional networks is to be hyper-local.
On the national network, you'll have all the football games, most of the men's
basketball games, a lot of the most prominent women's basketball games are
championships and some of the most high-profile competitions.  
  
The idea of then the regional networks are to be hyper-local and to be
tailored in each of the markets. So it's Pac-12 Mountain, which would be the
regional in Colorado. You're going to see more Colorado and Utah basketball
and other Olympic sports events.  
  
Where those networks are carried, on which tier, and whether they're in HD or
SD is subject of negotiation with each distributor. The outright obligation
any distributor has is to carry the national network on the most highly
distributed tier, often called your basic, in the basic package, in HD.  
  
What we haven't been able to get is that the regional will also be on expanded
basic in HD. There are some distributors around the country that do it. Most
don't. Though in most of our markets that regional network will be on a sports
tier, which is probably there where you have to pay extra for.  
  
I think the thing I encourage fans to look at as well is, I think, all of the
regionals, in most cases, not 100 percent sure with Comcast, are also
available authenticated through the app. So that is another option people can
look at. Again, it will vary distributor by distributor.  
  
Maybe, Pat, after this, we have a few Pac-12 Networks people here that can
talk more specifically about the situation with Comcast in Colorado. I'll have
them come see you and give you more details so you can inform your readers
about how they can better find what they're looking for. But it's complicated
distributor by distributor.  
  
Q. I saw your statement and you've taken a firm stand on integrity in
the conference and beyond for men's basketball. Did you get any indication
that women's basketball will be looked at or have you made clear to the
women's side as well that, hey, this is how we're going to operate?  
COMMISSIONER SCOTT: Well, I had a chance to meet with our coaches earlier this
morning before the day started. I broached the topic. We're very concerned
about what we've read so far in terms of the allegations. If true, it's very
worrisome. I'm going to have more and speak to this in more detail tomorrow.  
  
It will be obviously a relevant topic at Men's Basketball Media Day, so I'm
going to speak to it tomorrow, and I think you'll see us take some steps in
this area, primarily focused on men's basketball.  
  
But the idea of wanting to ensure integrity of the competition, protecting our
student-athletes and doing what we can as the Pac-12 to advocate or change and
reform to ensure those principles cuts across all sports.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
SCOTT RUECK: What a privilege it is to be back here. This is always a day
everyone looks forward to because it's done so well. The Pac-12 treats us like
gold and provides an awesome opportunity not only for the coaches but
certainly our students. I don't know. Just it's just a feel-good day, and it's
always exciting.  
  
Here we are starting another year in what all of us I know believe is the best
conference in the country. It has been the last two years at least.  
  
We're excited about our team. This is a team that just a year ago lost some
really important people and found a way. This group has that same opportunity
this year. We lost a few really important people to our program, and now it's
their turn to step into those roles.  
  
I love this team. They're tight-knit, they're tough. They realize they've got
to adapt to a new environment, a new demand, and they're ready for it.  
  
So we're excited.  
  
Q. Marie, now you're a senior and you're going to be stepping into that
leadership role, not that you weren't already, what do you see in this team
that's mostly veteran players in terms of what you guys can accomplish this
season?  
MARIE GULICH: I see a lot of hard work and a lot of heart going into
practices. Everyone is dialed in and focused. Scott already said we're missing
some players who were very influential last season, and everyone knows that.
Everyone is willing to take on the role. And I'm super excited to see that and
also to feel how everyone takes it on and embraces it.  
  
Q. Sydney Wiese was such a center point to that program from a
leadership standpoint and everything that she did. How have you guys adjusted
to that, and how have you taken that role on? Just point guards are super
important, I don't know for your program, Scott, too, but specifically moving
forward on a basketball standpoint.  
SCOTT RUECK: Do you want me to answer? Is that to me? Who do you want to go
first?  
  
Obviously that's a great question, and that's one that I have been asked the
most since the conclusion of last year, is how do you replace Sydney? She
meant a lot not only on the court, but off the court in our community. She was
a standard-bearer on how we conduct business in many ways and go about things.
She had a joy about her that made every day fun. That is hard to replace.  
  
But she's no longer here. So what has happened with her is the same thing
that's happened with our program. The culture is in place, the standard is in
place, and now you have that incredible model.  
  
So not one person can do that, just like nobody's going to control the ball
like Sydney did for 35 out of 40 minutes. Which was the way that we played.
It's going to be a collective thing. We have incredible students in this. I
think this team has the ability to have the best culture to this point. And
that's saying something. That's saying a lot, actually.  
  
They're winners. They're selfless. They come in every day and want to be
coached. That's Sydney. And so she rubbed off, and it's all of our
responsibility to keep that going and build upon the example that she set. And
you're right. That goes for Gabby, too, to be honest. Gabby had a big say in
the way this team competed.  
  
So we're so fortunate to have had those examples. You're looking at two people
sitting next to me right now that are more than capable of stepping in and
fulfilling that. So it will be done collectively.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Like Scott said, I think it's going to be a collective effort.
I think she was a great role model and great teacher, and the values she put
in place here in this program, we have to continue that going forward.  
  
But I think the biggest thing was how she communicated with people and treated
people going forward is how all of us will strive to act as well.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: And for the coach, that's really a fun challenge. Honestly, to
help them, to teach them, to put them in positions to really shine in
leadership roles. That's the joy, to me.  
  
Q. As you guys transitioned with major role players leaving over the
last couple years, you've really relied on what you do defensively while you
all figure out what people's new roles are in the offense. Do you anticipate
the same thing, that you will rely on defense while you get yourself settled
offensively with new people in new spots?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great perspective. That's what being a great defensive
team allows you to do. It buys you time and keeps you in games while you're
figuring things out.  
  
And certainly we had some questions to answer, just like we did a year ago. I
remember sitting here picked fifth a year ago, having lost four or five
significant seniors, and wondering: Man, how are we going to do it? And not
knowing quite yet.  
  
So we did have to figure those things out. This is similar. The standard of
our program is to defend like crazy. It's what's made us who we are. This team
embraces that, they understand that. It is our DNA. And we're going to have to
grow in that area as well.  
  
So coaches, we need to put them in place to be successful, but we have willing
participants that can't wait to step into those roles. So I agree that is
going to be necessary.  
  
Q. In looking at the teams from before that we were just talking about,
I think of Gabby, and when I think of Gabby and what she brought, just scrappy
and hard-nosed and tough, just taking care of business, and then you had
Sydney who was a fan favorite and lighthearted. So that, when we thought of
your team, is what we kind of thought about. Now I'm thinking: What is this
team's personality going to be about? What are people going to think about
when they see some of your individual personalities?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, I think each player is different, but they're definitely
great role models. Gabby is one of the toughest people we played against. I
remember when I came in first as a freshman, I was a little scared of her. But
that's what you need to -- you want to be a tough competitor. She was a great
role model for that. And Jamie too.  
  
We need toughness and we need competitiveness going forward. And you also need
a joyful, lighthearted kid like Syd to balance that out.  
  
MARIE GULICH: I think what you'll see from us on the floor will be unique.
We'll play as a team. We show that we love each other and play to inspire not
just each other but the community around us in Beaver Nation. I think you for
sure will continue to see that from us. And for that maybe some people rise
and stick out. But right now the roles haven't really been established yet. So
we'll see.  
  
Q. I know this is really early, but Civil War, okay, and obviously
Oregon has risen a lot quicker and higher than maybe many people thought,
maybe except them, okay. So the game is not for a while. How is it -- are you
guys talking about this recruiting-wise, or how does this affect your program
in any way?  
SCOTT RUECK: This conference is No. 1 for a reason. It's well coached. There
is a lot of talent. Talent is staying West now, the reason we're where we've
been and where we are. We've done that exact same thing.  
  
To me, my personal opinion is I'm not surprised. It makes us all better. It's
another really good team in our conference.  
  
As far as recruiting goes, it's every day. You know, it's every day. We work
against the Pac-12 every day in recruiting, and that's just the norm.  
  
For me, I look back on my career, and I think of my greatest growth in great
rivalries. I can look back as a D-III coach and say Suzy Barcomb and a guy at
PLU named Bill Rigell were two people that made me grow and challenged me.
They were heated rivalries, and they were so fun. I respected the heck out of
them, and I'm grateful for it.  
  
I look at what Tara's done. I mean, who doesn't want to try to compete with
that. I mean, are you kidding? That is the greatest thing that a competitor
can try to do. So to be in the same sentence as them or near them in the
standings, even, you're doing something. How phenomenal.  
  
Well, Oregon, they've done the same thing. They've worked their butts off.
They've gotten really good. Another great team. Awesome.  
  
We're all getting better. We're all rising. There are no negatives to it.  
  
Q. Mikayla, I was wondering if you could tell us about your experience
with the track team last spring, throwing the javelin. Coach, if you had a
chance to watch her out doing track & field and your thoughts on that?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I participated in track & field in high school, and I went home
for spring break and saw my sister competing in track, and it sparked my
interest again.  
  
I knew competing in track would keep me motivated to work on my strength, work
on my speed, and that would help translate well to basketball. So I did it as
a way to get stronger, stay competing, stay competitive. It was a lot of fun.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: My perspective on track is I love it. I love it. The reason I
love it is every single individual sport student that I've coached in my
career has a mental toughness advantage over anybody that's not competed
individually. They know they've committed. It matters. They've been out there
on the island having to come through. Succeed or fail, you have to live with
it. And you can't look anywhere else. It's on you.  
  
So when she approached me with that, we talked about, well, you're here for
basketball. How are you going to manage your improvement in the off-season
through basketball? Can you during this? Just do you believe it's a good
decision for you at this time? And she said yes, and I said, I agree. So go,
go do it and win the Pac-12.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Thanks for letting me compete.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: You're welcome, Mik. Yeah, I'm all for it. It's amazing.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I think for one meet we had a get-together or something.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: We'll see how this basketball season goes. Take it a day at a
time. But basketball is my main priority, and that's what I love most.  
  
Q. Seven years ago, Coach, you were one of the upstarts trying to make a
mark with your team. Now we look around the conference and there are several
newcomers. Some of them had some success. Looking at them, do you see or do
you feel any -- do you see yourself in any of them, and does it remind you
when you first came to the Pac-12?  
SCOTT RUECK: I don't remember details. I remember what we had to accomplish
during those times and how hard it was. I don't know the details completely
like I knew that. I know that it's a grind.  
  
I know the number one thing you have to change is a mentality. It's a
mentality more than anything that we can, and there is a toughness that is
demanded. There is no other word for it, it's a demand. You have to match this
toughness every day, and you have to be so resilient and you have to fight so
hard, and it's worth it.  
  
So I admire those that have taken on those challenges. You look at the
conference, and there are just great coaches everywhere. There are great
people doing great things in every program in this conference, 1 through 12.  
  
So I admire it. I'm a fan of it. Certainly we'd like to keep them where -- no,
I'm kidding. But I can relate to all of them. So when you see them on the
recruiting trail, those are fun conversations. I say, yeah, I can relate
exactly where you are and this is what I did at that point. Not that it's the
right thing for them. Who knows. But this is what worked for us.  
  
So, yeah. I'm excited for our conference. It truly is the best.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask a question about the national picture. UConn has four
starters back. They've got a terrific player from Duke in Stevens. They've got
the No. 1 recruit in the nation, Megan Walker. Are you all playing for second
place across the country this year?  
SCOTT RUECK: (Laughing.) Of course not. Of course not. Who knows what's going
to happen throughout the year. I do have an incredible amount of respect not
for the talent they have but the program they have. We've felt it, we've
watched it, we've observed it.  
  
You know, Geno doesn't just acquire talent and win because they're talented.
He's won because he can coach and he puts them in position to be successful.
So will it come together again? There is no one in here that can predict it,
of course. I see them taking a step forward from a year ago, however. So that
means everyone will need to rise as well.  
  
Q. Marie, for you, your increased presence in the lineup on the floor
for Oregon State, how did that translate for you in international basketball
with FIBA and Germany this summer?  
MARIE GULICH: It definitely made me more comfortable and more confident. Going
back to Germany, I was a little nervous. I hadn't played European basketball
for a while. It's a little different.  
  
It was a lot of fun, though. I was the youngest on the team, so that was new
for me, too, because I'm, here, the oldest. So just like stepping into the
role, seeing older players coaching me, too, and seeing leadership and
learning from that. It was a lot of fun. I think it will help me transfer that
back to here too. So I benefited in both ways.  
  
Q. Some of your new faces, you see 6'8 " on the roster, and it piques
your interest in how developed she is. And do you expect her to be able to
contribute this year?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, well, you know I love those ones. So we're really excited
about Jo. Jo is neat. We had our team retreat this past weekend, and each of
the students got to share. We all did. Everybody in the room got to share. Got
to tell about their story a little bit.  
  
We all got to hear her motivation for coming to the States. She knew if she
wanted to be the best she could be, she had to come here to develop. That was
met with some adversity at home.  
  
So her story is one where she wants to be elite. She wants to be great. And
anytime you have someone that wants it that bad, good things are going to
happen.  
  
She obviously in some ways will remind you a bit of Ruth because of her size.
She's an imposing presence. She has a lot to learn. She hasn't played at this
level yet. But she's very intelligent and adapting quickly. Even in our first
week of practice, you just saw incredible growth and her just becoming
comfortable within a new system. So I have big hopes for her that she's going
to have a big impact on our season this year.  
  
Q. Mikayla, what has been the biggest jump for you in terms of
leadership, from coming in and being young and contributing, to knowing now
what your role is going to be before you step on the floor?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, last year we had great examples in Sydney Wiese and Gabby
in what good leadership looks like. I think going forward new roles have to be
established. I'll have to be more vocal. I'm not the loudest, but I know if I
lead by example, that's a good way to lead as well.  
  
Just to continue to encourage the underclassmen. If they have any questions,
they can come to me and ask to get good advice.  
  
But leadership roles have to be established going forward.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: One of the things I have to improve on is being louder and
being more vocal. In high school I was the captains of the cross country and
track and basketball, so I think that leadership there will help translate to
this as well.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Mik tends to be a bit understated.  
  
MARIE GULICH: I agree.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, she was telling us about Lynwood High School and how they
won a state championship. And I said, What sport, Mik? I'd ask her. Girl's
basketball. Just to make sure everybody knew.

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Lynne Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30341)

### [Tanaeya Boclair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34206)

### [Emily Potter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26506)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Thank you all for being here. We're excited to be here. This is
coming in on my third season here at Utah. So I feel like I finally feel
settled. This feels like my program. Like we're really -- like I explained on
camera on set that it feels like wet cement right now. We've kind of laid the
foundation, players headed in the right direction. Like our staff is in the
right place. You know, just continuing to work and grind and continue to
climb.  
  
It's an exciting time to be part of the Pac-12. Even though the conference
graduated a lot, I think it's better than ever. As exciting as it is, it's
also really challenging as we continue to climb and build, and we're doing it
in the best conference in the country.  
  
So looking forward to the year. I think at this point in October, every
program is full of enthusiasm and optimism and all of that. We're no different
in that. So we're looking forward to getting going.  
  
Q. Is there a blueprint to reaching the upper echelon of this conference
and staying there? And without tipping your hand, what do you guys need to do
to get there?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: What was the second part?  
  
Q. What's part of that blueprint of working your way up to getting with
the Cals and the Stanfords and UCLAs and staying there?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I don't think there's any secrets to it. There's no hand to
tip. I think it's two things. One, it's culture, and you can't ever sidestep
that. You can't ever take a shortcut on that. That's the number one priority.
In terms of culture, recruiting good kids and just the foundation that you
want.  
  
Then the second one, you've just got to recruit talent and get better and
better. You look at those teams that you just mentioned, and that's what
they've done. They've got established, healthy cultures, and they've got
talent.  
  
I feel like our culture's in a really good spot. I know culture is such a
cliché word, but in terms of who we are, how we operate, how we conduct
ourselves, how we work, we're in a good place.  
  
I didn't recruit these two, but feel like I did. They definitely feel like
they're mine, whatever that means. We've got really good kids. They're not
kids, but we've got great players, we really do. They're doing whatever it is
we ask them to do, and we're continuing to recruit young talent.  
  
So this is the third program I've taken over. The other two I did before, we
won a championship, and had never been done. And that's the goal at Utah, and
I believe that we can do it.  
  
Q. I know you like to be up-tempo, and you couldn't always do that
previously. What kind of styles will this team have this year?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Well, I think, yeah, I still -- just my coaching philosophy,
coaching style, I always want to try to be up-tempo. We didn't really have the
depth to do it the last couple years to the level I wanted to. We're more up-
tempo than they had been.  
  
But this year I think we have the best post play that I've ever coached. We
have, you know, we're two, three deep at the four and five spot. We have
legitimate size. We've got 6'6", two 6'5", and two 6'3". So we're big. It's
exciting style.  
  
So we still want to be up-tempo, but we'll probably play two post players at
the same time. So kind of a new type of offense, but philosophically the same
in terms of the object of the game at the end of the day is to score more
points than you're playing.  
  
Q. For both of you -- I guess I'll go, Emily, after a couple years with
Coach, just your reflections on the transition and your experience in this
change to Coach Roberts. I'm curious on this year's roster, you guys are
seniors. Here we go. When you look at the roster, you look at the personnel,
kind of what your outlook is for the year?  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, I have to thank Coach Rob and the coaching staff for
letting us take our time and transition. I think it's always hard. They didn't
recruit us. They were given us, and they did a really good job of trying to
find out what we're good at. She didn't try to make me a point guard. She
wants me to put in the best --  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: World's dumbest coach.  
  
EMILY POTTER: She's going to put me in a spot to be successful, and I'm really
excited to play in this new offense we have this year, and I think that will
really showcase our talent.  
  
So, yeah, it's been a process. I think Coach said last year second year is
always the hardest, and I think it was. So I think we're ready to make a jump
this year.  
  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: Yeah, in response to the roster, I think we finally have all
the pieces that we need to kind of click and ebb and flow throughout the
season. I think throughout the years we've had like specific things. We have
drivers and we have someone that can shoot, but they were a missing post play
or just anything.  
  
But I feel like our freshmen this year, yeah, they're freshmen, but they're
catching on quick. They are willing to learn. Their work ethic is great. I.  
  
Feel like we have a good base of upperclassmen that know the system. We know
what Coach Rob wants. Just being able to transfer, like Coach Rob said, the
culture down to the freshmen and teach them in practice that this is what
working hard looks like. This is what it looks like to play Pac-12 basketball.
I think that's a lot. It could really progress a lot faster this season than
we have any other season before.  
  
Q. Emily, you led the team in scoring and rebounding, but you also led
them in fouling out. I wonder how you balance -- because I think to take your
game to the next level, how do you stay on the court and yet still be super
aggressive? Can you work on that? What do you do there?  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, defense is always a work in progress for me. It's
something I want to take pride in. We did defensive boot camp the entire first
week of practice last week. Only defense for the entire week. Yeah, I think I
just need to trust my abilities on defense. I am bigger, obviously, than a lot
of the girls. I need to trust that I can defend them if I move my feet and I
work towards it. So trust in that and try not to foul as much. Know that I
need to stay in the game for my team.  
  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: I can add on that. She and I have talked a lot, and it's the
burden of leadership. If she fouls out or if she gets two fouls early and she
has to sit or that knucklehead third foul really early in the third quarter,
those are things as a senior that we're all counting on she's got to
eliminate.  
  
She knows that, and I think she's in a good place to -- that's just part of
maturing as a player, understanding as frustrated as you are and how much you
want to go for that block or whatever, not taking the bait.  
  
I think she's in a right mental state. It's not like we haven't talked about
it and stuff. But at the end of the day, I don't know that you can practice
not fouling. Like you have to choose in that moment to be disciplined and not
foul.  
  
Q. Going off of that, you have a 6'5 " and 6'4" freshman coming in.
Emily, how's practicing against somebody your size? Is that helping this
year?  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, it's definitely great. The more bodies, the better, and
different types of players. People that are more like better, a lot stronger
than me. Or a lot more mobile than me. Like having those two different types
of players to play against is good because that's what I'm going to see in
games.  
  
So you want a variety. We also have Megan Huff who is more of a shooter. So
that's been a challenge for me, making sure she can defend the three-point
shot as well. So having that versatility really helps. So come game time,
we'll be well seasoned and seeing everything already.  
  
Q. Maybe a little more on Maurane Corbin?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Maurane. She's French Canadian.  
  
Q. I've heard she's got quite the personality.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: She does.  
  
Q. Would any of you like to expand on that?  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: Yeah, me and Mo have become good friends since she's been
here. On the trip to Italy, we sat on the back of the bus together and started
French lessons. So she's been teaching me some French words every now and
again.  
  
But I think playing CEGEP basketball in Quebec helped grow her game and helped
prepare her a little more for coming here to college. She's definitely very
outspoken, and she understands the game, and I think that helps a lot.  
  
So I feel like her confidence with us on the team, like she knows. She's so
fun. I don't even know how to explain it. She's so fun, so willing to learn,
but also willing to interact with us. Never shy. Just hearing her like when
she says her words in English that aren't really English, So what are you
trying to say? That's her level, like the bonding.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: She's a great interview, too. Some of the slang that just
doesn't quite translate, she went -- this is a fun story. She went into our
trainer, who's name is Claire. She said, Claire, I have new. I have good new.
Claire was like, What? She said, I have good new. She said, What do you mean,
news? She said, No, I only have one. So stuff like that.  
  
It's just constant and entertaining. She's great. Her name is Maurane, but she
goes by Mo because everybody thinks she introduces herself as "Moulin."  
  
So she's great. She'll get a lot of playing time. And she's a fun interview.  
  
Q. I want to talk about the trip to Italy. Favorite things you did? You
talk about team bondings. There are a lot of new, young kids. Did most of them
get to go along?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, they all did.  
  
Q. Talk about experience. I was watching you vicariously as I worked
while you were overseas.  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: Yeah, I think the Italy trip helped us bond and get that much
closer as a team. It's only October, but we've been together so long already
it feels like we're mid-season team-wise.  
  
We're all definitely really close. Some highlights for me from the trip was
definitely Rome those first couple days. Did a lot of sightseeing from the
Vatican. Seeing that was amazing. Then Lake Como, we all went swimming. Most
of us went swimming when we got to Lake Como. Then we found out that's not a
thing that locals do, and it's apparently gross to swim in the water there. We
thought it was great.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: We thought it was amazing. We wondered why no one was in the
water. We were just in it. We were wondering why they were all staring at us.  
  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: We survived. No one got sick.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
EMILY POTTER: He was in his house. The window was open.  
  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: Yeah, he was in his house. We creepily boated by.  
  
Q. Coach, can I ask, when you came to Utah, you kind of hit the double
bonus. You had the Pac-12 recruiting platform, and you had a lot of really
significant facility upgrades. How has your recruiting elevator speech evolved
over the last couple years with Utah?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: It's been great. The one thing we can speak to is the one thing
we sell is just the level of the Pac-12 and how great it is. What we need to
find at Utah -- you know, I don't know, for better or worse, Utah is not the
sexy sell. It's not -- we're not on a beach. We're not.  
  
And so for us -- and we're climbing. So we have to find those kids that want
to be in the Pac-12. They want to play at the highest level, and it is.  
  
But they also want to be the first to do something. So Utah women's basketball
has a ton of success historically -- 15th or 16th winningest program in NCAA
women's basketball history; 18, I think, Mountain West Championships.  
  
But we haven't done it in the Pac-12 yet. We have to find those kids that are
Pac-12 talent, Pac-12 ability, Pac-12 mentality, but that want to come to a
place because they want to be the reason we do something for the first time.  
  
With that said, that's been what we've been trying to find. We've gone
international a ton. Our 2018 class, can't really talk about it, but it's
going to be a great class. 2017 was very, very good, and it just keeps getting
better.  
  
But a lot of that is the facility. But I think more Utah's -- our facilities
are I think better than anybody's at this stage.  
  
But Utah's a cool place. It kind of sells itself. We kind of fight the
perception versus reality when you get on the phone with a kid or family and
they come visit. It's like, wow, this is really cool.  
  
What makes it really cool is more the people than our locker room. While the
locker room is incredible, while the facility is ridiculous, I can admit that,
that's not why you pull the trigger and come to Utah. It's because of the
people, and it's because you want to come to a place that's Pac-12.  
  
It's amazing. All the things like this. But you want to be the reason that
Utah women's basketball does something that's never done in the Pac-12.  
  
Q. Emily and Tay, this may be difficult for you to answer since the
season hasn't started yet. What do you hope that Utah fans and basketball fans
in general are saying about this year's Utah team?  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: Yeah, I think that what we want to do always is work hard and
achieve like full potential. We don't want to leave anything behind for a
season. Knowing now we don't know what that potential holds or what that
potential necessarily means.  
  
But for me and Potter and all of us seniors, our main focus has been leaving
it all on the court and leaving behind what we've learned over these four
years and what seniors before us, our captains before us have taught us -- to
always work hard, to leave your heart on the court and be completely invested
in the people that you're with.  
  
Like everybody keeps telling me, like, you're a senior. You're never get these
years back. Now it's completely clicking. I don't want to leave.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I don't want you to either.  
  
TANAEYA BOCLAIR: These girls have become family, my sisters, and some of my
best friends forever.  
  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, I think I just want people, when they watch us play, to
say, like, wow, they really love each other and want to play basketball.  
  
I want you to see on the court that we're all one unit. We love the coaching
staff, we love each other, and we just play really dang hard. So I'd love for
that to be visible every time we step on the court.  
  
Q. You have six newcomers and your own recruits this year. Can you give
us a quick rundown what you're expecting from these newcomers?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Well, we're going to need them. We have a couple injured. A
couple are going to redshirt. One because of injury, one kind of
developmentally. But we're going to need them. The one that she was on our
team last year, Megan Huff, she's a transfer from University of Hawaii. She
was a volleyball and basketball player there and wanted to get serious about
just focusing on one sport. So she redshirted last year. She's going to be an
impact player for us.  
  
I think Emily gets so much attention on defensive scouts. It's going to open
things up for Megan a lot. So she's going to play quite a bit. Tori Williams,
a guard out of Idaho, a freshman, she was the big Idaho State Player of the
Year, very highly recruited. She can score. She's got a good feel for the
game. We're going to need her to play.  
  
Then Corbin, we were talking about Mo Corbin, I think she's going to be an
impact player for us too. She's a freshman, but she just plays so dang hard.
She's still learning. And there is the language barrier even where she might
not even know turn left, turn right, but she has nose to the ball and plays
her tail off. So she's going to make plays regardless. So she's a little ahead
of the game, farther than I thought she'd be.  
  
So I think those are the newcomers. I know we've got some great returners.
Obviously, these two. Then Erika Bean at point guard. And then we've got some
good guards coming back too.  
  
So we're a little deeper than we've been, we can shoot the ball better, and
I'm cautiously optimistic.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Alexis Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34201)

### [Kennedy Leonard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32002)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
JR PAYNE: Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. It's nice to look out
and see so many now familiar faces in the room, so it's wonderful.  
  
But we're very happy to be here. We're excited about the season that's coming
up so much quicker than -- I know as a coach, it's coming up so much more
quickly than I would like. These guys are probably ready for games already.  
  
But we have a lot of new players. We have these two fantastic returners that
carried a heavy load for us as sophomores and now will continue to carry an
even heavier load.  
  
So we have a brand-new team. I'm excited to share about them with you, and
we're just ready to get going.  
  
Q. Year one in the system is always a transition, and even when you try
to jump start it, everyone's a freshman learning how to do stuff. What's it
feel like? How do you tangibly tell the difference between last year, when
everybody was learning who their coach was and their system, and then maybe
this year?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: I think just being able to play in it for a year, even if
it's just a year, helps a ton. Obviously we have a couple new faces, a lot of
new faces. But at the same time, it's a year under the same kind of structure,
and we know what's coming and same plays -- don't tell anybody that, though.
Different plays. Lots of different plays. Be ready.  
  
Just the same kind of concepts I think Coach J and Coach T have kind of
instilled in us so we're able to help the new people.  
  
So, yeah, I think just having a year of experience is good. And we're kind of
like sophomores in the system now, so we can try to help the freshmen and the
transfers.  
  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: I have to agree with Kennedy. It's been pretty easy so far.
Sometimes us veterans will catch ourselves, like, oh, this is a pretty
difficult drill. Let's be veterans. We catch ourselves doing that, and we'll
be there with the new kids and kind of help them out along the way.  
  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, it's really nice this year, we only have five returners, but
we lean on these five in drill work and, like Kennedy said, in full practice.
A lot of it is it's just easier when you have anyone, even if it's just a
couple that know what you're doing, know the expectation of how is this drill
run and, more importantly, how do we interact together, train together, and
what tempo should we be training at.  
  
So for me, it's significantly easier. Even with eight new people, it's so much
easier this year.  
  
Q. Last year, if you took, I don't know, a couple signature moments or
big takeaways, what are you reflecting on from last year that you're going to
take forward with you this year?  
JR PAYNE: Oh, gosh, there are so many things in year one that I can reflect
on. Some of them were on the court, some of them were off the court. When we
had a big -- it may have been our win over Kentucky in the preseason last
year, I remember sitting at the press conference table with a couple of our
players, and it was probably these two, someone said, How do you beat a team
like Kentucky? And one of them said, We have just bought into our roles. We
feel confident in our role. We know what we're doing, and we're all doing the
best we can in our role.  
  
For me, that was a pivotal moment in our program because that's such an
important part of the way we run our program.  
  
Another big win we had or big moment was our win at Cal when they were 25th in
the country, a game we weren't supposed to really even compete in, never mind
win. And to take a team that, like someone said, we're basically all freshmen
in a new system, and to win a game like that on the road was also very
pivotal.  
  
But advancing to postseason play, winning several postseason games, there were
a lot of really great things that happened in last year's season that we can
take and build on this year.  
  
Q. Alexis, how is the rehab process going for you coming off that torn
ACL? I read a couple weeks ago that you'd be ready in a couple weeks. I was
wondering if you could give us a status update. And, Coach, what have you seen
from Alexis as she's tried to make her way back from injury?  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: Yeah, it's going pretty well. It's been an easy process,
considering the timing. But, yeah, I'm looking pretty good, I think.  
  
JR PAYNE: She's looking better than good, yeah.  
  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: Yeah, I should hopefully be full-go here soon. But
everything's going really well.  
  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, Lexi tore her knee, and there is never a good time to tear
your knee, but she tore it at the best moment of the year that she could have.
The season was coming to an end, and she was able to have her surgery right
away and rehab right away.  
  
Now she's basically back. She hasn't been cleared for full court five-on-five
drills, but she's playing five-on-five in the half court.  
  
I told someone the other day when we were playing, I said, Lexi looks like
she's never been hurt. She really does. I mean, she he looks like she's never
been injured. She doesn't love her knee brace, so she takes it off as quickly
and often as she can. But the doctors are thrilled with the way she's
rehabbed, her strength, everything about it.  
  
So I'm expecting -- as great of a season as Lexi had last year, I'm expecting
an even bigger season.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
JR PAYNE: Absolutely. If we had to play today, Lexi would be ready to go,
yeah.  
  
Q. I was privileged that I got to watch you guys a lot in person last
year and could see the improvement. What do you think, Coach, the biggest
difference from last year to this year will be?  
JR PAYNE: We took a big loss in Haley Smith, our great senior last year who
was just an incredible force on and off the floor. But we return a lot of
firepower in these two. There aren't too many one-two punches around the
country that I believe are as talented and as effective as these two young
ladies up here on the court. So that's a huge, huge bonus for us.  
  
The biggest difference from this year's team to last year's team is we're
significantly bigger. We're significantly longer. So we'll be able to do a lot
more things defensively than we could do last year.  
  
So we turned people over a lot. We scored a lot off forced turnovers and
things like that. But we'll be able to do that a little bit even more
effectively this year.  
  
Q. Talk a little about them. And also two of them -- I've asked some
other coaches about their international players. Two of them were overseas,
one via junior college, I suppose. How important was that, to get overseas
players on your team?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, I think the world of recruiting has gone pretty international
lately. For us, that doesn't necessarily need to be a focus, but I think the
world has shrunk with the Internet and the way video can be transported and
exchanged.  
  
So the two international players you're referring to are freshmen from the
Canary Islands. Sara Castro, and she's from Dakar, Senegal, but she played one
year at junior college, Imatel Jop (phonetic).  
  
So those two, we weren't necessarily looking for international players, but
these two seemed to fit what we're looking for at that time. They're a great
part of our program.  
  
We have a lot of new ones. You want me to talk about all of them, or just a
couple? Just a couple. Okay. Those are two of them.  
  
One young lady that you're going to hear a lot of throughout the season is a
junior college transfer from Massachusetts. Her name is Janea Bunn. She's a
6'3" forward, and she's going to be really, really good for us this year.
She's a great rebounder. She's athletic, big, broad, mature player. She's
played a lot of basketball. She can attack. She's going to be really good for
us this year and fill in some of the empty space that we had inside.  
  
Another young lady I'll talk about is Mya Hollingshed, a 6'3" freshman wing
from Houston, Texas, who I believe is one of the more talented players I've
ever recruited.  
  
Now, it's a big step from high school to college and the pace and everything,
the grind of a long season, but this gal can play, and she's going to have a
big impact this year.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you -- were you confident from the git-go that you'd be
back around the season opener? And can you take us through your rehab over the
summer and how exactly you approached it the last few months?  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: Yeah, I was pretty confident that I'd be back. My sister had
recently torn her ACL, not recently, but this past fall, and she recovered.
She's my younger sister, but she's my inspiration for coming back so quickly.
So I looked to her process and how things went for her, and I based myself off
that.  
  
But as far as how everything went this summer, the rehab, it seemed really
fast, but it was actually pretty slow. We really weaned myself into it. And
then I guess at the right time, when practice started hitting, we just started
going really hard and got really aggressive with my rehab and stuff like that.  
  
Q. As a second-year player, what kind of lessons did you learn about
playing in this conference?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: It's a good conference. Every night is a good game. You know
you're going to get some good competition.  
  
Fortunately, this is my third year in the Pac-12. I got to experience it as a
freshman. Freshman year was a little rough for the team. But with Coach J and
Coach T coming in and coaching us and everything, last year was really fun.
Got to compete in every game. We won two games we probably shouldn't have won
and lost some games we probably shouldn't have lost.  
  
But I think in the third year we're upperclassmen now, so we're able to -- in
the storm, in the eye of the storm, we're able to calm down those around us.  
  
So I think that's going to be really, really vital in the middle of the
season, when things might not go as we planned or as we think, to be able to
be those people that our teammates can look up to and know that everything
will be okay.  
  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, my first year, in completing our first year, the biggest
difference that I noticed was every single night you're going to play an
opponent that's really tough, extremely well coached, very disciplined, and is
going to have the capability of beating you.  
  
But then on the flip side, we also have the ability to beat anybody as well.
So I love the fact there is nowhere on our schedule that you can look at a
game and circle it and go, okay, if we're struggling, we can get back on track
on this night. There is no one in the Pac-12 that you can count on being able
to walk in and "we can win this game for sure." So that's cool.  
  
As a coach and as a player, a lot of these guys chose to come to the Pac-12
because they wanted to play against the best, and that's the opportunity that
we get every night.  
  
Q. I watched you guys a lot. So, Kennedy, your numbers really increased
from your freshman and sophomore year. What part of your game do you want to
improve on and expect to be improved this season?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: I don't know if it's so much basketball-wise, but I fall a
lot. I get pushed around a little bit. So this off-season I've gotten in the
weight room a lot. Now I have like a little muscle definition. So I'm going to
try to stay on my feet a little more.  
  
And then obviously I'm just going to try to be a better leader as a junior and
a point guard. The ball is in my hands a lot, and I have to be an extension of
Coach J on the court. Keep my body language good, keep myself on my feet, and
keep the teammates on their feet I think is what I'm going to try to do my
best at.  
  
Q. How about you, Alexis?  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: I would definitely say different off the court. I want to be
a better teammate. We have a lot of new kids, so I want to be able to set the
example for them and get them through tough times, because there is a lot of
struggle being student-athletes. So I want to get them through tough times on
and off the court and build a relationship with them.  
  
Q. Were Alexis's arms some of your motivation? What were you lifting at
the beginning of summer, and what are you lifting now?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: Me?  
  
Q. Yeah, if you want to get specific.  
KENNEDY LEONARD: Okay, the other day we did max squats, and I went from 210 to
259. And I have little legs, so they tell me that's pretty good.  
  
My bench press, we haven't tested it yet, but last time we tested it I got
135, which is my body weight. So I don't know if that's any good, but that's
what I got. My vertical has gotten higher, so that's good.  
  
Q. What was it, and what is it now?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: 26, I think. So I wasn't fat before, but I was a little
chunky. So I've lost some of that chunk, and now I'm pretty lean.  
  
JR PAYNE: For the record, Kennedy Leonard has never been chunky. But she
actually has leaned out and gained a good amount of muscle.  
  
KENNEDY LEONARD: I lost whatever was there, and now it's muscle. Yeah, I've
gotten in the weight room a lot. Alexis obviously gets in the weight room a
lot too.  
  
And we were partners in the weight room this year. So my weight would be under
hers, and she was like, Oh, no, you can do it. You can do this push press at
105. And I'm like, I cannot do that. And she's like, Do it, do it. I'm like,
Okay.  
  
So she's standing behind me, and I'll like shake to get it up there, you know,
but I get it up there, and then she goes and throws on like 150 pounds and
just slings it around like it's nothing.  
  
So to be able to compete with each other in the weight room and lift each
other up and grab our teammates and link up with them and get them pushing
bigger weights I think has shown off on the basketball court, too, because we
don't fall. We rebound better now. I think it's just a full cycle.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, it's great to see so many members of the media
here. I think each and every year that I've certainly been in the league it
seems to have grown and grown and grown.  
  
We're excited as Oregon Ducks to be here. I go to bed smiling almost every
night because I don't think I've coached so far a group that's been more fun,
more competitive in my life. So I really enjoy these guys. We've had a lot of
fun.  
  
Like I said, we have worked hard, and we have high expectations on the year.
Right now I think our program is in a great place, and we hope to have a great
year.  
  
Q. What are those expectations this year playing on last year's stage
and the terrific March run?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, last year was a lot of fun. We've been reminded of that a
lot, but like I always say, this is a new go-around. The expectations
externally, I think, have changed. I was privy to the poll. I haven't seen the
whole thing yet. But I know where we've been picked by the other coaches, so
that obviously we're not flying under the radar now.  
  
But we challenge our players all the time. We always set higher expectations
on them than even those externally. So we have the right mix of players,
they're all driven as well. I have tremendous student-athletes. They've all
been winners. Most have had the experience last year.  
  
I think they, in the back of their minds, think they can do more and do
better, and that's certainly what we're gunning for this year.  
  
So we'll see how it plays out. It's going to be, again, another grind, a tough
Pac-12 season. The conference is as good as ever. I mean, it's deep. So we've
got a lot of challenges ahead.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your experience? It's going to be a different
experience than not flying under the radar and being a team that's on the rise
to people you expect a lot from, and you probably expect a lot from yourself.
How do you expect them to change the dynamic with the team this year?  
KELLY GRAVES: Practice is already different. Especially with our international
kids being freshmen. It's really good that we have so much experience now this
year because I think we can help them a lot. It's great for us. We appreciate
each other every day in practice, and we want to get to where we were last
year, and even further than that.  
  
We're really excited for this year to work harder to achieve our goals.  
  
Q. I didn't know you owned a suit jacket, first and foremost, Kelly. I
didn't know that was in your wardrobe. Looking good.  
KELLY GRAVES: I literally, when I pulled it out yesterday when I flew down, I
had to blow the dust off the sleeves and the top.  
  
Q. For both of you, it's really rare for sophomores to be invited. It's
rare for sophomores to be the leaders of the team. Can you talk about how much
different it is from a vocal perspective, or an example, leading by example,
from last year to now you've been through the grind and as a sophomore?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, we had great leaders last year. Jacinta was a great
leader. Maite was a really good floor general for us, and she's even better
this year. And Lexi has played the most games at Oregon. She was one of the
only ones that was a returner and had played.  
  
But we led by example. I know that's for sure. I think all of us freshmen did.
I think having that mindset of wanting to win and doing whatever it took for
us to win, I think that definitely showed in practice and showed in games.  
  
But I think it's a little different this year, especially since we had gone
through it. Last year I think our freshmen looked up to us more, and
definitely other players on the team look up to us a lot more. We still look
up to them. I don't think there is one particular leader on the team. I think
everyone does really well in their role and everyone looks up to each other
for guidance.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, definitely. I miss Jacinta, of course, her leadership on
and off the court, her talking to us and boosting our confidence. We really
miss that. But something as a sophomore, especially Mallory and I, are working
on talking more and trying to lead, not just the post, but the freshmen as
well and being more vocal this year.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: When you talk about the expectations and leadership, we still
have to remember this is a young team. One of the youngest teams in the
conference. Maybe one of the youngest teams in the country. On our roster, we
only have two seniors and two juniors. So even though we have a lot of game
experience in terms of returners back, starters back, that kind of thing, the
reality is we're still very young. So I think the ceiling is very high, and
we're still a work in progress.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Sabrina, you guys have kind of talked about wanting to go
even further than last year. What do you talk about as a team goals-wise? Do
you even mention the phrase Final Four, or what are those conversations
like?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, definitely not. I know my goal as a player and our team
goal is taking everything one step at a time, and that begins with practice.
We take everything one step at a time and live in the moment, because you
can't overlook anything that you're going through in practice or in games.  
  
So I think just taking everything one step at a time and doing what's in our
control. So if that's practicing hard every day or that's working on your free
throws or working on your shot, I think we really try to focus on what's in
our control and take everything one step at a time, and then everything else
will find its way.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, definitely one step at a time with nutrition and working
in the weight room. Just making ourselves better each day is definitely a goal
for us.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Mention they're just sophomores? I mean, seriously. These guys
are elite basketball players and competitors. They've already figured this
stuff out.  
  
Q. Coach, I owe you an apology. At your pep rally last year I predicted
that your team would go to the Sweet Sixteen. I was one round short. Because I
knew what Sabrina was; Ruthy was a surprise. So congratulations on a fantastic
run.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you were our motivation. We used that in the locker room.  
  
Q. No, I was not. Blind squirrel finding nuts, that's all I do. Lydia
Giomi. How's the wrist, and how do you see her fitting with what you have in
place?  
KELLY GRAVES: Lydia has been doing great this fall. I think she's healthier,
yeah, there is no doubt. Her hand is better. She's been practicing with us
full-time. I think the year off is good. She didn't gain a ton of weight. But
it's not often that you line your team up at the end line and you go down and
back and your 6'6" player beats everybody.  
  
She's a great athlete. She's getting close to throwing that ball down, so
she's got a high ceiling. She loves the game. She plays really hard. She's
going to give us a defensive presence. Most importantly, she's a really great
kid and an awesome teammate.  
  
Q. Do you two want to add anything to that?  
SABRINA IONESCU: He nailed it. She's a great person on and off the court. But
just her positivity, especially having that injury last year, is something
that we actually all look up to.  
  
She's so positive, no matter what it is. She'll miss a lay-up in practice and
go back down and block someone's shot or get a loose ball. She's always
working a hundred percent no matter what it is on the court.  
  
And I think that's something that all athletes should do in every aspect of
their game, because I believe that's what helps your game grow.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: And she'll lead the league in flying elbows. Those arms are so
long. It's just all over.  
  
Q. Have either of you caught one of those in practice yet?  
KELLY GRAVES: It's like their initiation.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: All the time.  
  
Q. Ruthy, I thought at the end of last season you might have gotten
robbed by your teammate, because looking at the numbers, she might have had
the flash in the tournament, but I thought you could have easily been our
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. Any inspiration or motivation in playing with
Sabrina next to you?  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's inspiration playing with Sabrina and having her push me
every day. It's an honor to play with her. I'm proud of her for getting
Freshmen of the Year, and it's going to be great to play with her for the next
three years.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how do you, slowly, correctly pronounce your last name?  
SABRINA IONESCU: All right. Here it is. Everyone, listen. Repeat after me: Yo-
ness-Cu.  
  
Now all together.  
  
MEDIA: Yo-ness-cu.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yes!  
  
Q. Awesome, thank you.  
KELLY GRAVES: A teacher and a player. She does it all.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: It's what I do.  
  
Q. Larry said he met with all the coaches this morning and did bring up
what's going on in the men's game. Lindsay just talked about the importance of
just a reminder that you guys want to be the standard of excellence and
integrity. Any take from you on the message?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I'm sure she said it a lot more elegantly than I possibly
could.  
  
The honest truth is I haven't dived into what's happened on the men's side.
It's too bad, honestly. As coaches we're stewards of our games. I would like
to think that we all want to hold ourselves accountable and uphold the
integrity of the sport by doing the right things.  
  
I think sometimes the drive to win can make people do things they wouldn't
normally do. But hopefully it doesn't mushroom even more to something bigger
and that it stays out of our game on our side.  
  
Q. I want to ask the players this. You had an amazing run. Who do you
see, new players, coming in to play a lot or give significant time to your
team? Which player or two?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think everyone's going to have a huge role on our team this
year. I don't think there is one player in particular that's going to play
more minutes or do this or do that. That all takes care of itself.  
  
But I think every one of our new players and returning players are going to
have a huge role on the team. Like Coach tells us every year, every one of us
are going to end up winning a game for us. No matter if you start or you're a
bench player, everyone's going to end up stepping into a game and having to
contribute in a way that's going to help us win.  
  
Q. I appreciate that. But you're the point guard too. Who do you want to
pass to as a freshman that you know Sabrina's going to finish a shot? Come on
now, be honest.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Satou Sabally.  
  
Q. Ruthy, go ahead. Who do you pick?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Who do I want to pass to?  
  
Q. Who do you trust right now? You guys were freshmen, but you didn't
play like freshmen. You're sophomores, but you play beyond your years. This is
about trust. Who do you trust right now? You've got a game tonight. Who do you
trust as a freshman coming in that's going to come in and contribute?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I would say Satou as well. She definitely has a lot of
confidence coming in as a freshman, and how she plays really works with what
we're trying to do. So Satou.  
  
Q. What separates her as a freshman with your other kids? And she's an
international player. What does she do that will help your team?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Are you asking any of us? She has a positive attitude and
she's always willing to learn. Everything she does, I try to correct her and
teach her, and she changes it right away.  
  
Sometimes it takes kids longer to get out of their old habits and get into new
ones. But she's always ready to listen and learn and try to be the best player
that she can be.  
  
So we're really excited to get her. She's long, she's athletic, and she shoots
the ball really well. So I think she's going to be a great fit and definitely
earn a really big role on our team.  
  
Q. Sabrina, every time we ask this question, what did you work on in the
off-season, everybody says: Everything. Can you give me two specific things
that you worked on in the off-season?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yes. I worked a lot on my defense in the off-season because I
felt like I was a defensive liability last year just being able to keep my
player in front. I usually just like roaming around and getting steals here
and there.  
  
That leads to transition, huh, Coach?  
  
So I definitely worked a lot on my defense. I think USA Basketball helped me
with that, competing against the top players in the country at trials, and
playing internationally I had to step up my game defensively.  
  
Then another thing that I would say that I worked on my game would be staying
positive. I usually get down on myself, and that might not be something --
like not a specific part of my game, but all-around game, I think, would be
staying positive.  
  
I think they both can attest that I always get down on myself. I have to stay
more positive and lead our freshmen and returning players.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you're a fellow Miramonte Matador. Go Mats. You came to Cal
last year, probably just ten miles away from your home, and had a dramatic,
game-winning three-point shot. Can you talk about that feeling of playing back
at home in front of friends and family, and doing that so early in your career
and how it impacted your season?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think that was a turning point in our season. We had
injuries early on. You know, Maite was out, I was out hurt. So I think that
game really gave us a lot of confidence and a little boost going forward.  
  
But that game wasn't won just on my shot. Maite hit a big shot. Ruthy got a
steal. It was all of us collectively working hard throughout the whole game
and never giving up. That was something that we stayed with the whole game and
trusted what we were doing.  
  
But it definitely was fun coming back home. I had all my family there, my club
team, you know, everyone was there. It was fun being able to get that win and
get that boost.  
  
Q. Your newcomers are all from overseas. Can you talk about recruiting
internationally and how the Pac-12 Network played into that? And your
Instagram account is all about your shoe game. Can you talk about how you
became so popular with (indiscernible)?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, okay. Well, the first part, the game is international now.
And I think if you're not recruiting internationally, I think you're doing a
disservice to your university and your program. There are just so many good
players. Both Ruthy and Sabrina talked about Satou.  
  
And they have to play -- they don't have high school systems over there, so
they have to play with pros. They're playing in club systems. So they come in
a lot more prepared, perhaps, than the players over here do.  
  
So Satou was the MVP of the U20s this year, European championships. So she's
playing against veteran players, and it, I think, pushes them.  
  
Anneli Maley, multi-gold medalist, one of our incoming freshmen from
Australia, same thing. She's playing as young as you can play internationally
in big-time tournaments.  
  
And then Aina Ayuso -- that's right, right? That's going to be the next tough
one to say. Aina is a really crafty freshman from Spain. And I'll tell you
what, she's got a lot of Maite in her.  
  
As far as I'm concerned, Maite is one of the top two or three point guards in
this conference and has the potential to be a pro.  
  
I think all three of those are going to impact us in a positive way.  
  
I personally love to coach skilled basketball players. That's just my
preference. And we're not the kind of team that's going to run all over the
floor and get in your face and defend like that. I like to coach skilled
basketball players. And, quite frankly, I think the Europeans and Aussies and
everywhere else in the world, I think they do a really good job of teaching
the skills that, quite frankly, doesn't always happen over here.  
  
So we've had some success, and I think in the recruiting, and they in turn
have success when they come over, and that breeds having more players that
want to come over. So it won't stop. We spend a lot of time overseas
recruiting.  
  
Did you say the shoe game or the shooting game? Oh, the shoe game. Well, you
know, that's kind of Nike. Obviously, that's the University of Oregon, that's
what we do. Hopefully it's not something that that's what we do best. We do
other things.  
  
For me, I love it because they just keep giving me shoes, and they're really
nice. And I have two sons that also wear size 13. So if I don't like a pair, I
can always hand them down, so they get used, no doubt.  
  
But I don't Instagram much. I think you're talking about Twitter.  
  
Yeah, and I've had other coaches think that's very egotistical that I will put
a couple of options and let the public choose. I think that's okay, right?
Okay.  
  
But I will tell you this: I did wear what was given or what was chosen even
though I didn't actually personally think they were the best. So when the
public speaks, I listen and I act.  
  
Sorry. That was a long-winded answer to a very nice question.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Hi, everyone, good morning. Thank you for being here. Pac-12
Media Day is an unbelievable day. It keeps getting better. Just to see the
room filled with such terrific communications talent is really meaningful to
us.  
  
We feel in this conference like the story is no longer that we're on the rise,
but that we're here. That's really fun to be a part of, to have been part of
some of the growth and to now see the student-athletes thrive on this
platform.  
  
Very excited to have these two young women here with us today. They're now
juniors. Personally for me they've been through so much with us, and they've
turned into not just great talents, but really unbelievable leaders. To see
them as upperclassmen showing our youngsters what Cal basketball's about,
their goal is to lead us back to the top. I have a lot of confidence in them.  
  
I think since the last several years this is our best combination of veteran
talent and leadership with youth that's ready to contribute. Freshmen and
sophomores that can play, but they have juniors and seniors to show them the
way.  
  
So we're really excited about the upcoming season, and can't wait to get
started.  
  
Q. Tell us about Jordan and how things are going on that front, and if
you're going to have Jordan and the other young man, Weston, on the bench with
you during the season.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: So Jordan is my son. Not Jordin Canada, although we can talk
about her too. They met last night. It was very fun.  
  
This time last year I was pregnant and couldn't tell any of you all, so I was
just self-conscious about if I had a bump showing or not. So it's pretty
unbelievable now to have a five-month-old son. As those of you who are parents
know, it's life changing. It's unbelievable.  
  
For me, the most special thing is that the young women I coach, who are also
my family, are integrated with my other family of Patrick and Jordan. That has
been the most gratifying thing, to see them interact with him.  
  
For me, the challenge -- and I told them this before I went on maternity
leave, I'm going to be the same type of coach, but there may be a little guy
bouncing on a chair next to us.  
  
Literally that's what's happened. It's been an unbelievable experience. I
appreciate you asking about that.  
  
But the focus for our team this year is really about being the Cal basketball
team we know we can be, and to just have my family be part of that is pretty
special.  
  
Q. Kristine and Asha, you were both talented enough to play a lot as
true freshmen. And now you're juniors. How does that change things for you
both in terms of leadership and your role on the team?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: For me, I came in and saw great leadership. So I'm just
trying to be the leader that I watched and I expected from the upperclassmen.
It's just really exciting. It's my last go-around, so -- well, the last go-
around, well, the last whatever. Okay, you guys get it.  
  
But I'm just really excited with this group.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: For me, I would say it's been an experience being myself, looking
at myself in the mirror, seeing what type of person I'm becoming and then what
kind of leader I'm becoming for the younger ones.  
  
Then just seeing growth with Kristine and all the other veterans, to see where
they've come. And it's been an experience. I've really been enjoying it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you said you're going to be the same coach. That said,
having a child, has it changed your perspective on coaching and how you coach
this team going forward? And then for the players, what's it like not having
only Jordin, but Weston around, hanging around the team?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: So, there is nothing exactly the same as having your own
child, but I've really felt over my career that I've had 12 to 14 children at
any one time.  
  
I was remiss in the opening statement to not mention that Kristine sustained a
knee injury. It was six days ago. She's okay. She hyperextended her knee. It
was very scary. But she was laying on the ground going, "Lindsay, Lindsay."
And as a coach, she's as much my child. Seeing Asha go through what she's gone
through, being a freshman point guard, I've really felt like I've had children
before with respect to the team.  
  
So my perspective is just right now different in that I'm trying to balance
everything. Having a son that I'm nursing, it's a lot of time. It's a matter
of managing that. And sure, seeing him smile or make some crazy sound makes a
missed lay-up maybe not seem as significant.  
  
But I do think the way I approach the treatment of my players and the way we
run the program, I hope that how I am as a mother is just an extension of what
I was doing before, if that makes sense.  
  
But, yeah, it's definitely different to have Weston and Jordan around. And
they can speak to that.  
  
But my personal style, I hope that I've approached other people's children
that I've had in my program -- I make a promise to their parents I'll treat
them a certain way. I hope I've always been that way, but now having my own
little guy just kind of puts it in perspective a little bit.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I think, adding on to that, I think her demeanor has changed
as a coach because she expects us to just know what we're doing. So we're
upperclassmen, me, CJ, Asha, Kayla, Nina, she expects us to know what we're
doing, and she doesn't give us the leeway of, oh, you're learning. It's like,
you know this, do it.  
  
So I feel like that's our motto going into the season. Like we're older, we're
better. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Lindsay and the players, talking about the Cal basketball team that
you want to be, I know the last couple years have had their share of
frustrations, so how do you turn the channel on that? How do you turn the
frustrations of the last couple years into being the team that you want to
be?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: That's a really good question. In terms of basketball
things, I think we have a better balance of ability on the floor. As I've said
multiple times, not afraid to say I think Kristine is, if not the best,
certainly one of the best post players in the country.  
  
But now I think we have a terrific three-point shooter and leader in Asha. I
think we have someone like Mikayla Cowling who can get to the rim. I think we
have freshmen now -- Kianna Smith, Alaysia Styles, Mi'Cole Cayton -- people
can break you down off the dribble and create shots for others. I think we
have better pieces than we've had in the past.  
  
But the other point, as Kristine was alluding to, I now have older players who
I can look at in practice and say, "This isn't good enough," and they're able
to get better within the course of a practice.  
  
I don't think we need to lose two or three games in a row to say we can be
better. I think they're able to self-assess in the moment, and that's
maturity.  
  
Two years ago we had zero seniors. Last year we had one that was competing on
the roster. Now we have two really significant seniors -- Nina Davidson's
playing really well and confident -- and two upperclassmen that I don't know
if there are juniors who have played more minutes in their careers in the
entire country than these two.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Yeah, I would definitely continue with what Lindsay said, the
leadership, us maturing as players on and off the court. So we see different
sides of our past, and we don't want to go through that again. We don't want
our younger players to go through that. So we want to lead them to a better
view of where we want to go.  
  
Q. Larry Scott was just in here, and on a bit more of a serious -- I
mean, on a serious topic, he said his message, he did bring up integrity with
the women's coaches in the meeting this morning. Could you share that message
and maybe how you feel about the importance of just a reminder of the
integrity of the game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: First and foremost, as Division I head women's basketball
coaches, we're educators. I've said this before, I said it again, said it in
some article that came out today, if I'm only talking to them about pick-and-
roll defense, and I'm only talking to them about running the transition lanes,
I am not, I don't think, doing a complete job. Right?  
  
This is a time in their lives where they're learning how to be change makers,
they're learning how to deal with adversity.  
  
I think our number one thing is to lead them as human beings. So if I'm not
acting with integrity in my own job, I'm certainly not the leader I can be for
them.  
  
I think the game of college basketball is unbelievable. We need to protect it.
It's a good chance for coaches, given what's going on nationally, to just look
and say: Are we conducting the sport we want to conduct? Are we conducting our
business the way we want to and need to?  
  
And I think generally we are, but it's a good chance to reset and say: What
path do we want to go down here and make sure that we're the leaders in terms
of how collegiate athletics is supposed to go.  
  
Q. Asha, as a leader on the team now and upperclassman with seven
underclassmen underneath you, what is your best piece of advice for your
fellow teammates hitting the Cal campus for the first time?  
ASHA THOMAS: It would probably be to be yourself. I know Lindsay has allowed
us individually to be ourselves and be comfortable with ourselves and then
around people.  
  
I know for me, I love being myself. I really do. It makes me become confident
on and off the court.  
  
So our advice for them is continue to be themselves. Don't be scared to make
mistakes.  
  
I think that's probably a hidden thing where a lot of freshmen come in and
they're thrown into the fire, as in my place, or they're not sure what college
basketball is about. I think it's okay to make mistakes. It's the process of
the four years or however long you're going to be there.  
  
Q. Just individual things you two have been working on this off-season?
I know you can shoot the three, Asha. Are we going to see more of that this
year? And, Kristine, we know you're great down low. But what are specific
things you've worked on this off-season, and what are we going to see in your
game this fall?  
ASHA THOMAS: Definitely continue shooting at threes. Continue to put the ball
on the floor as well. But also on the offensive side, knowing where my
teammates are. Trying to make the easier play for them and not have them
continue to force themselves to do something. Also on the defense, I need to
pick that up. That's definitely something I need to do, and you'll see a
change in that.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: This off-season I just worked on just getting stronger and
getting faster. I wanted to run the entire game, and I want to be more
efficient. So I felt like if my conditioning was up, I'd be more efficient
because I'll be able to take bumps.  
  
And just keep playing more efficient as in like passing out when I need to,
getting the extra -- doing the extra play, getting on the floor, defense.  
  
I want my game to be, well, like -- I don't want to be scoutable this year; I
want people to be surprised when they get on the court.  
  
So that's what I've been working on, is being diverse and faster and stronger.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how cohesive of a team you have at this point,
having returned almost all your players? And can you comment on how the
freshmen are adjusting to the college game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I know it's a time of year where everyone's undefeated and
people feel good. I feel very confident it's the best team chemistry we've had
since our Final Four team. I can see it, I can feel it. Team chemistry doesn't
always mean the rah-rah, we like each other. They do. We're defending national
champs of dance team and have fun and that kind of thing.  
  
But I think the chemistry's now there where they can hold each other
accountable. They can raise the standards. They can get on someone to do
better but still be good off the court.  
  
So I think our chemistry and cohesion is really good. That partly comes from
returning most of our players, but it also comes from a concerted effort by
the people in the program to say: We want more. We want to do better.  
  
So I credit the upperclassmen with that. The freshmen have been great. They've
been seamless personalities to integrate. From a basketball standpoint,
they're very high IQ basketball. They haven't seemed like freshmen some of the
time. When they have, they've had friends and mentors and upperclassmen to
show them the way.  
  
Q. This may put you on the spot, and I don't want to put you on the
spot, because you're the leaders and you've played a lot. So I want you to be
specific. What are your personal goals this season? I want to talk numbers.
First of all, you have some big numbers, and you know you've got to carry the
team. Your shoulders feel heavy at times. But what do you have to do? What are
your expectations per game? And also what are your team's expectations? You
went to the tournament last year, second round. What do you have to do to help
your team? What are your goals?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, for me, in practice, I know I'm not carrying the team
anymore. I'm a big presence on the court, but Asha, her shot has gotten so
much better. People are getting to the rim. Kayla's getting to the rim. Nina,
Penina, she's shooting threes.  
  
We have so much talent. The freshmen are shooting the ball well. Like Mi'Cole,
our starters are great. Like we lost one player. We went to Australia. We went
to New Zealand. We killed it.  
  
I'm just really excited for the season. More so numbers. I'm just trying to be
efficient. I'm trying to get to the rim, pass the ball, shoot mid-range,
trying to be mid-range and efficient all around. Play defense.  
  
I'm trying to win. I'm not setting big goals because I know the goals we have
for ourselves, but like if we don't make it, okay, but if we do, we got better
than we did last year. So I'm trying to win, play strong, and play hard. Yeah.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: As for me, pretty much everything Kristine said, literally. For
me, I'm going to be the constant leader. Whether that's I have to score -- I
know I have to score more. I have to do that on a consistent basis. I have to
do better on a consistent basis. Assists. Keeping those up. Whatever I have to
do to help this team win, I'll do it.  
  
So it's going to be multiple things I have to do in one game, and I don't mind
doing that.  
  
Q. Australia and New Zealand, you said you killed it over there. Can you
tell us a little bit about how you felt with the intensity before the season
started and what you mean by that?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Coach Lindsay brought up that we -- like the team chemistry
is on a different -- like it feels different. And going to those trips, I felt
like we just got closer. We did so much. We did scuba diving. It was so much
fun.  
  
I'm just really excited with our team on the court. Whatever translated off
the court went on the court. So we're passing the ball, we're running for each
other. We're playing hard for each other, because that is what we worked on
the entire summer.

JUNE DAUGHERTY: Good afternoon to everyone. It's great to be here. Really
appreciate seeing a lot of familiar faces and some new faces as well. Very
excited about Washington State's women's basketball.  
  
We are healthy and coming off a Final Four run in the WNIT, which I think has
definitely built a lot of confidence into our players.  
  
We've had the best spring and summer that I've witnessed in my 10, 11 years
here at Washington State. The players are playing with a lot more confidence.
They're a lot more hungry about continuing to play in postseason.  
  
A lot of great leadership from these two and other teammates, and a lot of
talent.  
  
We are very up-tempo. More so than we've ever been. We scrimmaged the other
day, and I had officials in. And we scrimmaged against what we call our gray
squad, the guys we play against. And we put a lot of points up on the
scoreboard. And I don't think it was because their defense was so bad.  
  
So very excited about the season. Have a great schedule, a great team, and
ready to take some questions.  
  
Q. From last year it felt -- the last couple years, just the injury
thing, every time you got momentum, there would be some injury. I don't know
how you addressed that with your team or you just forget about it. How do you
go through that? It seems like it stopped your momentum.  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, first of all, I'm just so excited that everybody's
healthy now. We gave them a lot of vitamins all postseason, all summer.
They've worked really hard, our doctors and trainers worked really hard with
them.  
  
I think one of the unique things is when something bad happens, there is a lot
of good that comes out of it. And there was a lot of good that came out of it
for our team. I think the mental toughness that this group showed last year,
not losing one, but two, but three starters and then a fourth player for the
season like they did, they just bounced back. They did not allow anyone to
make excuses for them.  
  
I think that they're to be commended about the fact that they were able to
say: You know what? We know they're hurt, but we're good, too, and we're going
to keep playing and get better. And that's exactly what happened.  
  
To see them make that run, that was the third year we were in the WNIT. But to
play four out of five on the road and win the way we did in the WNIT I think
really talks about how mentally tough they really are as a group, the
leadership in the program. And I'm pretty proud of this group for what they
did.  
  
They also know it's time to move on from that, and that's something that we're
working on right now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that WNIT run, what you learned from it and what
you take from it and move forward as you start a new season?  
CAILA HAILEY: I think our team learned a lot from going as far as we did in
the WNIT. Like June said, that was in the past, and now we're focused on a new
year. We have new goals this year with everybody coming back. There are high
expectations, and as it should be, but I think that that kind of tested us a
lot with the injuries as well.  
  
Like she said, it is a testament to the coaches and to the players and how
tough we are.  
  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: I also want to say that last year in the WNIT we had a
lot of experience, because we had three starters going down and then a fourth
player, and this year we only lost one senior from last year, Eva. Everybody's
coming back this year.  
  
The WNIT was a great experience for us because there were tough games, one
after the other. It was a quick turnaround. We had to travel a lot to various
and different places that were far from us, learn to scout, and be quick to
learning the new system.  
  
So it gives us experience as a team. We're hoping to carry that on to this
year. We know last year is over, so we need to get that experience and use it
for this year.  
  
Q. Pinelopi, your WNIT run was especially good, and you upped your
averages significantly from regular season to postseason. What worked for you
during that run? Is that something that you could take forward to this year?
Coach, what did you see from Pinelopi during that WNIT run?  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: One thing that I changed personally was to sleep more. I
knew it was very important to get rested and recover from game after game. I
knew I was getting more minutes on the floor. So I needed to kind of balance
my academics more than I did in the past.  
  
So that was a good observation from my strength coach. He said: What changed?
You're getting eight hours or more of sleep, and look how good you're playing.  
  
So I'm keeping that in mind for this year.  
  
Another thing is the starting point guard went down, so I was the one up. And
I really wanted our team to go far. I didn't want the season to end in the
Pac-12 Tournament like the year before. I got confidence from that. I was
looking at my teammates and I wanted them to be successful and have a
successful year.  
  
Especially Eva, our senior last year, I really wanted to play, as a team, play
good for her, so that she finishes with a great experience her career at
Washington State.  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Well, you can see we've got some team chemistry. The whole
team was challenged when starters were going down. One of the things that
happened with the injuries is we played 10, 11 players deep.  
  
So we did have an opportunity where Pinelopi and Chanelle Molina, the young
lady that went down with ACL, they played a lot of minutes. They're used to
being in the leadership roles that they're in.  
  
So I think that really helped us, is the fact that we've played a lot of
players. They've had significant minutes on the floor. They just had to up
them quite a bit.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked last year about Lindsey Wilson, performance
consultant, working with you. You talked about how great this off-season has
been. Is there anything you've done that's different this year in terms of
preparing for your team?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, Lindsey's program is awesome. I've known her for years.
She's a great high school player and had a great college career as well.  
  
But for us this year, we've tried to take a different path. We've brought in
speakers. We've brought in some different speakers. We'll continue to bring in
speakers.  
  
One of the speakers that will be interesting to a lot of you in the room is
that Bill Moos really wants to talk to this team. We had a long conversation
this summer, Bill and I did, about the program has arrived. It's great that
we've been in the WNIT the last three or four years, but this is about getting
into the NCAAs and going deep in the NCAAs.  
  
Bill and I both believe this program has the opportunity to compete for the
title in the Pac-12. We haven't been able to feel that way in a long time at
Washington State.  
  
So speakers will continue to be a part of what we're doing kind of behind the
scenes, if you will, with the program. It will be fun to see how they react to
the different speakers that we have programmed with it.  
  
Some of it is a little bit of a surprise. They don't know. It's kind of
ongoing as the season goes on. Some of them will be picked up on some road
games with former players and standout people that will, I think, make a great
impression on this group.  
  
Q. Just kind of going off what Coach just said, talk about the progress
that you've seen with this program and how these things that they create for
you, what it's been like. There are a lot of positives, but also the things
that they're bringing in now, different speakers and different motivational
tools, to try to help you build chemistry with this team. Talk about how
that's been for you.  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: It's been a great experience because I've never had this
opportunity in my life before. And Coach June makes sure that we introduce
ourselves to people that we see on the road as well. We get exposed to things
that could be good for us in the future.  
  
So it's a great learning experience because we hear from their lives, from
either successful people or people that have been in our position and they
struggled and then they rose.  
  
It's good to see where we're at now and where we want to go as people, as
maybe professionals or basketball players, whatever it might be. It helps us
in our lives.  
  
CAILA HAILEY: Yeah, just piggybacking off of that as well, I can tell I've
changed so much since my freshman year, and that's all because of June, all
the things that she's done for this team, preparing us outside of basketball
for life in general, as far as meeting people, like Pinelopi said, getting to
know people, learning about people's lifestyles and what they've been through
and learning from that and taking that into our life and learning from what
they've gone through and taking that on.  
  
Like even now, I never thought I'd be a captain ever. Like I said, that's all
because of June. And she's prepared me for life. I feel like now I'm confident
in leading this program because of June.  
  
Q. Your teams are known for having an international flair. Kelly Graves
talked about recruiting overseas as well. He says that oftentimes he noticed
in Europe and Australia that the kids are taught skills and that that really
doesn't happen as much over here. You see the influx, especially from
Australia that's now a gold mine for players coming to play here. What do you
think about his comments, and do you find that that's true?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Well, I would agree with Kelly on that. We see him quite a bit
overseas, him and his staff. Basketball is a global game. Because of FIBA TV,
now Facebook, the Internet, you know, there is quite a bit of interest from
the student-athletes overseas. They can check us out. Pac-12 Networks is in
30-some countries, and they see our games.  
  
So we get a lot of interest not just from Australia, but from Europe, and
Athens, Greece. We have kids from Serbia, France, Bulgaria, Portugal. Did I
say France? Serbia, yeah, Australia as well.  
  
But I agree with Kelly because over there we get to see practices, we get to
see quite a bit of games as well. But the fundamentals are taught at a very
early age over there. And fundamentally the players in those countries are a
lot of times way ahead of our age groups, and a lot of that has to do with the
way they teach the game.  
  
So it's great to be able to go over and recruit kids from all over the world.
I believe we're the most diverse team in the country, if you look at our
roster. Where we're all from, whether it's Los Angeles or Bulgaria, it's
great. It's great.  
  
But basketball is a global game on the men's and women's side. It's fantastic
to be able to go to homes across the world and talk about getting a world-
class education at Washington State, to be a part of the Pac-12 Network, to be
able to be seen the way that they're able to be seen these days. It's a win-
win for everyone.  
  
Q. Couple new freshmen on the roster. Only two faces that I'm not
familiar with. So this is for you, Caila and Pinelopi, first, before Coach.
What do you like about Taryn Shelley and Celena Molina?  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: That should be a Disney character, Celena Molina. I'm
going to start with Celena, because she's a stud. If you watch her social
media pages -- her Instagram, her Twitter -- she's really loving Pullman,
everything about it. She takes pictures all over the campus, in the city -- or
town.  
  
And both of them are great kids. They have great character. They have already
bought into our program. They haven't caused any trouble.  
  
What I like about them is they always have their eyes and ears open, ready to
learn from us. So it's important that we as leaders set the right example for
them and move on. But they're receptive, so that's a good thing.  
  
CAILA HAILEY: Yeah, very receptive players, very respective players. I think
they fit into this culture perfectly. There are times when I'll pull them
aside in practice and say, hey, make sure you're doing this or that. And
they'll say, okay, great.  
  
And Celena, she was on my team and she didn't understand the drill, and she
was on the side asking me questions. I said: Go in and do it. It's okay to
make mistakes.  
  
That's what I love about them. They're open to making mistakes and know that
it's okay to make mistakes as a freshman. They want to get better. I love
their work ethic as well.  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Just so finish that. Celena's a very unique athlete and very
athletic, very athletic. Right now she's ahead defensively than she is
offensively, and that's okay, especially for a two-three guard in our program.  
  
Taryn Shelley has really soft hands, and that's a great thing when you talk
about a post player at 6'4". She's learning the system very quickly. She's
somebody that offensively is not going to have problems scoring, but she's got
to learn the other side of the basketball, like most freshmen, defensively.  
  
So excited to have them both in the program. Thanks for asking about our new
up-and-coming stars, I hope.  
  
Q. Is everybody -- I know you had so many -- not only so many injuries
but so many crazy injuries last year. Is everybody full-go now? There are no
restrictions?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, they're full-go. Every day they're in practice, and it's
great to have the numbers out there.  
  
Q. I wanted to go back to something you said a few moments ago, Caila;
that you never expected to be a captain. How come?  
CAILA HAILEY: Just always having people in front of me. I'm always the one
that kind of looks up to other people. I never expected to be the one that
people look up to. I'm always the one that's trying to learn.  
  
I feel like I'm always -- as an underclassman, I always make mistakes, and
just trying to learn from my mistakes. I feel like once I started taking
outside of basketball more serious, and I felt like that kind of carried over,
I'm way more mature than I was my freshman and sophomore year. I know the
system inside and out now. Like I said, that's all a testament to June.  
  
Q. Expand on that a little bit. Did she say anything in particular? Was
there a moment that helped you believe in yourself?  
CAILA HAILEY: Yeah, definitely. June's always encouraging me. She told me way
back she could see me being a leader for this program. In her saying that, I
wanted to be a leader. That's what made me change myself, my character. That's
what made me grow as a player.  
  
Like I said, leaving this program I know that I'm ready for life now outside
of basketball. So I'll even if I never play basketball again, I know I'll be
ready for what hits me, and that's because of her.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you all for being here and your hard work. We're so excited
as a conference where we're going. But without all of you, those stories don't
get told, and the enthusiasm doesn't come forth. So just appreciate all of you
being here and all you do for the conference.  
  
I'm obviously really proud and excited for our program, for the opportunities
to pursue excellence that we have this year. This is the deepest team I've had
since I've been there. I think we're going to be able to play a very fun,
entertaining style, play up and down, press more, really try to generate some
points off of our defense.  
  
But just to, you know -- for me being able to watch these young women grow,
and not only in terms of the stats you've heard but how they're growing in
their leadership, that's really fun to watch.  
  
We're just excited for the year and excited for the challenges that are coming
for being in such a great conference.  
  
Q. Coach, when these athletes were freshmen, you played the toughest
pre-conference schedule in the country, and we had a lot of conversations
about how that was a bricks-and-mortar experience. So here they are as
seniors. What did you build out of that?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think we're going to have the No. 1 preseason conference
in the country. This year, too, I would not be surprised if it shook out that
way. But it's like anything else, you know, when we meet really tough
challenges in life, you have to figure out. So are you going to go around the
wall, through the wall, over the wall? What's it going to be?  
  
And I think because they really embrace those challenges in this group and
they believed in a vision that really didn't have any substance behind it,
when they came in, and they had to be a part of the ones that built that
substance, I think that they've been -- they've gained so much perseverance.
They've gained so much character because they've had to find ways around the
wall, through the walls, and maintain that vision.  
  
So at the time, it really wasn't very fun, and I probably would have made some
adjustments. Hindsight's always 20/20.  
  
But I'm not sure I can argue with what the character and perseverance has
brought out in these young women.  
  
Q. Monique and Jordin, you guys got here as freshmen and you have that
opportunity to look ahead and all the things you hope will happen for your
career. Now you're sitting at the edge of your last season, and I'm wondering
what you're thinking about what you want to accomplish this season. And can
you believe that you're here looking at your last season?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I don't want to look back at the season and say, oh, if this
would have done this or if this would have happened. I don't want any what-
ifs. I just want to give it my all, have fun, and play really hard, and I want
to rise up (indiscernible).  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Like Mo said. But most definitely want to get to the Final
Four. That's a goal of ours. We want to take it one day at a time. Especially
for me, this being my last year. Just want to embrace every moment that I have
with my teammates, my coaches, and just enjoying my last year here.  
  
Q. For all of you, I can't believe Kari Korver's name is not on my
roster any longer --  
CORI CLOSE: We can't either.  
  
Q. You know, she was that first kid on the court, you go out and she's
just shooting, and I know she pushed you guys. Who tries to fill her shoes a
little bit, or do you force her to come back in every once in a while?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, she is around, thankfully. That's a nice thing. But I think
that's the standard that was set. Your leaders are your hardest workers. As
you grow, there is a reason that she performed as consistently and she had the
respect of her teammates.  
  
But I have really enjoyed watching other people step into that. They know if
you want to reach your potential, that that's the standard that's been set.  
  
I think that's something that's been really fun to watch Jordin and Monique,
over their careers, really dive into what does it take to be elite? What's it
take to be ready? What is the work -- we say, what is the work that has to
happen in the dark to be ready when the lights come on?  
  
I think that's not just Kari Korver anymore. It's most of our team. If you
walk into our practices before any of them start, that's what you're going to
see. I think there's a lot of credit that goes to her, because there was a
while that she was the only one, that Kari was.  
  
That's one of the biggest credits we can give to her leadership, is that she's
not anymore; that a lot of people have embraced the work ethic of what it
takes in the dark to be ready for the light.  
  
Q. Jordin and Monique, I was wondering if you could tell us about your
experience with Team USA winning the Four Nations Tournament, that U24
tournament, I believe you played on the U23 team, so playing up a little bit
in age there. And also for you, Coach Close, you see not only Jordin and
Monique playing with the National Team, but Ally playing with the Israeli
team. And then some former Bruins, Fields being named MVP of the FIBA Women's
America, and then Atonye Nyingifa winning AfroBasket with Nigeria. So what do
all of these experiences with the international teams do for your program?  
CORI CLOSE: Absolutely. You guys go ahead first.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Well, Team USA was a lot of fun, just being able to play with
some of the best players in the country, playing with them and against them
during the trials. It's just so much fun. You learn so much from them, what
you can get better at, and then they learn from you as well. So just being
part of that whole experience was an honor.  
  
Then playing against Canada, Japan, and Australia. It's just so much fun to
see the talent all over the world. And playing against that is just so much
fun.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I definitely agree with Jordin, just being able to play
against the toughest competitors, that the mentality was just bold, win. That
simple. I think that's something we brought back to our program, get the job
done (indiscernible).  
  
CORI CLOSE: It's just really fun to watch basketball make the world smaller
and to see how all these relationships that they're talking about, all the
experiences and how their game has grown by being able to play all over the
world.  
  
So the alumni that are getting to -- I remember when I recruited Nirra Fields,
what a dream it was for her to represent her country and Team Canada and what
she sacrificed to be able to do that. So to watch her continue to grow. I got
this nice email from the National Team coach about the incredible growth she'd
seen in her over the last year.  
  
So Atonye, I've never seen her smile that big. Something about representing
your country. We have so many countries represented, there's something about
that. I just love to see the pride in their eyes.  
  
I obviously got to watch them. I was a giddy coach when they both made the
team. I happened to be at training camp when they made that team. I also knew
what they committed to. A lot of coaches asked me, Are they excited about the
opportunity? Yeah, they want this bad. And they prepared for that in such a
way.  
  
It was really fun to watch them. The trials was like a WNBA combine. It was
amazing. And several WNBA coaches were there to take in the talent.  
  
But I think -- I don't have kids of my own, but if I had kids, there is
something about watching your kids experience really good things. And that's
what I've really enjoyed, is just watching them. Of course, it does great
things for our program, but that's secondary from watching them reach their
dreams.  
  
Q. You guys have so much experience returning. You're picked to win the
title. What about some of your newcomers? And is Lajahnja healthy now and
ready to go? Can you talk about some people that will be adding more talent?  
CORI CLOSE: How do you guys think the freshmen have added? You're the ones
that have talked about them. I can fill in the blanks.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I'm really excited for our newcomers because they come in
and work hard. It's that simple. They add a lot to our program and our
practices and stuff, and there is no drop off. I feel like every single day
they're improving and getting a lot better. They're putting in the time and
the work to get better.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: And they're very versatile. Every single one of them are
completely different in personalities, the way they work. The positions that
they play, they're just very versatile, and I think that's what we need on our
team, and I think that's what we have in general.  
  
Laj is going to be another asset to our team. She brings out that
aggressiveness every single day, and she's working hard as well. We're all
working hard. I think the freshmen are going to have a huge impact on our
team, and Laj is going to be one as well.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: We're excited to add Japreece too. Got to shout Japreece out
too. She transferred.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Yeah, Lajahnja is a huge thing for us. Rebounding I think was
probably the determining factor. We had an eight-minute period in our Sweet
Sixteen game that we didn't get a rebound, and that was the turning point.
Outside of that eight-minute segment, which you can't have at that level, but
Lajahnja's never had an eight-minute segment where she didn't get a rebound.  
  
So I'm excited to have her back and healthy. She also has a new maturity about
her. She's expanded her range, so that really helps someone like Monique, for
instance. They can play off of each other a lot when we can spread the floor
out, combined with their athleticism.  
  
We lost a lot of joy in our senior class last year. A lot of fun spirit. A lot
of just joy is the word that comes to mind. There was a laughter, and I didn't
really know where that was going to come from. I was a little worried about
it. I think we are pleasantly surprised to say that our freshmen have
unexpectedly brought this sort of really fun, bold joy. They're really
unafraid. They really go after things, and they're mature beyond their years.  
  
I'd say specifically Chantel Horvat from Australia has really stepped in.
She's very competitive. She's just really never met a challenge that she
didn't think she could conquer.  
  
I'd say Michaela Onyenwere, she's so athletic and versatile. She could be
giggling one moment and rip your head off the next. She's got a really diverse
skill set.  
  
Kayla Owens and Lauryn Miller have brought great things as well. Their voices
and their game will be heard this year.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit earlier, expectations and the poll again.
You've been chosen to win the Pac-12 Conference for a second consecutive
season. Last year, expectation was a lot. Didn't win the conference in the
regular season or the tournament. Now I'm wondering, all three of you, what
did last year's experience teach you that you can use here in 2017-18.  
JORDIN CANADA: Our conference is very packed. So the expectations of us last
year winning the regular season and the Pac-12, you can't really get too deep
into that. Obviously, it's a great honor, and it's good to have the
expectation. But you're going to have to fight every single night with every
single team. Nothing is handed to you. You have to earn it.  
  
I think that's what I've learned this past year going into this year. You have
to fight for every rep, every loose ball. You have to go after it because it's
not going to be given to you. You have to earn it.  
  
But, yeah, the expectations is an honor to be selected to win again. It's not
about talking, it's about your actions. So we have to go out there and prove
ourselves.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I totally agree with Jordin. I'm ready to go get it done. I
have a bitter taste in my mouth from games that we lost that we shouldn't have
lost. This is the fight, and I'm ready to fight. I think that we're battle
tested as a team.  
  
It's weird being in a new position. We're seniors now and the younger players
are looking to us where things aren't maybe going right or things are rocky
and challenging, they're looking to us to make things easier and to clear the
path for them.  
  
That used to be us. We used to look to our seniors to do that. So now that's
our challenge, and I'm ready to step up to the challenge.  
  
CORI CLOSE: I think this group has high expectations for themselves. So I'm
not sure anything from the outside can match what we place on ourselves every
day.  
  
So that's the key factor for us staying focused on our process, is that if the
expectations of the outside world are greater than what you have for yourself,
then it's easy to get distracted by those or maybe to rest in those. But when
your expectations are higher internally than they ever could be externally,
both in the individual accountability and the long-term potential of your
squad, I think that's a pretty good formula. I think their leadership will be
a big piece of that.  
  
Q. Jordin and Mo, I'm curious if you could give us one or two of the
biggest ways you've grown both on the court and off the court. I'm assuming
you're very proud of yourselves, but I want to know what ways you've seen that
growth.  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: On the court I would say mental toughness for me personally.
I feel like I really made strides in that at the USA camp, because that was
hard. I didn't want to think about how hard it was because everyone around me
was like, I'm tired, I'm tired. But I didn't want to put that out there. I
didn't want to put that energy out there. I wanted to remain consistent. I
knew everyone was tired, I was tired, but I had to keep going.  
  
I wanted to bring that into this season because everyone's being tired at a
certain point. But you have to fight through it and keep pushing to achieve
what you want to achieve.  
  
Off the court, I'm graduating early, and I'm really excited about that.  
  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: For me, I would just say my confidence level and getting my
teammates involved. My first two years, not saying that I was selfish, but I
didn't really read the floor well. I wasn't making smart enough decisions. The
past year I think I focused more on putting my teammates in positions to be
successful and just reading the defense more.  
  
Off the court, I would say trying to be more outgoing. I'm very shy, so I
don't really speak much. I don't like to do a lot of stuff. So just trying to
put myself out there and get to know people and make new friends and all that.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Captain of the ship, right?  
  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: Yeah.  
  
Q. We talked, Coach, about Rosenblum and Lajahnja Drummer. I'm wondering
what we can expect from Lindsey Cosaro and her contributions expected this
year.  
CORI CLOSE: It's great to have her be healthy, even as she gets more and more
confident, because really she is a freshman, but she's mature and her
basketball IQ is really high. Sometimes it's easy to forget that.  
  
But as she gets more and more comfortable, she's also a really good three-
point shooter, and I think that's going to be a key factor. If we want to play
north and south and really attack the paint, we're going to need some people
to widen out those driving lanes and be able to stretch defenses.  
  
Her ability to be a big guard and use her IQ to make people better. But she's
also a really good driver. She's strong and not afraid of contact when she
gets in the lane. She's going to be a really big factor for us to play the way
we want to play. She's also vocal on the court. As Jordin referred to, she's
become more vocal, but it's nice to have someone to share the load with.  
  
Kelli Hayes is a big piece of that, too, in terms of being a vocal leader that
understands expectations and those kind of things. So she's a big piece of
stepping into that new role of using her IQ and her vocal leadership to help
make Jordin's job a little bit easier.  
  
Q. You always have a very challenging non-conference schedule. Your last
game, UCLA a year ago, you lost to UConn. Now you're playing them, you're
undefeated at home, right, last year? What would it mean to beat them early in
the season or just beat them? How would that impact your team?  
JORDIN CANADA: Great question, and I would love to answer it. But we have to
focus the previous teams we're going to be playing, so Baylor and --  
  
Q. (Off microphone.)  
JORDIN CANADA: No, I understand your question. But I can't answer that for you
because I don't want to get too ahead of UConn because we have games to play
at home. That's more important than UConn right now. We have to focus on San
Jose State and Presbyterian and Baylor. So those are the games that we have to
focus on leading up to UConn.  
  
So we can't lose those games, because those games are at home. So it's more
important about our team and what we need to focus on day-by-day. When we get
to UConn, we'll get to UConn.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Well said, Jordin.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
JORDIN CANADA: Not me.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Not me. Monique?  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I enjoy cooking. I have a Pinterest, so like I'll make
casseroles. We got to talk, because I really love to cook.  
  
CORI CLOSE: So who are the best cooks? You? Kelli Hayes?  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Kelli can Cook. Japreece can cook. I've never had her food,
but --  
  
CORI CLOSE: Word on the street?  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I've seen her Snapchats. She can cook.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Chantel can cook. Her family says she's pretty good at cooking, so
you might need to invite her over.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Maybe.  
  
CORI CLOSE: There you go.

## October 11, 2017

  

### [Adia Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32004)

### [Kat Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34194)

### [JaLea Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34195)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
ADIA BARNES: We're all really happy to be here. I'm excited for this upcoming
season, and just delighted that there is a great turnout today. So thanks for
being here.  
  
Q. Noticing that you have three returning players and that it looks like
you're creating your own culture in Tucson, what do you want this program to
be known as?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, the biggest thing has been the culture from the git-go. I
just want to be known as a place with tremendous culture, and just some place
that's going to -- we're starting to build a legacy, and I think it started
with the culture with us. Having three returning players has been valuable
with so many newcomers.  
  
But, yeah, the culture for me is everything. It doesn't change in a year. It
takes time, but it's really evident this year. Adding a fifth-year like Kat
Wright has been tremendous because she's added to the culture.  
  
But it's a lot having seven new players. Just still working on cultural
things. But it is night and day from last year. It's refreshing and players
have really bought-in, and it's a really big piece of the process.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the changes from your experience? You sat in this
chair last year, and it is a fairly new experience for you as a head coach.
Can you talk about the ways you feel it's a little easier?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, first, people always said it's going to be really hard and
everything moves fast. But it is literally like drinking out of a firehose.
And I still have a little bit, but not the same. I think you kind of know what
to expect. But when you first come in, it is a whirlwind. You're late on
everything. There are so many things you have to change, and you start with
the culture, but you can't change the culture right away. So it's little
milestones you reach.  
  
But then this year, it's just a little bit easier because you have new players
that you have more relationships with. And I built relationships with JaLea
and some other players, so that just makes it a lot easier.  
  
But I think for us it's been adding the right pieces, changing the culture,
and doing the little things to show how it's a process to win, and you have to
do it every day and just what that looks like.  
  
I think initially no one really knew what that looked like because there
hadn't been a lot of success. So bringing in kids that are from a championship
culture, kids that have won at the high school at AAU level, all of those
things are essential for the culture.  
  
We're starting to see the difference. I think when you're in it, you don't
notice it right away, until the end of the year, JaLea's starting to speak my
language, and I'm like, okay, they actually listen to me. Those little things.
Or you see things off the court. And those are things I value.  
  
Now I'm starting to see it more, but it's not where I want it to be, but it's
definitely in the right direction.  
  
Q. Considering all the newcomers and you have transfer students, now
some can't play this year as they're sitting out, but in some respects does
this kind of feel like another year one in your program because of all the
different faces?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, it does in a lot of ways because you have to teach so many
new things, like you did in the first year. The first year is hard for the
players. You didn't recruit them and they're adjusting, so I was very
sensitive to that.  
  
But these are all players that I've recruited. You know, besides JaLea and
those guys. But now I have a great relationship with them.  
  
But I do think it is a lot of times like you're repeating some of the same
things. Ideally as a coach you don't want classes of like four, five, six,
seven. But I think initially when you're trying to get the best players you
can, you just kind of deal with it.  
  
But I think what's really helped this year is the three transfers, because
they're experienced. Like she has a tremendous amount of experience, so they
can add to the culture in positive ways and help mold the freshmen.  
  
It's just going to be really hard looking down the bench and seeing three
great players that can't play this year, so that's going to be a challenge.  
  
Q. Kat and JaLea, JaLea, there are players that have kind of come and
gone, and you're still here. What was it that made you stay and want to be a
part of this new culture? And Kat, what made you want to transfer in and be a
part of it?  
JALEA BENNETT: Like she said, I got to know Adia, and like she said, she was
really trying to change the culture, and I bought in. When I came here my
freshman year, my goal was to help build the program and change the culture,
and I felt staying here with Adia was the best way to do that. I'm glad I
stayed all four years.  
  
ADIA BARNES: And I'm very glad she stayed too.  
  
KAT WRIGHT: For me, I think a lot of it was throughout that whole transfer
process it was the coaching staff that really made me want to be a part of
that program. Like Ja said, to want to build something that, yeah, I only have
a year to play, but I can have pride in my school after the fact. When I'm
older and I'm watching Arizona on TV, I can be like: I helped build that.
That's what I wanted.  
  
Q. Kat, this is your first year now. You're in a Power Five conference
at Arizona. What is the difference already coming from a mid-major and now
practicing and then playing in the Pac-12?  
KAT WRIGHT: There are so many, I don't even know where to start. I think
practices for one, there are so many details. It's so detail oriented and
making sure we do every little thing correctly.  
  
But I think the one thing that I absolutely love about playing in a Power Five
conference is the girls that I'm surrounded with are so competitive. For me, I
love that. I thrive off of that. So just having those people around me.  
  
Q. And, JaLea, last year you were fourth-leading scorer. Now this is
really your team. What are you doing and what have you done to prepare
yourself and prepare your teammates for this coming year?  
JALEA BENNETT: I feel like the biggest thing that I've done is put my own
needs aside and focused more on the team. I have to step up and I have to be a
leader with my voice and by my actions.  
  
So the biggest thing is stepping outside of myself and making sure I'm there
for my teammates, especially focusing on how to talk to my teammates. Some
teammates, you know, I can get on them like in the heat of the moment; some
teammates I have to go to and talk to them on the side and let them know:
You've got it.  
  
But my biggest thing is basically to take a step back and focus, focus in on
like this year and what we need to get done.  
  
Q. Coach Barnes, you have the No. 2 recruiting class in the nation.
UConn is No. 3. What is key to recruiting?  
ADIA BARNES: You have to remind me like they're right next to me? Thanks.  
  
Q. I'm just saying.  
ADIA BARNES: Well, I think a lot of talk is about the No. 2. But their
commitment, so it's not official until you sign kids, that's one thing. That's
just the fruit of our labor. Our staff worked really hard, and we did reach
for the stars. We did go after some really top kids.  
  
I think that our staff had tremendous relationships throughout the country and
throughout the world, because we got some kids from overseas.  
  
But it was just hard work. I think the hardest thing in that recruiting
process was selling a vision. So you haven't had success. People look and a
lot of players, it's hard to be part of a building program. It's hard to go
there and your sweat, blood and tears and maybe not get to where you want to
go.  
  
So it's not for everybody. It is for the Kelsey Plums, it is for the Jasmine
Davis's. Those are kids that have the mentality that want to come in and,
okay, I'm going to bring you there. But it's not for everybody.  
  
So all the players that we recruited, they're all players like Kat that she
said: I want to be part of this legacy and go there and start something
special.  
  
We had to sell a vision. It's hard to sell a vision to 17-year-olds. But
selling them saying this is what we're doing, this is what it looks like.
We've had the experience. I brought Morgan Valley in, she's won in Final
Fours, she's won National Championships. We've been to the Final Four together
with college coaches, and I've won championships. Showing them that we know
what it looks like and believing in that.  
  
They all have a chip on their shoulder. To me they're all made for it. They're
made for the process. They're made to come in and do something hard.  
  
Like I went to Arizona and played for Joan because of that. I wanted to be
part of something special. I wanted to be the one that helps put us on the map
and make my mark. All of these kids are like that. They're like: Coach, we're
with you. We're going to do it.  
  
It's exciting to me because that's what I want. It's not for everybody. We've
lost some top kids because of that, but the kids I have, they're the kids for
it, and they're the kids I believe we can get it done with.  
  
Q. In the recruiting process, how do you use the Pac-12 platform to
enhance your recruiting?  
ADIA BARNES: It's a tremendous platform to use. By far the best conference in
the country hands down. We're not building a conference. Our conference is
there and it's to be reckoned with, and it is by far the best. You look at the
RPI and all those things. I'm going to sell that there are 111 games on the
network next year. I'm going to sell there are five ESPN games. Because kids
that come from far -- from Chicago, from New York, from overseas -- their
parents want to see them play. Now at the network, you can see them play.  
  
I think also a really key recruiting point for me was, well, before you didn't
have players from the West Coast being No. 1 picks or NCAA leaders and all of
those things like Kelsey Plum was in the Pac-12. So there is recognition.  
  
Now there is visibility. Now players are getting drafted first-round top
picks, and that's really important for players that their vision is to go pro.  
  
So all those things with the Pac-12 Network has helped us recruit and helped
us sell the product. It's a beautiful product to sell. This is a great
conference. It's in great cities.  
  
So it is by far the best. It's not something we just say, but it's proven now
because of the seven teams in the tournament. So all of us can use that for
recruiting. I think our league does the best job of promoting that, and I
think we can promote it even more.  
  
Q. I was going to ask the same question, but I'm also wondering on the
flip side you're in a situation where this league has maybe five teams that
are going to be in the top 25. Battles night in and night out. Do you have to
balance that in recruiting and saying, yeah, you're in this great conference
but it's a challenge? What is that?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, but I will always sell if you want to be the best, you've
got to play with the best. So do you want to go to a conference that is No. 1
but doesn't play a hard game all year?  
  
So, yes, in the Pac-12 you beat each other up all year, but it really showed
the results last year that prepared us for the tournament. Yes, they were
beating each other up every night, and there was no night that was a given
win. But then you have success later on when you play in the tournament. So I
think that was the result.  
  
But it is a hard conference, and I think it goes to show Washington's
(indiscernible) and went to the Final Four a couple years ago.  
  
So if you want to play with the best, you come to the Pac-12. I think a lot of
players and overseas, your goal isn't to go play in the Euro Cup. Your goal is
to play overseas in the Euro League. That's the best conference. It's very
comparable to that.  
  
Yes, if you want to get better and you want to have a chance to go pro and
stuff, you have to be in the best conference. I think that's what this
conference allows you to do. I hope that answers your question.  
  
Q. My question is for all three of you, you've got kids from all over
the country and the world now. Like how is the chemistry on the team? Do you
do special things? Do you have a special song or things like that?  
ADIA BARNES: We don't have special songs. If you have ideas, let me know. But
we do a lot of things. I think we talk a lot about culture. It is the most
important thing. I've never been on a championship team that doesn't have a
tremendous culture. It doesn't mean you have to have ten All-Stars or all
Pac-12 kids. You have to have the right pieces.  
  
So we've put a lot of energy in getting the right kids, not just in getting a
great kid that's not a great person. So that's really important. I like to do
a lot with teams. I'll let them speak more.  
  
But one thing I did, which I thought was awesome this year, we had a retreat.
It wasn't just an ordinary retreat. I thought let me get players out of their
element. I tell them they're in a box, and how are you going to get out of the
box? And some of the kids say I'm in the top left corner, and some of the kids
I'm like, well, you need to get out of it.  
  
So we did a retreat at a ranch. We did horse penning. We got in groups of four
and had to corral the cows in the cages. So it was team building, but it was
great. It was a lot of fun.  
  
It just really changed the chemistry. They were scared to death, because some
of the coaches were like: If I didn't work for you, I would tell you heck no,
I'm not doing this.  
  
So it was tremendous. It's all the little things. I do believe it's not one
retreat that's going to fix everything. I think it's a daily process.  
  
So I do indirect things that they don't know are team building. So every day
they eat breakfast together. It's not labeled as team building, but it is team
building.  
  
I chose to buy a house a half mile away. I want the players at my house
because it is a family. I have a child, my husband's on staff. So I want it to
feel like that. I don't want to just say and sell it as a family, because I've
been places it's like that. But I wanted to show this is a family, this is
what it's like; you can be a part of it.  
  
Now, it's not for everybody, and that's okay, because then you're not going to
be a part of this program. But it is for the people. It is like that. So those
are some things that we do. They could probably speak more.  
  
JALEA BENNETT: Since I've been here -- I've been here for four years, and this
is the first year where they like to get together and we like to go to the
locker room and have a movie night. We like to go to the movies, we'll go out
to eat together as a team. We literally went to Mr. An's. We dressed up and we
all went to Mr. An's and ate dinner (indiscernible) without the staff.  
  
Yeah, like we'll be in our team group message and be like: Let's go do this,
let's go do that. If we go somewhere, I really enjoy including people. That's
my biggest thing. So if I'm ever doing something, let's say I'm going to go to
Funtasticks in Tucson, I'll make sure I put in the group message saying: Hey,
I'm going to Funtasticks, and if you want to join, let me know, and we'll try
to work around schedules and stuff.  
  
But we make an obvious effort to hang out outside of basketball and all that.  
  
KAT WRIGHT: I think with all of the chances just to hang out with each other,
we become so comfortable with each other. So we have dance parties in the
locker room. And I don't dance, but I will with them. So it's just being
comfortable around each other, and it's all of those little things that we do,
like the retreat and building off of that every single day. Not just letting
that be, but continuing to be inclusive and hang out with people that you
wouldn't normally hang out with. So just getting outside of your element.  
  
Q. I've actually been horse penning, you get almost there and then one
escapes. So can you tell us a little bit about who your team was for horse
penning and some anecdote about that experience?  
ADIA BARNES: First tell them what group won.  
  
KAT WRIGHT: I don't remember.  
  
ADIA BARNES: 27 seconds, it was awesome.  
  
JALEA BENNETT: Well, on my team we had Morgan, who had a naturally slow horse,
so hers was just trotting. But it was me, Destiny, and I believe Tee Tee was
on my team. We struggled a little bit. Struggle was extremely real. We almost
had a good time, but one of us forgot to close it off and one cow escaped and
then another one. There were only three, so all three of them were gone. They
had to help us. We had like a minute, and it was very bad. But we got together
and we did a better job the next time. It was a lot of fun, though.  
  
ADIA BARNES: And it's hard, because at first you don't really run on a horse.
Usually if you go horseback riding you trot and may run like ten steps, but
you have to run across the field, and it's kind of scary. So we had to pass
the test. But you saw who took charge. Morgan was scared because she'd never
been on a horse before.  
  
But you saw who took the leadership. You had a role and you had to do it, and
it wasn't easy. So it just got everybody out of their element. But it showed a
lot of our characteristics.  
  
KAT WRIGHT: My team was Salvo, Dom, and Sammy, and we improved. We started
with like a minute and a half and then steadily got better and better because
we did it three times, I think. But it was definitely nerve-racking. My horse
was kind of crazy. His name was Yeager (phonetic), and we'd get to the line,
and I could not get him to stop. He would just go. So I'd be booking it, and
they'd have to follow me. It was fun. But it was a little crazy.  
  
JALEA BENNETT: Felt like a natural, though.  
  
ADIA BARNES: We went all out. We had cowboy hats with red Arizona bandanas. It
was a really good time and a really good team-building experience.

_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 48, Oregon State - 43  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the Stanford Cardinal. We've got Tara VanDerveer,
Karlie Samuelson, Erica McCall, and Alanna Smith.  
  
Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, I want to congratulate Oregon State on a great
season and a great team, and wish them the very best in the NCAA Tournament
along with the, hopefully, six other Pac-12 schools that will be going to the
NCAA Tournament other than us.  
  
We're really excited. I'm so proud of the women next to me and the rest of the
women and staff in the locker room.  
  
But a lot of us, the reason that we're sitting up here is because of the great
leadership that we've had from Karlie, from Bird, from Bri, the great defense
that people played and the belief and the resilience that we showed.  
  
We kind of have that little saying, it wasn't pretty, but it was gritty. We
got after it. Our defense, I thought, was outstanding. You know, we stayed in
the rebounding game. I mean, the numbers, there are so many numbers that match
up. It was just a heavyweight battle. We started out, we kind of got the
bloody nose first, but that motivated people to keep playing hard and make
some plays.  
  
So, congratulations Stanford, and I'm really excited to be the automatic bid
for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting the bloody nose first, what you guys were
thinking when you were looking up at the scoreboard at that point and what
shifted?  
ERICA MCCALL: Honestly, I was like, dang, again? But that's what we're used
to. We come back strong, and I think being in situations like Washington, even
Oregon yesterday, we battled back.  
  
I'm just super proud of how my team performed. I think just being down helps
us push through. We knew we've been through those situations a lot. I think we
just had to continue to talk to each other, encourage each other. I know my
teammates were talking to me when I didn't feel like I was knocking things
down, and I think that really helped us push through. Like Tara said, it was
really gritty, and I'm just really happy we got this win.  
  
Q. Tara, you did a great defensive number on Sydney Wiese. Can you talk
a little about your priority there and how you did it?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, it wasn't me, for sure. I thought Briana Roberson and
Marta Sniezek worked extremely hard, and they were very focused. Sydney Wiese
is an outstanding player, and she can frustrate a lot of defenses, and I think
people really studied tape and said: This is what we're going to do.  
  
She got -- both Bri and Marta got great help from our post players who showed
out. We just really wanted to make other people make plays, and they were
doing the same thing to us. Both teams, I think, were playing what I call
scouting report defense. But I thought we just had great effort defensively
from everyone, but especially Bri and Marta.  
  
Q. Yesterday you gave up 25 points to Oregon in the first quarter, and
then the final three quarters hold them to 31; today give up 22 and you hold
them to 21 over the final three quarters. Can you just talk about how
important defense is to your program?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think, first of all, we should skip the first quarter and
just go right to the second quarter and play second, third, fourth and fifth;
maybe that would help our defense a little bit.  
  
But defense is a mindset. I think it starts with Briana, her being a great
defensive player and under -- sometimes underrated defensive player. But
everyone buys in. Defense, you're unselfish. It's not about scoring. It
doesn't get written up in the paper that much. So, again, I hadn't seen those
numbers, but to be able to hold them to 7 points in three quarters is
phenomenal.  
  
Q. Alanna, you were able to get in deep in the paint. You were able to
score. You gave your team a big offensive spark when you guys seem to have
trouble scoring. Could you just talk about what your mindset was when you went
into the game? And I'm going to ask Tara about Alanna's game and what she gave
you guys.  
ALANNA SMITH: I think for me, it's just having an aggressive mindset, and just
slowing down and reading the defense. And that's something my coaches have
been telling me and I've really been trying to take on board. Tonight it
worked really well for our team, for everyone, not only me.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Alanna?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It's been really exciting to see Alanna's improvement
throughout the year. She has a lot of talent. She gives us a big body that can
score on the perimeter, score on the block, runs the floor. She's had some
super games for us, and she really stepped up big tonight.  
  
I think that one of the things with our team, Kaylee Johnson had a great game
yesterday, and Alanna got to rest a lot, you know? So it was really what I
call tag team. So Alanna played great tonight, championship game. Kayl played
great the night before. We were able to play a lot of people in the first game
against Washington State, so I think that helped Alanna have her legs,
rebound. And Alanna really focused. She works extra. She watched video. We
don't sugar coat it, and she really listened and I think really improved. It's
really exciting to see her have such a great game.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday during this press conference you said that we were
going to talk about the problems you had with Oregon State after today's game.
Now that you're here and you've won it, what shifted into getting the win
today? It was kind of interesting that Scott Rueck said nothing surprised him
in this game. He knew it was going to be gritty. What are your thoughts?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, either -- any of these three games could have gone
either way with each game. We could have won all three. They could have won
all three. We could have won two. It could have been any combination. I think
a lot was on the line for this game. This is the Pac-12 Championship. I think
our team came in with a lot of resolve. After losing last week, we wanted to
play them and we wanted to show to ourselves that we were champions too.  
  
Again, Karlie and Bird and Alanna and all of our team dug in. Even when things
weren't going well, everyone stayed with things. The grit, the resolve and
resilience was to me what was most important.  
  
Q. Karlie and Erica, how satisfying is this to finish in your senior
year with a Pac-12 Championship? You guys came here to win championships.
Regular season championships have been a little tougher to come by than maybe
you might have thought they were. But here you are, and is this a super
satisfying way to finish?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yeah, I think our loss to Oregon State we were that close on
that last loss, and that was a pretty painful loss for us. We wanted a
championship this year. So we really wanted this tournament. We knew we could
do it, and I'm really happy that we did, because we really want to be
champions, and we were that close during regular season.  
  
ERICA MCCALL: Yeah, like Karlie said, those two losses to Oregon State hurt
really bad. We were super focused this week, and being able to come out, and
even the way we won makes it that much more satisfying. The way we came back
from that 16-3 score they had, and we battled.  
  
I'm really happy about how my team performed. It's super satisfying. It's like
tasting your favorite candy, Sour Patch Kids.  
  
Q. I don't have the box in front of me, but I think you only gave up
seven field goals after the first quarter. But you also didn't put a fairly
good free-throw shooting team on the line very much. So you played not only
played good defense, but you played without fouling. Is that about as well as
you can play defensively over the last three quarters?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'll probably go back and nitpick a little bit and see one
more opportunity. But they are an outstanding offensive team. Sydney Wiese is
an All-American, and we had people really work hard to shut her down and work
as hard as we could to make everything tough. Like you said, without fouling.
I tell our team fouling negates hustle. So if you're fouling, you're really
hurting yourself.  
  
So not sending them to the line, making -- even like you think of her shot at
the end of the first half, Bri was right there on her. She's just that good.
I'm so proud of how hard our team played and how they just battled, getting on
the floor for loose balls, getting on the glass, all the little things.  
  
We left some -- we left a lot of points, I think, kind of out there. We had a
lot of shots that we would make nine out of ten times. So it wasn't like our
offense was as good as it can be. But our defense really stepped up.  
  
Q. You said at the start that you thought it was seven from the Pac-12
would get in. I think people understand six of them. What would your case be
for Cal? With that, what do you think this tournament title does for your
seeding?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we have 12 teams in our league, and if you look at how
well Cal played in the preseason, the teams they beat and playing against in
the top RPI conference, I just would say that there would be no one in the
NCAA bracket that would want to play Cal. I think they're good enough, and I
think that they should be definitely given consideration. I mean, I think they
should be in it, having played them twice.  
  
Q. The absence of winning regular season titles over these last few
years, and the conference is obviously upgraded, has it been strange? Has it
been -- what has it been from your vantage point to see other teams climb up
-- you guys don't win titles for a couple of years. What's that experience
been like?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, the regular season has changed because you don't have a
true home at home. So in some ways we've come into this tournament and been
undefeated. It's like, oh, great, regular season, on to the tournament, and
this gets the automatic bid.  
  
So in a lot of ways we have geared our team for the tournament. To be -- I
think we won it two years ago. We won the regular season three years ago,
right? So that's not shabby.  
  
But I think it's different. There's more of a sense that there's more
excitement with the tournament because you're playing these teams and three
games in three days. Our team from the beginning, I told our team we're a
tournament team because of the depth that we have. We're able to put a lot of
players in the game.  
  
You know, I'm excited that the Pac-12 is so good. I mean, it's really a
premier conference in the country with great universities, and now we have
women's basketball to kind of check that off too.  
  
So it's exciting to go to Washington and play in Seattle with a sellout crowd,
and a sellout crowd at Oregon State. I know Oregon's going to be good for
years to come. It's great crowd for us at Stanford. So I'm all for everyone
doing well.  
  
Thank you, all. We've had a great time.

_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 48, Oregon State - 43  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good evening, Oregon State. Thank you, everyone, for being
here. Again, this is being streamed live on Facebook. We have Scott Rueck,
Sydney Wiese, and Mikayla Pivec. Coach, I'll let you open and we'll go from
there.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: I thought Stanford played great tonight. They're obviously a
great team. In all three games, it's been really tough and really similar.
This one is no exception. Saw them get down last night and come back and
dominate the last three quarters.  
  
Today, I wouldn't say they quite dominated, but they made the plays, and they
were in control more so in those final three quarters. So I knew this team is
proud, they're going to make a run at us.  
  
So this group, I couldn't say enough about this team. To be a significant
player down all weekend, and to play three games in three days, you know, it's
almost unhealthy, to be honest, for everyone, let alone four. So I was just
proud of the grit and the heart they showed to give themselves a chance to win
tonight.  
  
There's big things ahead for this group, and I couldn't be prouder of them and
prouder of Beaver Nation for another incredible showing here in Seattle.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how having Katie in the game was, and how much you
think that played out?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, it was absolutely huge. Katie's become one of our best
guard defenders, and against this team, you need that. You need that size and
that length and that experience.  
  
You know, she's been in all the wars, you know. She hit three threes against
UConn last year in the Final Four, so she's seen it all. Hit three big threes
last week against Stanford.  
  
So not having her all week hurt our rotation. It burned people out a little
bit. We felt that tonight, no doubt. We felt that. You know, you're in a
championship game that you want, so you're going to give it everything you've
got, and then pretty soon that's dry. Not an excuse, it's just a reality of
the situation without her. So she has so much experience and she would have
played a big role this week, let alone tonight.  
  
Q. Sydney, what did Stanford do tonight to particularly throw you off
balance and try to get threes up, going 2 of 9 from the floor?  
SYDNEY WIESE: They have really aggressive guards. And I think the post too.
Every time there was an on-ball, there was at least one, maybe two defenders
that were on my hip. So, I mean, Stanford's such a good defensive team. They
scheme people. They know exactly what we're trying to do. So, I mean, whoever
has the ball, they're going to make it tough for us to score.  
  
Q. Scott, you knew offense was going to be hard to come by. Would you
have imagined that especially over the second half, that it would have been
that tough to come by?  
SCOTT RUECK: I thought it was just the same. I thought that's where we were
kind of hitting the wall, I believe. So there was a combination of the two.
The they did a good job. I didn't think we -- we had a tougher time inside
than I was expecting. They did a nice job keeping us off the O-boards, which I
thought was going to be a big factor in this game, and credit them for that.  
  
But nothing surprised me, to be honest. We just didn't knock down some shots
that we needed to.  
  
Q. Scott, you mentioned missing Katie and what a factor that was. How
about when Mik picked up her second foul, with how thin your rotation was to
begin with?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, then we went with a little less experience on the floor, no
question. I thought that both Kat and Taylor did a great job for us during
that stretch. But we had total control of this game when she picked up that
second one, and we were flowing so well offensively with that group.  
  
Mik is somebody that can play 40 easily, if you need her to. I mean, we've got
a cross-country champion in Mikayla. So I thought that was a factor, for sure.
Yeah, I mean, she's never had a second foul in the first half this year, and
Gaby hadn't until last night. So we've had a couple weird things in the last
couple nights in regards to adversity.  
  
Q. Mikayla, first Pac-12 tournament under your belt now. What do you
think about the experience?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: From what Sydney and Scott had shared with me before, how tough
it is to play three games in three days, I got the full experience. And we
were hoping for a different result, but I'm proud of how we battled today.  
  
Q. Sydney, after UCLA -- we were in here for the UCLA press conference,
and they were very emotional right now. I'm sure this still stings right now.
But they said they would let that moment teach them how to play in March. What
is the similarity with that for you?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, absolutely. I think we have a lot to be proud of. No one
could have predicted us to have made it this far, and I think that fueled us
throughout the season. Of course this hurts, it stings. We want to be out
there right now celebrating, but there is still a lot of basketball left to be
played and there are a lot of lessons that we can take from this game and the
whole weekend in general.  
  
So I think we gather ourselves, we galvanize our group and come back together.
We realize that there's still a lot of battles left out there. So we're going
to do what we can to make sure that we play as much basketball as we can.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Marie's game tonight?  
SCOTT RUECK: Marie? Yeah, I mean, I thought she was key early, especially
starting us off. She was so aggressive offensively. I mean, everybody was, but
I thought she was phenomenal.  
  
Marie is Marie. She just played it heady, gutsy game. Again, great defense on
the inside. We probably could have gotten her a couple better looks in the
second half. I would have liked that, and I thought there was a match-up there
that we could have gone to a little bit more.  
  
But Marie's rock solid. I thought she played another phenomenal game.  
  
Q. You talked about learning lessons from this weekend, and that's been
such a constant theme throughout the whole season. What specifically going
through this can you take away going into the big tournament?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Just watch a lot of film and see the little things, the
weaknesses that have been exposed offensively and defensively. It's tough to
play three games in three days, but there are good lessons to take away from
that. So I think paying attention to details and what we have to take care of
in order to win in a tournament.  
  
Q. You talked about there was kind of a lot of weird things that
happened this weekend. So with that being said and going into the NCAA
Tournament, what was sort of your message to your team right after and sort of
trying to get them ready and just to flush this out and realize there is more
to play for?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think you just deal with reality. And reality is what they've
accomplished is ridiculous. It's amazing what they've done in the number one
conference in the country. They've proven -- tonight Stanford won, but this
has been the best team all year and won the games that mattered in the regular
season and put themselves in a position to be a high 2 seed if not a 1 and
were poised to make a great run in the postseason.  
  
So this team, the reason we're here and the reason they are who they are is
because they've handled adversity well. For seven years this program has
handled adversity well. And this group, they're absolutely experts at it. So
anytime you lose, it hurts, especially when you're as competitive as this
team.  
  
And it should, it sucks. But you turn that into a positive, and you come back
hungry. You say, okay, I don't want to feel that again.  
  
So we had a crazy loss against Marquette; we turned that into a positive. We
got beat at UCLA; we turned it into a positive. We got beat by USC; we turned
it into a positive. Here we go tonight. Stanford outplayed us down the
stretch, and we turn it into a positive, and that's basically what we said,
so, let's go.  
  
Q. Sydney, can you talk about what Beaver Nation means to you, the
evolution of your career, coming out tonight? The connection to the crowd,
we've seen you sign autographs and shaking every hand. You were smiling as you
came out with that support. Just talk about what they mean to you.  
SYDNEY WIESE: They fill my heart with so much joy. They've had our backs since
the beginning. And to see that orange throughout the arena, throughout the
whole weekend, they travel so well and they love us. So the love is mutual. We
couldn't do this without their support, and they motivate us. I mean, we want
to put on a show for them every night.  
  
So, so much love for them, and I'm so thankful to have had these types of
people to follow us throughout all my career. So there is still a lot of
basketball left to be played, and I know they're going to show out for us. So
I love Beaver Nation. I know I'm biased, but I think they're the best fans in
the nation.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the freshman impact throughout the
tournament this weekend?  
SCOTT RUECK: Really incredible. When they've been called on, they've
performed. Certainly Mik started us off on Friday with a huge performance
against Cal. Coming home, playing in front of her family and friends in her
home city, what an inspiration that was to everyone. She set the tone in many
ways. She said: Hey, we're here to win, we're here to play. Whatever it takes,
I'll do. She set the tone. Kat played huge minutes, Madi played huge minutes
when she got her opportunity last night.  
  
So I just think that you can't really describe it until you're in it. And I
love their performance. They embraced it, and that's all they've done all
season long. So it's a great sign moving forward for those guys.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Erica McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28839)

### [Kaylee Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28443)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 71, Oregon - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good evening, and we welcome Stanford Cardinal head coach, Tara
VanDerveer, Kaylee Johnson, and Erica McCall.  
  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, I'm really proud of our team and how we
battled. Oregon has a great, young team, and I just think that our seniors and
our juniors, our upperclasswomen stepped up for us. We did not want it to be
an all Oregon final.  
  
So I thought that the difference was for us in the second half, our defense.
The we really stoked up our defense in the second quarter and the rest of the
game. And the rebounding, Kayl and Bird, they really battled in there. I'm
really proud of how hard they played and just their determination. Kayl has
been -- her coming back has meant so much to our team, so we're really excited
she's been out there playing so well. And Bird's been hanging in there the
whole time. Working really hard. Great passion for the game.  
  
So it's really exciting that these two young women had such an exciting and
great game for our team.  
  
Q. Tara, I wonder if you could talk about what Briana did tonight. She's
been a great defender all season, did a great job against Plum in the second
half, she's been awesome against Sydney. What makes her such a great
defender?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Shh, don't tell everybody. She works really hard, and I think
she really takes pride in our defense, as our whole team does. But when you
have someone on the ball, pressuring the ball, being aggressive. You saw that
today with Jordin Canada, how disruptive she was. I think Briana sets the tone
for our defense. But both Kayl and Bird have her back, and they played great
defense today too.  
  
Q. Erica, how much do you think your experience came into play? Coach
talked about junior and senior leadership. But you've been in tough games this
season already, but do you feel your experience is helping you out a lot right
now?  
ERICA MCCALL: Absolutely. I think the fact that we've been in super tough
games where we've been down really helped just boost us, especially in that
second half and that late first half run. Really just proud of how my whole
team reacted to us being down. We really just -- the upperclassmen really just
pushed. I'm really proud of how my buddy here rebounded. I think that really
helped us push the tempo and get baskets.  
  
Q. Erica, I think Tara said it best, you played with tremendous passion
for the game. Chiney is running around here somewhere, and she played with the
same type of passion. Did you learn a lot from her? Did you feel that was
going to need to be your role when she left?  
ERICA MCCALL: Absolutely. When I came to Stanford, I really looked up to her.
Saw how in every play she was going hard and she really loved the game. I
really admired that. So when she left, I knew I had to keep going and keep the
energy for my team.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Kaylee's performance. Every time Oregon was
making a run, like she would get a basket or defensive stop and get that
rebound. It really stood out to me.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, she just brought a tremendous amount of energy, but
also she was scoring for us, she was rebounding for us. She set some great
screens. Those might have been not noticed and not on the stat sheet.  
  
But she's -- Kayl is kind of the quarterback back there. She's talking and
very knowledgeable basketball player, very high IQ. Someone that, again, she
missed so much of the season and it's been frustrating for her. I just really
kind of really enjoyed watching her grow and become a great team leader for
us. Whether she started in the second half, whether she played, she got a
couple fouls, she doesn't show frustration, she just keeps playing hard, and
that's what we need our whole team to do.  
  
Q. Coach, they made five of six three pointers, but they only got six
attempts, and last night they shot it really well. Bando did not even get a
three-point attempt tonight.  
TARA VANDERVEER: That was Karlie.  
  
Q. Is that something you tried to do, is take away that perimeter
shooting of theirs?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Definitely, definitely. There were a couple times where they
did knock down -- going five for six is really good. But in the times that
we've played them they had three, four, or five threes, and this is the most
that they scored.  
  
So I was upset with a couple of them because people -- we're not giving them
threes. And that was something that we did get hurt inside a little bit early,
but then we made some adjustments. That's the key to beating them. You can't
let them get three-point shots, for sure.  
  
Q. To look ahead to tomorrow night's match, you guys have had two
completely grind-it-out games against Oregon State. First of all, is it a
coincidence that perhaps the two most experienced teams in the conference end
up standing in the end? And what do you expect from tomorrow?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think coming into this tournament, who would know who
is going to be in the championship game? I mean, you look at Oregon, it could
be Washington. I mean, Cal, I mean, we have such great -- I mean, UCLA, we
have such great teams in the conference and great players.  
  
So I think sometimes it comes down to the match-ups you've had. We played well
against Washington State. I think we played well in spurts. Not in the
beginning, but 75% of the time against Oregon. And we're going to need to play
100% of the time well against Oregon State. They're an experienced team.
They're a talented team and a very well-coached team. And we've lost to them
twice. Our team's going to have to have a chip on its shoulder and bring it
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, you held them to 31 over the final three, what sort of
adjustments did you make?  
TARA VANDERVEER: We made some little adjustments, but I think it was more the
leadership of our team -- Kayl, Bird, Karlie, Bri, Britt, Marta, just them
saying we're going to buckle down and play hard.  
  
That's what we talked about during timeouts. Just keep playing hard. Keep
working, getting on the floor for loose balls. Rebound, be aggressive, try to
get deflections. I don't think it was necessarily what we did as coaches, but
what they did on the court.  
  
Q. Looking to tomorrow, in the Oregon State match-up, what, I guess, was
the reason there were two losses to that team in the regular season, and
what's going to be the difference in tomorrow's match-up?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think our team really knows what the problems were, and I'm
going to hope that I can talk about them maybe tomorrow. Basketball is not
rocket science. Teams that win take and make better shots. So it's taking good
shots. It's not doing things that are not part of your game.  
  
Rebounding is always -- we were outrebounded. If we look at the stat sheet, I
think the rebounding and not taking good shots were the keys to us not being
successful. And quite honestly, we didn't make free throws. So, we could have
won the first game with a free throw. The second game we're up with 19
seconds, and we didn't make a play. But we've learned.  
  
I think that just as I think Mike referenced, you can learn, and we learned
from that loss against Oregon State, and our team has listened since and I
think we're playing better.

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Marie Gulich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32731)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 63, UCLA - 53.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, shoot, that was incredible. I mean, UCLA, I told Cori, my
rule is to say good game afterwards. You can't lose there. You can lose if you
say any more than that when you shake a coach's hand, win or lose. But tonight
was different. I've got so much respect for her and for this program, and they
are coached so well. They are so hard to play against. That's a team that
absolutely could see a Final Four, without a doubt. You look at the point
guard they have, look at the center -- Cole and I were sitting last night
watching, scouting them, and it's like, look at the point guard; look at the
center; they've got two elite shooters; look at Burke. I mean, they have so
much ability and so much talent, and to beat that team takes everything you
have, and it takes a big-time performance, and if you look at this box score,
that's what you see. You see an unreal performance by our team tonight, and
I'm so proud of the guts and the resilience and the courage that it takes to
make the plays that they did.  
  
We're shorthanded without Katie. That meant some long minutes for people, and
they really came through in a big way. You look at Marie with 16 boards; I
thought Gaby Hanson's second half may have been one of the best halves of her
career, offensively and the defense that she played on Jordin. To hold Monique
scoreless in the second half is a monumental accomplishment for our post
players.  
  
Beaver Nation was unbelievable tonight, and it was a great combination and a
great relationship on the court and in the stands, and it was a great win for
our program.  
  
Q. To have Gaby Hanson not on the floor for a lot of the second quarter
and then have her come back in in the third quarter and do what she did to
really give you guys a lift, can you discuss that a little bit?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think everybody saw her impact. If you wonder who Gaby Hanson
is to our program, you saw that. They were able to get out and go. It's kind
of like when a smaller post player comes in to defend the center, how
confident a center will get. A year ago, as soon as Ruth came off the floor,
everybody went straight to the post and they were so confident against our
other posts, and Marie and Bre would hold their own last year, but it was just
different than Ruth. Ruth just had that presence about her, and that's what
Gaby does to the guard spot.  
  
Jordin doesn't want to see Gaby; Kelsey Plum doesn't want to see Gaby; nobody
wants to see Gaby. Jamie Weisner didn't want to see Gaby in practice every
day.  
  
And so she changes the game just by her presence and her impact defensively,
and then tonight we saw her offense emerge, and she's 5 for 10 with two huge
threes in this game where points were at a premium. Her leadership was at its
best tonight, and so it was just a -- it was a classic Gaby Hanson
performance.  
  
Q. Scott, Jordin went off in the second quarter, and then in the third
quarter you guys held their entire offense to eight points. How did you guys
-- what adjustments did you make and how did you manage to do that?  
SCOTT RUECK: We put Gaby in. I mean, and I really mean that. That was a big
difference. This team, we came out of the locker room -- we were on our heels
in that second quarter. Give them a lot of credit. They really knocked us
heels, forced us into turnovers in the first half, got us out of rhythm, and
our offense really struggled. Gaby gave us control, and we controlled the
tempo, and we were in control of everything from that third quarter on I felt.
And so it started there, and I think it ends there with Gaby.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about Gaby. You've mentioned several
times whenever you guys needed those big buckets Gaby was there, Baylor last
year, now tonight. How big was her offense?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I thought they did a nice job taking the basket away. I
think we had four interior points in the first half is what it felt like
anyway, at least from our posts, and I think actually one of those was a jump
shot, so they really did a nice job taking the inside away.  
  
We shot it okay, but we didn't shoot it great from the perimeter. We needed
that, and so when you're getting that from a place where it sometimes comes
but we needed it, as soon as that shot went down, everybody relaxed, and so it
was nice that it wasn't just Syd. Mik wasn't hitting initially, and then she
stuck with it and then hit a big three in the fourth quarter, but it was Gaby
that gave us that spark on the outside, and you're right, every time we've
needed something, she's provided.  
  
You know, she hadn't shot the ball particularly well the last four games
overall. Tonight, like I said, it was a classic performance by Gaby, and it
was on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Syd, you hit some big shots, too. You hit a three with about three
minutes to go. Right before you hit it, Jordin motioned to UCLA's bench and
said, "I need a sub." Did you notice that and did you call a different play?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I could see that she wasn't pressuring as much towards the
end of the fourth quarter, but Coach Rueck made the call, and Gaby was the one
that made the pass happen. And so I told Coach, we had a time-out like right
after that possession, and I told him that she was getting very -- she was
working her butt off all game, offensively, defensively. Of course you're
going to hit a wall. I think I got loose on that possession, but I didn't see
her, I didn't see her pull her jersey or anything, but then after that I could
sort of tell that she was a step slower.  
  
Q. Scott, you said that this is the kind of game where you had to say
more than "good game" to Coach Close at the end of it.  
SCOTT RUECK: I just told her that. I just said, she did a phenomenal job with
her team this year, and obviously they've got a lot more to do, but they've
done a phenomenal job. I just feel like they're just extremely well-coached.
They can hurt you in so many ways different looks given us defensively, and I
just think that she's -- they adapted very well this year. They were really
hard to guard. So many misdirection plays, so the scout was very difficult.
Coach Holsinger had that for us, and it wore him out. Wore him out. The scout
is crazy. To go through and kind of decipher the main points to focus on,
there were a lot with UCLA.  
  
So I just think that that team is very well-coached and extremely talented,
and I told her that in as few words as I could. I said, I would love to see
them at the Final Four unless they're in our region.  
  
Q. Marie, career high, 16 boards, got the double-double. Talk about your
performance tonight and what it was like going up against Billings inside.  
MARIE GÜLICH: I mean, she's a very, very athletic player. It's tough to play
against her, obviously. She's fast. She's explosive, and you just have to have
always good position, and obviously she got me sometimes. It's fun, though.
Like I like the challenge, and yeah, it's been -- it was hard to start off,
but then once we got in a rhythm and we got poised and the game was flowing,
it got easier and easier.  
  
Q. Syd, how is this a different experience tonight to hit here knowing
you're going to the final than when you haven't won one before?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I mean, you're in the same position where you still have to
prepare and you still have to win the game. I think the experience that we had
last year going to the final and then even freshman year being in that same
position, so we have all types of experiences that have led us to this point,
and so I just think that we focus on what we need to do as a group, take care
of ourselves tonight, and then come back, just have fun with it, and we're
fortunate to be out there for 40 more minutes.  
  
Q. Syd, you talked about the big three you hit, but just overall as a
team you guys closed the game on a pretty good run. What was the difference
when they made their spurt?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think we've been in this position so many times this
year where we've been forced to make these types of plays, and so it was just
another game, another day, another dollar.  
  
People were stepping up big throughout the game. Mik had crazy drives and
finishes. Marie had huge rebounds, and she was a defensive presence tonight,
and then Gaby obviously on both ends of the floor came in aggressive and
really changed the game for us. Super exciting to see how many people stepped
up, and they weren't afraid of those big moments.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, how are you guys feeling heading into the
championship?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Well, no matter who we play, it's going to be a tough match-up.
We played both these teams twice, and it's tough to go against a team three
times in such a short span of time. So it's a grind. Conference tournament is
always a grind, but we're going to do whatever is necessary to cut down on
that.  
  
Q. Coach, was there anything in particular that you guys did to make it
so difficult for UCLA from three-point range, only going 4 of 23 on the
night?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a big number. They shot a lot in the fourth, I know, and
so I thought they got some better looks than I hoped actually at a couple of
moments. That's what I'm talking about, their misdirection offense and
different things that they do to free up shooters. But I just felt like we
played with a great intensity overall defensively, and they demanded that, and
so it was 5-on-5 every possession. None of those threes I don't believe came
out of transition, which was a big part of this game and maybe our No. 1 focal
point going into the game defensively anyway. And so it was 5-on-5, and I
thought we were on point tonight. We closed out very well to shooters. We
challenged well and didn't give them looks, and that goes back to the scout. I
thought we switched when we needed to, and we were close, and so we were -- we
challenged and then I guess in some cases you're fortunate they miss.  
  
Q. No matter who you play, as Syd pointed out, you've played both these
teams twice and it's been a war with both of them, especially Stanford. In a
game where every possession counts, how are you going to be mentally
prepared?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, that's what this game is probably going to be like, as
well, out here tonight. So we'll be on equal footing there. This team, they
love the challenge, just like Marie said. It was a fun challenge, and that's
how we view it. It's fun to prepare for. It's fun to play in. It's fun to be
challenged by great teams. These -- the four games we had against those two
teams in particular were probably the best scouted we've been I would say all
year long. Oregon certainly was ready for us. They know us inside and out.
Stanford, I mean, Tara, they prepare as well as anyone in the country for you.
So that's why they were all low-scoring games. They were kind of like this one
out here, just a slugfest basically, and the team that executes the best down
the stretch is going to find a way to win, and that's what I would anticipate
tomorrow being like no matter who it is.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Maite Cazorla](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32732)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 71, Oregon - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Welcome Oregon. We have got Oregon coach, Kelly
Graves, Sabrina Ionescu, and Maite Cazorla. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, I want to cop grate late Coach VanDerveer and the
Cardinal. They played a great game. They're a great team, and they deserved it
tonight. They just played better and harder in that second half. Just once we
got behind a little bit, we tried like crazy to keep up, and it just wasn't
happening tonight. We didn't bring our "A" game, and you have to to beat a
team like that. So I do congratulate them. They're competitors and they know
how to play the right way.  
  
But I'm really proud of our team. Disappointed in the outcome today, but
really proud of the effort the whole weekend. Oh, boy, I couldn't have asked
for more. I thought we played hard, and we're just still learning, we're still
growing. We're not where Stanford is right now, but we're capable of beating
teams like this. That was what we learned, I think, this weekend.  
  
Q. Kelly, what pulled you guys out of the zone?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we wanted to actually switch it up most of the night. You
know, I don't know. We go by feel a lot of times. We had some successes. I
think the boards mainly. We really struggled to keep them off the boards, and
that's one of the biggest weaknesses out of the zone.  
  
But we switched it so much tonight. So when you ask me that question, it's
like which time? But they're a tough team. They're so good, they're so
disciplined that you have to do things to change it up to try to keep them out
of rhythm, because once they get into a rhythm, they're really hard to guard.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I know that you wouldn't use this as an excuse, but how
tired are you guys at this point? Tournament play is tough?  
SABRINA IONESCU: That's definitely not an excuse. We're not tired at all. We
didn't come out like we should have, and they played great basketball. Like
Coach always says, they're not going to beat themselves, so that's definitely
not an excuse. We're doing fine.  
  
Q. Kelly, it seemed you were set up how you were last night, they go up
by nine, you call timeout. And obviously you're trying to make adjustments.
What just wasn't able to click for your team tonight to be able to creep back
into it like you did last night?  
KELLY GRAVES: We just didn't get many easy looks. When we tried to get the
ball inside, and they do such a good job, we have young post players that are
positioning. You're going against McCall, Johnson, those are veteran post
players that have played a lot of time and know how to defend. So just not a
lot of easy baskets.  
  
Then I thought we became stagnant a little bit. We tried to score off our
first option instead of swinging the ball side-to-side. Maybe they break down
a little bit, which is what happened early. We had some good looks early in
the game, and then we just kind of got away from it a little bit.  
  
But I credit their post play. It was strong tonight.  
  
Q. Sabrina, what did you take out of this tournament run?  
SABRINA IONESCU: That we can hang in with every team. We gave all the teams we
played a game. I think it just shows what we're capable of and night-in and
night-out, we're going to give it all we have, and I think we're excited for
the rest of March.  
  
Q. The two teams left in this tournament are pretty experienced teams
and have played a lot of games, really, really tough games. Even tonight the
games kind of mirrored each other, and it was veteran leadership that pushed
them through tough spots. Do you feel like experience was a huge factor
tonight? Are you surprised to see two of the most veteran teams in the
conference at the end?  
KELLY GRAVES: Last question? No, I'm not surprised. They've been the two best
teams throughout 18, now, I guess, 20 games. So it's no surprise that they're
there. I think experience always helps, always. It's never a negative. This
was a situation we've never been in. We've never played three games in three
days. You know, and you're playing a better team each and every game you go.  
  
So, yeah, they didn't win the game because of experience. They just played
better than us tonight. We'll learn from it. That's the good thing about youth
and good youth. We're a young team, and so I think we'll learn from this and
we'll get better. At least now they've won a couple games in this tournament,
so next year when we come up, expectations are going to be a lot different
next time.  
  
Q. Kelly, the previous semifinal, the losing team came in here and was
distraught, very, very upset. You guys seem okay. Do you feel pretty good that
you're going to go into the NCAA Tournament with some momentum, I think, like
Sabrina said? You guys can play with anyone?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, you know me, so I'm not going to be down. I
have good perspective in what's going on. I think we should celebrate what
this team has done. We've got to be one of the youngest teams in the country,
and a lot of young teams, especially ones that are playing in the most
difficult conference in the country, don't have the success these guys are
having.  
  
So we're enjoying the ride. I think we earned the spot. That's not up to me
now. It's up to somebody else. But the fact that we have four top 25 wins, and
one that came last night against a great team on basically their home floor,
yeah, we want to celebrate this.  
  
With this group, we just wanted to get to that tournament. And let's face it,
Pac-12 play is going to prepare us better than any conference will prepare any
team. So once we get there, not that it would ever be easy, but my goodness,
are you kidding? We just played Washington and Stanford back-to-back. So what
we see in some kind of postseason is not going to be any different.  
  
So, yeah, I think this is great. This is a program that I think is going
places. I think most people see that we're going to be a force. So just to get
a taste of that and be able to play in it and see how far we can go, I think
it's a bonus. It will allow our kids to work harder and know what they're
going after in future years. This team is a good group. This is a good group.  
  
Q. Sabrina, just going through this Pac-12 grind, are you looking
forward to playing teams that aren't familiar with you guys and know what you
do and know all the plays you're running?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Definitely. It's always hard playing a team three times. So I
think we're excited to go out there and play a team that we're not really
familiar with them. They're not really familiar with us. I think we'll be even
in that term. We're just excited to continue playing, to be honest with you.
It's something we've worked hard for all season, and we've earned.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys scored 25 in the first quarter and you're held to 31
through the final three. What did they do to shut you down?  
KELLY GRAVES: They really got into us. We got nothing easy. They took away
most of our pick-and-roll games. Started to force us to the baseline. We
didn't handle that well. And we started to just play back a little bit. Not
scared, but we were on our heels. We didn't play that way. We have to play
downhill coming off those screens, and we just didn't get any easy baskets.  
  
We didn't put any pressure on their interior defense at all, so I think that
was the main thing. I credit them. They adjusted well, and they stepped up
their intensity. They really played hard and a lot more physical those last
three quarters.  
  
Q. Maite, what was going right for you here in Seattle and what did you
see from Oti as well?  
MAITE CAZORLA: No, it's been a really good tournament. I think it's been
really fun playing with all of them. I think I had a great tournament too, we
just kind of disappointed because we wanted to win. But we have to be proud of
what we did.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you've seen the opposing team's best defender all season. I
was curious where Bri Roberson ranks in that. She was up, making sure --
trying to make everything tough for you tonight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, she's a great defender. She's up there with Jordin
Canada. She's quick. She's lower to the ground than I am. So all credit to
her. She made every shot that I took difficult. Played great help defense.
When Maite tried to drive, she was there. But that's what we've been facing
the entire season, so we just have to learn to adjust.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Kari Korver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30452)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 63, UCLA - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Great, welcome. Good evening, UCLA. We are one more time
streaming live on Pac-12 Facebook.  
  
Coach, we'll have you open with a statement and then take questions.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, thank you all for being here. And the more coverage we can
give this conference, the more the national media understands how good it is.
Obviously Oregon State's a really good team. They were the No. 1 seed for a
reason. I thought they -- in the second half, they outexecuted us. Especially
to start the second half, they got layups and we got misses, and I thought
that was really the telling part, especially at the turning point. And we sort
of lost our focus.  
  
But I love these young women. These are tears right here because they're
invested, they care, they care about UCLA, they care about each other, and
they're competitive. They want to win. And I could not be any more prouder of
the hearts of these young ladies.  
  
And the bottom line is they wanted this really, really bad, and I could not be
prouder of their effort in these two leadership. And this will propel us into
deep things in the NCAAs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Cori, can you just talk about the third quarter? And offensively,
were they -- Gaby Hanson was back in the game. She obviously missed a lot of
the second quarter in foul trouble. Did that make a big difference? What did
they do that was different that you guys were struggling well?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I didn't think they were doing that many things different in
that third quarter. Gaby Hanson is obviously a great defender, but she can
only guard one person at a time. Obviously Jordin was getting some good looks
in that second quarter without her.  
  
But I thought we got -- we were talking in our huddles that we're getting good
shots; we just could not knock them down. We were getting some one-on-one
opportunities and we were getting the ball out out of the double team, and we
just weren't making shots. If you don't make shots against them, they're so
packed in the key that it's really hard to get second shot opportunities. We
weren't pulling away from the basket at all. Some of those shots we knocked
down yesterday against Arizona State. We just weren't hitting those three-
point shots. Hersler had some open threes, Nicole Kornet had some open threes,
not just in the second quarter, third quarter, but throughout the game. And
when you don't knock those things down versus Oregon State, they just get
closer and closer to the rim, so it makes it harder not only to make your
first shot, but it's harder to get a second shot opportunity.  
  
Q. Cori, Jordin is obviously awesome. She had to do a lot tonight --  
CORI CLOSE: She did.  
  
Q. Did you feel like more people needed to step up, that she couldn't do
it by herself, and were you talking about that?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, the good news is that Jordin has been doing that all year,
so this is not a new thing. Jordin does a lot for us. I mean, she is a really
good player on both ends of the floor. She did get a little bit of -- a little
tired at the end, and I thought maybe in hindsight, it's 20/20, I might have
needed to rotate Kennedy Burke on Wiese sooner in the game to sort of mix that
up a little bit and give her a little different look. Jordin was doing such a
great job that you didn't want to take something away that was working. But
obviously I'll look at the film and see that. But the reality was she did get
tired down the stretch. I didn't think it was the fourth quarter that really
affected us, that was when she got tired, I thought it was the third quarter
when they executed and got lay-ups, and we got mid-range jumpers and didn't
make them.  
  
Q. Jordin, when the shots weren't falling, does frustration build at
that point and does it make it even harder? And the emotion that you guys are
showing tonight, there's still basketball to be played, but obviously this was
something that you guys wanted to come in and accomplish?  
JORDIN CANADA: To answer your first question, I mean, we weren't getting
frustrated. It was just, you know -- it just sucked that we weren't making
shots. But I thought our offensive execution was great. I don't think it
really frustrated us. I just think that, you know, it just didn't translate on
the defensive end. But I don't think it frustrated us at all. I mean,
obviously we still have a lot of basketball left to play, but let me just say
I wouldn't -- there's no other person that I'd rather play basketball with
than this one right here. She is the epitome of a basketball player. Her
heart, her dedication to this team is unbelievable, and sometimes it doesn't
show on the court, but off the court, you guys have no idea how much she
affects this game and affects our team. It's emotional because this is her
last chance to get a PAC-12 ring, and it sucks that we didn't get it for her.
But I know we've still got a lot of basketball left to play, but this one
right here, she's going to do a lot of things, and I'm very proud of her.  
  
Q. Cori, you can make a very deep run; this is the toughest conference
in the country, NCAA Tournament is probably going to be a little bit of a
break. How do you make sure you can channel the emotion into something good?  
CORI CLOSE: I actually told them about some other Pac-12 schools that allowed
a tough loss in the PAC-12 Tournament teach their hearts. We beat Cal in the
semifinals the year that they let it teach their hearts and go to a Final
Four. Last year we watched Washington lose to Oregon State in the semifinals
and let it teach their hearts and be different and better and propel them to a
Final Four.  
  
So I think these are just great tears because they're wonderful human beings.
They're incredible kids. They compete like crazy, and they're invested. So I
have no doubt that because their hearts are invested, the hurt in their hearts
right now will teach them, and they will allow them to propel them forward. We
will be different going into the NCAA Tournament as a result of this loss, and
it doesn't make it any easier. It still stinks. We wanted this really badly.
So I'm not diminishing it. But I do think that because we care so much and
because we really are committed to each other, we will let this teach our
hearts and we will be different, tougher, better going into March Madness.  
  
Q. Coach, on the positive side, you guys forced them into 22 turnovers,
and I thought your guys' defense was really intense throughout, especially
Jordin's. Can you just elaborate on that?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I thought it wasn't just Jordin, and of course I give Jordin
so much credit because to chase around Wiese -- this old lady had to be Wiese
in walk-through, and I was out of breath trying to put our team through the
plays. Even coach JORDIN over here said, Coach, you okay? So I know that it's
really difficult. But I thought the rest of the team had some great
deflections, 50/50s. We rotated really well, in a lot of situations. We forced
a lot -- especially in the first half, and even in the fourth quarter I
thought we forced some really difficult shots and possessions for them. But
the difference, we forced them into those turnovers every time we've played
them, and the difference was we didn't capitalize as much off of those
turnovers. We didn't get as many points off of those turnovers as the previous
couple of games. We had a couple of run-out lay-ups that we didn't finish, or
sometimes if Jordin gets to the middle and is able to flip it back to a
shooter, we weren't really able to gain that momentum off those turnovers on a
consistent basis, and I think that hurt us.  
  
But I love the progress we've made on the defensive end. Coach Tony said this
yesterday. He's like at the beginning of the year, he was telling our staff,
We're going to have to score 85 points because we can't guard anybody, and to
watch this team's growth on the defensive end of the floor has been really fun
to watch, and I believe that defense and rebounding are what you need to make
deep runs. We'll get our rebounding better, but I think our defense is pretty
solid.  
  
Q. I just wondered if you could speak to Sydney Wiese has hit a lot of
big shots over her career. You have players that have done that, too, but
what's it like to go against a kid like that?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think she's a really great player. You just look at the
run of their program, they've had some different -- the two pillars are Scott
Rueck and Sydney Wiese. Scott is a really good coach, and he's got a system
and a culture now that's bigger than any individual. But when you've got a kid
who can make big shots like that, who can control a team, who has a high
basketball IQ, who's committed at the highest levels, she's going to do that.
I've watched it all on film. Every time they made a bucket, she knows how to
find the shot that she wants. We showed our team, this is at this moment, and
for the most part I thought we took it away, but there was that couple of
times where she got those, and she's a really good player.  
  
But what I like even more about her is I think she's a really good teammate,
and I think she's a great representative of the game, and who she is as a
human being is even better than she is as a player.  
  
Q. Jordin, first half you had 17 points, and then in the second half for
probably the first 15 minutes you only had the two. What kind of defensive
adjustments did they make on you to kind of slow you down?  
JORDIN CANADA: I actually thought that I was getting good looks, it's just I
wasn't knocking them down. That's all I can say. I don't really think they --
I mean, tried to stop me. I just wasn't making good shots. That's all I can
say.  
  
CORI CLOSE: I do think they sent another post player, and they dared Monique
Billings and Kelli Hayes or Hersler or Nicole Kornet, any of those other
people to make shots. I did think they sent another player to try to help with
Hanson. But I know that was our last question. I don't want to leave this
table without echoing Jordin's sentiment about Kari Korver. This program would
not be knocking at the door of elite without Kari Korver. Our program, our
culture has been not only based on her commitment to what we believe in but
also her entire family. She is one of those players that she has given to us
and to me more than I could have ever given and invested in her. And Jordin
Canada deserves all the credit she's gotten. She's a phenomenal player. I
believe we've got the three best point guards in the country in our
conference, but I will tell you, just as Jordin said, none of us would be
talking about these things if it wasn't for this young lady, and she is
spectacular and she will be greatly missed, and we're going to send her out in
style.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Karlie Samuelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30872)

### [Kaylee Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28443)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 66, WSU - 36  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll take questions.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I thought Washington State had a great season, to get through
the injuries that they did, and their team played really, really hard. I
thought we just came out and jumped on them. And Karlie, Kayle, Britt, Bird,
we just came out really playing well. Then we were able to get a lot of young
players in the game. I think sometimes we had some turnovers at that point.  
  
But I think it was a great first game for our team. To be able to play
everybody, to get them tournament experience I think is really, really
critical.  
  
Q. I don't think you had a starter playing more than 20 minutes?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, I was just looking at that, too, yeah.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, will that hopefully help you the next night, maybe
two?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, that's exactly right. You know, we have people that
work really hard. Dijonai came in and got six rebounds in 16 minutes, Nadia
scored for us. You know, it's a different stage. So some of the younger
players, it's a different pace and tournament, just more adrenaline and
everything. It's just good to get them experience. Like you said, you've got
to rest people like Karlie, like Kayle, Bird. You know, people that played
major, major minutes for us.  
  
Q. Karlie, and Coach, Karlie, you got a lot of wide-open looks it looked
like from the three-point range tonight and knocked six of them down. Do you
do anything special to get open? Is that part of the system?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think Washington State was kind of in their zone that they
play, and my teammates found me really well. I did miss quite a few wide-open
ones, too, but my teammates found me, and I thought we moved the ball well.  
  
Q. I think it's easy to say they missed their first 11 shots, but when
three of those are also blocked and the other ones are contested, does that
make it a little tentative, rush their shots? Even when they do get a good
look, it takes then out of their comfort zone?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that anytime you get down like 16-0, it's probably
very discouraging. Missing shots, blocked shots, I really felt that our team
playing our first night and their second night, we just really wanted to come
out and run on them. You know, we did. We got out to a really nice lead right
from the get-go.  
  
And after that I think our defense was outstanding. The fact that they didn't
make any threes was really good. They had made threes night before. The fact
that they didn't really -- we outrebounded them, so our defense, our
rebounding, then offensively our key people were able to rest and other people
were able to help us. I thought it was all good.  
  
Q. Karlie and Kaylee, to only play 26, 27 minutes tonight, how much do
you think that that helps you going into the rest of the weekend?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Oh, it's great. We're excited to play tomorrow and getting
like D, Alexa, all the bigs in, I think it's great and it's really going to
help us tomorrow too.  
  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Yeah, just to go off of that, I think it's really comforting
knowing that you don't have to depend on just five players to play the entire
game, knowing that we have six other players on the bench that we trust that
we're excited for who can go in and get minutes too. The.  
  
Yeah, we're just all really excited for each other anytime any of us can get
on the floor.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Jamie Ruden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32695)

### [Kelsey Moos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26527)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 77, ASU - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, thank you to everybody in the Pac-12 Conference
just for hosting the tournament and all the hospitality and everything. You
just can't spot a team 19 points. You know, I mean, we beat them the second
quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. You know, we just dug way
too deep of a hole.  
  
Credit UCLA. They shot lights out, and those were not lay-ups, they were
three-pointers, they were jumpers. They were scoring every which way. Got to
set up our zone pretty quick. So I thought that was about as well as I've seen
them play, so I do want to credit them.  
  
Then I'm proud of our team. We just battled back. We knew we had lots of time.
We got down on them the first game and battled back. You know, we needed to
sustain things a little bit better, and that's kind of our story this year
just for the younger team, just kind of keeping that consistency.  
  
But, you know, I'm excited. We get a little window now to recover and
obviously, Jamie Ruden, these are her first two games since December, and 12
points in 13 minutes, that's not too bad.  
  
Q. UCLA came out 26 points in the first quarter, and you guys shot for
22%. How did they continue in that first quarter to get that huge run on
you?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, they came out and pressured us, and we've played
against pressure defense the last three weeks. I mean, this is a six-game --
except for Utah, minus the Utah game, every game we played UCLA, USC, U of A
twice. We knew how they were going to play us, and we just didn't handle it
well.  
  
Our young guards in the back court didn't stay aggressive. We turned the ball
over. We played sideways. I don't know why. We knew what to expect and we knew
how to attack it, and we just didn't do a great job.  
  
Credit UCLA, but I thought we settled down. We stopped turning the ball over
and did what we know how to do. Maybe chalk it up to this is the first
postseason for half our team, almost half our team. So a little bit of a
learning curve, I guess, there.  
  
Q. You talked about the younger team. It seemed like there were a lot of
times where the shot clock was running down and they had to chuck up a three
or even the shot clock violation. Was that just due to a young team or was
UCLA playing tight defense?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I think, again, you credit UCLA's defense. We
passed up shots. We've been doing that all year long where we'll create a
shot, we don't take it. Then against a really good team, it's hard. Then we
don't really know because everybody was ready for that person to take the
shot.  
  
When they didn't, I thought that happened -- it's been happening, if you've
been following us. But it happened a little too much today. I think we're
actually shooting the ball well, and we have really good shooters, and that's
something that we'll work on in terms of preparing for postseason. We've got
to catch to shoot and be ready when that shot comes. We did pass some up for
sure.  
  
Q. Coach, trying to dig out of that kind of hole in such a game of runs,
is that just two insurmountable? I mean, you use so much energy climbing that
hill.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: At halftime you saw us come out and we came out really
strong. We definitely felt we could overcome it. It was just right when we get
to single digits, we would foul or -- or UCLA would hit a big three. Like even
down the stretch, I mean, Kelsey pitches on Canada off Burke, I want her to do
that. She's a low-percentage shooter, but she makes the shot.  
  
So in some ways they stepped up and people that we gave some things to did a
great job. I think, you know, obviously Canada is a great player. If we had a
more veteran guard that could just handle her, she just makes everything
happen for them. It's the third time. That's why we tried to play zone,
because we knew we didn't have anybody. We have just freshmen that are trying
to handle one of the top guards and they're getting a great education on that.  
  
So, you know, I thought she was the difference the entire game because it was
always helping her on an on-ball screener, and she's getting deep in our key
and she draws a pinch. And her teammates really stepped up and hit shots.  
  
Q. Jamie, what's it like being a freshman and coming out in one of your
first games being in the playoffs? What's that like?  
JAMIE RUDEN: Honestly, it's exciting that I'm able to play, and I just found
out this a couple days ago that I'd be back for this season. So it's exciting
for me to see what I could do to help, especially for the seniors and just to
see any way I could impact the game just to help us win just for the seniors.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of the positives that you can really take out
from this game? Your team shot 19 of 22 from the free-throw line, but what are
some of the positives you can build on as you head for this week off and
decide your fate in the NCAA Tournament?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Right. Well, I thought we beat them three out of the
four quarters, and we played tough. I think at the same time -- you're asking
a coach after a loss the positives. We're looking at all of it. I mean, you
know, this team, I think we scored 68 points needs to be enough for us, and we
scored -- I don't know. You guys do the math. We scored a lot of points, 47
points in the second half. That's a huge positive for us, because usually our
issue is scoring. It's not defending. You know, the zone really, we thought we
could do it, we did a great job the first time. Didn't work the second time,
and that's kind of where we dug our hole for ourselves because we were in a
different mindset.  
  
But we come out man for 40 minutes like we normally do, and we score 68
points, we win, easily. So I think our offense as we settled down and got
going in our perimeter shooting combined with our inside attack, bringing that
into March Madness will be exciting, because we know we can defend.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what was the message to your team that you gave to keep them
in the game and keep their heads in the game? What did you tell them to keep
fighting for?  
KELSEY MOOS: I just kept trying to remind them who are you as a person? What's
your character? When times get tough, are you going to quit? Are you going to
quit on each other or are you going to lock arms with each other in the eye
and know that we can take this game.  
  
Believing not only in yourself, but believing in the other 11 people that are
out here with you, going to war with you every single day. When the going gets
tough, how are you going to handle it? What are you going to do? What are you
going to do later when basketball's not here?  
  
Games like this rebuild your character and show who you are. I'm really proud
of the team coming out after halftime. We didn't quit. We did not give up. We
tried our hardest until the final buzzer went off. So I'm really proud of the
team for that. Just staying true to our character.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 65, Cal - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Oregon State. Coach, an opening statement, and then
questions.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Thank you. First off, it's always a privilege to play in front of
a sea of orange, and that's what we were able to do again today. So early
start today in Beaver Nation didn't disappoint. They never do. So how
encouraging that is for our team to run out and hear that ovation and have
them behind us the whole time. So we're very grateful for that.  
  
Today I was just proud of our team to play for the third time and second time
in just a few days, it feels, against such a talented Cal team. And Kristine
Anigwe coming off of a great win yesterday with momentum, and we faced
adversity all day. She's so difficult to guard. Then they hit threes in that
second quarter.  
  
But I love the resilience this team played with. I thought they started the
game in an incredible way with Syd starting it off scoring for us. And every
time they made a run at us, we made the plays to keep them at bay. So it was a
great team win today. Mik and Syd were awesome, and our defense was
phenomenal. To hold them to 49 points and hold Kristine 26 on 24 shots,
though, and only keep her to six free throw attempts. That was the plan, to
make her work for everything, and we did.  
  
So really proud of the effort and really happy with the win.  
  
Q. Syd, can you just speak to how tough it is to play a team two times
in less than a week, and maybe what the difference was down the stretch you
feel like every time they tried to make a push there?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think one thing that is tough for postseason, especially
Pac-12 Tournament, everyone is on level playing field. You forget about the
conference play and the wins and losses. And everyone's out to win and to
survive. So it was a big day for Cal, because I know that they have postseason
opens.  
  
So they were coming out to try to get a win, which is important for them. I
mean, they're so long. There were a few times in the fourth quarter I must
have forgot how lengthy they were, because they got a lot of tips and we
turned it over a little too much there. But they're very talented. It's
definitely tough to play a team, I think, in a four-day span, four- or five-
day span because you know each other so well. Especially at the end of
conference play, you know each other, so you just have to make plays.  
  
So I think Kolbie had an amazing pass to Marie to get that and one lay-up. I
want to see a replay of that. So I think people just stepped up the way that
we needed to and at the perfect times and made the plays necessary in order to
win.  
  
Q. Mikayla, what was it like to play your first college game in your
hometown, basically?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: It's great to be back home. I knew some of my friends and
family came. And it's good to see Beaver Nation. The four- or five-hour drive,
they didn't worry about that. They just came up, and we saw 250, 300 people in
the crowd cheering us on, so it's cool to be back.  
  
Q. Were you just feeling it today offensively or what?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: My teammates set me up in position to be successful. I know Syd
made a few great passes to me, and glad they went down.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Thanks, Mik. Great shots.  
  
Q. Mikayla had a huge game, but your freshmen played really well. Talk
about how big Mik was, and that freshmen group. I think three of them were on
the floor in the first quarter because of foul trouble. They really gave you a
lift?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, another huge lift from them. Mik and Kat have produced all
year long. I love it when Mik was as aggressive as she was today. She makes so
many things happen, attacking the basket, spacing the floor. I thought we did
a nice job finding her in the corner, knocking those shots down.  
  
Kat stretches the floor when she's got the ball. She doesn't even have to make
a shot to stretch the floor because of who she is. I thought they played great
defense as well. Madi gets minutes when we need her, to be honest, and when
Marie got those two quick fouls, we were already out of our rotation two
minutes into the game. So Breanna did a great job just staying out there.
Kolbie had to play long minutes, and they can't stay out there the whole time.
So Madi just once again comes in and plays absolutely huge. She hadn't played
for, I think a couple weeks to be honest, and the other day hits a big shot
against Cal on Senior Day, and then today hits another huge shot at the end of
the first quarter.  
  
So just really impressed by all of their contributions. They do a phenomenal
job. We see Janessa every day. There are four of them that are just constantly
improving, and it's so encouraging to the rest of our team to see their
growth. So they're leading from that freshman position. They were pivotal, and
they will continue to be as we go forward.  
  
Q. Your rotation was also a little different today because Katie
couldn't play. How did that impact your substitution patterns and how
optimistic are you that she'll be able to go at some point this weekend?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, I'm hoping. We'd love to have her back tomorrow. You saw
gabby at the one a little bit. You saw Mik playing a little bit longer
minutes. You saw Syd playing longer minutes. Well, I guess. That's kind of
typical, I guess. But, yeah, anytime -- just one more example of this team
rising when, you know, we're down a player. That's been who they are over the
years. Not just now.  
  
So when somebody goes down, somebody else steps up, whether it's foul trouble
or whatever it may be. So this was just one more example of this team taking
adversity and turning it into a positive and overcoming it.  
  
Q. Scott, there were multiple times throughout the game where it looks
like kat was going Cal was going to make a bit of a run and it get back into
it. They got within four at one point. Most coaches opt to take timeouts at
that point. It seemed you let your team play. Is that more of a comfort thing
for you knowing that they've been through a lot of the season and they'll ride
it out, and you don't really need to slow it down for them?  
SCOTT RUECK: It's a feel, complete feel. There's times when as soon as that
momentum has changed, we need a timeout immediately. That happened against
Stanford last week, actually. They got momentum and an immediate timeout. Who
is on the floor, the vibe of the situation. So that's always feel for me. I
felt in this situation let's play through it as long as we could.  
  
I did take two timeouts tonight though because of that. So when you've got
veteran leaders on the floor, and typically we do with Syd and Gabby, normally
you can weather it a bit. This team has done a great job of that, and I trust
that their ability to make it right again out of the chaos, you know? Let's
get back to something normal. So sometimes it's just telling them to slow
down. A couple times I thought we shot the ball way too early a couple
possessions in the third quarter that led to their momentum during that
stretch. We got away, maybe, from being who we are. Took a couple bad shots,
and, hey, let's run a set. When we did, we were successful tonight. So, all
feel.  
  
Q. Mik, you've had a lot of success in the three games against Cal. Is
there anything that they do that allows you to be open? It looked like you
were really confident throughout, but just especially shooting the three
tonight. Was that true?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, I try to come out and be aggressive with my drive. If
they take that away, if the threes there, go for that. But try to come out
with that mindset each time. Luckily it's been against Cal, I don't know if
it's a coincidence or not, but...

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon - 70, Washington - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Washington. Coach, I'll let you start with an
opening statement, and then we'll take questions.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Great game, that had to be fun to watch. Tremendous crowd.
Thank you, Pac-12, Seattle, everybody that did everything to pack that house
tonight. It was awesome. I thought they played very, very passionately like
they needed that win. I thought they were already in the NCAA Tournament, but
they played like a team that thought they needed to have another one. And I
think what they did tonight is play themselves into a higher seed.  
  
I thought our kids really, really battled. It's really tough to play that
second day, and I thought we got off to a little bit of a slow start with some
hustle plays, some 50-50 balls that they won every one of. Once we got that
cleaned up, it was a great game from that point on.  
  
Q. Kelsey, will you talk about the last shot? Did it look like a good
look? Somebody had a hand on it, right?  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, I didn't -- I mean, there were two people on me, but there
wasn't a lot of time left, so I just tried to get it up there. Yeah, someone
tipped it.  
  
Q. Coach, you swapped Kelsey on to Sabrina I think maybe midway through
the first quarter or second quarter, and I think she held Sabrina scoreless
for a quarter, quarter and a half. Kelsey is always praised for her offense,
but can you talk about her defense?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, anybody that doesn't praise her for her defense doesn't
watch the game. They're just watching it for the offensive stuff. She got
everybody's best player last year for 40 minutes. So I thought she did a great
job after that adjustment. It got her in some foul trouble that I wish we
could have made some other adjustments on, but the kid's hard to guard. The
kid's really hard to guard. I thought -- I'm going to go back and look at it.
I thought the fouls that Kelsey got called on her were mostly hand checks and
stuff. So there's nobody in the country that gets more hand checks than she
does, so we'll look at it.  
  
But I thought she did a great job defensively. I think, in general, our team
doesn't get any defensive credit anyway. I think these got to be one of the
Pac-12 defensive players of the top six, five or something, if she didn't make
it. Just because steals and blocked shots show up. She's in my opinion one of
the best defensive players that ever played in the post. Look at the numbers
of what she did against people head-to-head. The job she didn't tonight.  
  
Defensive rebound doesn't count anymore? I think we had a great team defense.
And I thought our first-shot defense was great. They got 15 points after we
would stop them initially in the first half. Like we would stop the first
shot, and then the ball would kick around or something, and they'd get a
second. It might not have gone down as a second-chance point, but they got 15
after we made them miss the first time.  
  
So that to me is a sign of a team that really was amped up to play the game,
and they got to all those loose balls. But I think both of these kids'
defense, and Natalie Romeo, is way underrated. I'm really proud of our team
where we finished statistically to not have had somebody that the rest of the
conference thought was good enough to be on the defensive team. Even though
they were third in field goal position defense.  
  
Q. I'm not sure that it matters because you guys did such an incredible
job last year with your seeding. What seed do you think you've earned this
year? Do you think that regardless of who wins this tournament, the Pac-12
needs to be a 1 seed?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I don't think regardless. I don't think if Oregon wins it they
should be the No. 1 seed. But I think if Oregon State does, they should. I'll
look at it really hard. Y'all know I love to look at that stuff. I'll start
looking hard tomorrow. Preliminary looking, I didn't think there was any way
we could fall out of the 3 seed just based on who the other four seeds were
and what their resumés were. This will put Oregon's RPI probably into the top
25, close. Low 30s at the very least. And that would be considered our worst
loss because we've lost to Notre Dame, Oregon State, UCLA, Stanford, and
Oregon, there is not a bad loss in that column. So if we don't end up getting
the host, then we'll go back to work to try to figure it out.  
  
But I think we've done plenty to be able to host one. If they at any time see
what Seattle does when they come out to support us. What was it, 9,000
tonight?  
  
THE MODERATOR: 9686. It was a sellout.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: That's a big number.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what was it like going against Sabrina? She's at the
beginning of her career and you're kind of at the end of yours. What did you
see from her tonight?  
KELSEY PLUM: She's a very good player. She's going to have a great career. I
missed shots late. I'm known for making shots, and I didn't make them late,
and that's why we lost. You can give credit to them, but as a player, as an
All-American, I have to do better, I have to play better, so end of story.  
  
Q. You guys had I think a nine-point lead at one point. Were you guys
comfortable in any way?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: No, never comfortable. This team's too explosive. And Lexi
Bando, I think, hit two straight threes in that run and had an and-one toward
there. So I was happy that we were playing well. We had built the lead, but by
no means were we satisfied or didn't think there was another run coming.
They're too good of a team. We've been in too many games with these guys. It
happened last year too. We had an 18-point lead against them last year when
Alene (phonetic) fouled out. And that's one of those moments you go Alene is
out of the game now, and all of a sudden they start raining threes again. So
never comfortable, never any of that.  
  
I thought they hit some very, very timely shots, and that was the big
difference in it.  
  
Q. Lexi Bando had nine points in your first match-up. She only had four
or five shots, I believe, to get that. Was her performance -- did that change
your guys' game plan defensively?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Didn't change the game plan. Maybe it should have, I don't
know. But we do what we do. We didn't do as well this time. I think also last
time you have to understand, Sabrina and Maite didn't play, so those kids that
were on the floor, we may have been heavier in the gaps and we could have
helped on some of those curls and given Natalie more help on some of that
stuff.  
  
It was an overall team breakdown, wasn't anything any individual did. But I
think the result of the stress that Sabrina and Maite put on you on the
perimeter, that just makes Lexi that much more dangerous. And like I say, I
thought she hit a couple threes in transition that were just really, really
timely and clutch.  
  
Q. Kelsey, not the outcome you wanted, but what are the positives you
can take from this game and learn moving on to the NCAA Tournament?  
KELSEY PLUM: We'll be ready in March. March Madness, we'll be ready. And I'm
not going to miss like that again.  
  
Q. Kelsey gets a hand on the three late, made a great defense, Chantel
gets an and-one, and you're right there the final minute. Can you just talk,
is it harder to swallow when you lose the game at the line, essentially, when
they're able to go ahead at the line?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It's hard to lose period, with this group, just because their
expectations are so high. But I think the key thing is, again, for us, if we
all of a sudden start talking about being a process team all year long and now
all of a sudden become a results team at this point in time in the year,
that's what we didn't do last year.  
  
So I think there are so many plays. I mean, I'm going to kick myself for
running the play that involved the screen that gets a moving screen called on
it with under a minute to play. That doesn't happen very often, but that's my
fault. I probably should have just ran an iso play or something like that. But
moving screen called with under a minute to play in a crucial, crucial game,
that's on me. I should have known better.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you've been a captain since you were a freshman. What are you
saying to your teammates right now? I think you guys will be ready for March,
and I'm not sure anyone wants to play you. But as a captain, as a senior, what
are you saying in the locker room to make sure everyone's focused?  
KELSEY PLUM: We have some veterans on our team and we have some young kids
too. So I think as a leader you have to reassure the young kids that it's not
the end of the world. Yeah, it's a tough loss, but we learn from it. When the
big games come in March, March Madness, you learn from this mistake. You learn
from getting one more defensive rebound, one more screen, whatever that was
called for offensive foul.  
  
But I think as veterans we take responsibility for the loss.  
  
I think, if anything, I didn't do enough job preparing the young ones, and
even Natalie in there. Because, like, they need to feel more free out there.
They need to feel like they can step in, knock down shots and there's no
pressure, no pressure on them. So I'll get my team better prepared.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Lexi Bando](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28321)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon - 70, Washington - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll take questions.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, what I told the team in the locker room
after the game, I've been coaching, this is my 30th year of coaching, and I
don't know if I've ever been more proud of a basketball team than I was of
this group tonight. A full house, they weren't cheering for us.  
  
You know, when we fell behind by ten in that second half, and the way we just
showed some grit and fight and toughness and battled back, that really speaks
to the character of our team. Led by these two, I thought particularly these
two played like -- is beast a good word? Warriors. They were incredible
tonight. And their will to win, I think, carried us through.  
  
Also, we didn't do it just on heart and toughness, but we executed. I thought
tonight our defensive game plan was on point, and these guys went out and
really executed it. So, again, very proud. That's a great team. Washington is
a great team. That's a Final Four contender. I think we all expect them to get
there, at the least challenge to get there. So that was a big win for the
University of Oregon.  
  
Q. For both players, Kelsey said you guys played like a team that felt
like you needed to win this game. Did you feel like you needed this game when
you walked in this gym tonight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I don't think necessarily needed, but I think wanted. I don't
think they were ready for how bad we wanted this game. So we need to come out
every game just like we did today, ask we'll get some great wins.  
  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, I mean, we just dame out with so much heart and grit. You
know, we're just truly blessed to be where we're at, and it was so much fun
playing with the team tonight.  
  
Q. Lexi, I think you guys were actually down nine in the fourth quarter
and you kind of went on a personal tear there. Did you take that upon yourself
to keep the team in the game or were you just open?  
LEXI BANDO: You know, I know I needed to step up, and Sabrina was getting me
the ball. I just had the mindset I need to shoot. I need to shoot, and the
ball ended up going in tonight, so.  
  
Q. Kelly, you've been in NCAA Tournaments a lot. You have a lot of
experience. This group is new. What can a win like this do going forward, kind
of regardless of what happens tomorrow, because I think you're definitely in
now, we all agree.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you're challenged so much in the Pac-12. It's incredible
each and every night. We've played a lot of very good teams, teams that are
going to be in the second and even third weekends. Tooth and nail, right down
to the wire. Oregon State, UCLA, Stanford. We haven't really -- other than the
UCLA win, don't really have that signature win against a top team.  
  
Now I think a win like this really makes our kids believe that, yeah, we've
been playing them close, playing them close. We can play with anybody. About
you you've got to get over the hump and get that big win. I think tonight was
just that.  
  
We joke, and by the way, these two play it down. They have great synergy, you
should see them in practice. They play back and forth with this shot and that
shot. So Lexi's pretty humble, and yeah, just tonight, they kind of went in,
and there is a lot of heart work behind that.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Lexi, just describe the last half an hour emotionally for
you guys? What have you guys gone through?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, a whole lot. I think we're just excited. That was a
great game that we played, and they played a great game as well. But I think
it motivates us to continue winning and competing with these great teams. It
just shows that we're right there. We got a few stops and made some big plays
tonight.  
  
Q. There were a couple times where it looked like Washington was going
to maybe pull away. The crowd was going wild. What was it like on the bench
and timeouts? What were you guys saying to each other during those times to
stay resilient?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, well, we knew Washington's going to go on runs. Kelsey Plum
is an amazing scorer, and we knew she was going to hit big buckets. I think it
was just staying engaged and focused and just coming together and not letting
those baskets get to us. We just ended up playing really hard.  
  
Q. Coach, often with the back-to-back games, especially if the team
loses, they were like, oh, we were tired. Can you talk about the benefits of
actually playing yesterday?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think you get the jitters out. It's a big stage. There's a lot
of excitement. I think over a longer period of time, the more games you play,
that might be a factor. But my guess is late in that game, there was a lot of
adrenaline flowing, and that's going to carry you through. So these kids are
smart. They're good athletes and they're going to hydrate and they're going to
eat right, and they're going to go home and get a lot of sleep, and I
anticipate we're going to be able to come out and fight tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sabrina, when they were all in the middle kind of in the mid-court
and Kelly said you were a little late to the party, what was that like when
you joined them at mid court and you all went wild there?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think I've done that about five times already to be honest.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: It's an ongoing joke.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah. But it was awesome. I'm happy they did their cheering.
I had to sit down. I couldn't keep standing. I think I was just embracing the
moment. I think we all were in different ways. It was a great team win here,
especially on their home court, and we're excited to get back at it tomorrow.  
  
Q. Not a big mystery that Kelsey Plum was going to have the ball for
their last shot. Did you guys play the defense you were hoping to play on
that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we wanted to foul. We had a couple to give after the first
dribble. You know, it gave us a couple of seconds, and then, yeah, I thought
we defended that last one pretty well. You know it's going to be in her hand.  
  
I tell you, I thought Maite Cazorla, you don't see it on the stat sheet a ton,
even though she did shoot the ball and hit a couple big threes in the second
half, I thought she was incredible tonight. That is not easy. Kelsey Plum is a
phenomenal player. All of you are from Seattle, so you know that obviously.
She still had 34, but she had to work for them. I thought Maite was
phenomenal, so with her on her there at the end and we gave some good help.  
  
Q. I thought Ruthy was awesome early and you guys went to her a lot.
She's going against someone that's a great defensive player in Osahor and a
veteran. How did you mentally prep Ruthy? A lot of freshmen at this point have
hit a wall mentally?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I tell you, she's shown resilience in this tournament.
She's played really, really well. Yeah, Osahor is a heck of a defender and had
a great night. I didn't realize 27 rebounds. I saw a lot of them, but that's
incompetent credible.  
  
No, Ruthy grows up right in front of our eyes. She continues to improve and
she's got such a high ceiling, I don't think we've seen anything yet.  
  
Q. Kelly, after an emotional victory like this in this tournament
setting, you have to turn around and play Stanford tomorrow. At what point do
you stop celebrating this victory and already start looking ahead to
tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Right now. I think they're all in there being fed, putting ice
on them. Yeah, we'll enjoy it. Once we get back to the hotel, we'll start
working. I know as coaches, on tomorrow. So I think, you guys are fine, right?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Oh, yeah.  
  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we'll keep going. They've played a lot tonight, but I
think they've got more.  
  
Q. Sabrina, what were you thinking when you went to the foul line there
with the game on the line?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I knew I was going to hit the free throws, to be honest
with you. I've been there a few times. My freshman year I missed it to win the
game. So I told myself I wasn't going to do that again. But I was just excited
to be put in that position.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't think I would want anyone else in that position because
I know how tough it can be to hit those free throws. But after you hit the
first one, the second one is pretty much easy.  
  
Q. Lexi and Sabrina, what did you see there on the court when you see
Ruthy get a hand on Kelsey's last shot, and what was it like those last couple
seconds?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Well, we knew she was going to have the ball in her hands. We
didn't want to foul on her shooting because she'd hit those free throws as
well. But we just stuck to what we've been doing all year, using our
principles and doing what we did. And that shot wasn't meant to go in, and it
didn't.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you said you've been there before, but you really haven't.
This is the Pac-12 Tournament, and you haven't been here before in a situation
like this. So why are you so calm at the line because it's not high school?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, you're right. You know, it's just basketball. Wherever
you are, you have to step up and hit those free throws, so they came pretty
naturally.  
  
Obviously, I told myself I'm not missing these free throws. I didn't want to
let my team down, and since I was put in that position, I was put in that
position for a reason. I'm excited they went in, and that's why we practice
free throws every day.  
  
Q. Kelly, can you give us your quick take on Stanford and how they've
been playing? You talk about Sabrina's never been here. Stanford knows how to
win in this conference and this tournament, and they can turn it on sometimes.
What is going to be key to stopping them?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, it's a challenge, obviously. The thing that I've always
appreciated about Stanford, even before I got in the Pac-12 was they just
never beat themselves. They're so poised. They're so solid. They rarely make
mistakes. So they'll test us at both ends of the floor, offensively,
defensively. They play really hard, and, like you said, they're playing with
confidence. But, you know, listen, we're going to be ready. We're going to
fight. And I think we can go out and play loose, you know. And I think that
will help us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, with Kelsey Plum being as dynamic as she is, specifically what
goes into trying to defend a player like that when you're game planning?  
KELLY GRAVES: You know what? She is so much fun to watch. I hate playing
against her, but she's so much fun to watch. I think she's a testament of hard
work and a will to win. And I think an example to every young girl out there,
and young boy, for that matter, that you don't have to be the biggest, the
quickest, you don't have to jump the highest, but you've got to have a will to
win and to compete and to get better. That's who she is to the core. She was
meant for big moments like that.  
  
So you can't defend her with just one. Maite did a great job on her, but there
was always help lurking. We switched off a lot. We kind of went with a guard
on Osahor, so anytime those two are involved in pick-and-roll, we just
switched it. So, again, Sabrina was involved in a lot of those. Then every
time she drove, we had to have somebody kind of lurking around the hoop to
help.  
  
So you try to defend her as a team, and that's the only thing you can do.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Courtney Range](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30430)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 65, Cal - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome the California Golden Bears, head coach
Lindsay Gottlieb, Kristine Anigwe, and Courtney Range.  
  
Coach, I'll let you open and then questions.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Sure, we lost today to the Pac-12 regular season champions
and a potential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. And they proved it. I don't
think it was without a fight from us. I think that's what we do in this
conference. We prepare each other and beat each other up a little bit. I think
everyone makes one another better.  
  
Credit to Oregon State, Syd is terrific and plays like a senior. Scott's
terrific, has done an unbelievable job. I don't see how he's not in a serious
conversation for National Coach of the Year with what they've lost and what
they've done this year.  
  
But I'm proud of our group. We sat up here last year, and we made a run. It
was the end for us. Now we're a postseason team. I just said this in another
media thing. I cannot fathom the Pac-12 not having seven teams in the NCAA
Tournament, with what an incredible top to bottom conference it is. People
talk a lot about the top four seeds who have been continually in the top 16
reveals, which is an incredible story.  
  
But I think the bigger story is 5 through 12 are better than anybody else's 5
through 12 in any conference. I think it set us up for a postseason run. We're
hoping that's in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
And I just think that the way that our kids showed out these last couple days
talks about who they are, and I want to continue to play and coach basketball
with this group, so we're excited about that.  
  
Q. Coach, you got it down to single digits multiple times in the fourth
quarter (indiscernible)?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: But they're a twenty, whatever they are, eight win team for
a reason. They're going to bend a little bit, but it's tough for them to
break. I thought we could have hit a few more threes, might have changed the
game. I thought we could have kept them off the free-throw line a little more
and maybe changed the game and not put ourselves in such a hole in the first
quarter.  
  
But if you look at the rest of the game, it's pretty even from there. And
they're too good of a team probably to come back from that much of a deficit,
but gosh, I like how we played and competed and put ourselves in a position.
And I felt like if we had gotten one more bucket and the pressure's really on
them, then maybe it's a different story all the way down the stretch.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you sound pretty confident you're an NCAA Tournament team.
Is the next ten days going to be uncomfortable, anxious? What are the feelings
going to be like? Because most projections have you guys right on that edge?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I'm confident that's where we belong. It's hard to be
confident in things that are out of your control. We know that, you know, if
we have five or six more wins, then it's not a question. But I do think the
committee has sort of in the years that I've been doing this, right, it's
crazy. Like 15 or something years as an assistant head coach, I think it's
evolved where they watch a lot more games because of the Pac-12 Network,
because everything is digital streaming and all of this. It's a weird year
with the bubble, right?  
  
I would say it's soft in a sense that there's a ton of teams with very similar
records and resumés. I think what puts us over the edge is that we've got a
Top 10 RPI win with UCLA, a top 20 RPI win with Oklahoma, and Oregon is a
really good win for us, and no real bad losses, because nobody in our
conference is outside the Top 100.  
  
The thing that makes me most confident is the eye test. If you watch our games
and watch today, if you just looked at the score, oh, Cal lost to the No. 1
seed. If you watched the game, you'd say that team's a Top 10 seed or whatever
the heck we would be. And I think that's where I have confidence that we have
a caliber of club that is an NCAA Tournament caliber. The rest of it is out of
our control.  
  
But I'm happy the committee has watched all year and understands. I think when
you have whatever she is, a Top 10 player in the country, Top 5, whatever, can
you compete with anybody? Sure, then you compete with anybody. And we've got a
bunch of other talented kids too.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you're talking about how you're proud that your team came
back, but falling behind yet again in the first quarter. What happened
there?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I don't know if there's a guard that makes as many big-time
shots as Syd does. When you literally go under one ball screen and it's a
bucket, and I thought we missed a couple good looks earlier, and they got a
little bit of a rhythm.  
  
I thought the second quarter when we cut it to six, I think Kristine scored
seven points and we game back and started hitting shots. When we cut it to six
and got five stops in a row, we couldn't get a bucket. So when we went on our
run and won the second quarter by four, we could have won that by ten.  
  
So it's tough, right? But they've got their No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament
potentially if they win this thing, so they're really, really good. So some of
it is you've got to be so sharp from start to finish. You miss a bucket, you
give up a three, and all of a sudden you're in a little bit of a hole.  
  
But I didn't think it was a lack of focus or energy or intensity or anything
like that. I think we've been pretty solid here for two days, and this is the
type of way that we want to play. And if we continually play this way, I think
there's a lot more basketball in us this year, and especially for the young
kids understanding this is what it's like. You know, I think we'll eventually
get to a championship caliber.  
  
Q. When Sydney hit those three free throws to open the second quarter,
you guys were really on the verge of getting blown out of there. Do you think
that's something that what it says about your team, but also an NCAA committee
would look at and say they were on the ropes and next thing you know they're
down by four?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, she hit those free throws and I think they didn't
score again for a really long time until Pivec hit some big threes. And the
reason Oregon State is good is that you kind of want to give up Pivec threes
if you're going to give up something, it hasn't been her highest percentage
thing, and she goes 3 for 4. That's why they're good.  
  
But absolutely. I don't -- I think to have a team climb back, right, and
string together stops and score, and this is a team that's tough to score on.
We put some pressure on them in the second quarter.  
  
Again, it speaks to how good they are and also, I think, that we're
competitive against anybody. We want to get to the point where we're not
putting ourselves in a hole and having to climb back. But to be down 13, 14 or
something, and climb back to four, again, obviously, we can compete. We just
have to take that next step.  
  
Q. It seems like the last couple games you've taken your game a little
more on the outside, like more short jumpers and all of that. How's that
working for you? Was it like more of an intentional thing this game because
they were clogging inside for you?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, like when you're getting pushed around game after game,
you have to do something else. So when there's three people on me, I just try
to extend the court and do whatever's comfortable, whatever fits our play,
whatever the guards are giving me. I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to
win. So if I have to shoot a jumper, I'm going to shoot a jumper because
that's two points and it's closer to winning than anything. I'd rather do
something for us to be in the game than not do anything at all.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team in the locker room after the game?
Because you are kind of on this bubble, kind of waiting. NIT is a given, but
for the NCAA, how do you approach this now?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I told them I couldn't be more proud of their effort in the
last couple days, but we also need to understand that there are reasons we're
not a championship team yet, and they are, right? Because I know that, again,
Courtney and KC are only seniors, and we have a lot to play for for them. But
the rest of the kids in this group are going to win a Pac-12 Championship at
some point, so I want them to feel how it feels to give this effort all the
time, even when you come up short.  
  
In terms of the whole postseason conversation, they're really smart. They're
cerebral kids. We've been pretty transparent with what's at stake the last
couple weeks. So I talked about it, I said, we're going to be in a postseason
tournament, and I think we deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament. And if we do
get that opportunity, gosh, we're going to, you know, blaze into that thing
like the team that nobody wants to play. If that's not in the cards for us,
then we're going to take every advantage to try to win the other tournament
and that could be, you know, useful for us too.  
  
But we're going to be on pins and needles for a couple days here, but the
thing you can do is rest and practice hard and mentally prepare and take what
comes. The whole thing we do in college basketball is all about life lessons.
And we know we could have taken care of business earlier. But I also know
looking at our resumé lined up against other people, I think if we get in that
tournament, we'll be everything that it's about, which is, hey, I don't want
to face that team. Anything can happen in a 40-minute game. So we'll get them
prepared either way, and everything we always do is about the life lessons,
and the growth and handling situations through basketball.  
  
Q. Courtney, as the senior here, what are your thoughts and feelings
going on with you in terms of your last Pac-12 tournament or waiting on the
bubble? What's going on with you?  
COURTNEY RANGE: I felt like -- Coach Lindsay said it best, but, yeah, we're
going to be on pins and needles, but at the end of the day we're going to go
back, practice, and whatever happens on the Selection Show, that happens. If
we get our name called, then we're going to prepare for whoever we're playing.
If not, we're going to prepare for the NIT.

_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Stanford - 66, WSU - 36  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good evening, welcome to Washington State Cougars. Coach, an
opening statement and then we'll go to questions.  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: First of all, on behalf of our program, we'd like to thank the
Pac-12 for an incredible experience here in women's basketball. It's been
everything great up to this point, unfortunately. Also to you, the media, we
really appreciate all the support that you guys have given women's basketball,
especially this year. It's really exciting, obviously, to coach in this
conference and see all of the improvements that continuing to on, so thanks to
everybody for that.  
  
Congratulations to Stanford for their tremendous play today. Obviously they
came in well-rested, really had scouted us very well. Took us out of a lot of
things early defensively. We were struggling very much to score, and, you
know, it took us a while, but I thought we got back on track in the second
quarter. Obviously, it's just not enough, given all of the strength of
offense, especially that Stanford plays.  
  
But, you know, all in all I thought our team played hard at times, especially
in the second quarter, and the third and fourth quarter and they stayed with
the game plan. But, unfortunately for us, I think we were running a little bit
on fumes today, and it showed.  
  
Q. Coach, when your team falls down by so much like that, what do you
try to talk to the players, rally them?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Well, we did the same thing the other night. We've done that
before, and they know that they've got a great maturity about them even though
they're a young group.  
  
That's what we talk about, just don't play scoreboard. Get back down into our
system defensively. Try to get some stops. Try to turn them over, get them one
and done and get them back into our running game. Try to get something easy so
we get some confidence and get some rhythm about what we're doing. They've
always done a great job of that.  
  
But tonight, like I said, it's just tough because we were pretty tired out
there.  
  
Q. Was there any sort of emotional letdown, I guess, after yesterday's
game where you guys came back and really took --  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how there couldn't be. For all the
people that were here and people on TV that saw that game, I mean, Colorado,
it was just a slugfest, back and forth, back and forth. You know, all the out
of bounds plays on their end, and that arrow going the other way, the arrow
not changing, all the crazy things that were going on. There is no doubt.  
  
I'm not going to tell you there wasn't an emotional letdown after. It's a
very, very quick turnaround. No doubt, it's a quick turnaround for us. But I
thought that our team was ready to play. I thought that they were rallying. I
thought they were encouraging each other. I think after the first quarter in
particular they kind of put it behind them and the emotions kind of leveled
out and it kind of picked up emotionally and we got after it with some energy.  
  
Q. It looked like even in the early going you were actually getting some
decent looks and just couldn't get it to drop. Is that right?  
IVANA KMETOVSKA: Yeah, and their defense is also good.  
  
NIKE MCCLURE: I mean, that happens to the best of us. Not all your shots are
going to fall. It just depends. We ran our offense correctly, and that's all
we could get, really, in terms of those shots falling. We just need
rebounders. So if we're not going to rebound and those shots are not going to
fall, then obviously the score's going to be a little lopsided.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, Coach has talked about how proud she was of you
and how you've handled the injuries and adversity you faced this season. How
proud are you of yourselves and what do you guys take away, do you think, from
this season?  
NIKE MCCLURE: From this season, I think the biggest takeaway is our toughness
as a team. Obviously, when you lose a lot of talent like that, it's hard. It's
hard to come back from that and you have to adjust a lot during the season. So
I think that it really shows that we're able to adjust on the move really well
and we're tough.  
  
So when we bring those players back, we have that talent, that toughness, and
the ability to adjust on the move. So I'm excited for our season next year,
and I'm excited for postseason as well, hopefully.  
  
IVANA KMETOVSKA: I thought as much as this is a lesson for basketball, this is
a lesson for life in general. When things aren't going right, you don't give
up. I'm so proud of my teammates that we were successful in doing that.  
  
Q. Coach, Karlie Samuelson gets a lot of open threes tonight. What does
she do that gets her those wide-open looks? Is that part of the system, and
how do you counter that?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: They space the floor really well. They've got tremendous
inside game. I think for us, honestly, because we only played Stanford once
this year with the rotation with the Pac-12, and we did a much, much better
job covering them, but that was the first night of Friday Sunday play up in
Pullman.  
  
So I think we were a little bit of a step slow. But they move the basketball
very quickly. They've got a very, very dominating front line. So if you get
caught leaning in a little bit or trying to help or whatever, they're going to
find open player. And she's a great player. She's just a great player as well.
They move the basketball and find her with ease.  
  
Q. What did they take away from you guys defensively tonight? It seems
like in the first quarter things weren't falling. Is that something they were
doing or were the shots not there?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: They did a very good job of keeping McPhee on Swedlund. They
were denying her the ball. You know, Swed was one of the big factors in us
getting going last night offensively and she has been most of the season.  
  
So they did a good job. She didn't even get touches. We were trying to get a
lot of ball movement. They play gap defense. They're not out on you playing
really hard, but we're trying to move and cut through the gaps. Just, you
know, trying to find something easy.  
  
But with their length and how they play that gap defense, I think -- we talked
about we did get some looks early, but for us, I thought they were a little
bit rushed and they did get some blocks early. I think that made us a little
bit tentative.  
  
But I thought that probably four minutes into that first quarter Nike just
kind of said, you know what, let's go. Nike has kind of been our superwoman.
She kind of put that cape back on and said, you know what, guys, I don't care
who we're playing against, I don't care what the score is, let's compete. She
took it to the rim and hit that first free throw lying jumpshot and kind of
got going a little bit, so everybody else kind of said, oh, yeah, I guess we
can score against these guys.  
  
But sometimes it just takes one player stepping up and getting going and
showing that, hey, we can do this. This is just basketball.  
  
Q. You went 0 for 16 from three-point range tonight. With that, would
you rather see them attacking the basket more or do you think because the
point differential was getting so much you had to take those?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: I don't have a problem with our shot selection tonight. I
don't. Two nights ago, the three-point line was very good to us.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Nicole Kornet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32694)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 77, ASU - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then questions.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you, media, for being here. It's so huge for our sport and
the city of Seattle. I just think this is such a well-run tournament and I
know a lot goes in behind the scenes, and we need our media to really make it
a national event, so we appreciate that.  
  
Also, congratulations to Arizona State. They're going to have a great run in
the NCAA Tournament. I just have so much respect for the way they play and how
hard they play. They're always a team that plays better together than you
would think in their individual pieces. So excited to root them on in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
That's why this win means something to us. We beat a really good team in
Arizona State. It's not easy to get a team three times in a year, especially
not a good team like that. But really proud of our team. That's as well as
we've executed all year in that first quarter. They came out in zone, a lot of
people have been zoning us throughout the year. We put in some new things
recently, and we really executed to perfection.  
  
I thought Monique Billings really set the tone for the game. Other people will
talk about her points and rebounds, but what she did on the inside to draw two
and three people, how hard she posted when she created driving lanes with her
seals that created outside shots for Nicole, I really thought her intensity on
both ends of the floor really set the tone for the entire game, and I thought
she was consistent all the way through.  
  
About a month and a half ago, we looked to Nicole Kornet, Kelli Hayes, and
Paulina Hersler in the eyes and said we are going to go as you guys grow. And
to see Nicole Kornet's growth over this last month and a half has been
absolutely a joy to watch. But it's not been without sacrifice and hard
things. So I'm really proud of her just stamina and perseverance, and it's fun
to see it pay off the way it did today.  
  
Q. I know you you'd like to bottle that first quarter --  
CORI CLOSE: Absolutely.  
  
Q. \-- and just pour it out whenever you need it. It was pretty even the
next three quarters, but that part of it? It's really hard to keep that type
of pace when you're that far ahead for an entire game?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think it is hard. That's why there are not very many elite
teams. That's what we seek to be. We seek to be an elite program that knows
how to sustain that kind of focus and intensity, no matter what the score
says. I don't always think the score, whether you're up or down, is always a
reflection of how close to your potential that you're playing.  
  
So it is. It's very difficult to maintain that edge. We have an edge to start
the game. Like everything mattered. Every pass mattered, every screen
mattered, everything mattered. As we stretched out that lead, it is more
difficult. If you want to be an elite program, you have to be willing to do
the difficult things.  
  
Q. Monique, what were you seeing from the ASU defense that allowed you
to draw that pressure inside?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: They really just concentrated the middle of the key, I would
say and just really brought two, three people to me. So I had to be strong
with the ball and look for kickouts to Nicole or Jordin and just make the
extra pass.  
  
Q. Nicole, when an offense gets rolling, and the shots start falling for
almost everybody, is that kind of contagious though that you kind of get into
a flow? You wish it would go 40 minutes, but at times like that, it's nice to
happen, but can you feel that?  
NICOLE KORNET: It's definitely contagious. As soon as one goes in, especially
when it's your first shot, it's just give me the ball. It's going up. But when
K.B. hit shots, when Kari hit shots, when it's falling, it's just fun. You're
together, and it's the most cohesive time to be that team. Obviously the hard
part is when shots aren't falling. But tonight especially in the first
quarter, it was just fun to be out there and playing with these guys.  
  
CORI CLOSE: I think it's really easy to talk about the 26 points we had, but I
think the more important thing was the 7 points we held them to. I think it
really is our defense. So, we said hitting shots are a bonus. The when you get
defense and you defend and you rebound, that's really what we were most
excited about in that first quarter.  
  
Q. Early thoughts on Oregon State tomorrow night?  
CORI CLOSE: They're just really good. We have two great match-ups. Obviously,
we have confidence, and we beat them at our place, and we had a good game up
at their place. Even when we lost Jordin Canada in the second quarter, I
thought that was the start, honestly, of our role players really learning how
valuable they are and how capable they are.  
  
And I thought we actually fought really hard, won the third quarter. We were a
couple plays or a couple baskets away. But they do such a great job on the
defensive end trying to control the shot selection, trying to get you into
mid-range, low-percentage shots. It's going to be important that we hit a
couple jump shots, honestly, because we're going to need to pull them away if
we want to play to our strengths. I thought they did a really good job of
trying to play Monique up there. But the great thing about Monique is she
spends countless hours watching film and learning from her experience.  
  
You know, they had their punch, and she'll have her counterpunch, and we'll
see who learned the most.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Sophie Brunner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28348)

### [Quinn Dornstauder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30839)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
ASU - 72, Utah - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll take questions.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Thank you. Well, thank you to the Pac-12 for the
championship they're putting on and everybody here at Key Arena. Always nice
to get that first one under your belt. Obviously, with injuries this year, we
kind of had to work our way in through the play-in game.  
  
But sometimes I think it's actually a good thing. I thought our young kids
handled their first postseason game really well. Our seniors, of course,
stepped up huge. Great rebounding effort, and just kind of a great team win.
Jamie Ruden hasn't even practiced. She's been out for eight and a half weeks,
and we just kind of threw her out there because she was cleared. So we're at
full strength right now for the first time since probably November. So it's
exciting for us to just continue to build and play better basketball.  
  
Q. This was your first year having to play in the first round. What was
your message to your team to come out and play hard?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I mean, honestly, I didn't really need much of a
message. This team is incredibly driven and competitive. And while we're young
and we've had our injuries this year, I mean, we've continued to believe in
ourselves and get better.  
  
I didn't really have to have -- the seniors take care of that. Sophie, Quinn,
Kels, I mean, they help make sure these kids know you don't save anything.
It's one game at a time, and you empty out. They did a great job with that. I
think we've had so many ups and downs. I mean, we just show up every day
trying to give our best effort.  
  
Q. Utah started to climb back at the end of the first half. What
adjustments did you make to go on that 11-2 run to start off the second
half?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: The second quarter I think we just kind of let up. We
gave them backdoor cuts, we fouled offensive rebounds. It was really more
about us than them. I think we just talked at halftime, obviously, just play
position defense without fouling. Let's do what we do at ASU, and they took
that to heart. And we also stopped running in the second quarter.  
  
So I thought we got out, got our stops, got the transition game going, and
kind of controlled the game.  
  
Q. What did you feel of how Jamie Ruden played out there, because
there's been such a long layoff since she's last played, and what kind of
depth does she provide to the bench?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, she provides -- she definitely adds depth, because
we can play her and kind of swing her. We play her inside and outside. And, I
mean, really, I had no -- again, she basically did position shooting and some
half-speed defense yesterday, and that is it. So we really didn't know how.
But she's just a basketball player. She was a high school All-American. She's
very skilled, and she loves the game.  
  
You know, the thing that Jamie said was -- I said, Mentally, do you feel okay?
Do you want to try to play? Because she's gotten cheated out of two-thirds of
her season. The rule for red-shirt is 30%, and she was at 33. Then she worked
so hard and got herself back, and we didn't even expect her to be back. And
I'm like, If there's an opportunity, we're going to put you in there. And her
only comment to me was: Charli, if I can help the team, I'm ready. Which is
amazing.  
  
Q. Sophie and Quinn, you guys fought last time in a close game against
UCLA. What improvements do you need to make in order to come out on top
tomorrow?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I thought we played a good game against them last time, we
played them really tight. And most of the game we were up on them. But I think
not letting up. We let them go on a run at the end of game, so being able to
let them finish out games and finish it with key rebounds and key defensive
stops, I think those were the biggest adjustments.  
  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: Yeah, just to echo what Sophie said, I think we had a
couple of mental lapses at the end of the game that kind of put us behind. And
if we can clean some of that stuff up, I think we might have a better outcome
for ourselves.

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Lynne Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30341)

### [Malia Nawahine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32653)

### [Emily Potter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26506)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
ASU - 72, Utah - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Certainly not the game we hoped for, and the fun part of March
is there is kind of new life, new hope. Everybody kind of has visions of
advancing. We didn't play, I don't think, how we've been playing the past
couple weeks, which is disappointing.  
  
But, you know, you do have to give credit to ASU. I thought they did a nice
job. Their front line is very experienced, very physical. Their guards are
young and very good, and they just -- their culture is in place. They're good
at what they do. What I think they're best at is taking you out of what you're
trying to do, and they were effective in doing that today.  
  
So congrats to them. They did a nice job. So we'll regroup. I'm hopeful and
confident that we'll get a WNIT bid, which is great, and we can improve on
last season, even though we didn't finish as high in the regular conference
season as we did last year. We can still improve upon number of wins and just
keep moving forward. I think building a program takes time, and it's a
process. We're in the middle of that.  
  
But I'm confident in our players and what we're doing. So we'll get there.  
  
Q. Emily and Malia, the slow starts to both the third and fourth
quarter, what was going on with you guys, or was there something ASU was doing
defensively that tripped you guys up a little bit?  
MALIA NAWAHINE: I thought their pressure really kind of took us out of their
game, and I think at the end of those quarters, we got going. It kind of took
us too long, and I think they got tired, and I think that's why we did better
at the end of quarters and that's why the pressure got to us in the beginning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Emily?  
  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, I agree with what Malia said. Maybe the break at halftime
was too long. I think we came out flat in the second half, and we brought it
to six points at the half. We had that little run, and I think our momentum
halted at halftime, and they went on that run to start the third quarter, and
we couldn't recover from that.  
  
Q. Last year you guys came in here and played Cal very close in the
first game of the tournament. Did you take anything from that going into this
tournament experience?  
EMILY POTTER: I think we've been I personally didn't think about last year. I
think we were just trying to carry the momentum we've had for the last couple
weeks. I think since we played Oregon State, Washington State, and Washington,
we were playing harder and more as a team, and we just wanted to carry that
forward to this game.  
  
MALIA NAWAHINE: Yeah, I think that every game gives you experience, so last
year was close, and it kind of showed us that any team can win in this
conference. We saw that today, and we just wanted to come out and try to win
this game.  
  
Q. Emily, I know you were blocking a lot of shots, or trying to, and
obviously contesting and rebounding is tough. But what made them so tough
overall to rebound against and come down with it?  
EMILY POTTER: It's not enough to be there and be in the right position. You
need to make a conscious effort to continually push back every time on every
rebound. They're very strong and they pursue very well.  
  
Q. Coach, what was happening in the second quarter that allowed you to
outscore them and take momentum into the locker room?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I think we were just more aggressive on both ends. Kyle
mentioned it, but the start of the first quarter and the start of the third
quarter is kind of where they won the game, I feel. You know, in the fourth
quarter it was just kind of too much to make up.  
  
But I think in the second quarter we were the first quarter and third quarter
we missed some shots that were good shots. We always say we want to take good
shots, that gives you a better chance of making them. And we missed some good
shots. That just gave us a little bit -- put us in a hole.  
  
I think Malia kind of mentioned it, too, I think we started to be more
aggressive and wore them down a little bit where our pressing was effective.
And I think we stopped -- I don't know if it's nerves or youth or what, but
we're playing a little tight to start both halves.  
  
Then in the second quarter, and even in the fourth, it was just the free
throws were tough to defend there in that fourth quarter. It's hard to get a
hand up on the free throw line.  
  
But other than that, I thought we did a pretty good job, but I think we missed
some easy shots, and they converted on -- they were scoring; we weren't. Both
halves, I think first quarter we were down 14 2 or 14 4, and they went on a 9
0 run to start the third quarter. That, to me, is the game.  
  
Q. Lynne, you mentioned the free throws. They took 26, I think. What was
that chopping things up pace-wise and kind of hard to get into rhythm, or was
the game maybe a little too far gone at that point?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, I mean, I think ASU's incredibly physical and defensively
very, very good, very tough. So, you know, it's just one of those things you
can't control. You can't control how the game's called. It was frustrating,
though.  
  
Q. Emily, Lynne was just saying that pretty confident about a WNIT bid.
How are you feeling? What are you thinking about when you think about maybe
the possibility to turn one or two things from this game around and improve
upon them?  
EMILY POTTER: I'm excited for the opportunity to keep playing. Any extra games
are great games and still want to make this a really great senior season for
Paige. I'd love to get to 20 wins. So right now that's my goal, to win the
whole thing in the WNIT. Why not? If you're going to do it, you need to do it,
as one of our assistant coaches said, collectively and consistently. So that's
our mindset moving forward.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I would add on that: I think the rigors of this conference,
whether you make the NCAA Tournament or the WNIT, you're competitively ready
for whatever. It prepares you for postseason.  
  
Q. Lynne, you talked about how this is a process and it's not going to
be fast. What did you see from this season, your second with Utah, that stands
you in good stead for years to come?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: As I've always said, we are young. We have only one senior. But
we have really good kids. They're not kids, but we have good players, good
people. And, you know, I'm confident in how we're doing things.  
  
It just takes time. We've got good recruits coming in. We've got a great
nucleus returning again. I'd like to end the season on a high note on the
WNIT.  
  
But I think this was a really -- sometimes hard lessons are the most valuable
ones. I think this is a really learning year for us as players and as coaches,
just how competitive this league is and how good it is. We can look back on
two, three games that we played in conference. Whether it was in January or
early February, we didn't play to our potential at all. And those, you know,
that's why we're the 12 seed today.  
  
And that's what -- I think we can learn from that today, this season and
taking it into next, that every game matters. If you want to have a good
seeding and you want to be playing past the first game, second game in this
tournament, you've got to give yourself a good chance by winning those games
that you should win in January and February.  
  
So, like I said, not all lessons are fun ones to learn, but I think that's the
one thing that I would think the players would agree with me on that, that
that's what we learned the most and can take away from it.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Haley Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28332)

### [Ariana Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32672)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
WSU - 79, Colorado - 78  
  
JR PAYNE: I'm here supporting our team in the Pac-12 Women's Basketball
Tournament. I say this every time, and I mean it with all my heart every time,
I'm unbelievably proud of our team. I'm proud to be their coach, I'm proud to
be a Buffalo.  
  
Our kids played their hearts out. And that's who we are. We've been down in
games. We're younger than our opponents, we're smaller than our opponents, but
we never stop fighting. I don't know what else I could ask for as a coach. To
have a group of young women that play their hearts out every night and never
give up and continue to fight and continue to scarp. I'm unbelievably proud to
be a Buffalo today.  
  
Q. Coach, walk me through that final play. What were you trying to draw
up there?  
JR PAYNE: We got exactly what we wanted. We got our best finisher near the
basket with a ball and an opportunity to score the ball. We've said all year
long, Ariana makes the toughest shots of any player we've ever coached. She
doesn't always make the easy ones, but she makes the tough ones, and that was
a tough one. But it was a simple up-screen and created an overload two-on-one
on the weak side, and we got what we wanted.  
  
Q. Take me through the start of that one, went off on a 17-4 run to
start the game. Where did that intensity come from?  
JR PAYNE: We've been talking about that since we left Pullman last weekend, so
I knew we'd come out aggressive. I knew we'd be really tenacious. That was the
game plan going in, and we executed it perfectly. We just got in a tough spot
with our starting lineup all in foul trouble. That was hard to overcome.  
  
Q. Haley, you finished with 21 points tonight. What was allowing you to
get the looks that you did?  
HALEY SMITH: I think that since we had just played in Pullman last week, we
kind of knew what our looks were going to be. We were really looking to attack
from the corner and have shooter spot up. I think we executed that really
well, and we were able to attack the way we wanted to. Yeah, kind of our
spread motion was look working really well. And yeah, we were just able to
kick it out to shooters and pretty much get whatever we wanted either at the
rim or on the three-point line.  
  
Q. Do you think your season will continue after this?  
HALEY SMITH: Absolutely. I'm certainly hoping so, yeah.  
  
Q. Ari, you had a very good game today. You were very aggressive. Talk
about what was working for you so well tonight?  
ARIANA FREEMAN: Like Haley said, we just got done playing them, so we knew
attacking the baseline was going to be wide open, so I just stuck to the game
plan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Colorado.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll take questions.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Adia and her staff
and team on a really good season. I think Adia, she did an awesome job with
that group. Obviously gave us everything we could handle tonight.  
  
But I think on the whole, it's a program that is going to go places. So I
congratulate them, but really proud of our team tonight. I thought our players
showed a lot of poise. We've struggled offensively the last couple of weeks,
and tonight struggling again. But middle of that second half and through the
middle of the third quarter and through the fourth quarter I just thought
offensively we were really good. The kids executed and we made the plays that
we needed to down the stretch at both ends of the floor. These two in
particular did an awesome job.  
  
I mean, freshmen for us scored 61 of our 70 points, and that's incredible in
any setting, let alone this setting on this stage. So, anyway, really proud of
the team.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you guys were down 7 middle of the third quarter. It kind of
had that feel of recent Oregon tournament games. Obviously, you didn't know
about those. But what was it that calmed you guys down and got you to play
your best ball down the stretch and pull it out?  
SABRINA IONESCU: We just had to stay together and keep fighting. While doing
that, we knew that we'd get on a run and we'd get going. So I think that's
what we did. We just stayed together. We pressured them, and we slowed it down
offensively and got it into Ruthy. She was a beast down there, and I think
that helped us in the long run.  
  
Q. Kelly, just wanted to ask, obviously you haven't been here since
2008, but to get the program's first win since 2008 in the Pac-12 Tournament,
what's that do for you guys?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, it's a big win. Have you guys ever lost here?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: No.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: So I think for most of the team this is a new experience,
anyway, which I think is all the more remarkable that they played so well
under pressure and down the stretch. Yeah, I mean we needed this just for our
own psyches. The last couple weeks struggled a little bit. And this was a
really big win, and the way we did it will help. (Audio interruption) she's
not the tallest kid, she's not the quickest kid, she's not the most athletic,
she just knows how to play and she competes. You've got to do it by committee,
and they have a lot of other really good ones.  
  
But, you know, I just think right now we're running on a little -- we'll run
on adrenaline until we get things rolling. But at this point we'll have a game
plan for them. But the reality is you've just got to Lace them up and be
ballers, right? That's what we always talk about. Just got to be ballers and
just play.

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Mikayla Cowling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30340)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 71, USC - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, and congratulations to the Cal Bears. We've got Coach
Lindsay Gottlieb, Kristine Anigwe, and Mikayla Cowling. Again, we are
streaming this live on Facebook, so keep that in mind.  
  
Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thanks to the Pac 12, obviously. It's really an honor to be
in the conference tournament of the top women's basketball conference in the
country. So thanks for all the work everybody is doing to put this on.  
  
Always proud of our own team and to get a win. But it's hard not to think
about the other team. They have a senior named Courtney Jaco that I've just
enjoyed watching and admiring for four years. She's terrific. If this is the
end of their season, just want to shout out to her for carrying herself like
an amazing representative of the Pac 12 Conference. Great scholar athlete and
a wonderful young woman. So just kudos to USC on their season and to Courtney.  
  
Sometimes, I told the team, you see growth over long periods of time, and
we're on a journey with this team. And sometimes you see it minute to minute.
And I just thought our players understood at halftime what we had to do. They
came out in the second half and did it under a lot of duress.  
  
Kristine played like the best post player in the country. I think our guards
stepped up and didn't turn the ball over in the second half. Mikayla was a
leader, and we made the plays we needed to make against a really good team.
This is a big win for us, a quality win, and it allow us to move on in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys get Oregon State again, and you were just there on
Sunday and it didn't go as well as you'd like. But what do you take away from
that game and getting an opportunity to play against them tomorrow?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I didn't have to go up there to know they're really good.
They're the champions of the toughest conference in the country. Scott does an
incredible job. They have a great closer in Syd, they've got players making
plays.  
  
I think the benefit of having just played them is we have a really competitive
group. Anytime we lose a game, I said five minutes later, let's go run it
back, they would want to do that. We're looking forward to that opportunity.
We know we have a lot to prove in this tournament, and no better chance to do
that than against the No. 1 team in the conference. We want to make people
remember that we're here too, and that's going to be a big challenge for us,
but we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had several runs of your own, but until that final
free throw, you couldn't really put them away. Were you pleased with that? Did
you expect to maybe seal that a little earlier, or did you know they were just
going to hang around?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: You know, obviously, the turnovers were sort of an issue the
whole game. So I think we took that nine point lead, and that's maybe when
Kristine picked up her third foul, and she was pretty dominant at that point.  
  
But we knew they were going to continue to make a run. Everyone's playing for
their season. And USC's really good. Again, this is a team that's beaten the
top team in the conference. They have some great non conference wins. They had
a good year. We knew they were going to keep coming at us. I felt like we were
generally in control in the second half, but they weren't going away.  
  
No, I'm not that surprised that they came back at us. Simon made some big
shots. But I never felt like we weren't going to win it. And I thought our
guard play stepped up in the second half. Like I said, it's one of those games
where we had Kristine and they didn't. And as much as they tried, they didn't
have much of an answer when we got the ball to her.  
  
Q. Kristine, last game against USC, they did a better job holding you
down. This game they couldn't do it. What was the difference?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I just felt like my team did a good job getting me the ball.
Mikayla had seven assists. Just knowing how to get me the ball and knowing
where to get it. Kristen always does a good job being tough, pushing me out,
and I was just really trying to play against that.  
  
Everything started clicking in the second and third quarter, and we just got
that push. I feel like we had control most of the game even though it didn't
look like that on the scoreboard. We thought we were going to go home and try
to do whatever it took to stay here.  
  
Q. Mikayla, Coach talked about the guards playing well. Like at the end,
USC put on a lot of pressure. You guys had to call two timeouts, but you guys
seemed to stay calm, that's not been the case all seep long necessarily. So
what was different this time?  
MIKAYLA COWLING: We just didn't want to turn the ball over anymore. Towards
the end of the game, you have critical plays, and it's important to make sure
the ball isn't in their hands, obviously. We had to take a deep breath, calm
down. Take control of the ball. We knew that the pressure was going to come.
They were a really aggressive team. It's a matter of just fending it off and
making sure you're tight with the passes and being mentally aware that the
pressure's going to come.  
  
Q. Last year you guys had a great run here. What is it about this
tournament that brings out the best in you guys? You had a really good chance
to get to the finals last season?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I think it's the pressure knowing that you have to win or you
go home. There's no second game. If you lose, you're out. So you have to do
whatever it takes to stay here. You don't want to be the first team to leave.
So that's what we always carry. We carry that swag, I guess. And we just try
to do whatever it takes not to go home. It's really cool here. A really cool
environment and just really fun.  
  
Q. How did it feel to hit the one three pointer of the game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I want to know in their Cal USC game pool, who had Simon and
Anigwe combined to go 2 for 4 from three? Raise your hand. She wants her
percentage at 100%.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [June Daugherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23417)

### [Kayla Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32668)

### [Alexys Swedlund](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32669)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Washington State. Coach June Daugherty, Alexys
Swedlund, and Caila Hailey. Coach, an opening statement, and then we'll take
questions.  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: I know, it's just one of those regular old games. Another day
in the park. No, I was just so proud of our kids. First of all, Colorado had a
great game plan.  
  
They started out like gangbusters. You know, we were down early, and things
weren't looking too good, but we were able to turn up our defense in that
second quarter, and I think we held them to eight points. We started to get
into our running game a little bit, and that gave us some confidence. You
know, this kid to my right decided to do a highlight reel all in one quarter,
I think it was. And that was exciting.  
  
But it's -- you know, you look at the stats, and kind of scratch your head and
say, how did we win this? How did we pull it out? And, you know, being plus 18
on the glass is just glares. It just glares. That was certainly a team effort
all the way around.  
  
Caila got going. Caila Hailey got going down the stretch. She's one of our --
maybe our most veteran player right now in the program, and it's great to see
her be able to just kind of take over and put the team on her back, whether
it's the free throws at the end or the lay-ups and the stops defensively.  
  
But, again, Colorado, great game plan. Gosh, those kids are tough, and they're
a young group, too, so we give a lot of credit to JR and her crew.  
  
Q. Coach, what adjustments did you have to make after you trailed
early?  
JR PAYNE: Well, I just didn't think we were in the arena. At home a week ago
Saturday night we played the same team. We started out with a 16-0 run. It was
kind of a reverse script for us. We used a lot of -- you know, two timeouts in
that first quarter, and just reminded them that we're going to be okay.  
  
Just get back to what's been our staple all year, and that's playing some
great defense. Play as a team, play for each other. I think that was the
biggest thing is they just settled down, relaxed a little bit and said, you
know, yeah, this is the biggest stage we've been on all year, but we're going
to do it for each other.  
  
Q. Alexys and Kayla, both of you set career highs today. What were you
seeing on the offensive end that allowed you to have the night you did?  
ALEXYS SWEDLUND: Well, Kayla's a great passer, so she was seeing me, and I
think everyone saw Caila, too. She moves so well off the ball and she's really
dependable. When she sets the tone bringing the ball up the court sometimes,
we find her.  
  
KAYLA WASHINGTON: I think their trapping kind of gave us a lot of
opportunities to kind of break on them. I think that's where a lot of our
baskets came from. Just in transition, looking up the court, finding each
other on the outside, breaking, coming down, getting lay-ups. I think that's
kind of what gave us that momentum when we were down early in the first
quarter.  
  
Q. Perseverance is a word that gets used a lot in sports, but this year
a little bit more than normal. If you could just talk about the perseverance
that team has faced all years, especially with the injuries and some of the
tough losses you've had, where this kind of fits in tonight as far as
persevering?  
KAYLA WASHINGTON: I think, like you said, we went through a lot of injuries,
and we have to keep trying to find ourselves after each injury. When we lost
we Lou, we had to find ourselves. When we lost (indiscernible) we had to find
ourselves again. And then we kind of found a niche, and then we lost Chanelle,
and so then we had to go back to the drawing board and say: What do we have to
do? What do we have to fix to get back on the board.  
  
A lot of us stepped up in that area, and now we have so much confidence. I
have so much confidence in my teammates. We've grown so much. We've come so
far, and to see how we're playing now with everything we've been through, it
just shows. I mean, it goes towards our coaching and how great of coaches they
are.  
  
ALEXYS SWEDLUND: Yeah, I can piggyback off of that. Our coaches believed in
us. Win or lose, they were there the whole way. So I think the coaches really
helped us believe in us, and obviously we believed in one another, and that
really helped seal the deal.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the things you take away from tonight, and what do
you still need to work on for Stanford tomorrow?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Wow, didn't even give me half an hour to enjoy this
(laughing). Back to work. We've got to take care of the basketball. Obviously
we turned it over way too many times. I think there were times tonight where
offensively we didn't move the ball the way we wanted to move the ball coming
in as a game plan. So that's definitely an area that we can improve upon.  
  
But, you know, these kids are great, and they work so hard and they believe in
each other so much. They know that all year it's been our defense. You know,
so it's just making sure we understand the scout for Stanford, and obviously
we don't have a lot of energy to go through practice, but to get that down and
get the game plan down and go out there and continue to compete for each
other, compete for our lone senior with Eva, that's important to us.  
  
It's really important because I know you hear family and all that, but this
group is as tight of family as you'll find in women's basketball, I think,
anywhere. We just want to keep playing for Eva. That's really important for
us, as well as the rest of the kids.  
  
We also are playing for the kids who can't play this year. You know, with Cam
and Chanelle and Lou and Bobby out, they're great cheerleaders, and they've
been great leaders for us. But they're dying to play and stuff. So these guys,
you know, they're playing hard for them as well.

_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 71, USC - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the 2017 Pac 12 Conference Women's Basketball
Tournament. We are streaming live today on the Facebook Pac 12 page.  
  
Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I want to first thank our seniors. Jaco has done a
fantastic job, and really all of our seniors, all year long, all four years.  
  
Just a hard fought game for 40 minutes. Kristine was tough to stop. I thought
Cal made crucial baskets in the important moments of the game, and we couldn't
necessarily get the stops we needed.  
  
But I'm very proud of the effort that we gave for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, you slowed down Kristine quite well the first time you guys
played her. What was different this time?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Well, we missed some defensive assignments when we were
supposed to trap her, and then we allowed her to get too deep in the paint,
whereas before we were very physical with her. There were some early fouls
called that I thought made us tentative defensively against Kristine. And it
was tough to stop her once she got into an offensive rhythm.  
  
Q. Coach, you drew even in the fourth quarter with about 8 minutes to
go. What changed over that final portion that couldn't get you over the
hump?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Well, I think execution on both sides of the ball. I
thought Cal went up in intensity and focus, and I thought we couldn't match
that intensity. We tried to do some different things defensively, but once
again, we were in foul trouble, and, two, being in the crucial moments, we
couldn't necessarily get over the hump and finish shots or get defensive
stops.  
  
So hat's off to Cal. They did a great job, really stepping it up in that
fourth quarter. And, once again, I'm very proud of my seniors and my team for
how hard we fought all game long.  
  
Q. It seems like every time USC fell down, it was on you guys, the
guards, to attack and bring the team back. Was that the strategy and why were
you successful at it?  
COURTNEY JACO: Yeah, we knew we had to attack their pressure. And once we did
that and draw the help, we could pass it easily to the open player, but I
think we just didn't have that mindset for 40 minutes.  
  
MINYON MOORE: I think we had those looks, it's just the execution part of it.
We got the passes, we got the open looks, but we just couldn't finish at
certain points in the game.  
  
Q. Courtney, what do you think you'll remember most about playing for
the Trojans?  
COURTNEY JACO: There are so many memories, but definitely my teammates and my
team. Just being a part of it. Just when you get out of college basketball,
you kind of miss that camaraderie and stuff like that. My teammates this year
were really special. Some of them they'll be long time friends, so that's
going to mean the most to me.

### [LaBrittney Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30345)

### [Malena Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32679)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon - 70, Arizona - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the University of Arizona Wildcats. Coach, I will
have you make an opening statement, and then questions.  
  
ADIA BARNES: I'm just really proud of this team. This has been a great year
for us just the way that they fought the entire year and showed heart and
character and did everything I asked them the whole year. I'm really proud of
this group. You know, five seniors, their last basketball tonight until they
go play pro and do different things. But I thought it was a good fight. I
thought we had opportunities to win tonight, but we just missed a couple shots
town the stretch and didn't get shots we needed. But I thought the seniors
really led this team the entire year.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys just ran out of gas in the fourth
quarter?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, I think that we ran out of gas, and Ruthy made some really
tough shots. Made some good plays over good defense, and then offensively I
thought that some good shots we got in short corner after we moved the defense
or drove around the rim, they kind of blocked some shots or altered some shots
and they didn't go down the stretch.  
  
I think we got a little bit tired. We were in a short rotation which I felt we
had to be tonight, and a little bit softer on balls, and that was just a
little bit of fatigue. So that hurt us down the stretch. They were taking the
momentum from us slowly.  
  
Q. LaBrittney, was there a moment in that fourth quarter where it felt
like it kind of slipped away, or what was it like for you out there?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: I mean, just a little bit. They started to go on a run, and
we didn't respond well to it and they made some shots. I don't know. I don't
think it really killed us. I think we still fought the rest of the fourth
quarter, but they made some shots and we didn't knock shots down. I think
that's what happened.  
  
Q. Adia, I think you did a lot of stuff this year that surprised and
impressed people. So what can you build on and what can your young kids take
from this game and this season?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, I think that these five seniors have really helped us start
to establish a really cool culture, and a culture of learning what it takes to
win. Hard work, and learning that we have to do it collectively as a group,
and this is for them. Not only on the court but off the court. So they've
started that. And they've really stuck with me in asking everything that I've
asked them to do.  
  
As far as the little things, as far as the culture and our mentality, and I
thought that they started that. Now the young group, freshmen and sophomores,
and Julia's going to be a senior next year, so they're going to kind of hold
the torch. That's what I think they should be proud of. They've had, I think,
a tough career. It wasn't exactly as planned, but I told them everything
happens for a reason, and this year we got better. We got better off the
court, we got better on the court. I think they started to enjoy basketball
again. And it was fun to be a part of that. I'm just sad I didn't get them for
longer. But for the future, I told them they have to come back around. They
can't just disappear for years and go overseas and play, they have to come
back and give back. Mentoring the young.  
  
We're just excited. I'm sorry I only had a year with them. It's really hard
because they're great kids. I wanted this year to be special. I wanted to have
these seniors go out feeling good about what we've accomplished. Not thinking,
oh, you know, college sucked. I wanted them to feel this is great, we ended
strong, we got better, because winning's fun. It's hard when you don't win.
The I think we've started that here. It's just, it's a process, and they've
been a part of the of the process, and they never complained.  
  
I asked a lot of them, and it was very different. To have a coaching change
your senior year is very hard. They've been resilient. They've been totally
receptive to everything, and that was a pleasure to be a part of, and it was a
pleasure to go to them.  
  
Q. LaBrittney and Malena, what do you take away from your senior year,
and what do you hope the younger players use to then build on as their careers
keep going?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: From this year, I felt we grew as a team. Personally I think
I got better this year. I worked on my game all summer, and I think I was able
to see that transfer to the court this year. But as a team, I think we grew.
We got a new coach, and we used what she wanted us to do and we did it. I feel
like this is one of the best seasons I've had since I've been here. It's
probably not saying a lot because we haven't had a good season, but, hey, it's
one of the better seasons. As a player and as the group of seniors that we
grew, so I think that's all we could ask for leaving out of Arizona.  
  
MALENA WASHINGTON: I think the most important thing is the growth, which Coach
Barnes and LB has been talking about. Because since I've been here, we haven't
been at the top of the pack, we've had rough times in games, and as a team,
period, and we never gave up. We fought back. We stayed a family, and we just
worked things out. So I would say just knowing things are going to get better.  
  
LABRITTNEY JONES: And for the younger people, I think they learned a lot this
year. A lot of the younger players got a lot of experience, and I think
they'll carry that over to next year when they bring in a new class with a lot
of freshmen. I think that's going to be good for them to have the experience
they got this year.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 59, Mississippi State - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome South Carolina.  
  
Congratulations, coach. Why don't you start us off with an opening statement,
please.  
  
COACH STALEY: I just want to say it was a great atmosphere. We beat a
tremendous basketball team in Mississippi State Bulldogs. I thought it could
have gone either way.  
  
I felt like our players, when it was time to step up, stepped up in a big way,
you know, to get us this victory in an incredible atmosphere.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. A'ja, once again you played real big in defense with the defensive
rebounds down in the paint. Talk about, especially in the fourth quarter, how
was it getting down out there.  
A'JA WILSON: Just during the timeout, coach pointed at her chest, it means
heart. That's what it comes down to. Great talent on both teams. In a
championship game, it comes down to who wants it more. We came out with a lot
of heart and energy.  
  
Q. A'ja, with that fourth quarter, you're down five, what did you talk
about in the huddle? Was the game plan to get it to you?  
A'JA WILSON: I don't think that was the game plan necessarily. We just kind of
stuck to our system. We didn't really let up. We didn't really doubt
ourselves. We just made sure that we just had good support around us. We
really just came out, like I said, with a lot of heart. We knew we had to
trust the process, trust each other were the biggest things.  
  
Q. Kaela, your point total increases with each game. Tell me about how
your confidence soared from game to game.  
KAELA DAVIS: I think the stakes got a little bit higher with each game as
well. I think that's just part of it. Obviously the competition increases as
you get deeper and deeper into any tournament.  
  
You've just got to be ready to play. With Alaina out, we have to compensate
for that and fill that hole.  
  
Q. Kaela, you were down going into the fourth quarter. You hit that
three right away. Seemed like the entire momentum of the game switched. What
was your viewpoint on what happened there?  
KAELA DAVIS: I don't know. I think my biggest thing I did, I got a stupid
third foul. I just find made sure I was ready to go back in and make an
impact.  
  
Glad that turned into an eight-point swing and we could kind of get the
momentum shifted our way.  
  
Q. Both players. The crowd really got into the game in the fourth
quarter. It seemed like your defense fed off the crowd.  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah. I mean, we have amazing fans. They are real loyal out
there. You hear them roaring, our ears ringing, and it gets your blood
flowing. Gets you into defense. We give it all to them.  
  
Q. Kaela, some of these other guys have been through this before. For
you, what did it feel like to get out there on the court celebrating the
championship?  
KAELA DAVIS: It's amazing. There's really no feeling like it to know that we
faced a lot of adversity this year. To know through our conference play, we've
had to deal with a lot. We found a way to just fight through it, be better
because of it.  
  
Like I said, there's no feeling. Can't match it.  
  
Q. Did this win and the way you played recently just mark you as a team
to be reckoned with in the NCAA tournament?  
A'JA WILSON: Yeah, most definitely. I think we really showed ourselves. We
showed a good picture of what we do, how we are here at South Carolina. So,
yes, I do.  
  
Q. Kaela, seems like ever since the Missouri game, you have gotten more
confident in your game. How much does that game impact your thinking or does
it?  
KAELA DAVIS: Sure. I mean, I hate to lose. No one likes losing. I think in my
head personally, I knew I didn't want to feel that again. I shot the ball
horribly at Missouri. That was just something that, like I said, I stuck that
in the back of my head and just tried to carry it with me.  
  
Q. A'ja, if my history is right, you're only the second program to win
three SEC tournaments in a row. Tennessee has done it twice. I know part of
what you've done here is sort of historical. You've wanted to make that mark.
What does this particular accomplishment mean?  
A'JA WILSON: It means a lot, it really does. When you look at it, Tennessee
was the powerhouse of the SEC of the just to really see how Coach Staley and
her coaching staff really turned this program around, it really does mean a
lot. Just being a part of the legacy that we're going to leave when we leave
here just really means a lot.  
  
Q. A'ja, you were matched up most of the game against McCowan. That was
a battle. What happened in the fourth quarter? You seemed to get an edge?  
A'JA WILSON: That was a battle, correct. I haven't felt nothing like that in a
while.  
  
She's a great player. She really is. She kind of gave me a different look that
I haven't seen throughout the tournament. It was kind of difficult to get
around her because she's big. She's right up there with me.  
  
But my teammates keep feeding me the ball. I kind of found a way.  
  
Q. A'ja, what does it mean to you to get to win an SEC championship in
your home state of South Carolina?  
A'JA WILSON: I can't even put that into words. It means a lot. Just from the
day that I committed to South Carolina, I knew it was going to be something
special.  
  
But just the way that everything is turning out really does mean a lot. The
fact that I'm kind of home, it means -- I can't even put into words how
amazing this feeling really is.  
  
Q. You don't really have a lot of people leaving. I know you still have
a lot of the season left with the NCAA. In terms of competing in the SEC, how
do you think you can grow from here in the following season?  
KAELA DAVIS: I mean, like you said, right now we're focused on the tournament.
That's our biggest focus, getting prepared for that. Part of that is just kind
of taking the momentum of the tournament with us.  
  
But all year, this whole year we've been saying it's a process. We're trying
to figure it out, where shots are coming from, how certain things are going to
happen.  
  
I think it's all coming together at the right time. We're trying to keep that
train rolling.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, how much of a focus was it to target A'ja in the fourth
quarter, get her the ball?  
COACH STALEY: She was a target because we felt like she would be able to take
the big girl, Teaira, off the bounce. But she's big. I thought A'ja sometimes
settled for little midrange jumpers. When she was able to get inside, go off
the bounce, good things happened.  
  
We couldn't get that, we played off of that. I thought we just did a great job
in moving the ball and scoring when the play was broken. Kaela got a three. Ty
got a wide-open three. Allisha knocked down a shot. We were pretty good at
playing off of not getting our first option. A lot of times in these settings
and moving forward, people are going to take your first and second options
away. You have to be organized when those plays break down to get good shots.  
  
Q. Over the summer, the biggest thing we were happy about is the
tournament in Greenville. Now you sit here as the champions. Does this one in
particular make it any more special with the thousands of fans here to support
you and the momentum?  
COACH STALEY: I think it's only fitting. We have the best fans in the country.
They come out and support us at home and on the road. To put it in a place in
which they can drive up and come, they showed out. They created an atmosphere
like they do in our home arena, Colonial Life Arena.  
  
When you can pile the fans in here, create that experience, not only for our
team, but it looks good on TV. I think Mississippi State wouldn't mind playing
in this kind of environment versus an empty gym.  
  
Overall, I think it was a great experience by us all. Obviously we're a little
biased because they came to support our basketball team, but they do have a
really good appreciation for good basketball.  
  
Q. It's 50-49, Ty hits the three. Mississippi State doesn't score again.
Talk about how big that bucket was.  
COACH STALEY: It was huge. She had her feet under her. She knew she was going
to take the shot. It felt good to her. When she released it, she knew it was
going in.  
  
I think the momentum, the crowd got into it. It helped us gain some valuable
energy that we needed to finish the game off.  
  
Q. Dawn, having to be a little resourceful against a really good team
like that, do you think that kind of experience for your players will help
down the line in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH STALEY: Not having Alaina Coates makes you do a lot of different things.
You have to make adjustments because there's a huge void left, not just this
year, but she's been a mainstay for us for the past four years. She's been a
big part of our program.  
  
But our players are truly resilient. They want to do anything they can do to
help our team win. That's growth that's taken place over the entire year. Some
of them, it wasn't comfortable playing out of their position. Some of them
really wanted to concentrate on doing one position well.  
  
Now that they see we're in an adverse situation, they open their minds, their
skill sets, to play in other positions. We're finding that it's good
basketball for us.  
  
Q. Dawn, with all the success of the past four years, how much do you
still think about your first year at USC and the struggles that you had
early?  
COACH STALEY: I'm driven by those first few years being at South Carolina.
It's a thing that fuels me every single day. They didn't feel good. Although
winning, it does feel good, but you do have to look back on where this program
has come from and use those days, you know, to make you continue to work and
not go backwards.  
  
Just truly proud of our coaching staff, our support staff, our players, our
fans, our administrators. Everybody has been a big part of allowing us to be
successful.  
  
Q. How much do you think the way you guys have played since UConn down
the stretch here has reinforced the thought that you guys are a threat in the
NCAA tournament? Do you feel you can be out there with just about anybody?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I feel like we can be out there. I don't know if the
basketball experts feel like that. We're not one of the programs that they
talk about when it comes to competing for a national championship, nor are our
players talked about in a national spotlight.  
  
A'ja Wilson is the best player in the country. Let's just get that out there.
She is the best player in the country. If you look at her numbers when we're
playing ranked teams, I don't think any numbers compare to what she does.  
  
We're going to keep flying under the radar. We're going to keep getting
better. We are going to keep making the most of the opportunities that we
have. Wherever we're sent, we're going to continue to play and use the
experiences of playing in the SEC to our advantage.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about defensively holding a team to only four
points in the fourth quarter. They didn't even attempt a free throw in the
fourth quarter playing good defense.  
COACH STALEY: I think one of the last timeouts we had, the fourth quarter
timeout, I told our players that we need to make adjustments to the
officiating. It's not saying that they're bad or anything. If they're going to
call a certain way, we must correct what we're doing. We're going to play
proper defense.  
  
Slide over when we need to slide over, help each other out, communicate, play
with our hearts and our heads. They took that to heart. They executed out
there on the floor. They held a team that can score a lot of points in
bunches. I don't know if that's a season low, but it's got to be close to a
season low, especially with the type of players that they have.  
  
Q. Looking at some of the previous records, your last five meetings
against Mississippi State were all victories, your record against them is 9-3.
Did that previous success help going into this game or was this like the first
game?  
COACH STALEY: What took place even in I think it was January didn't enter into
our minds as far as us winning. A lot of people put a question mark on that
win with calls late down the stretch.  
  
But we knew coming into this game, it's going to be a knock-out, drag-out. We
knew they were fighting to get their program a first championship. We know
they're a very good basketball team, very seasoned. They play together and
well all season long. For the past couple years, they got a nice, experienced
group.  
  
We knew that coming into this game, we were going to have to give a 40-minute
effort, execute on both sides of the ball. We were probably going to have to
beat them at a low-scoring game because they defend well. We needed to do
certain things.  
  
I was proud of our effort. I look at the stat sheet. We were down in
rebounding the whole night. Then we end up beating them in rebounding. Kudos
to our players who barreled down and got the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 59, Mississippi State - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, we're disappointed. There's no question about it. We
feel like we played really well today for about 33 and a half minutes. I
haven't seen the timing sheet, but I think there was a timeout at 6:39 or
something like that. We may have been up 48-43. I'm not sure we scored after
that, but, it was a heck of a basketball game.  
  
We just feel like we didn't execute down the stretch. Morgan and Te both
really carried us offensively today. Really put us on our backs, made some
really, really tough shots, some good shots, and competed.  
  
That's the thing, you just want them to go out there and lay it on the line. I
thought our kids did that.  
  
South Carolina is obviously very talented. I thought we had a good plan. I
thought we executed extremely well, again, up until whatever time it was on
the clock when they had the timeout. I thought we were really good up until
that point execution-wise.  
  
At that point we didn't make good decisions, stopped throwing the ball inside.
They kind of took Mo away, switching the high-ball screen, putting a bigger
person in there. That made it a little bit of a challenge for us.  
  
Both of these kids, as the rest of the team, really put us on our back. We
played hard defensively. I'm not sure how well we played. We played pretty
hard defensively. Again, they're tough to guard. They spread you out, shoot
the three. I thought our fives did a magnificent job on A'ja.  
  
It always takes somebody else, when you take away somebody's best player,
somebody else is going to have to step up. For them today, that was Kaela
Davis. She really played extremely well.  
  
When you force South Carolina into 17 turnovers, they don't typically turn it
over very much. I think that's indicative of how hard our kids played. Again,
really, really proud of our effort. Just not good enough. One of these days
I'm going to walk off that court, and I'm not going to walk off when the
confetti comes down. I'm going to be able to stand there and enjoy it.  
  
Two tough losses two years in a row. I'll say this, then you can ask
questions: I thought the character of our team, the character of these young
ladies, was really revealed in the first five minutes of the game. When they
jumped on us 10-2, to see them respond like they did, get it back to 14-13,
really says a lot about our kids.  
  
Again, I think that shows the character of these young ladies, and I'm really
proud of them for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you talk about how going from 45-40, having the momentum,
then it almost seemed like suddenly they were on top?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: It's a game of runs. We made our run, they called a timeout,
they made their run.  
  
We had to make a run, and we didn't. That's what hurt us.  
  
Q. Morgan, you didn't score for the final four and a half minutes in the
game. What do you attribute that to?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: They make shots, they look inside. Just poor execution.  
  
Q. Teaira, you were able to contain Wilson for much of the three
quarters. Seemed like in the fourth quarter she took her game up a notch.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I made her catch it way out. With her catching it way out, she
would day a power dribble in, and counter-back to the left. She is left-
handed, and that's what hurt me.  
  
Q. Morgan, with Victoria not having a big point-production game, how
much did you feel the need to fill that void and elevate your game offensively
today?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I mean, Teaira is our leading scorer. I know pretty much she
does score for us... Everyone else, we score, but we don't score as much as
her. I'm second scorer, I can step up and get some points, too. Get people in
good positions, but...  
  
Turned the ball over too much today. I think that really hurt us a lot, so...
Have to take care of the ball. Had the most turnovers. Only had seven assists.
That's not normal for us. Normally we have more.  
  
Make shots, not turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Morgan, you know you have basketball left to play. How quickly do you
think you'll let yourselves get past this and focus on what's ahead?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I'm sure we'll get past it. I'm sure we'll watch film on this,
learn from it. After that, on to the next game. Can't dwell on this game.
There's more basketball to be played. Might see them again. We still got to
keep playing.  
  
Q. Teaira, you were visibly upset after the game. How much do you think
you can use this as motivation heading into the NCAA tournament?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: This game, we played hard, but at the end of the day when we
didn't execute, we didn't get to our spots, rebound. We're going to go back
and watch film and learn from that.  
  
Q. Teaira, in the fourth quarter, when the momentum swings back to South
Carolina's favor, what were you trying to do to regain that momentum given
what coach said about the switch defensively on Morgan, then not being able to
get the ball much inside?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: We knew when they made their run, we had to make our run. With
that being said, we needed time to regroup. Everybody couldn't get on the same
page at the end of the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. There was a point in the fourth quarter when you tried to settle
Morgan down. She was being really aggressive and needed to be aggressive, but
how much do you think that just epitomized things?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, I just think kids are trying their hardest. Those kids
really competed and wanted to win today. Morgan tried to put us on her back
there in the second half and carry us in victory. For a long time there, she
did, same thing with Teaira.  
  
When you're leading scorer is not doing well, hadn't played well now in a
while, we've been having some other kids step up. We didn't have anybody else
to step up tonight. We basically had Teaira went 6-12, Mo went 7-13. Nobody
else did anything statistically speaking.  
  
I thought we settled early in the game. That's what got us behind. I thought
we settled late.  
  
This is a big-people game. You got to play like big people. You have to go in
there like a big person, jump up, make big-time shots. You can't dodge
contact.  
  
We didn't get to the line but seven times today. That's our fault. We just
were not the aggressive team that we've been, and that's disappointing. It's
on every chalkboard every time I talk about a game plan, it is aggressiveness,
attack.  
  
You have to give South Carolina credit. Those guards take that away from you a
little bit. You let them stand out there and take you sideline to sideline,
which is what you're supposed to do. It can kind of bother you a little bit.  
  
We forced 17 turnovers today. That's hard to do against South Carolina and a
Dawn Staley-coached team. We have 14. Mo had seven of them. That's
uncharacteristic of Mo. She's just trying too much. I thought her and Tori
both, just trying way too hard.  
  
But I love 'em for that. I love 'em for the fact that they just care so deeply
about their team and their teammates and they want to win. That's what makes
them special. That's what makes them great players.  
  
Q. You referenced Tori trying to do too much or trying too hard. Is
there anything now, when you get back to campus, that you talk to her about?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, I think you get in the gym. You get in the gym, you
shoot. You got to get shots up, bottom line.  
  
I know when I'm playing golf, I'm not playing well, got to spend some time on
the range. That usually fixes it.  
  
She's got to spend time on the range. She's got to get in the gym and shoot.
We had some other kids didn't shoot well tonight either. So I think when
you've been here since Wednesday, your time is so limited to do those things,
skill sessions. You're always getting ready for the next game. It's hard.  
  
This will give us a chance. Next week they'll get two, three days off. We got
to get back, get in school. Give them a chance to kind of recoup. They'll be
fine. They'll be fine.  
  
Q. Victoria checked out of the game about six minutes in the first
quarter, which is early for her in games.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Might have been earlier than that.  
  
Q. What was the thought process? Get her going, come off the bench
later? What was your thought there?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think my thought was, I wasn't real pleased with how she was
playing defensively. I thought she had settled early for a couple shots that
we don't need to settle for. You can get those shots with 10 seconds.  
  
I was more disappointed in our transition defense, just her attention
defensively more than anything, just felt like, hey, we needed to get her
attention. We pulled her out, and we made a run. That's happened a lot this
year when I've either made a substitution, got her out, she's in foul trouble,
we've made a run.  
  
Our kids really responded. I was proud of our bench today. I thought our bench
was special, again. 19-8 in bench points. Good thing I got a bench. Would have
only had 30 points.  
  
Q. Teaira is still a pretty young player.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah.  
  
Q. Can you address how important this tournament was for her going
forward? How much confidence is she building going into the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I hope she's got a lot of confidence. She went up against the
Player of the Year today. I thought she was just fantastic with her.  
  
When you're young, it seems like your post players are the last ones to
develop, the last ones to mature. The faster she matures, the faster she's
going to develop.  
  
Tea has some really good days. When she does, man, you can just see the
potential that is within her, what she can become. That's what I coach and
live for every day with her, is to see that kid every day.  
  
Y'all saw it today. The kid can really impact a basketball game on both ends.
If she ever gets it, she's going to do this a long time.  
  
Q. Coach, with Victoria, she scores the last five of the second quarter.
You go to her right off the bat at the start of the third. You hope or think,
if you're a Mississippi State person, she's going to get going. He only scores
two points the rest of the way. Was she not involved enough offensively? Did
they take her away?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think they were there on the catch with her a lot. Ro didn't
shoot it when she felt crowded, whereas Tori sometimes will shoot it anyway.  
  
But they were there. They're chasing hard, defending. They're a good defensive
team. When they're there on the catch, then it becomes you got to go create
your shot.  
  
There toward the end of the second quarter, she caught it down there on the
right side of the baseline and attacked. That's what you got to do. When
people are running at you, you can't settle and try to make some miracle
three-pointer. You got to catch it square and attack pressure with pressure.
That's the piece that I've struggled with her with sometimes. She gets it, and
some nights is a struggle.  
  
Tonight early she didn't. She changed and got it. Then she was back to not
doing it there late, but you have to give her space. I thought we ran some
sets for her to give her space. You have to give South Carolina credit. She
gets everybody's best defender, best defensive game plan. The kid is still
averaging 18 a night in the best league in the country against the best
players in the country.  
  
She went up against some good teams here. She'll learn and grow from it, but I
have all the confidence in the world in Victoria Vivians.  
  
Q. Kentucky this year, South Carolina this year, South Carolina last
year, today. Is there a train of thought in those games, execution at critical
points, how much do you hope that streak ends at four, that you learn to
better execute in the fourth quarter?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We talked about that in the locker room after. We're going to
be in this game again, whether it's two weeks or three weeks. We've got to
learn the importance of execution down the stretch.  
  
I thought, against LSU, we executed down the stretch. With that many empty
possessions, when you score 33 points... I thought there was some great
execution that night. I thought we had great execution earlier in the year,
Iowa State, USC, on-the-road games.  
  
We've done some good stuff. We played Texas A&M at home. They made a run, cut
it to five. We executed down the stretch.  
  
It wasn't for lack of trying. We certainly will go back and look at the film
and will address the things. I think we turned down some post entries that for
whatever reason we didn't feel comfortable making. Again, you have to give
South Carolina credit. They're a really good defensive team. They are handy,
long, physical, all that. They don't go away.  
  
I'll bet you they say the same thing about my kids. We don't go away. That's
what makes a game like this a 59-49 game. It's a knock-down, drag-out,
physical basketball game.  
  
You know what, if you would have told me it was going to be 59-49, I would
have probably said, We'll have a good chance to win that number. I sure didn't
want it to be 95-88. I didn't feel like that was a good situation for us.  
  
That being said, we certainly will learn. Our kids understand the importance
of executing, though.  
  
Q. You had a great performance from your point guard. Talk about Ty
Harris for them as a freshman.  
COACH SCHAEFER: They decided they were going to let her run their offense, not
have to go against Morgan. We had Morgan over on Cuevas.  
  
Ty did a great job. Didn't she hit the big shot late? If I'm not mistaken, she
hit a big three when the clock was going down.  
  
Again, you got to have kids that want to be in the moment. I've seen her do it
on film before. That was a big shot for them. That gave them the breathing
room they needed. I thought she was really, really special. Five assists, four
turnovers, a freshman playing 35 minutes in a conference tournament
championship game, That shows you the level of confidence that Dawn has in
her.  
  
When you have a freshman point guard playing that many minutes in any game,
whether it's in November, a three-name directional school game, or the
conference championship game in March, that's pretty big.  
  
I'm sure that kid feels pretty good about herself knowing that her head coach
feels that way about her.  
  
Golly, got to see her for three more years. That's not a good thought either.
But, yeah, the kid is special. She's got a presence about her. You want point
guards to have a presence. Your great players have a presence about them.
Certainly she's got that. Functioned very well today in the moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

### [Mikiah Herbert

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 89, Kentucky - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome South Carolina.  
  
Coach, if you could start out by giving us an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH STALEY: We're happy to be back in the SEC tournament finals after
playing a tough Kentucky team that took it to the wire. It was great to have
Alaina Coates back even for a few minutes, but she will be out for the rest of
the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A'ja, I want to talk about some of the defensive plays you made out
there. You were in the paint, pressuring, had a lot of good blocks. Tell me,
what was going on with the game plan.  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, the game plan is really just stopping the ball from
getting in the basket. I just try my best to be as many places as I can. Coach
kind of says my defense sucks, but I try to show her that it doesn't suck. I'm
not out there stealing a ball, but I'll get a hand on the ball when the shot
goes up.  
  
That's the game plan. We take it all in. The guards trust us we can send a
defender into the post and handle business.  
  
Q. You were up 14, then the lead was down to two. What wasn't happening
or what was Kentucky doing well during that run?  
A'JA WILSON: I just feel like basketball is a game of runs. Kentucky had their
run. We was kind of slacking on the defensive end. On offense, the shots
weren't going in. I think once we got back on track, back into the system, we
started to see South Carolina basketball. That's when we started to take over
the game.  
  
Q. A'ja, it looked in the fourth quarter when Kentucky made that run
that you turned the intensity up about five levels, wanted the ball. What were
you thinking at that point?  
A'JA WILSON: I was just thinking we got to win this ballgame. We weren't going
to leave it till the game as won. I just take it all in, whether that's
scheming at my teammates, at the and-one. Just keeping everybody uplifting.
That was my main goal, my mindset.  
  
Q. A'ja, can you explain a little bit how defenses focus on you when
Alaina is in the game and when she's not in the game, the differences that you
face.  
A'JA WILSON: I think now with Lai being out, it is difficult. Everyone is
sending two or three. When Lai is in the game, they might just send two.  
  
I mean, it feels the same out there, it really does. It's just now I can't
really lob it up unless Kiki is in. The defense does feel the same. I don't
really feel a difference in it.  
  
Q. Kiki, that first half you didn't miss. How good were you feeling out
there in the first half, being in the flow of everything?  
MIKIAH HERBERT HARRIGAN: It felt great. I mean, I was confident. That's pretty
much it. I was just confident out there. It felt great.  
  
Q. Is this the closest it's felt to a home court, being away from
Columbia?  
A'JA WILSON: Yes, most definitely. I remember playing defense one time, my
ears were ringing. Gamecock fans are here.  
  
It is a great feeling to see everybody head up here to Greenville and just
support us.  
  
Q. A'ja, if the starting lineup is the same tomorrow, especially with
Alaina out, you'll be the only one of the starters that played in an SEC final
before, is there anything special you'll tell the rest of your teammates about
that experience?  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, it's really nothing much I can tell them. They have a
great understanding of what we do here at South Carolina, that's win the SEC
championship. I think we're all going to take that in. I think we're going to
go out there really confident, no matter who we play, execute the game plan.  
  
It's nothing really much you can say at that point.  
  
Q. A'ja, another kind of classic USC-Kentucky battle. How great is it
not to have to face Makayla Epps any more?  
A'JA WILSON: Definitely going to miss Makayla. The rivalry will continue on,
whether there's Makayla or no Makayla. I will miss it, but it's still
continued.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, with Alaina, how comfortable did you feel putting her back in?
Any update?  
COACH STALEY: She just reaggravated. For a player that really hasn't been
injured, I think psychologically every time she feels a little bit of pain, it
sets her back two steps.  
  
We're going to just allow her to know that she's not going to play, get
herself ready for the NCAA tournament. She will be back for the NCAA
tournament. We're just going to prep the players that are able-bodied to get
ready to win another SEC tournament championship.  
  
Q. Coach, I know I talked about this yesterday, asking you being here in
Greenville, how it played. Today being a little different, having the stands
completely full, nothing but Gamecock fans. Did the crowd play a big part in
the momentum building, whether on the bench or out in the court that you
noticed?  
COACH STALEY: Truly, it created a home-court advantage for us. The way our
fans came out and showed up in the stands, we heard them every step of the
way. Whether we were up, whether we were down, whether Kentucky was making a
run, it really energized us. It felt familiar to us.  
  
When you have a backing like we have a backing, that wills you to a win, it's
an incredible feeling. My hat goes off to Gamecock Nation. I hope we can bring
more people to fill this place up to win another SEC tournament championship.  
  
Q. Dawn, how good was it to see Kiki's play, especially in the first
half? How have you seen her confidence grown maybe more in the past couple of
games?  
COACH STALEY: It's always a proud moment when you can see a player who had
their ups and downs throughout the season, then you think they shut it down.
But weeks ago, Kiki made a decision to give an extra effort, whether that's
staying a little bit later with our strength and conditioning coach, getting
shots up with our coaches, coming in and getting extra film sessions.  
  
When those things are taking place, she's taking a vested interest in her
career. It's going to go a long way because she's now having success. She sees
what it feels like when you give a little bit extra.  
  
When you give to this game, it becomes a gift that keeps on giving. Truly
happy for her. She's got to continue to play at that level in order for us to
continue to have the success that we're having.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting off to a great start, taking control of
the game early?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, we were really excited to get out here and play, once
again. We got behind. The crowd was really loud and proud. When it's that type
of atmosphere, your team can find the energy to get up and down the floor.  
  
We got to find a way to sustain that, not allow teams to get back in the game,
take things out of our control.  
  
Q. What was Kentucky doing well? What weren't you doing well when they
made that run to cut it to two?  
COACH STALEY: Kentucky kept beating us to loose balls, hustle plays, getting
out in transition, forcing the issue, like they normally do. For us, I thought
we got a little bit stagnant. We were taking a little bit unexpected shots. We
weren't putting them back on their heels, doing the things we did in the
beginning of the game.  
  
I thought when they came back, it got our attention. I think we focused in on
rebounding the ball a little bit, coming up with some 50/50 balls, converted
them to easy buckets.  
  
Q. This is where you wanted to be now. What would winning another SEC
title mean to you? What are you playing for tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: We're playing for our history, University of South Carolina's
history. This is a place in which, if you have the talent to get here again,
you got the team that can win it, why not?  
  
I think it's an opportunity for us to continue to solidify us being one of the
best teams in this conference. We couldn't be that without having the
competition. I think we have the best conference in the country.  
  
When you're able to get that exposure, it allows you to do some things that
you haven't done in the history of your program, whether that's here or
Mississippi State or Texas A&M. They've won an SEC tournament championship
before.  
  
When you play against stiff competition like we have in our league, you can
make history. We want to continue to make history with our program.  
  
Q. Whether it's the situation with A'ja, the situation with Kiki
stepping up, how much have these injuries taught you about how flexible your
lineup can be, led you to put some people in position you wouldn't have?  
COACH STALEY: Again, I mean, we're a resilient group. It's led by our coaching
staff. We don't fret who we don't have. We have to continue to move forward
with who we have available to us. It doesn't mean that we don't care and love
the injured ones.  
  
But when it's such a quick turnaround, you got to prepare the ones that are
ready. Our players really respond to that. They get themselves in the mindset
of, Hey, maybe I'm going to get in today. Even player one, we're down to ten
players at this point, I believe. We're down to ten. Everybody thinks they're
going to play. It's added focus on their part.  
  
We've had great practices, shooting rounds, film sessions. They all want to
win.  
  
Q. Coach, Ty Harris played a lot on Makayla, Kiki was on Evelyn down
low. How much confidence do you have in those two freshmen defensively?  
COACH STALEY: We're real confident. We don't have a choice at this point. We
got to play them.  
  
I think these are good learning experiences because although Makayla Epps is
leaving us, there's going to be another Makayla Epps in our league. The fact
that Ty and Kiki can get these experiences as freshmen, it's only going to
help our program, help them gain some valuable experience.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, Texas A&M - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, if you could start off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, another record today, giving God the glory for number
29. It's amazing, amazing group of young ladies I've been given the privilege
to coach.  
  
I thought we played extremely well tonight. Texas A&M has given us -- we've
had two knock down, drag outs with them. I'm sure games in three days was
difficult for them, especially with depth issues.  
  
Our kids played hard. I thought we came out with a lot of intensity. We came
out, executed offensively. I thought we were interested defensively, which is
always something I can tell in the first five minutes.  
  
Really locked into trying to keep them from doing what they wanted to do. But,
boy, we made some shots. Dominique made shots. Morgan made shots. Morgan has,
like, 33 points, 12 assists in the last two ball games, no turnovers, which I
absolutely love. Scoot over here next to me (laughter).  
  
Really, I thought our execution the first half was what really relaxed us. We
made some shots, got a little bit of a lead after a quarter, just kind of kept
it from there.  
  
Second half, we talked about it at halftime, Texas A&M is probably the best
second-half team in the country. They've come back from more deficits than
anybody in the country. We talked about coming out of the locker room, really
kind of stepping our foot out there and putting it on 'em, not letting 'em up.
I thought we did that.  
  
I thought our kids really came out with a focus and intensity, did a really,
really good job in, again, making shots. Really loosens everybody up. I
thought defensively, again, we were really good.  
  
Proud of our kids. I've said this before, playing Coach Blair, that's not a
comfortable game for me. It's very different. We were together for 15 years.
For us to be in a competitive setting like that, it's very unusual to be on
opposite ends. It's still not very comfortable for me.  
  
So much respect for him and his staff, those kids. Curtyce Knox is a warrior,
fifth-year senior. I helped recruit her. They're going be tough out in the
NCAA tournament.  
  
But proud of our kids.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Dominique, looked like you were aggressive from the very beginning.
What was your mindset to try to be assertive on the offensive end?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Before the game started, coach just told me to get to my
spots. In the previous two games, I got to my spots any time I wanted. It was
all about getting to my spots, knocking down shots, just getting where I
wanted.  
  
Q. Dominique, coach talked a lot about you were out-hustled at times
over the last three games. How tired were you of hearing that game after game
for the past three?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Very tired, because that's not a typical Mississippi
State basketball team. That's not how we are defined. It's frustrating to know
that people were having more heart than us. It was just time for us to fix it.  
  
Q. Dominique, I know you look at that game, you led the team in scoring,
but every category, you had seemingly a different leader. A full-team
performance. Is there something that maybe led to that, having all that heart
you played with?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I don't think anything led to it. On any given night, I
think anybody can contribute.  
  
We have so many weapons on our team, it's hard to stop us. Someone steps up a
different night every time. There's no one you can key on.  
  
Q. Morgan, your recent play, what's been your mindset in terms of
looking for your shots? I even heard you move somebody vocally in the
halfcourt.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Being a leader, that vocal leader, I haven't been doing.
Directing people where to go when the play is messed up, it's my
responsibility. Got to make sure we have somebody in a good position each
position.  
  
When I'm able to knock down shots, I'm able to attack and give my teammates
open looks. I'm another scorer on the confident, just been confident.  
  
Q. Morgan, how excited are you to face South Carolina tomorrow, given
last year's result here, and that classic, hard-fought game in Columbia
earlier this year?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: It's exciting. Another opportunity to play against South
Carolina again. They're champions from last year. Of course, we want to beat
them. We just got to come out there and play the way we've been playing. Can't
get excited. Just have to keep playing how we've been playing. It's been
successful.  
  
Q. Dominique, what are your memories of that last game? It was one of
the best games in the season. Went down to the wire. What do you think you
have to do maybe a little bit differently tomorrow against South Carolina?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: It was a really great game. It was hard-fought. I think
we did some really great things in the game late. Some of the shooters got
over. Alisha Gray, she hit a couple shots late.  
  
I think we maintained their post players for some of the game. A'ja Wilson,
she got her usual numbers. I think we stuck with the game plan. At the end of
the game, we had every opportunity to win the game, so...  
  
I think we go into tomorrow with confidence. We know that we can play with
them and we can win.  
  
Q. For both players, more games and more wins to come this season, but
the significance of the 29th and setting another record for one of the seniors
at least adding to your collective accomplishments, just your thoughts about
the record tonight?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: No. Dom got it.  
  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: It's just another accomplishment for the season. It's a
team that I will never forget. Just an amazing team. It's just amazing to be
on a team that's so good. It's just another accomplishment.  
  
But we have so much more to get. We just got to keep keeping on.  
  
Q. Dominique, as a senior, you've had the opportunity to see this team
grow over the course of your career. What has been the key to getting to this
point where you're one game away from winning the school's first SEC
tournament?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: The key has been just buying in. This year, a lot more
players are getting in the gym. That's one key we missed from last year,
consistency with our shooting. I think a lot of players are just buying into
what Coach Schaefer has been preaching this whole time. I think that's the
key. Players got to buy into what he's preaching.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Vic, having seven turnovers against Texas A &M is really tough. To
have that kind of performance, how important is that going to be for you guys
going forward, both tomorrow and in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SCHAEFER: This has been one of my better teams that I've ever been
associated with with taking care of the ball. I think that's attributed to us
getting more shots. As Dom said, we're making more shots. It's helpful when
you have a point guard that's taking care of the ball. It starts with her.  
  
In our offense, sometimes we have a lot of people that handle the ball. That
lends itself to turning over the ball sometimes. We've been harping on take
care of the ball, get a good shot.  
  
It starts with Morgan and Jazzmun, our two point guards. Last night Dominique
had seven assists. Tonight she had two, no turnovers, so...  
  
It's very important. It's going to be really big tomorrow. That's where we
lost the ballgame last year. We lost the ballgame about three minutes to go in
the second quarter. We turned it over. It was a layup fest. We got down 9 or
11 at half. It was all off of their intensity defensively and our lack of
ability to handle the ball and get something good offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked before about Dominique's role on the offense,
when she's aggressive and scoring. Her performance and Morgan's performance
both were very aggressive from the start. How did you see them come out
attacking?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, I think when those two are making shots... When Morgan
is scoring for us, her and Dom add another dimension to us offensively. This
is two nights in a row, Tori goes four for 14, had 10. We still were able to
do what we wanted to do.  
  
Let me tell you something about Tori tonight. She was a rock defensively. She
was in stance, in help. She did a great job. We talked today about what we
needed to do to try to take away some of their inside presence. It had to do
with our help side.  
  
Tori was in a spot a lot. So even though she may not have shot it well, she
was really big defensively for us tonight, not only guarding, but also in help
side.  
  
I've said this all year, when Dominique gets 12, 14 a night, we're a different
animal. You're not going to beat us. I'm going to say, it's hard to beat us
when Dominique gets 12 or 14, and you got Victoria on the other wing. Morgan's
getting her 14 she got tonight or 12. It's just hard to beat us typically.
We're typically pretty interested defensively. We're going to do a pretty good
job there.  
  
Again, I was really proud of just our intensity and our interest tonight on
both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Vic, the kind of hard-fought game that you played in Columbia earlier
this year might have really dented and damaged some teams. It obviously didn't
for you guys. How much do you think that will help heading into tomorrow?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, I think you walk out of that building knowing that it
was one play. You did it in front of 14,000 screaming people. Might have a few
more fans tomorrow, by the way, than I had over there.  
  
Really, I walked out of that building with a bunch of confidence. I mean, we
missed a layup with 30 something seconds to go up one. We've got the ball, 17
seconds. We've got an out-of-bounds play.  
  
We had our chances, bottom line. We had our chances to win a ballgame.  
  
You walk out of that building with a lot of confidence. I think that's how we
did from there. We didn't walk out hanging our head, We just lost the
championship.  
  
We walked out of there going, We're pretty good. They're still going to have
to play a bunch of games. See how the chips fall. They fell and gave us our
chance.  
  
We have another opportunity tomorrow. When we started the year, there were
seven championships for us to win. We won the first three. The fourth one we
were eliminated from. This is the fifth one. Here we are.  
  
I'm sure our kids are going to be excited. I'm going to be excited. But,
again, we'll have to do it on their home court. But we've got experience there
so, it won't be anything we're not used to.  
  
Q. Tonight seemed like it was a full-team performance. Like Dominique
said, a little bit more heart than the previous few games. Did you see that
from your vantage opponent? What went into that, if you did?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, the film doesn't lie. We spent a lot of time looking at
film the last few days. I think what our kids have found is that when you're
looking at film, coach says this, he's right, there it is.  
  
For our kids, there's a sense of pride. Again, I think our kids see the
investment that is in our program in a number of ways. When you got all those
fans out there that have traveled this far and spent money to be here, I'll
tell you what, I know for me personally, I don't want to let them down.  
  
I think our kids appreciate that. When you go to Mississippi to play, half the
arena is full of maroon and the other half is empty, that's what you love.  
  
I think our kids understand that and appreciate that. We stubbed our toe
against two really good teams, okay? They bounced back. That's what I expected
them to do.  
  
Q. Victoria looked to be more aggressive offensively in terms of looking
for her shot. Driving to the basket a little bit more. What can you try to do
to maybe get her off, so to speak, get her feeling in the rhythm, get her feet
set so she's really comfortable?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We're going to keep giving her the ball. She took good shots
tonight. She may have taken one we may not have wanted to take because it was
quick. She can get that shot anytime she wants it in the shot clock. She
missed a driving layup. Instead of four for 14, she should have been five for
14.  
  
Tori is a confident kid. I'm going to go to bed tonight confident she's going
to wake up tomorrow and have a heck of a game tomorrow night because that's
the kid I know.  
  
I just think in the moment, she's going to embrace that opportunity. I've seen
it too many times. Tori will be fine. Again, when other people are scoring, it
helps our team, but it might even affect her focus a little bit knowing she's
got some help. That's a good thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you.

## March 4, 2017

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Makayla Epps](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30337)

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 89, Kentucky - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Kentucky.  
  
Coach, if you could start with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're disappointed with the result tonight. We really
wanted to win, wanted to play in the championship game tomorrow. But I'm not
disappointed in our team's effort. They really fought, battled hard. We were
shorthanded today.  
  
We had a tough, tough ending to last night's game. Woke up this morning, found
out Taylor wasn't going to play, had to make some adjustments.  
  
Just so proud of our team for fighting hard. We didn't execute the way we
wanted to, but we sure battled. I can't say enough about these two seniors. I
love them. They came to play today. They gave a championship effort.  
  
We will build from this one, get ready for the NCAA tournament. I think we're
going to be a very good tournament team. We're excited about that opportunity.
Wish we were playing for the championship here, but can't say enough about our
players' effort tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Makayla, when you made that run, got within two points, what was
going right for you? What happened to kind of thwart that run?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: What I will say that was going right for us, we just had an
attack mentality from the beginning. Evelyn, myself, Maci, McKenzie, everybody
who checked into the game for Kentucky had an attack mentality. I showed. We
almost took 20 more shots than they did. We was obviously on the attack,
hunting shots.  
  
Just down the stretch, got a couple foul calls, a couple free throws we didn't
execute as well, missed a couple shots, couldn't get the rebound, so...  
  
Q. What can you say about this team's heart? You're down by 14. It looks
like it could really go bad for you. You fight and battle back, play with so
much heart.  
EVELYN AKHATOR: I would say we can do anything we put our mind into. I mean,
we have good guards, good post players. We play together. We all love each
other.  
  
I would say whenever we put our heart into something, hustle, it's really
going to happen.  
  
MAKAYLA EPPS: They had us down 14 in the third with eight minutes to go. We
were down 14 at their house at halftime. They came back and had a big third
quarter like we did today.  
  
I feel like every position or situation we get in with every team, it's
nothing new to us. We've been there before. Us being down 14, we've been there
before. You could tell our team wanted to win today so we could play tomorrow.  
  
Everybody showed fight. We got scrappy after some loose balls. People laid
their body on the charge. Evelyn had some great and-one plays down the
stretch. I feel like this team never gave up.  
  
Q. Makayla, coach touched about you being a difficult tournament team.
How will this help you when we get to NCAA tournament time?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: We got to keep the momentum going. They're one of the top teams
in the country, a top team in our conference. If we're hanging in there neck-
and-neck with them down the wire, that's saying what we're capable of doing.  
  
We're going to get back to it, focus on Kentucky, what we do best, what makes
us our best. I'm sure coach got us a really good plan coming up. Regardless of
where they put us in the tournament or who we got to face, I'm confident in my
team and our abilities.  
  
Q. It looks more and more likely like you'll be able to host the first
two rounds. What does it mean to get back home, that you might earn those
seats?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Like I said, playing at home, it's a big home-court advantage,
especially with all the Kentucky fans that will pack Memorial if that does
happen. Evelyn and I had a memorable Senior Night. The opportunity to play in
Memorial again is something we're looking forward to, if the opportunity comes
our way.  
  
Q. Makayla, what do you remember most about all these battles with South
Carolina over the years?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Just the Kentucky versus South Carolina game hype is real. It's
not like -- you know you're going to get a battle, regardless of what the
score is, who is up, who is down. The team that's down is always going to
fight till the end. The team that's up is going to fight like they're down.  
  
Like I said, the hype is real surrounding the two teams. I've played them line
11 times, probably more than anybody else in the conference. My respect to
'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Matthew, are you confident Taylor will be able to be back come NCAA
tournament time?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it's at little over 24 hours since the injury occurred.
She's in the concussion protocol. We've had them last for a long time, and
we've had them going back within a week or so.  
  
We'll be praying for the shorter period of time. It looks promising right now.
We're very optimistic as you can be in these situations. She's a really tough
kid, real honest kid. She'll let us know how she's doing. You'll know where
she stands with that. She'll communicate well with us.  
  
We'll figure it out. But, you know, I think it's a couple weeks until we play
again. I would be hopeful, optimistic that we'd have her for the NCAA
tournament.  
  
Can't hold me to that. I'm just giving what my hopes are.  
  
Q. What do you know about Jaida Roper's injury?  
COACH MITCHELL: Under evaluation. That was the fourth quarter. She's under
evaluation. Hit her head. It will be a concussion check. We'll check for a
concussion.  
  
I shouldn't say that either. She's under evaluation is what I was told. Almost
went to medical school, but I didn't quite get in.  
  
Q. When they went up by 14, looked like everything was getting ready to
go south, you sort of were able to make a run, come back in it. What do you
think went well during that period?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we tried to get strengthened and encouraged this morning
before we came over here to practice. I just went in the room, told them,
Listen, it was not a fatal blow losing Taylor, it was a punch in the gut. When
you get punched in the gut, it hurts real bad, but you got to find a way to
straighten up and grit your teeth. We had a lot of positives going for us.  
  
Everybody that was available today has been in a game and has made something
happen in some game. We could not worry about things that we couldn't control.  
  
It was a terrible thing that happened with Taylor yesterday. Wished we had her
today, but we didn't. I think the players, to their credit... The only thing I
asked of them today was a positive attitude at all times, never hang your
head. That's a really, really talented, powerful, physical team. If you hang
your head, you can get your head handed to you.  
  
The only thing I asked out of them, before we started talking strategy, was to
have a very positive attitude, an attitude of strength, encouragement of each
other. I told the coaches we needed to do the same thing. I was talking to
myself more than anybody.  
  
I think that's probably what we did well. We always felt like we could get
shots. We always felt like we could execute and get some shots. So you just
kept telling them, Just hang in there, hang around, it's going to pop open for
you at some point. You can get it done.  
  
The kids stayed really strong mentally today. That's one of the benefits we
can take out of the game. You have to do that tournament time. It's a really,
really stressful, difficult time. You can let your emotions get ahold of you
and send you in the wrong direction. We didn't let that happen today. I was
proud of our team for that. That was real growth, real toughness from them.  
  
Q. Matthew, the game tonight was fairly similar to the one you played in
Columbia less than a week ago. You made a run on them, came close. Did you
think this time, because of what you learned in Columbia, when you saw them
back on their heels, This is our shot, we're going to be able to complete
this?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought the players were communicating in the huddle. Coach,
we can get them, win this game.  
  
I kept telling them, you know, we weren't making anything up. We were right
there. We were a possession or two away. I thought the team had great
confidence.  
  
We needed a couple shots to fall that were really great shots that we executed
well down the stretch when it was a one-possession game. We really did some
nice things that created open shots.  
  
I just hate they didn't go. I'm proud of our team for executing. We were a
confident bunch, fired up. Everybody wanted to win. Just proud of how they
competed.  
  
Q. Your seniors combined for 55 points today. Maybe elaborate on them,
what you saw out of Evelyn and Makayla today.  
COACH MITCHELL: If you think back to last April, it was so much negativity
swirling, never inside the building, always outside the building. We were
under attack really. It was incredible. It was a very, very stressful,
difficult time.  
  
Different things were floating around about them, you know, maybe leaving
them, getting out, people coming in saying that was a sinking ship there.  
  
Those two stepped up into the gap, just said, We're not going anywhere. This
is a great place. It's impacted my life in a positive way.  
  
You're sitting there with six scholarship players in April, and you don't know
the way forward, you don't know what's going on. If you don't have some
character to you, you can bailout and go. Those two didn't. It's just
critical.  
  
I'm so grateful for them. I'm grateful for all the kids. Then the six that
joined up with us, I said this many times, it's a beautiful group of kids, a
high-character group of kids. They really care about each other.  
  
I think they do, because these two have a special bond at seniors. They knew
we needed it from them tonight. They rose to the occasion. So I love 'em as
people. They both have just shown tremendous character. They've both given of
themselves this season. I just can't wait to get in the NCAA tournament, do
something special with them.  
  
They've really done a lot for us. So proud of those seniors. Proud of our
entire team. They're a special group of young women.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Curtyce Knox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32730)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State - 66, Texas A&M - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Texas A&M.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH BLAIR: The two best teams are going to play for the championship
tomorrow. That's good for the SEC. We had a great run through the tournament,
a great run, particularly after coming off four tough losses to finish the
season.  
  
I think we've got our mojo back. I think we executed very well during the
tournament. Again, we got off to another slow start. Couldn't hit the inside
shots early. When that happens, you just lose your confidence.  
  
I thought Mississippi State played great. Sometimes when you play the third
day straight, the last game every night, it just wears on your team and your
coaches and the whole nine yards. That's not an excuse.  
  
We were practically ready to play. We played Mississippi State so close two
times. We thought we should be 1-1 against them before we came into this game,
but we didn't do it.  
  
They are a better team right now. Our job is to raise our bar and to get up to
their level. They're trying to raise their bar and get up to South Carolina's
level. They'll have that opportunity tomorrow. They'll have a good chance
because Coates won't be playing for South Carolina. They'll have a good
chance.  
  
But proud of this team. One stat that is remarkable, since we've been in the
Big 12 and the SEC, we've gone to 11 out of 13 semifinals, finals, or we won
it. That's very, very hard to do. 11 out of 13. We've been playing on
Saturday, Sunday for the championships.  
  
One of the biggest keys of the ballgame, here is a stat I don't think I've
ever competed against a team that had all five starters without a turnover.
Not a single turnover. That's a credit to their ball handling.  
  
He's running the same weave offense that we used to run. I don't have quite
the personnel to run that offense. He's running more of a four-player weave
offense, and that's very good. His kids are good with the ball.  
  
I just thought when we missed the shots early, we couldn't get back into it
before half.  
  
Open it up to my young ladies, Anriel Howard, who had one heck of a
tournament. And Curtyce Knox, she just broke the SEC record for assists in a
single season. Congratulations to her. We could have finished a few more
shots, she really could have broke it. I'm proud she got it done even before
the NCAA tournament. Hopefully she can stretch it out there far enough where
nobody can touch it for a few years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Anriel, do you sort of go along with what Coach Blair said as far as
your feeling about your run here at the SEC tournament?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Yes, most definitely. I mean, we played our hearts out the
first two games. I mean, we did really good defensively and offensively in the
first two games.  
  
Tonight, we just couldn't give it all 40 minutes. But I'm really proud of my
teammates and the coaching staff for fighting as hard as we did for this
tournament.  
  
Q. Curtyce, I know it's a five-letter word, but kind of a four-letter
word, tired. You are talking about six players playing three days in a row.
How tired are your legs right now? How much are you looking forward to being
able to slow down a little bit over the next two weeks?  
CURTYCE KNOX: I think these few days off that we're going to have is really
going to help my body with recovery.  
  
I just don't like being tired as an excuse. Looking at my teammates, I know I
have to be on the floor for them, try to fight for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Anriel, you're known for your rebounding skills. When you look at a
stat sheet, realize Missouri only got three offensive rebounds yesterday,
scored five points off of those, Mississippi State gets 15 and scores 21, you
can buy into that and realize how important second-chance points off of
offensive rebounds are?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Definitely. Coach Starkey told us that stat coming in the game
that Missouri only had three offensive rebounds. Tonight wasn't going to be
like that. We all had to box out as a team. We fell short of that.  
  
Q. Gary, your thoughts on the difference in the offensive rebounds?  
COACH BLAIR: It's effort. When you run a weave offense, we're playing a
matchup zone against it, they're rebounding from outside more than they're
just rebounding from the post position. They share the ball. When they do miss
shots, the ball is bouncing over my post players. That's where the guards have
to help us out with defensive rebounds. That did not happen today.  
  
When they're out there shooting 16 threes on 10 misses, I'd say they probably
got at least half of those misses off of the threes. They made all the hustle
plays.  
  
Last night, we made all the hustle plays. That's what comes with three games
in three nights. We'll never have to do that in the NCAA tournament. You
always have a day off.  
  
This was just tough. But, hey, we're finding a way to do it. Being tired...
She had a year and a half-year-old with her all last night, too, in her room.
You can get tired that way, too. Mama has done a pretty good job. The rest of
us, we don't have excuses. Anriel and I, we had a good night's sleep.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Exactly (laughter).  
  
Q. Curtyce, speaking of the assists, y'all aren't about personal
records, but did you ever imagine you're going to finish this season with over
300 assists? Did you believe you would have the ability to do something like
that?  
CURTYCE KNOX: No, not going into this season. Assists wasn't a really big
thing that was on my mind.  
  
I give all the credit to my teammates. I got two great shooters on the wing,
Anriel at the high post, Khaalia. I give them all the credit because they
finished the shots.  
  
COACH BLAIR: We got one thing, if you remember in 2011, we got beat three
straight times by Baylor. We got the opportunity to play them the fourth time.  
  
I would love to play Mississippi State the fourth time because that means
we're in the Sweet 16 or the Elite 8, okay? That would be fine.  
  
We relish the opportunity to just keep playing. Gosh, we were just hoping for
the NCAA tournament. Now all of a sudden, we were hoping for a top four seed.
We're going to be a six seed. We will be a six.  
  
I'm hoping that Auburn gets in as the 18 because I think they very much
deserve it because they played the schedule. There's some other teams that are
playing their way in, like Purdue just played their way in, playing for the
championship tomorrow.  
  
We still have a chance to host. I'm pulling for Stanford to be a three and for
us to be a six. This would sort of be like when Florida had to come to Texas
A&M because of the Rod Stewart concert in 1994. They beat Florida that year,
too. That's what we got to hope. But look, good tournament. Everybody behind
the curtains watching and listening, good tournament. Glad you're behind the
tournament. If you show up over at my hotel, I'll buy you one cold beer, but I
said just one if you're back there behind the curtain.  
  
Thank y'all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Joni Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30359)

### [Pachis Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32637)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 72, Georgia -48  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Georgia.  
  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Let's give South Carolina a lot of credit. They were better than
we were today. We knew we had a tall task in front of us. They're the No. 1
seed for a reason. They showed it today.  
  
We didn't come out and do what we needed to do. I think we missed some easy
shots offensively that we normally make. We let that affect how we played on
the defensive end of the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Pachis.  
  
Q. What did they do, especially in the first quarter, second quarter, to
get you guys out of your rhythm?  
PACHIS ROBERTS: They played man defense. They kind of split us up, made us
rush our shots. That's pretty much what we do. Being the No. 1 team in our
conference, being a top team in the country, it was hard to get back from
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. In the first game you played with them in Columbia, you were able to
change the pace of the rhythm. They were without A'ja in that game. What
prevented that from happening today?  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, we made shots. I think that's the difference. I think that
we have some players who can pull Alaina away from the basket, pull A'ja away
from the basket. In the first game we did that. We made shots. That's the
difference.  
  
Those two games prior and today, we didn't make those same shots. We had some
good looks. They didn't go down. Give South Carolina credit for that, as well.  
  
The difference is us offensively.  
  
Q. You're obviously in one of the toughest conferences in the country.
What do you think your post-season chances are now waiting?  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, I mean, obviously after yesterday, you feel pretty good. I
think we should have had a better showing today. I don't really worry about
that. We have to control what we can control.  
  
We didn't give a good showing today like we should have. They're on the
committee for a good reason. They make those decisions. We try to control the
things that we can control.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Doniyah Cliney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32681)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina - 72, Georgia - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome South Carolina.  
  
Coach, if you would start us off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH STALEY: I thought we came out the gates ready to rock and roll, pushing
the pace, not allowing Georgia to play at the pace that they had been
successful playing against us.  
  
I thought we took advantage of the space that was left by Alaina Coates not
being able to play today. But we look forward to having her hopefully
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A'ja, with Alaina not being here, how much did you take it on
yourself to supply that boost and get to the free-throw line?  
A'JA WILSON: It's hard filling in the spaces for her. She contribute as lot
for this team. I give it all to the guards. They've been hitting shots lately.
It's been opening up the post. With me and Kiki now being in there, they're
still dragging on us, but it's not as bad.  
  
It's just the guards hitting shots and opening it up for us.  
  
Q. A'ja, Dawn talked about how important it was to get a good start. How
important was it for you to set the tone early and get this thing going?  
A'JA WILSON: It's very important, especially in post play. I think the first
five minutes are the biggest minutes in the game. I think we came out with a
lot of energy. That really showed in the end of the regular season, is that we
have a lot of energy. That's something we handle very well. I think when we're
playing with a lot of energy, we come out and play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Doniyah, you were very aggressive today, career high in points. Is
that something you've tried to be more aggressive with in the season or just
for this game?  
DONIYAH CLINEY: I mean, I look to be aggressive every time I get the chance to
when I get into the game. So today I just knew I had to step it up to fill in
for Alaina Coates. If I did get in for Kiki, make some offense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kiki, looked poised.  
A'JA WILSON: She did great. Kiki's game is really forming into its own. That's
the biggest thing. Like coach said, Kiki has been working hard in practice. I
think that's where it really starts. You can see it translate over to the
game. Kiki is my roommate on the game. You ready? I don't know. She came out
and did her thing. I'm very proud of her 'cause the sky's the limit for her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Dawn, I think saw Coates come in towards the end of the game. Where
was she for the first part? What is the problem? How is the ankle
progressing?  
COACH STALEY: We elected to keep her at home for more treatments with our
doctor, Dr. Guy. I think having her in the building now gives us a lift.  
  
She just got here maybe two minutes before the end of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, in reference to Coates, is still day-to-day? I know you are
hopeful to have her tomorrow. Without her, how important was it today to
conserve the legs of your starters moving forward in this tournament?  
COACH STALEY: She is day-to-day. I haven't talked to our doctor yet. We'll
talk tonight about what her status is, where she is, how the treatments went.  
  
I think it's important for us in tournament play to be able to spread the
minutes out a little bit. I was very encouraged by what we saw, that our
starters got us off to a great start. Then we went to our bench, they took it
to another level.  
  
I think they understand, the people coming off the bench, where we are, that
they're needed. They're more focused in on being ready when their number's
called.  
  
Q. Dawn, you said after the Texas A &M game your team played together,
very well. Another game where they played together here. What is it about them
when they feel adversity that they do rally around that?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think they're just a resilient group. We've been
practicing with the small lineup a lot, even before Alaina got hurt. Once A'ja
got hurt, we played the smaller lineup because we got some good looks out of
it.  
  
This team, whatever they've thrown their way, they've handled all season long.
It's the mark of a really good team that's able to take advantage of those
adverse moments.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about now the tournament being here in Greenville, is it
any different having a bigger fan base or not having to travel so far? How do
you compare it to other tournaments?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think it's closer to us. I think the proximity to our
hometown plays a big part. But we draw well no matter where we are.
Jacksonville, we drew pretty good. To have it in the state of South Carolina
is a tremendous thing, very convenient for our fans, very convenient for a lot
of the teams that are participating to get here.  
  
It's a great city. We got great weather. But I think the biggest thing is we
got great competition. This is the SEC tournament, where the best basketball
is being played against women's basketball teams, players, programs. Why not
bring it to a great place that's been a great host to the tournament.
Hopefully we can keep it here.  
  
Q. Bianca came off the bench and gave you a spark, got the team going.
How important was her performance today?  
COACH STALEY: It was great. Bianca has been in a precarious situation where
sometimes she starts, sometimes she comes off the bench. She's been real
focused in on whenever he's inserted into the game, she's always ready to
play.  
  
Today I thought especially she came in and gave us a boost. She took it to
another level by applying a lot of pressure on Haley Clark, as well as
facilitating and getting other people involved.  
  
I thought she did a great job passing the ball off, down low, to A'ja to give
her some easy buckets. When you have someone with that kind of experience,
she's used to playing in these type of games, she's our most experienced
guard. When we can get contributions from Bianca like that, she makes us
instantly a better team.  
  
Q. You mentioned the team taking advantage of the space. Did you have to
tell them to look for the open space or is that something that natural
aggression helped them take advantage of?  
COACH STALEY: It's something we've been working on, to allow our players to
play off what they naturally do. Allisha is able to go downhill a little bit
on the floor. Kaela is getting used to putting that ball on the floor, getting
to the basket, which I like, being very, very aggressive. All of them. Bianca,
even Ty Harris is being a little bit more aggressive.  
  
It's something that maybe we probably should have done a little bit sooner,
but you don't know. When you have two SEC-conference players like Alaina
Coates and A'ja Wilson, they've been very successful to our program, for our
program, you want to make sure you keep them happy, you keep them being as
productive as they are.  
  
Q. Talk about the team's defensive performance. Do you feel the way they
played in this game that they can string this along into the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH STALEY: I thought we did a really good job, especially in the first
half, just being ready to go. I thought by us having played Georgia two other
times, we have their tendencies down pat. We take what they want to do first
or second away, have them rely on playing off of a broken play.  
  
I thought we were keyed in on the game plan, executed it from a defensive
standpoint, played to the pace that we needed to play to get the win.  
  
Q. You have said for years Gamecocks, Lady Gamecocks. People call you
Lady Gamecocks. What can you say to get those people to stop?  
COACH STALEY: Call us winners. I don't care what you call us. I want to be
able to win basketball games. I'm not into the semantics. We have a very good
basketball team. Maybe it's the gentlemen that are calling us Lady Gamecocks.
It's chivalry, what they're doing.  
  
You don't like Lady Gamecocks?  
  
Q. I like whatever you like.  
COACH STALEY: Okay.  
  
Q. You guys were the early game today. You get to see the rest of the
teams playing for the rest of the quarterfinals. What are the advantages that
you're done for the day? What is the scouting presence going to be like for
the rest of the day?  
COACH STALEY: It's what we've been used to. When you're able to get into a
certain comfort level, we've been the No. 1 seed for the last four years. When
you can get into a routine like that, it surely helps you to plan your day.  
  
Now we can sit back and see who we have to play, then we can plan for the
finals. You got to see the big picture. As coaches, we do have to look ahead a
little bit for preparation. Having played the first game allows us to see how
it all pans out for the semis.  
  
Q. Why start Kiki today? How far has she come since her last start?  
COACH STALEY: I started Kiki today because I just thought we needed a boost
off the bench from Bianca. She's been playing well. It wasn't a fly-by-chance.
Kiki has been prepping herself for a moment like this, if given the
opportunity to start her if something happened, that she would be ready for
it.  
  
I just thought she was ready. Sometimes it's just intuition as a coach to say,
Let's capitalize on what she's been doing. If we start Bianca, we never know.
We would have missed this performance by Kiki.  
  
Q. Unlike a lot of the other games that happened in the previous season,
you are only going to get a little over 24 hours of recovery. What is going to
be your message to the girls so they can rest a little bit, make smart
decisions to be ready for tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: Well, our plan is to have them watch half of the semifinals game
-- I'm sorry, the Kentucky-Alabama game, get back, get some rest, have our
training staff get them a lot -- I see a lot of cold baths in their future.
Then we prep a little bit tonight with film and a walk-through at the hotel.  
  
It's something that our players are used to, having been in the situation
before. But some of them are freshmen and first-timers. Our older players will
get them in tune with what needs to take place in order to recover quickly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Ketara Chapel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32697)

### [Morgan William](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30442)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State - 78, LSU - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: I want to welcome Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, if you would start us off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, first of all, just really want to commend LSU on a
tremendous game. Those kids played extremely hard. They had a great plan.
Coach Nikki does an unbelievable job, her and her staff. They really caused us
some problems, especially in the first half. Just seemed like they got every
loose ball, things that we pride ourself on, toughness, hustle plays. They
just seemed to make them.  
  
I thought the second half, we really settled. I thought Morgan was really big
for us. Ketara, what can you say about her? Y'all don't know she went down
yesterday in practice in a heap with her back. She has a little bit of a lower
back issue. She went down and stayed down off the floor. I didn't know if she
was going to play today.  
  
She comes in the second half, goes four for four, two for two from the line
for 10. It's great to have, between her and Brea, Brea went five out of seven,
Ketara goes four for four. My four players went 9 for 11, were really big in
our zone offense against them.  
  
I'm happy for her. Between Brea and Ketara, those are both starters. They've
started off and on their whole career, veterans, been to the war, know what
it's all about.  
  
I'm glad to get the win. Hard-fought. Sure doesn't feel like a 70 whatever to
60 victory. It felt like a one-pointer.  
  
Thought our kids showed some toughness and resilience tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions to the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Ketara, can you talk about what happened in practice, how you felt,
and when you knew you would be able to play today?  
KETARA CHAPEL: I think we were doing a rebounding drill. Me and Brea both went
up for the ball. I kind of tweaked something in my back. I immediately felt
pain in my lower back. I went down.  
  
But Mary, our trainer, does a great job getting us well and healthy, going in
with treatment, ice. I told coach that I was fine. Coming in and playing like
that, that's what happened.  
  
Q. Morgan, were there any concerns coming in this week for you guys
after last week's defeat? Did you get over that pretty quickly and refocus
yourselves or was there any worry?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Well, first off, we had a day off after we lost. Immediately
went in, watched film, practiced, worked on everything defense-wise.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Let me clarify that. We did not watch film on our day off.  
  
MORGAN WILLIAM: My bad. Sorry (laughter).  
  
We didn't watch it on our day off. He made sure we watched the film the whole
40 minutes. We worked on everything. We watched the film. It was like, This
isn't us, this isn't what got us here.  
  
In practice, we worked on everything we supposed to have been doing. Today it
was good to finally show that we back, doing what we supposed to do.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you talk about that fourth quarter, how you were able to
pull away from them. What were the big keys there?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: We had to get some stops. Coach kept telling us we have to
score, stop, score. Felt like we exchanged buckets. We did extend the lead.
Felt like every time we went down, screen, shot, restarted rebounding the
ball. They kept putting me on the foul line. I feel like that's where we got
away, too.  
  
Q. Ketara, the fourth quarter, considering you guys came into the game
losing two straight, do you feel like you figured things out offensively in
the fourth quarter that you could build off of going forward?  
KETARA CHAPEL: Yeah. I feel like our offense was good the fourth quarter, our
zone offense. We ran a certain play we kept getting great looks at. Our inside
game with Teaira in the fourth quarter was also great.  
  
Q. Ketara, second quarter in particular seemed like you were struggling
a lot, started the second half the same way. Somewhere about midway through
the third quarter you, hit three straight buckets. Did it feel like at that
point you started getting momentum back?  
KETARA CHAPEL: Yeah, I feel like in the first quarter you could tell Brea was
on fire. Coming in in the second half, trying to follow up what Brea had done,
I scored three straight buckets, I felt like our momentum started coming. Our
press picked up a lot.  
  
Q. Ketara, when you come in in the fourth quarter, the game is that
close, what is your mindset in terms of coach's saying is always, Fix it if
it's broken? I don't know if it was broken, but what was your mindset in being
aggressive, trying to contribute?  
KETARA CHAPEL: I don't think anything was broken. Just coming in, like you
said, coach always says, Fix what's broken or keep going what's good. We knew
we had to get stops, score.  
  
Being help side, boxing out, rebounding was a big deal in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Morgan, what was it like without Victoria as a big part of the
offense today? She only hit one field goal late in the fourth quarter.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Yeah, some people had an off night. We're a team. Can't be our
only scoring option. Can't be one-dimensional. We got to play, do what we do.
I feel like I stepped up, made some shots. It was able to get my teammates
open for open looks.  
  
I'm sure she'll have a good game tomorrow. I'm not worried.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What do you think was going on with Victoria tonight? What does it
say about this team that you can win a tournament game without her best?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, I think we've shown tremendous balance all year long.
We've had a lot of games really early in the year. We've had a lot of kids
scoring us. Roshunda Johnson came off the bench, had big games, Blair has come
off and had 18.  
  
Our bench has been great all year. Tonight I think we -- our bench out-scored
them 29-12. We've got a good bench, got depth. Just got to get them playing
better.  
  
Again, Victoria gets everybody's best defensive game plan. Tonight our game
plan really wasn't centered on anything other than we were going to try to
establish an inside game and work from there.  
  
Between our four and five, with Teaira in the second half, we did a good job
of that. That loosened it up for some other stuff.  
  
Again, I think our team is talented enough to make up for that.  
  
Q. You ended that game against Tennessee saying things needed to be
fixed, you knew how to fix them. Do you feel things are fixed, given the
fourth quarter?  
COACH SCHAEFER: No. Here is what I should have said. I was emotional. We had
10, 500 in there, and we laid an egg.  
  
The fact of the matter is this: if we would have lost those two games in
January, went 13-3, 27-3 on the year, nobody would have said anything. The
fact we lost the last two games of the year, a chance to win SEC championship,
the sky is falling in StarkVegas, Mississippi. It's part of the monster we
created.  
  
It's the SEC. We lost out of top 25 Kentucky on Senior Day. I got the NBA
version of Tennessee on Sunday. They were awesome. Give them credit.  
  
So we didn't play well. We had some mistakes. Yes, I know how to fix it. I
think we're in the process of fixing it. We had three really good days of
practice, which we didn't have three good days in January or February
combined.  
  
I was pleased with how we came out and practiced. I thought tonight we were
better. But, look, we gave up 20 points in the fourth quarter. That's not
good. We'll watch the film. Our kids will learn from it.  
  
But, look, Chloe and Raigyne, those of two big-time mid-range jump shot kids.
They're going to play a long time after they get done at LSU. They're hard to
handle.  
  
The thing about guarding a kid off of a ball screen, your hedge has to be
perfect. Your turn-and-run has to be perfect. To guard it correctly, you have
to have three people in help on the person that's setting the ball screen.  
  
Kids get tired. I thought Chinwe got tired tonight in the first half. She got
caught out of position. Again, our problem at halftime wasn't the two guards.
We let their five players go five for seven. 44 and 20 were five for seven at
halftime. That's where I was disappointed.  
  
We were undisciplined. We came off of ball-side penetration, which you're not
supposed to do at the five spot. We had get to get it fixed.  
  
Q. When Ketara comes in, what do you see from her mindset and impacts
the game? I don't know if anything was broken, but she fixes it.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Right now, she's playing with a lot of confidence. She's
shooting the ball really well. We went in the men's gym. They've got a real
neat toy in there that tells you the arc on your shot. Her shot can get real
arc-y. Is that a word?  
  
We go in there one day. Basically she fixed it in one day. We were in there
for 30 minutes. She understood exactly what it was.  
  
But the kid's playing with a lot of confidence. I'm telling y'all. She's got a
bad lower back. She couldn't walk hardly yesterday after she got tangled up in
practice.  
  
I didn't play her the first half, really wasn't thinking much about playing
her in the second till Brea got winded. But the kid is playing with a lot of
confidence. That's a kid that started off and on her whole career. Her and
Brea, they're basically starters.  
  
That's the biggest thing for me right now. I can see it in her eyes. She's
confident. She's battle-tested. She wants to be in the moment. That's what you
have to have right now at this time of year. You better have some kids that
want to be in the moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sierra Michaelis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26438)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 62, Missouri - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Missouri.  
  
Coach, if you could start out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH PINGETON: Well, obviously disappointed in the game. I just didn't think
we played at our best. I certainly want to make sure I give credit to Texas
A&M. I thought they had a great game plan coming in. Really I thought didn't
give Sophie lot of space, regardless if it was off ball screens or in the open
court. I thought they really did a good job defensively on Sophie. She had to
work for everything she got.  
  
I thought we missed some early shots that could have maybe helped us out,
build some momentum going into halftime. Way too many turnovers the first time
we played them. I think we had 12. Just had some tough turnovers. We didn't
bounce back very well from them.  
  
They hit some big shots in that third and fourth quarter that we couldn't
respond to. It felt like one of those games that you were down three or five,
it felt more like 13 or 15. We could just never get our momentum back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sierra.  
  
Q. Can you try to put in perspective how hard it is against a team like
Texas A &M? It's almost they're like locusts because they're all over the
place. Did that get in your heads a little bit tonight?  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: I mean, we played them already in the season. I think it's
really hard to beat a team twice in the same season, especially a team like
Texas A&M. They're really aggressive on offense and defense. We just didn't
respond the way we should have.  
  
Q. Sierra, what happened in the third quarter offensively? You started
out so well, then all of a sudden you can't make any shots, so atypical for
you guys. Was it a matter of them getting you out of your comfort zone or an
off night?  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: I think it was us. I mean, give credit to their defense.
They're a good defensive team. We had turnovers we shouldn't have had. We had
a lot of missed shots we usually make. I think we let our offense dictate our
defense.  
  
Q. It seemed like Sophie got pretty frustrated, especially in the second
half. Could you sense that at all? Did that impact you guys?  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: I mean, I think Sophie is a big part of this team. When she
has foul trouble, it definitely impacts us if she's got to go on the bench,
so...  
  
Q. Everybody kind of knew the history, that you haven't won a game in
this tournament before. Between quarters, did it ever enter your mind?  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: No, I don't think it entered anyone's mind. We have to focus
on one game at a time, not the past.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sierra, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Loaded one for you.  
COACH PINGETON: That's all right.  
  
Q. You didn't shoot a free throw until there was 3 minutes, 4 seconds
left. What would your explanation for that be?  
COACH PINGETON: I didn't think we attacked as much as we needed to. I thought
our turnovers that we had really deflated us. We missed some shots we
typically make. Had some open looks that I liked. I just didn't think we were
aggressive enough going to the rim.  
  
You got to put some pressure on the defense. We talked about that before the
game started. They don't have a lot of depth. We really wanted to attack with
our inside presence as well as off the bounce.  
  
I just thought they played really solid defense. They're a great position
defense. We didn't attack as much as we needed to, to put ourselves in that
position.  
  
Q. Do you feel snake bit in this tournament, especially this game? For
you, did it ever cross your mind, Oh, man, we can't catch a break when we play
here?  
COACH PINGETON: No, it didn't cross my mind during the game. Honestly, I
haven't really put a lot of thought into that. I know when you look at it, you
probably think, How do you not think about that?  
  
Every team is so different and unique. Every year is a little bit different.
You look back on it, you think, Yeah, that kind of stinks.  
  
We just got to continue to stay the course. It's been a really good year.
We've done a lot of things this year that we haven't done in a long time.
We'll focus on those, break down this film. We still got games in front of us.
I just didn't feel like we played with the poise we needed to.  
  
Again, give Texas A&M credit. They're a very, very good team.  
  
Q. Seemed like they were intent on doubling Sophie. What do you think of
the job they did against her?  
COACH PINGETON: I thought they did a really good job. I like what they did
defensively against her. Gary did a great job scouting us, taking away some
things we were able to do the first time we played them.  
  
I just felt like there's always kind of like that triangle formation around
Sophie. They weren't going to let her get anything off that ball screen
action. She had a couple hard takes to the basket. Even in isolation in the
paint, they were going to make our players step up and beat us tonight.  
  
They made it really hard for us. Had a good game, but not the typical scoring
we usually do.  
  
Q. You won 10 of 12, surged as three seed. Does this take some of the
shine off what you accomplished down the stretch?  
COACH PINGETON: I think it definitely does in the moment, right now. I don't
know how it couldn't because your focus is always where you're at. We don't
look too far ahead. We don't go too far behind.  
  
It will be another one of those times that we're going to have to learn from
this and get better. I just didn't feel like we had the poise we needed to at
different times throughout the course of this game.  
  
So, yeah, it stings right now. It doesn't feel very good especially when you
lose. You want to feel like you played your best game or you played pretty
well. I didn't feel like that was the case tonight.  
  
We'll go back. I tell you what, this is a resilient group. We will watch film,
talk about it. I know records go out the window. When you start the NCAA
tournament, everything starts over. But we have to be willing to continue to
grow from the situations we were in tonight.  
  
Q. You had two turnovers in the first minute of the third quarter.  
COACH PINGETON: I mean, I felt like we got deflated. I was pretty fired up at
those. I felt like we didn't come out with the sense of urgency we needed to.
We had the ball in front of our bench. They were in a 2-3 zone. The way we cut
to be open was half speed. We weren't dialed in the way we needed to be for 40
minutes. I thought we had possessions where we were, but you have to sustain
that.  
  
There's a certain level, certain mentality you have to play with, certain
toughness you have to play with for 40 minutes against teams like this at this
level. For one reason or another, we just didn't have that tonight.  
  
Q. Is it hard sometimes when you're playing a team that is that pesky
defensively to be yourself? Does that make it difficult because they're so
aggressive?  
COACH PINGETON: Again, I think Texas A&M is a very good team, a very good
team. They're still in contention of hosting that first round of the NCAA
tournament. You absolutely want to give them credit. I don't want to act like
we just played awful and they didn't do anything. They played really well.
They're a very good defensive team. Gary does a great job with that team.  
  
I just didn't feel like we had the poise at times to get in our formations,
and our spacing was a little off. Our ball reversals weren't as good as they
had been. A couple times when the ball was swung on the perimeter, we talk a
lot about being shot ready. I didn't feel like we were shot ready.  
  
I thought our rotations on the drive, everything was a little off. Just didn't
seem free-flowing tonight. We had some open looks that we typically make in
that first quarter that I think could have maybe gotten into a better flow or
rhythm. Had a couple bad turnovers. Didn't get back on defense. I just felt
like that deflated us, took the wind out of our sails a little bit.  
  
Q. You talked about any loss, you want to get something out of it. You
haven't had very many losses recently. You said this group is resilient. What
do you think they take out of this going forward?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I mean, they're really disappointed. They know. I think
we talked about that same feeling that we had against Mississippi State about
a month ago, what that felt like, just not having the poise we needed to.  
  
I think we got frustrated, and it showed in our emotions, in our body language
on the court. We've got to be better than that. We have to let that play go
and move on to the next possession.  
  
In those moments, the poise has got to be so much better. We've gotten a lot
better. We've talked about that. We'll talk through body language, the way we
respond to adversity. We've gotten a lot better the last month or so.  
  
We weren't on point with that tonight. I think that really hurt us.  
  
Really appreciate you guys coming. Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Alyssa Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32686)

### [Evelyn Akhator](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32687)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Kentucky - 65, Alabama - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Really proud to win today. Played some tough defense. Had to
really battle an Alabama team that played great the first two days. Really,
really went at it.  
  
Proud of our players for finding a way to win the boards today, won the
turnover battle. All those take a lot of hustle. We were able to take some
charges today that were really key.  
  
A tough, physical game that I'm proud we won.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes,
please.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what was working for you guys inside, especially in the first
half?  
ALYSSA RICE: We were just looking to be aggressive and dunk in on their post
players because a lot of times they were playing behind. Just playing with
poise. We worked on that a lot in our practice. Even when they sent the
double-teams, looking for our opposite post player or guard, just being poised
and patient.  
  
Q. Evelyn, you had some success against Alabama last game, again today.
Did you have some confidence going into this game because of that?  
EVELYN AKHATOR: I mean, every other game, as long as we're practicing, I mean,
I just have to be patient. Coach tells us we need to be patient and poised
whenever we have the ball. If we can't decide, we just need to, like, faceoff
and see what we've got, just take it. That really boost my confidence.  
  
Q. Alyssa, South Carolina tomorrow in the semifinals. What sort of
challenges do they pose for you guys?  
ALYSSA RICE: Obviously they're a great team. They play very well together.
They have a great post presence. They have a good high-low game. We're
definitely going to have to come out and play our best, just go out and play
our game. Try to shut down their high-low game, their post players. Try to win
the boards, because that's a big thing they do well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Matthew, are there any updates on Taylor Murray?  
COACH MITCHELL: Alabama ran a nice set play in the game there. We weren't
ready for it. The other four were sprinting back, trying to get the defense
set. Taylor and I just talked about pressuring the ball on the way up, got
into a speed dribble. It was a legal play, a good play. We didn't handle it
well. She ran right into that kid full speed.  
  
She doesn't feel great right now, but it's too early to tell what's going to
happen. It was a terrible, terrible collision. It was a clean, legal play,
just unlucky. We probably didn't need to pressure the ball. We thought we
would take time off of the clock. The kid got into a speed dribble. Taylor was
hustling, and it is a bad break for us if it is anything that lingers. We
don't know right now. Doc is checking her out.  
  
Q. Talk about your dribble-penetration.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. Great job getting to the line and converting today, one
of the real keys to the game, because we certainly looked a little disjointed
offensively, just missed a lot of wide-open shots that we don't make all of
them, but we make more than what we did today. Just had a really, really
difficult day from the field.  
  
To go 85% from the line was huge. That was a real indication of toughness and
hustle. That was a big, big key in the game.  
  
Q. Tomorrow South Carolina. Talk about that matchup.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. I thought we had a real hard time with them in
Lexington. They had us on the ropes in Columbia. I liked the fight our kids
had.  
  
It's going to be a real challenge. They are such a talented team. The little
bit I was able to see today, they played with tremendous energy and effort.
Looked spectacular today. Extremely talented. Champions of our league.  
  
It will be a big, big test for us. We came down here with our goal to win the
tournament. I think you have to go through the champion, whether it's tomorrow
or Sunday, you're going to have to beat them to have a chance in it.  
  
They are outstanding. We'll have to play hard tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is there anything you can pinpoint on some of those offensive
struggles you had, open jumpers that weren't falling? Is it tournament
nerves?  
COACH MITCHELL: Hard to say. We have been in this position before in our
program. None of these kids have had to sit a day, sit two days, and play on
Friday. Maybe it was. I can't tell you.  
  
We had some great looks, created some great looks. I'll have to go back and
look at the film.  
  
I just tried to talk to them at halftime about getting their footwork right.
You can't let the jitters get to you. It was a difficult day for us
offensively from the field. But one thing we know is we didn't shoot it that
great on Thursday last year, then scored 92 on Friday. You never know what's
going to happen in this tournament.  
  
The key for us today was to take care of today. Now we can be happy about that
and start getting ready for tomorrow, get our best plan together. It's been
less than a week since we played them. It's not unfamiliar territory for us.
We'll have to go back and rest up and get ready to play our best basketball
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Eight straight trips to at least the semifinals of this tournament.
Talk about the success your program has had overall.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we've had a bunch of great players come through. Hard-
working young women have come through. They go to practice, go to work every
day. This team's really worked hard, really brought it every single day.  
  
I think we have great respect for this tournament. I have great respect for
this league. I think it's a privilege and an honor to have one of the 14 seeds
in this league that gets to lead a team in here.  
  
We have a lot of respect for this tournament, want to play well. It's time to
be playing well. So our team always has high expectations. Part of meeting
those is playing well in post-season.  
  
Q. Talk about your inside game today.  
COACH MITCHELL: Real, real proud of Alyssa Rice. Proud of Evelyn. Two great
students, great people, high-character people, the kind of people you want in
your program.  
  
They are just hard workers. Both of them have worked extremely hard. Alyssa is
just blossoming in front of our eyes right here. Every day she gets a little
bit better. Those were not poor players she was scoring against. Those are
really good, tough post players in our league. Just thrilled for her and her
progress. She's put a lot of work into it.  
  
I know Evelyn wants to do extremely well. I thought she showed some really
good poise and patience at times today. She limited her turnovers. I was so
proud of our turnover margin today. If anybody was going to turn it over a
lot, it was going to be our bigs because they were trapping them in the low
block. They had to make some decisions.  
  
Just real steady, good effort. We needed them on a day when our perimeter game
was not shooting the ball well. We needed their production. Real proud of
those two.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Thanks, everybody.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Alexis Hyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30323)

### [Raigyne Moncrief](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28352)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State - 78, LSU - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome LSU.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH FARGAS: I'm extremely proud of the LSU Tigers. I thought we came here
with the mindset of really competing against some of the best players, not
only in our conference, but in the country. I felt like we fell short of our
goal today.  
  
But for the most part, our fight and our determination to win today was there.
I didn't think that our kids came in playing scared or not to lose. I felt
like we had some great opportunities. But down the stretch, we fell short.  
  
But we're going to learn from this. We're going to get better. We're going to
be better from playing a team, not only just an Ole Miss team, but Mississippi
State, who potentially could be a No. 1 seed in the tournament.  
  
But to see the growth of my team over the past few months, that's something
we're going to continue to work on. Again, I can't say enough about the play
of our team, stepping up in this hostile environment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Raigyne, the game was pretty close until midway through the fourth
quarter. What do you think the difference was in the game?  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: We had some miscommunication on defense. Allowed a lot of
open shots to happen. Things were going their way. Calls were going their way.  
  
They executed in the game, and we didn't. We played 33-34 minutes. We need to
play 40. The last six minutes, the momentum started going their way. They
started to score.  
  
Q. Alexis, you had 19 fouls. Mississippi State had eight. How big of a
factor do you think the fouls were in tonight's game?  
ALEXIS HYDER: Fouls give a team momentum. Towards the end of the fourth, they
were and-ones, late and-ones at that. That gave them momentum, three-point
play. They didn't miss many free throws. That gave them the edge on us.  
  
It definitely took a toll on us.  
  
Q. Alexis, tonight wasn't the way you wanted to end it. How does it feel
knowing you probably have more basketball to play, that you've turned things
around, have more to do?  
ALEXIS HYDER: I think this definitely puts some fuel, some fire under us.
We're more hungry than we ever been, especially losing like this, in a game
that we were really thought we were going to win.  
  
It's motivation. We're ready to go get it in the NCAA.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Fargas.  
  
Q. Obviously, you didn't want to finish the game this way. You know
there's more out there for you, more chances to improve and show the
turnaround that you have made.  
COACH FARGAS: Well, it's been a complete turnaround from last year. This team
has grown a lot in just a one-year span. For us to finish in the SEC regular
season in the top seven, top eight I think, that says a lot about this team.
It's not easy getting wins in this conference.  
  
To see our team really fight, like they said, the last four, five minutes
there, we wanted this game to go down to the stretch where it's back and
forth, where we're playing our basketball, they're playing theirs. That's how
it was. The game was being played through the players. There was no influence
of fouls and things like that.  
  
We had gone through that with Ayana Mitchell getting three in the first half.
We felt like we really had a game plan of defending one of the best players in
the country in Vivians. I'm proud of the defensive effort on her.  
  
When you do that, it sometimes gives up the paint. They got some good looks in
the paint against us. This is something that this group are going to learn
from. They're going to learn from it. I'm proud to be their coach. There's not
another team I want to be on the sidelines with, because this team gives me
everything that they have.  
  
We're one of the smaller teams, but I think we play with a huge heart. You get
ready for NCAA tournament play, which I think our team has done enough in the
sense of our non-conference schedule, what we've done in the SEC, to get our
name called. So we're going to go back, we're going to practice like we're an
NCAA team.  
  
Q. A little bit more about the turnaround. When you go to where you were
last year, maybe a good season is three more wins than the year before, five
more wins. It's more gradual than what we've seen. How did they buy into it
immediately, that last year wasn't going to be repeated?  
COACH FARGAS: The buy-in was last year. The people who had to sit along the
sidelines stayed engaged the entire season. The energy that they brought on
the sidelines, it was almost like they were able to play, but they couldn't
physically because either we were injured with Moncrief and Mitchell, or we
had Jackson and Neubert sitting out due to transfer rules.  
  
We like our people who had to sit out, due to injury, we like them being in
every practice, traveling with us, experiencing everything that they can.  
  
That group that I just mentioned, they sat on the sidelines, sat on the bench
last year when we got our first win in the SEC tournament. The excitement that
they had for their teammates, I knew that this year, when they were eligible
or healthy to play, they were going to kind of repay Rina Hill, Jasmine
Rhodes, Alexis Hyder, Shanice Norton for only having to play with six players
in the season.  
  
They love each other. We're family. That's how we're going to continue to
foster this program where I hope no one ever has to experience that again. But
I think our kids grew from it. I think it's going to help them later on in
life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH FARGAS: Thank you.

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Meoshonti Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30320)

### [Hannah Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32614)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Kentucky - 65, Alabama - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Alabama.  
  
Coach, if you would start with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH CURRY: Just a credit to Kentucky today. I think if you look at the stat
sheet, the difference in the game was the free-throw line. We both had 20
baskets. But you can't allow someone to shoot that many free throws.  
  
The end of the day, too, I thought that Akhator and Epps did what seniors do,
combine for 35 points. I know we have a lot of positives to look forward to.  
  
Certainly a great run by a great group of kids. Disappointed in the outcome,
but also very, very excited about the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hannah, going out for 22 points today, what were you able to do to
penetrate that Kentucky defense?  
HANNAH COOK: Well, I owe it to my teammates for getting me open. Had to cut
off screens and change your pace. Just got to have a quick release, get the
shot off. All that pressure defense, so...  
  
Q. Meo, you made it to the quarterfinals for the first time in a long
time. What does that say for the future of your program?  
MEOSHONTI KNIGHT: We've just been constantly improving. We played really hard
this weekend, this week. We came up short today.  
  
But I don't see that happening too much for us in the future 'cause we're
getting much older, growing and getting better.  
  
Q. With Kentucky able to pull ahead in the beginning, kind of hold onto
the lead, what do you think you could have done differently to have pulled in
front?  
MEOSHONTI KNIGHT: It's just a game of runs. They went on their run in the
beginning. We came back and went on our run in the end.  
  
That's just the game. You just got to go on a longer run.  
  
HANNAH COOK: Like she said, a game of runs. I think we could have rebounded
better, me personally, as well. We just needed to knock down shots, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Curry.  
  
Q. Talk about your tournament résumé, why you think the Crimson Tide
should be in the NCAA tournament.  
COACH CURRY: Well, I think throughout the course of the conference season,
five wins probably is not going to get you in. At the end of the day, we
understand we were in nearly all of those, can certainly learn in the future.  
  
We're excited about the opportunity to continue to play more in the post-
season NIT. We just look forward to continuing block by block, brick by brick,
day by day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH CURRY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2017

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Taylor Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32705)

### [Anriel Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30842)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 62, Missouri - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Texas A&M.  
  
Coach, if you would start out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH BLAIR: It's good to see this many people. We finished last night, and
there was only two. I'm glad y'all stayed awake and got a chance to see
another great second half.  
  
So proud of my kids. A lot of times when you coach a team that doesn't have
drama on your team, excuses, they can take adjustments at halftime. When you
have the senior leadership that I have from Curtyce Knox and Taylor Cooper,
two kids that are in their fifth-year, they do not get rattled.  
  
I think that's what we did in the second half. Give Missouri a lot of credit.
Three wide-open threes to start the ballgame, timeout. We scratched our way
back into it. Was only down three at half or one. I can't remember.  
  
We made a couple of adjustments. Thanks to Taylor Cooper here, she suggested a
play that we ran. Either put Cooper at the high post and move Danni back to
the left side, because when Anriel didn't have the wide-open shot, she would
pass it to Danni and set the screen. Then Danni made that shot coming right
off the screen.  
  
This is a kid that's fixing to be a coach. She knows the game. I believe this
might have been her career high, if I'm looking at my sports information guy.
Is that right? No, it wasn't a career high. But a career high under pressure
in the SEC tournament.  
  
You got to look at this kid probably played three or four minutes last year in
the SEC tournament. The other young lady didn't start until January. Danni
Williams did three points a ballgame, and she's averaging 17 now. Hillsman
went from 7 to 17.  
  
We had a team step-up and take advantage of an opportunity and get something
done. Isn't that the way life is supposed to be? When your opportunity comes,
are you ready?  
  
This is why I'm so proud of this team; winning and losing can take care of
itself, the improvement, to see kids move to that next level, play in the best
league in the country, the SEC.  
  
I'm hoping people across the nation got a chance to see us. Mainly, I'm hoping
all those recruits across the nation got a chance to see us because I think we
have something special at Texas A&M.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the job you did on Sophie?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: It was a team defense. Coach Starkey did a great job telling us
what defense to run when certain players were in the game. A few times we did
double her. Other times we just denied her the ball pretty heavily.  
  
We all did that, we all did our part. It worked as a team.  
  
Q. Taylor, Sophie got the technical early in the fourth quarter. Could
you tell you were under her skin a little bit?  
TAYLOR COOPER: We could tell. We had two people on her the whole entire night.
That was kind of our game plan, just not let her get loose.  
  
She got loose when we played at Missouri. Just to kind of contain her. She's a
great player. Those are the type of players you have to contain. You can't
take them away fully.  
  
She started to get frustrated in the second half, especially in the fourth
quarter. That's kind of the turning point of the game.  
  
Q. The second quarter, coach talked about you suggesting a play to help
spark the offense. What about the defense? They only shot two of 13 in that
quarter, scored four points. What was the adjustment you made to the shut them
down in the third quarter?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I believe we were giving them the four shot more than the
rhythm shot they're used to. Within under 10 seconds, they were throwing up
shots. I think our defense was pretty effective.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What was the game plan for Sophie? Were you pretty happy the way the
girls executed it?  
COACH BLAIR: Very similar to Ronni Williams the night before. You know she's
going to get her points. The first time she had 36 on us at her place. Won the
game basically by herself.  
  
But they share the ball. We made her work a little bit harder. She didn't get
as many open looks as she got when she played us before. We clogged up the
driving lanes. I think that had a lot to do with it.  
  
A lot of times, every time she would drive, Hillsman would be over there to
help. People don't understand that. Hillsman didn't play that well. Hillsman
did fine. She's gone 31 straight games in double figures. First game she
didn't. She did so much in the ballgame that goes unnoticed.  
  
She needs a break. I know what tomorrow is going to be. 6'7", 6'5" with
Mississippi State.  
  
Here is another key stat: How many times in a major college game are you going
to hold somebody to eight points in the second quarter and four points in the
third quarter? We're not known as a great defensive team.  
  
That might have been one of our best defensive efforts ever. Give Coach
Starkey and my kids a lot of credit for what they did.  
  
The other thing, only three offensive boards by them, okay? When they're
shooting 40%, have that many opportunities, we only fouled 12 times. Curtyce
Knox, 10 assists. Normally she's getting them to Hillsman. She was having to
get them to our shooters because they were building a campfire on Hillsman.
That's why the high post was open as much as it was.  
  
Anriel started out two for eight, finished eight for 18, made all the hustle
plays we had to have.  
  
Q. What has to be different tomorrow to have a better result against
Mississippi State?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, we played them two good ballgames. It goes back to, can you
beat them on the third time? The last time at our place, I thought we had
them, but it didn't work out. They beat us by eight or ten at their place. We
had a seven-point lead.  
  
We have to do all the little things right. We have to make sure we get a lot
of help down there. They take up so much space. How many times is Vivian going
to have two bad ballgames in a row?  
  
I bet she's in a gym right now shooting the basketball because she's not going
to have two games in a row.  
  
The key to their team is the two players, Morgan Williams, the point guard,
who is their leader, and Dillingham, the defense that she'll put on Danni
Williams. Danni is going to have to work harder than she's worked in a long
time to be able to get open.  
  
Those are the two players, the key to Mississippi State. It's what they do
defensively and through leadership. Vic has done a great job with that
ballclub. They wear you out inside. That's why we cannot get into the foul
trouble that LSU did today, with Mitchell getting three fouls in the first
five minutes. Hyder had two early on.  
  
What we have to do is just find a way. Hey, we're on house money. We were a
six seed, maybe we're a five now. Let's go for the damn four, okay? To do that
we just need to keep on winning.  
  
I'm having the time of my life. I've got another suit here. I didn't just
bring one suit. I've got enough clothes. We're going to dress well. We'll win
the dress-off. I don't know about the game, but I'll out-dress him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

### [Brandy Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28290)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Georgia - 56, Auburn - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined by Auburn.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought we played extremely well in the first half.
We forced them into 16 turnovers. I think the defensive pressure and energy
wasn't there in the second half, didn't score like we needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Katie, you had a big game, as usual. A lot of steals, assists. Tell
us about the game you had today.  
KATIE FRERKING: I mean, I was just trying to do everything I could to win.
That's part of it. You got to play in every area of the game.  
  
Like coach said, we had good pressure, we had good energy. We just couldn't
hit shots at key moments.  
  
Q. Brandy, what was different in the second half?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I think we just didn't hit shots mainly in the second half.
Our defense was good. We were getting turnovers. We weren't converting on the
other end.  
  
That's kind of what the problem was, I think.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what did Georgia do differently in the second half that you
weren't able to force as many turnovers?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if they did anything differently. I
don't think our rotation was as quick as it was in the first half. I know they
got the ball to the middle a few times.  
  
But I really think, you know, our defensive rotation wasn't as quick as it was
in the first half.  
  
Q. Georgia had a ton of offensive rebounds, second-chance points. How
big of a role did that play?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It was huge. It played a big role in the first game
we played against them. They had 15 offensive rebounds in the first game,
which gave them 19 points.  
  
We knew we had to box them out. They do a very good job on second-chance
points, getting to the board. We didn't do a good job of boxing them out.  
  
Q. What kind of case can you make for post-season play?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We had a great non-conference. We played some of the
best teams in the country. Our RPI is extremely high. Our strength of schedule
was very tough. I mean, we're at least in the 40s in our RPI, even higher in
our strength of schedule.  
  
We've done everything we needed to, besides just the last win here with
Georgia. We have the body of work to get into the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jordan Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26580)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Alabama, 72 - Tennessee, 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee.  
  
Coach, start us off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Credit to Alabama. They were tougher than us today. They had a
little bit of a stronger will. They just out-worked us and out-played us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mercedes, could you talk about No. 25's improved play. She had six
blocks, double-figure scoring. I don't think she was that much of a factor in
the first meeting this year.  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, she definitely played a lot more tonight. Her presence
was noted. Like you said, she had six blocks. I think it was just us not
attacking hard enough and shot faking when we got into her.  
  
She also had two offensive rebounds which were key. In total they had 10,
which really hurt us.  
  
Q. Jordan, losing to Alabama two straight times in the regular season,
you would think the team would come in here really ready to play, yet you
looked lethargic from the outset. How do you explain that?  
JORDAN REYNOLDS: I think we were just overlooking this team. We didn't think
we had to come out here and play to the best of our ability because we came
off a very good win.  
  
I think we played lethargic from the beginning because we thought it could be
a switch. It wasn't a switch. We came out and didn't play to the best of our
ability.  
  
Q. Mercedes, can you put into words how frustrating it is for this team
to beat some of the teams you beat this year, then to bow out in the first
round of the tournament.  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: It's obviously very frustrating because our play is so up-
and-down. Sometimes we play so good, then we come back against a team like
Alabama. We think it's okay to not play our best. That really hurt us at
times.  
  
We've been high and low. We can't play like that.  
  
Q. Mercedes, what is this team going to have to do to bounce back
heading into the NCAA tournament?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: We're going to have to keep our heads high and move forward.
Obviously we lost. This post-season for us is over.  
  
We still have the tournament to look forward to. We're just going to have to
continue to get better, practice every day, look ahead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. You can return to the locker room.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Warlick.  
  
Q. Holly, offensive rebounding was trouble for you today. You didn't get
one until deep into the second quarter. Why has that been such a problem?  
COACH WARLICK: I don't know why it was a problem today. We didn't shoot the
ball well. I thought we got good looks. We were 16 for 51. Outside of not
stopping people on defense, you're not going to win a lot of games.  
  
I thought we got great looks. We didn't rebound the basketball. We talked
about it quite a bit, but our effort just wasn't there on that aspect of the
game.  
  
Q. How impressed were you with Diamond's ability to play aggressive
defense, even though she had three and four fouls late in the game?  
COACH WARLICK: I mean, I wasn't very happy that she got three or four fouls,
you know. We needed her on the floor. She can't put herself in that situation.  
  
Yeah, I thought she did some good things. She can't put us in that position.
She can't get into foul trouble. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Holly, when your senior point guard talks about, We thought it was
okay to come out here and not play our best against this team. That seems
inexplicable. How can you even relate to that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I didn't pick up on that. If she felt that way, that's
not how the team was addressed. We had a lot of respect for Alabama because
they beat us. We talked a lot about that.  
  
I don't know why. I guess that's what she felt. But we prepared this team like
we did any other team. Look, you don't advance unless you take care of the
game at hand.  
  
Our game plan was to do everything we needed to do to beat Alabama. We weren't
saving ourselves. We weren't thinking about the next game as a staff. I don't
know if Jordan was speaking for everyone.  
  
We presented this game to where we needed to play our best to win. If that's
the case, we got to change that mindset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Joni Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30359)

### [Mackenzie Engram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32636)

### [Pachis Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32637)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Georgia - 56, Auburn - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Georgia to the table.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH TAYLOR: First, I just want to give credit to Auburn. They're a really
good team. I still believe they're an NCAA tournament team. They came out and
gave us everything we wanted today. Our players did a really good job of being
resilient and making sure in the second half they came out and took care of
the basketball, did a good job of executing in the halfcourt.  
  
This team has grown up this year. We figured out a way to survive and play
another day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Joni, to be close to Athens and be able to play in front of some fans
today, what kind of lift does that give you? Logistics are easier for you,
too.  
COACH TAYLOR: Our fans have been great all year long. Bulldog Nation has been
amazing. They followed us on the road a lot this year. When you look and see
red and black in the stands, it immediately puts a smile on our faces. Our
players love playing in front of them.  
  
We were super happy to see them out here supporting us. They'll be here all
weekend. Logistically, you can get on the bus, ride a couple miles and be down
here. We were able to have not too much of a taxing trip.  
  
Q. For the players, how is it close to be close to campus?  
MACKENZIE ENGRAM: I mean, it's awesome. Like she said, to look in the crowd
and see red and black, to hear them chanting for us, it's really everything
you want, to have your fan base be able to travel with you.  
  
To have their support means everything.  
  
PACHIS ROBERTS: Honestly, it gives us a lot of energy seeing them cheering for
us. It's like being at home all over again. It's like being in front of your
home crowd, playing at home. You just love that feeling.  
  
Q. Pachis, talk about your senior year. You get to play at least one
more time. Talk about how special that is.  
PACHIS ROBERTS: I'd say it's very special. You never want your senior season
to end. Just my team being able to help me keep going on, just playing, I
can't really describe the feeling honestly. It's just, like, amazing.  
  
Q. Mackenzie, Auburn had such a tenacious defense in the first half.
Y'all had an unusual number of turnovers. Talk about how you were able to
overcome and turn the game around.  
MACKENZIE ENGRAM: I think just staying calm is what we needed to do. A lot of
our turnovers did come from their press obviously. But Coach just talked to us
in the locker room and told us to calm down, stay confident. We knew if we
could handle their press, we would win the game.  
  
Q. Joni, it probably won't feel as much like a home game tomorrow. What
do you expect when you play South Carolina tomorrow?  
COACH TAYLOR: The same thing that happens every time you play them. They're
going to have fans in the stands. They're a very talented team. Fortunately we
played them twice. We're confident playing against them.  
  
We're not taking that for granted, obviously. They've got really dynamic
players. We're going to go back, get off of our feet, watch film, get ready to
go tomorrow.  
  
That's what you look forward to this time of year, playing in front of a
crowd, giving it your all, laying it on the line.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Matt Insell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26444)

### [Taylor Manuel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32660)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
LSU - 65, Ole Miss - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Ole Miss.  
  
Coach, if you would start us off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH INSELL: You know, it's been an up-and-down season for us. Hated that it
ended tonight in the first round of the SEC tournament or second round of the
SEC tournament, tonight against an LSU team. LSU played extremely well in the
second half and won the basketball game there against us.  
  
I'm real proud of our team. The steps we've taken this year off of a season
last year, that was not very good, to bounce back and to be 17-13 right now,
be eligible for post-season play. Obviously we'll be in the WNIT. Proud of our
team players, proud of Taylor Manuel here. It was a good night tonight.
Challenged her to be good from the first day she's been here to be special.
She's done that more times than not. I'm real proud of her, the way she's
played.  
  
We'll be better. We'll take a couple days off, go home, be a better basketball
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Taylor, what worked tonight? You were really on. What was fueling
your fire?  
TAYLOR MANUEL: I'd say, honestly, I'm a senior. I don't have much time left. I
know that I have three other seniors on my team.  
  
I feel like we want to go out the best way we can. I was just giving it
everything I could. My teammates found me when I was open. Just going out with
a lot of power.  
  
My coach made an emphasis getting the ball up high on the backboard, going up
with power. I focused on that tonight, was pretty successful.  
  
Q. So the momentum kind of shifted a little bit. What happened in that
second half?  
TAYLOR MANUEL: Well, they ended the first half with a run. That gave them a
little bit of momentum going into the second half. I think they just came out,
and they're a great team. They came out, pushed the ball.  
  
I feel like their chemistry was perfect tonight. We didn't rotate at certain
times when we were supposed to. So our defense is what fuels us. At times when
our defense isn't exactly how it needs to be, our momentum is slowed down at
times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Chloe Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32657)

### [Ayana Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32658)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
LSU - 65, Ole Miss - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome LSU.  
  
Coach, if you would start us off with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH FARGAS: Well, we're excited to see another day here at the SEC
tournament. This is the most competitive conference in the country. Every game
here, the feel in this gymnasium, has felt like an NCAA tournament.  
  
I can't be more proud of my group for digging deep and really finding a way to
beat a very good Ole Miss team, who has gone on and had great wins and put up
a great season.  
  
But the play of our team on the defensive end, their effort to really try to
reach our defensive goal of holding our opponent to under 50, they reached it.
Again, we're excited that we're continuing to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chloe, what clicked for you because early on you had the team first
standing on 13 points? Just what happened?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Just going out and playing hard. I mean, Moncrief got in early
foul trouble. We lost a good amount of energy out of her. I knew I had to step
it up, fill that missing piece. Everybody else stepped up, too.  
  
Q. Next up is Mississippi State. How are you going to prepare for
that?  
AYANA MITCHELL: I think we're going to enjoy this win for tonight, and
tomorrow get up and do scout, go over everything, just mainly stick with our
game plan. We played them before and weren't successful. Just going back to
the drawing board, seeing where we were successful, do that for a full 40.
We're going to enjoy this, trust me.  
  
Q. Chloe, playing in your first SEC tournament, did that add any
excitement to tonight?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Yeah, I mean, it was definitely exciting. But I just knew I
didn't want to go home, just had to leave it all out on the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Tell me your thoughts on the way Chloe played tonight. Seemed like
they kept you going. One point where Ole Miss got within nine, she went on a
6-0 run.  
COACH FARGAS: Well, Chloe has been one of the players that we've looked to all
season. She had a little spell there where she wasn't shooting the ball
extremely well. But we never lost faith in the fact she can knock down shots
for us.  
  
Like she said, she took it upon herself, especially when Moncrief was in foul
trouble, to really step up. That's what you have to do.  
  
When a teammate is struggling, somebody else needs to step in and pick up the
weight. I thought that Chloe, not only her offensive execution, but the fact
we had her rebounding the basketball, she had 14 rebounds tonight, that says a
lot about her on both sides of the basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH FARGAS: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Ashley Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32647)

### [Meoshonti Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30320)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Alabama - 72, Tennessee - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Alabama.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement.  
  
COACH CURRY: Just really proud of our team today. I thought that our energy
and effort is something that's always within our control. I knew at halftime
and told them if we could hold them to 29 the second half, we weren't going to
shoot it as bad as we did the first half.  
  
Thankfully we made some shots, had confidence in each huddle, had some balance
offensively.  
  
I thought these two to my left, Ashley really learned a lot from the first
experience with Tennessee. Really took some things to heart, came out and did
a great job descending and rebounding. Her foul trouble I think was attributed
to the fact we couldn't keep them in front of us on penetration, which we've
got to do a better job.  
  
Meo had a tremendous day. Know when you are being pressured like that, she has
the ability to counter. Two things, I told them we had to out-rebound them and
make more free throws at the end of the day and make more free throws than
they shot. We were able to do those two things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ashley, another SEC coach was saying how much he thought you'd
improved from the start of the season until now. Do you feel like you've
improved even in the last month from the first Tennessee game to this one?  
ASHLEY WILLIAMS: Yes. Honestly I think I'm improving every day. My teammates
help me out with every mistake I made. Yeah, I think I'm improving very well.  
  
Q. Meoshonti, you won three consecutive games against Tennessee. You
seem to play with a lot of confidence against them, come out very
aggressively. How confident were you going into this game, then even after you
fell behind by 10 points?  
MEOSHONTI KNIGHT: To us, it's just a regular game. We just got to come out and
compete every time.  
  
It's tournament time, so a team that can fight the longest and play the
hardest for 40 minutes is going to win. That's what we strive to do.  
  
Q. Ashley, six shots, you blocked three shots. Is this your best shot-
blocking game?  
ASHLEY WILLIAMS: This is not my best shot-blocking game. But I was kind of
glad to block most of their shots because I didn't think I would do it.  
  
Blocking, it was my job. I'm glad I did.  
  
Q. Why do you think you were able to do it?  
ASHLEY WILLIAMS: I was just focused on getting the ball down the opposite side
of the court. If the ball came into my hands, it was just going to get
blocked, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes, you are welcome to return back to the locker
room.  
  
Questions for coach, please.  
  
Q. Kristy, was your game plan that much different going into this game
as opposed to the last game against Tennessee?  
COACH CURRY: It really wasn't that much different. We felt like there were
some things that we really needed to clean up. If we could execute the game
plan at a higher level than we did before, there were little things we felt
like we had to fix at times. We needed to do a better job in transition of
meeting our posts early and not allowing them to get great position. I thought
we did a better job with that today.  
  
I thought that our double was more energized and more active than it was in
Tuscaloosa. I think our kids a little bit took it to heart. Everyone kept
saying Diamond didn't play, Diamond didn't play, Diamond didn't play.  
  
At the end of the day, we felt like Diamond played in Tuscaloosa the year
before. At the end of the day, it was more about what we could control, that's
our energy and effort. To change or defenses, and when we did, be on the same
page, I thought we did a better job with that today.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Ashley's improvement over the course of the
season?  
COACH CURRY: I have to credit that Shereka Wright, she's done an incredible
job with our post players. She is extremely talented. She has learned each and
every day. She's had to learn. Her season's already over. It's just the pace
and rigors of the SEC and how long the season is.  
  
The same thing for Jordan, her playoff, her state championship is done by now.
It's how to learn to manage the off the court as much as on the court for our
freshmen. I think our coaching staff and training staff have done a great job
that.  
  
Ashley's come to work hard every day. She has only scratched the surface with
the potential that she has and has a chance to be a very, very great player by
the time she leaves Alabama.  
  
Q. When you fell behind by 10 points, and Tennessee being a very
talented team, what was going on with your team then, and how did you pull
them together at that juncture?  
COACH CURRY: Just told them to settle down. I think we called timeout. Our
staff did a good job with that. Told them to settle down, that we needed to
understand that we can get stops and rebounds. We're only four stops out of
it. The pressure was on Tennessee. We had no pressure on us today, to play and
to play every play.  
  
We'll take at the end of it what's there. We can control our energy and effort
on every possession.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH CURRY: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Ronni Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28289)

### [Delicia Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32667)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 67, Florida - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Florida.  
  
Coach, if you would start out with an opening statement.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Obviously we're very disappointed with the outcome. Have to give
Texas A&M a lot of credit for the way they adjusted to the things we were
doing defensively in the first half.  
  
But we were trying our best to make the day about us. Things didn't go the way
exactly we thought they would. But I'm really proud of our team's fight. All
the different ways they fought all season long, the way that Ronni led and the
way Ronni fought till the very end I think is a great example to all of our
younger players and all the ones that get the privilege of wearing a Gator
uniform next season.  
  
Our record did not demonstrate the success we experienced this season. In a
way, that's hard to know unless you were in our locker room. But I'm very
proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ronni, I don't want to ask this question, but can you reflect on your
amazing career, everything you've done for this program.  
RONNI WILLIAMS: I've been blessed to work with this great group of girls, this
great group of coaches. I've been nothing but blessed. I've been blessed for
the opportunity and blessed to be here. I wouldn't change anything.  
  
Q. Delicia, I know how much you look up to Ronni. What did you learn
from her this year and everything she's meant to you specifically?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Look up to Ronni Williams a lot. I'm going to miss her. I
wouldn't be the person I am now without Ronni. She's my sister. She always
have a place in my heart. There is nobody that will ever take her spot. Ronni
is that teammate I always wanted to play with no matter what, no matter that
she's not here anymore. I'll still look up to her.  
  
RONNI WILLIAMS: I love you.  
  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: I love you, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you can go back to the locker room.  
  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the team was great in the second quarter. Talk about what
Texas A &M did or Florida wasn't able to do in that third quarter.  
COACH BUTLER: Well, we played great defense. We got a lot of energy from our
defense. Did a better job of rebounding and pursuing the basketball. Didn't do
a great job of that in the first quarter. Evened it out in the second quarter.
That battle was pretty much even through the rest of the game.  
  
Hillsman is a great talent in this league. She's a difficult matchup, in
particular when you have shooters like Williams and Cooper. You have to give
them credit for making plays.  
  
We tried a lot of different ways to try to guard them. They made the plays
that made the difference.  
  
Q. Ronni, what does Hillsman do that makes it so difficult inside?  
RONNI WILLIAMS: She's a big player. She's a big post player. So we just, you
know, messed up a couple times with what we were supposed to do as a team.  
  
But next year we'll be better at it. I believe in 'em. I have faith in 'em.
We'll have something for that next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2017

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Danni Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32664)

### [Khaalia Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32665)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Texas A&M - 67, Florida - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas A&M.  
  
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BLAIR: First, I'd like to commend Florida for what Amanda has gone
through this year, losing two starters in Westbrook and the point guard who
decided to quit on her teammates and transfer to Maryland. That was tough. She
was one of the top 10 players in the league. The other player was one of the
top five defensive players in the year.  
  
I think Amanda did as good as she could. Ronni Williams, it's more than the
stat line about Ronni Williams, it's who she is. There's not a coach in
America that wouldn't like to coach that young lady, and what she's meant to
Florida's program.  
  
I was back there when DeLisha Milton played and Murriel Page, all those great
players. This one ranks right up. She needs to have her jersey retired. She
gave everything she could on the court.  
  
Defensively we did a good job with the three different zones that we ran
against them because we were always trying to identify where Williams was and
make it a little bit harder.  
  
When you can play a zone and have them shoot 0-10 from the three, you know
you're doing something right. The strength of their game is paint points, not
necessarily with their five players, but with their drives. We kept them away
from getting transition baskets. We made them work.  
  
In the first half, set basketball back a little while. I think everybody
watched Scandal and Grey's Anatomy. If they stayed for the second half, we
played as well as Alabama did against Tennessee. When you can shoot 57 percent
and then 66 percent after that horrific first half of shooting, you've got to
do something.  
  
Where we nervous in the first half? I think the team that has the bye is
always nervous when the first game starts because the other team has been into
the flow because they played the night before. They started off a little bit
better than us, even though we were up 11-7.  
  
We just had to find our way. Give a lot of credit to Hillsman. She took a
little bit of tough love at halftime about catching the ball. She was
complaining there was two people on her. I said there's not two people on you
when you first catch the ball. Score in a hurry before the double-team can
come.  
  
All of a sudden, she went 7-7 in the first half. A lot of that is because we
share the ball pretty good with my wings and my point guard.  
  
Then Danni was 3-11. She went 3-5, 3-4 from the free-throw line. Those two
played like they belong on the all-SEC second team along with Curtyce Knox.  
  
The adjustments we made at halftime, we started running some different sets.
Unfortunately my team always plays better when my offense is in front of me
because I'm doing a lot of verbal coaching out there and they're listening,
moving the ball. My point guard is right there. They're doing a heck of a job
on that.  
  
All four games today, the team that won the boards was going to win the game.
It was close. We barely won it. They were getting a lot of offensive rebounds,
11 in the second half, I believe, a lot of them in the fourth quarter. We were
dead tired playing with six.  
  
You win the boards, nine out of ten times you're going to win the ballgame.  
  
Q. Going back to the Mississippi game. After that performance here, then
the first half of this game, scoring 18 points, what changed at halftime in
this game? What switched to make y'all become the team y'all know you can
be?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we were a little bit embarrassed on the shots that we
had. I'm not taking anything away from Florida, but we had great shots. We
didn't catch the ball. Danni was missing some wide-open shots. Curtyce was
0-6.  
  
But we hung around. That's what good teams do. When you cannot play your best,
can you still win a ballgame? We won a ballgame on halfcourt execution, not
turning the ball over. 10 turnovers, I think only two in the second half.  
  
Here is another key thing. We only fouled them seven times in the whole
ballgame. Sometimes that's what a zone will do. Give Coach Starkey a lot of
credit for the three different zones that we ran at them today.  
  
Q. Khaalia, what is the difference in your game, what you can do, the
freedom you have to do it, when you can stay out of foul trouble? Only one
foul in the game today.  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: Well, it definitely keeps me aggressive. If I'm not getting
fouls, I'm doing something right. I just try to stay in that zone where I can
play defense without fouling. I know the last game I didn't play defense
without fouling. I tried to play better with my feet rather than my hands. I
think I did a better job of that today.  
  
Q. I know you give credits to your guards, everybody who feeds you the
ball. Did you just feel it? Coach said before you came up here that you got a
little tough love at halftime. Talk a little bit about that tough love, how it
inspired you.  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: In the first half, I give Florida a lot of credit, I got
frustrated, two people on me. When I did get the ball, I was frustrated, drop
it or miss the shot.  
  
When we got in the locker room, Coach Blair told me I basically needed to get
it together. My teammates told me they were going to keep giving me the ball,
finish over smaller defenders.  
  
They got confidence in me. That helps me, gives me confidence in myself.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the mindset of this team since you beat
Tennessee back on February 12th, Danni, the troubles you all have been through
on the court, how you stuck together from then until now.  
DANNI WILLIAMS: I think the past two weeks we just didn't finish. We were
right there in several of those ballgames. We weren't mentally tough in those
games.  
  
Coming in here with a fresh start, knowing we played Florida twice, we weren't
going to get beat tonight. That was the mindset we had throughout the whole
game.  
  
Even the first half, when our shots weren't dropping, we were down three at
half, we just kept saying, We're going to keep pushing. We all believe in each
other and knew what we could do in the second half.  
  
Q. Three-point defense hasn't been a strong suit for your game. Bottom
of the SEC stats in defense against the three-pointer, tonight they went 0-10.
How much of that is them not shooting it well? How much is what y'all are able
to do to alter their shots?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: I think it's a little bit of both. We were focused on Ronni
Williams. We really packed the paint. They were open on several of their
shots.  
  
I think we were recovering fast enough where their shooters had to put it on
the floor, which they weren't comfortable doing it.  
  
Q. Missouri tomorrow. Overtime game in Columbia, a game you felt you
had, you should have had. Khaalia?  
KHAALIA HILLSMAN: We're very much aware of how good Missouri is. They have a
bunch of really good players. But they got away with one at their place. We
really don't want them to get away with one here.  
  
We're trying to get onto the next day. They're another team sitting in our
way. We have to come out and have a way better start than we did today because
they're a much -- they're really smart defensively, good offensively. We
definitely need to have a better start than we did today.  
  
But I'm excited to play this team.  
  
Q. Gary, talk about Missouri, an early scouting report.  
COACH BLAIR: We go from Ronni Williams to Sophie Cunningham. That's like me
going from Julia Roberts to Jennifer Aniston, my gosh. They're two of the best
players in the league. You and I can dream.  
  
At the same time I really respect both of those players. They're both six foot
tall. They can put it on the floor. They can do everything.  
  
Basically we held Cunningham to 36 against us the first time, so give them a
lot of credit.  
  
But here's the thing, not taking anything away from them, they're the best
three-point shooting team in the league. They're not going to shoot 0-10.
We're going to have to get out and cover them. At the same time, they
penetrate. They have a little bit more balance than what Florida has. They
have more people that can score.  
  
Her sister is having a great senior year, Porter and Michaelis. Michaelis, we
slowed down when we played them. She's just very good. They have tremendous
balance, a good point guard. A couple kids come off the bench. That's why
she's Coach of the Year. She's had a heck of a year.  
  
But we've got to worry about A&M. We cannot get off to the slow start and
expect to come back. Even when Missouri loses, they shoot over 45% from the
field. As many threes as they shoot off of transition, set plays... They're
just a good team.  
  
We're going to sleep a little bit later in the morning. We're going to watch a
little game film, the, coaches tonight. We got one more time to dance. I'm
looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
The best day in basketball in the SEC is always on Friday 'cause all the teams
are generally going to the NCAA tournament. It doesn't get any better. You'll
have all the WNBA scouts. They were there today watching. That's the best day
in the SEC, Friday of the SEC tournament.  
  
All right. I'm past your deadline. Let's go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Alabama - 77, Vanderbilt - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome Vanderbilt.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH WHITE: Well, obviously disappointed with how we performed today. But you
got to give Alabama a lot of credit. They took it to us on both ends of the
floor. They were really aggressive defensively. They were really aggressive
attacking the paint as well.  
  
You just can't show up at tournament time and expect to turn on the lights.
For whatever reason, we weren't ready.  
  
But Alabama played really well. You got to give them a lot of credit. Balanced
scoring, which we knew they had, a lot of balance, aggressive, shared the
basketball. So congratulations to them and best of luck to them as they
continue their journey.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rachel, obviously a big day for you offensively. Seemed like you were
hunting shots early. It was working. What did you see out there that was
helping you find a groove?  
RACHEL BELL: I want to start off by saying congrats to Alabama. They played
their hearts out. It was a good game.  
  
I mean, honestly just coming in the game, I mean, I got to give it all to my
teammates. Great passes, great screens. I was just finding the open areas,
trying to get us baskets when the defense allowed it, so...  
  
Just thank them.  
  
Q. Minta, obviously it's a tough day to see it come to an end. When you
see what Coach White is building here, you've been here a couple years now,
the freshmen are playing well, what do you see for the future of this program
going forward?  
MINTA SPEARS: Yeah, you'll have to excuse me. I'm an ugly cryer.  
  
Yeah, we were talking in the locker room. I obviously have had a lot of
experience with different coaches. This coaching staff is so great. I believe
in what they're doing wholeheartedly.  
  
We also talked about that, you know, whenever these freshmen, Rachel next
year, whenever they play their last game, you don't want to feel like this.  
  
I believe in them so much. We just talked about that we've got to go back to
work, put in work for this off-season, make steps for the future. The future
is bright. I definitely believe in everything they're doing here at
Vanderbilt.  
  
Q. Rachel, turnovers were an issue today. They were turning those
turnovers into points. Were they just being overly aggressive or you making
mistakes?  
RACHEL BELL: I know that's something we've been trying to get better at all
year, is just taking care of the ball.  
  
Alabama, they did turn up the pressure a little bit with their press a little
bit. That's mainly on us. We throw, like, soft, loopy passes. We just have to
be smarter, make smarter passes and get in the open area a little better.  
  
That's something we have to work on in the off-season and get better at for
next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. You are excused to return to the locker
room.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach White.  
  
Q. Coach, Seawright is a local player. I am with the local paper. While
she didn't play today, can you tell us anything about how she's contributed to
your team?  
COACH WHITE: Miyia has come in and she's been a defensive stopper for us. She
helps us every day in practice with the way that she contributes. She's been
an energy player for us at points this season.  
  
Obviously when we change the system, we're looking for certain things, not
everybody is going to get a look every single night. But the fact that she's
continued to work and continued to challenge us every day has been a credit to
her.  
  
Q. As I asked Rachel, turnovers today dictated a lot of the offense,
what Alabama did. Been kind of an issue all year. Did Alabama do anything
particularly different or was this more maybe just issues on Vanderbilt's own
offense?  
COACH WHITE: I don't know that they did anything different, but I think we
have continued to have problems with length and athleticism when it comes to
our passing, our decision making, our ball handling.  
  
At times it seems like we're about two seconds too late in making our
decisions. Our picking and choosing went to attack and went to retreat. It's
been a little bit late as well.  
  
I think when you're playing teams who are quick in the passing lanes, are
long, you can't pass over top of them, you need to be able to find angles.  
  
We weren't cutting with urgency today. A lot of times when you're cutting with
urgency, you force rotations that give you open looks. We weren't doing that.  
  
But like Rachel said, it's something we have to be better at, be better ball
handlers, passers, be better decision makers.  
  
Q. You entered this game third in the country at a three-point
percentage. That part today was a slower day on the offense. Was that anything
in particular that they were doing?  
COACH WHITE: I'm not sure that I've ever seen Erin Whalen go over, not that I
can recall. But I think a couple things, when they turned us over early like
they did, we get rushed in offense. We rush our shots. We were a little
helter-skelter in terms of our ball movement. When we shoot our best
percentages, we get it off of drive and kick, get it off of ball movement and
player movement, not just off of transition threes or one-pass shot offense.  
  
I felt like we were doing a lot of that today. So some of that goes to them
just putting the pressure on us and forcing us into quick shots. Sometimes you
have those nights, as well.  
  
I didn't like that we settled for a lot of jump shots early as opposed to
attacking and getting to the free-throw line or getting to the rim. I think we
have to have more of an aggressive mindset offensively.  
  
That might have contributed, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Marqu'es and Minta, two seniors, what have they
meant to this program even at your short time being at Vanderbilt?  
COACH WHITE: Yeah, those two are just special. They're really good leaders.
They lead by example in how they play every single day because they leave it
all on the floor. They never take a play off. They never take a practice play
off. They're always very intentional with the things they do. They communicate
with their teammates in the right way at the right time.  
  
They're warriors. Marqu'es is just probably second to Tamika Catchings, the
toughest player I've ever been around. I've been around some tough players. I
really do think she is one of the toughest kids I've ever seen.  
  
To do the things that she does with being undersized, with not being as fast
as everybody else, it's just incredible.  
  
Minta is a coach in the making. She's got one of the best basketball minds of
any young person I've ever been around. She gets it. She understands. She
understands her strengths and weaknesses. It's really hard to step outside
yourself as a player when you're still playing. She's able to do that, step
outside herself and see the greater good. That's special. That's special.  
  
From day one, when Minta wasn't participating because of her surgery, she was
leading. She was calling me. We were talking about different things she could
do to be a better leader. And that hasn't changed.  
  
Regardless of good times, bad times, good games, bad games, the sign of true
leaders is being steady the entire time. These two have been two of the best
leaders I've been around.  
  
Q. As any new coach at a new place has to do, you've been installing
your culture, your expectations. When you look forward, five freshmen that
played significantly this year, what do you expect from everybody going
forward? How do you look at the off-season, the future of this program?  
COACH WHITE: In the off-season, we have to become better ball handlers. We
have to work on our skill set. We got to get tougher.  
  
I think everything that we do needs to be about being stronger physically,
mentally and emotionally. Everything that we do has to be about paying
attention to the details, the minutia. I think a lot of times, as young
players, whether it be freshmen or some of our returners, they don't always
value the little things.  
  
In this game, there really are no little things. I think getting back to the
basics, continuing to work on skill development, getting stronger, getting
faster, getting tougher, are going to be things we look for over the summer.  
  
In terms of the future, we have a great foundation with that freshman class.
There's no doubt about it. They all got a lot of experience, not only
physically, but I think mentally as well, seeing the things we've gone through
all season long. We have to get healthy first. We have some injuries we need
to deal with, get everybody healthy.  
  
But I hope they learned some valuable lessons from our two seniors. I think
the biggest question moving forward is leadership. Who is going to step up and
be that leader, those leaders, do it collectively? As we continue to move
forward, we'll figure out who that is. We'll continue to build our system,
continue to bring in players that sort of fit our system.  
  
Our freshmen have gotten a lot of experience in trial by fire. That's going to
do us a heck of a lot of good going into the summer and heading into next
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH WHITE: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Jimmy Dykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28312)

### [Bailey Zimmerman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32620)

### [Jessica Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26446)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Florida - 71, Arkansas - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas.  
  
Coach, if you would start us out with an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH DYKES: Well, very proud of, again, it's the same song, verse 28 in our
year, just how hard we fight, but not quite enough to win a ballgame.  
  
I thought we did a lot of good things. We got off 15 more shots than they did.
We shot 72 times, they shot 57 times. We just didn't make enough of ours.  
  
Free-throw line was the difference. Four points from the free-throw line, they
got 19.  
  
They are one of the better, if not the best, offensive rebounding team in our
league. They kind of punished us on the boards today, too, as well.  
  
Very proud of our fight. Jess, being a senior, continued to fight. I think all
of our young ladies fought hard. We've never not fought hard. We've always
hung in there.  
  
Had a chance in the fourth quarter. We cut it. You go back and look at that
game, two or three shots that could have gone down for us, they didn't. A
couple, three went down for them. Ends up a 10-point game.  
  
Disappointed in our record, not disappointed at all in our fight and toughness
and our togetherness.  
  
We talked about it in the locker room afterwards: As a family, when you get
beat like we have the last five or six weeks, your character gets tested.  
  
This isn't the only time in life you're going to get knocked down. We talked
about that. We will all be better people, better coaches, everything, better
student-athletes, better young ladies going forward because of it.  
  
I do feel that in all my heart.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Bailey, talk about your comeback in the first half, how you tied it
up at halftime. What was the difference between the first and second half?  
BAILEY ZIMMERMAN: Everybody on my team was positive. They were just like, Keep
playing through, even though I got hit in the eye and scratched.  
  
I just want to play hard for Jess and Cooley, since I knew it was their last
year. Our season hasn't been going really great, but I wanted to play hard for
them.  
  
Q. Jessica, you've had a stellar career. You're the only senior starter.
Talk about what you hope them to learn from you, and what have you learned
from them?  
JESSICA JACKSON: I learned a lot from them. First off, they always fight. They
never stop fighting every game. Especially Bailey, she's one of our toughest
players we have. Like, she'll get knocked down and come right back in a game.
Each one of my teammates, we fight really hard.  
  
I guess what they could learn from me is, I guess, being vocal. Yeah, being
vocal. And being a team player and stuff.  
  
Q. And the leadership?  
JESSICA JACKSON: Yeah, Bailey is going to be an upperclassman. You have the
other one. I think I made a good example of leadership. I'm pretty sure
they're going to handle the role pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Shaquera Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32627)

### [Jordan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32615)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome members of the Alabama basketball team.  
  
Coach Curry, start out with an opening statement.  
  
COACH CURRY: Just really proud of our team today. The consistent energy and
effort for 40 minutes is something that we've been looking to do. We've had  
  
moments where we've been in nearly every basketball game and have been so
close. It was a little thing here or there. I thought today the little things
we really took care of, or big things, and impacted the game. It was a great
effort from our entire team.  
  
Great balance today. I thought our point guard really controlled the game. To
have six assists and no turnovers in 13 minutes, there's been no freshman in  
  
the country that has been more valuable to their team than Jordan Lewis. I
thought that Shaquera really grew up an awful lot today and has been working
hard. It is just great balance. Having four seniors is what it takes to be
successful. The exciting things is they're all coming back. We're excited for
the future and look forward to the challenge tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, it seemed like the three-point basketball was y'all's friend
early in this game. What did you see there that was making that work for your
offense?  
JORDAN LEWIS: Well, a lot of people only see Hannah as a three-point shooter
on our team, so a lot of people guard out heavy on her. To get her open more
times, we have to learn to knock down shots, make others available when you're
open, make the open shot.  
  
Q. Shaquera, looking at the offensive rebounding stats, what was the
key?  
SHAQUERA WADE: Just be aggressive, be aggressive and to rebound. I know they
did a very good job on the rebounding end. You know, we didn't give up. We did
our best to push them out and go for the boards, just stop 'em as much as we
could.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes, you are dismissed. Thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Curry.  
  
Q. It seemed early on you were hitting a lot of threes. That was a big
part of the offense. Did you see anything there that was keeping that a big
part of the attack?  
COACH CURRY: We want our team to be shot-ready on the catch and ball reversal.
For everyone, I think we're at our best when we have great balance. We want to
encourage all of our kids that shoot the three to have that confidence.  
  
I think at Vanderbilt, we made 11 threes. I think they made 11 threes. We can
shoot the three ball. When we're open, it's on ball reversal, that's about
being aggressive. We have to take the open look and make others realize we can
shoot the ball.  
  
Q. It seems like you forced a lot of turnovers, turned those into
points. I'm sure that's a thing you focus on in practice, turning that into
production. Why was that important?  
COACH CURRY: I think it's important to maximize the possession and take high-
percentage shots. I thought our shot selection today was as good as it's been
all day. When we have an open window or an easy look, we need to convert
those.  
  
We've been in a position all year where when we convert turnovers to point, we
can convert those into points, it makes our team an awful lot better.  
  
Q. Everybody wants to win the first game in a tournament to keep going.
To win in this fashion, offensively playing well, why is that important for
you going forward?  
COACH CURRY: Again, it shows that we're making progress forward. So many of us
in that locker room have been in this position and had success, but not one of
those players have. To learn success, you have to have success.  
  
I think today was really important. It shows that our kids are doing things
that are necessary to continue to grow and improve. It's a brand-new season.
We talk about bounce back, the past 72 hours. It's always about your response.
I thought our kids responded.  
  
We were disappointed. We felt like we had a chance. To only have five wins...
How are we going to respond to that? What have we learned? That's about life
every day, how do you respond when things don't go your way.  
  
I like our response today.  
  
Q. Talk about your matchup for tomorrow.  
COACH CURRY: We're going to try to enjoy this one for a little while.
Obviously, I think we understand what we need to do to be successful. But
certainly we'll get together here in a little bit as a staff. We're already
prepared. We're going to let our kids enjoy this. There's so many things to
learn. We're going to try to enjoy the day. Tonight we'll turn the page and
get prepared.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH CURRY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2017

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Dyandria Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32618)

### [Ronni Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28289)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Florida - 71, Arkansas - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Florida.  
  
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Very proud of the way our team played, in particular in the
second half, the way we rebounded, our shot selection, our overall passion and
energy. I think it was reflective of the outcome.  
  
Our goal today was to be 1-0. We didn't know exactly what that was going to
look like. We just wanted to make sure we did whatever it took to win.  
  
Some amazing individual performances, some timely baskets. Really proud of our
second-half defensive effort. That's what shows our pride. That's where you
show your passion. Our team stepped up and did that today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. D, obviously a huge night for you offensively. What got into you?  
DYANDRIA ANDERSON: Coach Butler told me to be a leader out there. I put my
foot on the gas. My teammates were giving me opening spots, great screens by
Ronni. Haley was able to get me to the basket, and I was just able to finish.  
  
Q. Do you feel there was a turning point for you guys where you captured
the momentum?  
DYANDRIA ANDERSON: At halftime, Coach Butler said we needed to play with
passion, play how we play. After that, everybody was focused, tuned in, back
to us being us. That kind of led me to going hard, finishing, everybody doing
their job.  
  
Q. Ronni, a fellow post player Ty Fleming had an phenomenal game.  
RONNI WILLIAMS: Ty is relentless, whether it's blocking the shot, getting the
rebound. She was just very relentless. She understood we needed to come out
with a bang. As a senior, she stepped up to the plate and leaded us.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts entering today's game? Potentially an SEC
tournament final, a loss here and things are finished for the season.  
RONNI WILLIAMS: Just making sure I stayed focus on doing all the right things
as a team, making sure as a team we stayed together, locked in, bought in,
continue to do what we do best.  
  
Q. The third quarter obviously you took over offensively and on the
rebounding. What changed from halftime to know you had to make the push in the
second half?  
RONNI WILLIAMS: Well, our defense. We took pride in our defense. When we do
that, defense makes offense much easier for our team. So we stepped up big-
time with the rebounds, making sure we played our type of defense.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Offensive rebounding is what we do best. We knew we needed to
pick that up second half.  
  
Q. D, in the fourth quarter, you knew you had to be relentless in the
play. How do you think the team responded?  
DYANDRIA ANDERSON: I think we did great. We got the shots we wanted. Everybody
was in the right spots. We got rebounds, did everything we do.  
  
The fourth quarter.  
  
A. For us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, defense is obviously something you stress quite a bit. Can you
assess the difference in the first and half?  
COACH BUTLER: I think they said it very well. We just played with more
passion, more purpose, really trying to be us, not be reactive, playing with
just overall greater energy.  
  
We pressed a little bit more in the third quarter. That's something we wanted
to try to do, make a difference.  
  
If you don't press with great energy, you're going to give up layups. I
thought our team really took responsibility, was really accountable, If we are
going to play defense this way, we're going to make it work.  
  
Took a lot of charges. Haley took a charge. Brook took a charge. That's the
way we play. I thought that was really important.  
  
Q. What do you remember about Texas A &M games?  
COACH BUTLER: They were great SEC ballgames. We just came up a little bit
short for different reasons in both games. In the first game, we turned the
ball over too much. We left Curtyce Knox wide open for threes. In the second
game, we didn't do a very good job of containing Knox on penetration. They got
us rotated a little bit. We got out-rebounded.  
  
As D mentioned, that's something we take great pride in. That's where we want
to show pride in who we are. We know we got to have a much better defensive
effort than the we the two previous trips.  
  
Q. Ronni spoke on her behalf, but the rebounding and blocking effort,
what did you see from her performance?  
COACH BUTLER: As I was sitting here looking at the stat sheet, Ronni had 12
rebound Delicia Washington had nine and Ty had nine. It felt like Ty's nine
were so timely, they were huge. If we were going to give a timely award, she
would win it today because she got huge rebounds, and she only scored six
points, but they were big, big baskets. The way she protected the rim for us
tonight was great and critical for us. She played like a senior.  
  
Q. The transition today was great today, passing the ball. What did you
see in the transition play?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, we wanted to rebound well and ignite our transition, then
do a good job of picking our spots. I think we did an okay job with that. That
probably wasn't our best thing we did today.  
  
When we played those plays in transition, when they were a result of good
defense or tips, that's where we get our energy from. We're an energy team. It
got our crowd more into the game, our bench more into the game. That was part
of the game plan. Let's sustain the game plan. Let's not get away from what we
know will make this the result we want. I think you saw a good job of that, as
well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Go Gators.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=WOMEN%27S+NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 26, 2017

  

### [June Daugherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23417)

### [Pinelopi Pavlopoulou](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33307)

### [Caila Hailey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32008)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Washington State - 74, Iowa - 66  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: As you can tell, we're a little new at the postseason media
stuff. Starting off, thanks for being here. I'll tell you what, Lisa has got a
hell of a team, and those kids are young and they play lights out, and there
obviously was no quit in this group. I just want to congratulate them on their
season. I'm sure that you, the media and the fans, the great fans that were
here today and all over Iowa are going to be really excited to continue to
support that group next year. That's going to be a team that I'll bet you is
going to be in the NCAA. I'll put a bet on that if I'm allowed to legally with
the rules. But they are very impressive. We had to give it our all today to
win, and really excited about the win and to advance.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys made all the really big plays in that fourth
quarter. Whenever Iowa would make a run, somebody would make a big shot or get
an offensive rebound.  
CAILA HAILEY: We work really hard in practice, and we always talk about
finishing plays, and at every practice we always talk about finishing plays,
and when we came into the game today that was the most important factor at the
end of that game was finishing plays and gutting it out and getting those
last-minute rebounds and finishing those tough shots and just staying sound
offensively and staying poised defensively.  
  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: The other thing I want to say is through these
postseason rides so far, we've had really close games, and we've learned that
you have to play for 40 minutes, and you can't give up until the end. We
battled today it felt like, it was an awesome game. It was an awesome
atmosphere. We really wanted it because of the adversity that we've been
through this year. It's just that we can't give it to anybody. If the other
team is better than us, they will have to get it from us. They will have to
take it.  
  
But at this point, we really, really want it.  
  
Q. Why was your defense so effective, not only just interior but
outside? You rarely gave up an open three.  
CAILA HAILEY: In the scout we talked about them being really good on the
inside, but we didn't want to sleep on them outside because their bigs are
good at finding them on the perimeter so we wanted to make sure we stayed
focused and made sure we were aware on the outside and limit their three-point
shooting because that can put a team back in the game like it did UC Davis
when we played them.  
  
Q. They were 0 for 13 from the three-point range in the second half. Did
you guys realize that?  
CAILA HAILEY: No, I didn't realize that.  
  
Q. What was your game plan against Megan?  
PINELOPI PAVLOPOULOU: This is a question for the post players, but we know
that she's a really good player, and she had a double-double today. I don't
know, I think she's averaging a double-double, right? Close, yeah.  
  
We knew that she was going to do a lot of damage to us, so we wanted to make
sure that the post player, our post player is on her, switching around, just
trying to make her feel uncomfortable, and then the weak side guard would
double on the pass.  
  
Q. Coach, how was your defense so effective?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: You know, I'm so fortunate. I've got a great coaching staff,
and I know you guys don't know us real well, but Rod Jensen joined my staff
two years ago, and Rod was on the men's side for 44 years, and he's a
defensive genius. You saw some of that genius today. Not only does he get the
kids to believe and buy in defensively, but you know, they just play so
daggone hard because right now we're a little bit down with our injuries and
stuff offensively, so we've got to go work on the other end and try to turn
people over and try to limit touches.  
  
You know, once again, he came up with a fantastic scout, and these kids just
-- they can't wait. It's really, what was it 35 -- I don't know how many
games, but they can't wait to get into the scout when Coach Rod comes into the
room because he's so passionate about it and he's so excited about it, and
they believe in him, and they believe that he's going to have us ready; what
are we going to do, let's do it. He mixed some things up today. We were in our
match-up player-to-player, we were in our match-up zone. We were covering down
a lot. Actually in our match-up zone against the post player you were talking
about, No. 10, fantastic player, and we were just trying to keep that ball
from going in there because so much of their offense goes through her.  
  
I think the other key for us was trying to get tremendous pressure on the
basketball on the outside. We knew that they were very capable of lobbing
because we were mixing up fronting a little bit and stuff. But, you know, a
big key was just making sure our exterior people were really getting up and
pressuring the basketball.  
  
So if the lobs went, we had time to rotate and maybe get a charge, maybe get a
tip away. But try to maybe get a rushed shot by her because, enormous respect
-- that kid keeps the ball so hard and just turns, and she's automatic.  
  
So that worked well for us.  
  
But Rod Jensen, it's just a pleasure to have him on staff because he gets it
done every day.  
  
Q. The players mentioned the atmosphere. Can you comment on the
environment?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah. You know, I think for us, we're so fortunate that we are
in the No. 1 league in America in the Pac-12 and that we've been on the road
at Stanford, we've been on the road at Oregon State sell-outs, we've been on
the road at UCLA, huge crowds, and the list goes on and on and on. I think the
Pac-12, especially for these young people, the games have really helped us get
ready to come into this arena.  
  
I'm a Big Ten girl. I played a few years ago at Ohio State, and I don't
remember crowds like this when we came to Iowa. They were good crowds but not
great crowds, and they were so loud and they're so proud of their team, and
they should be, and they're in it all the way through.  
  
Great crowd. I think that -- you talk about answering the bell. You know,
late, hey, they made a run, now we've got to answer the bell, big shots and
stuff. That's us playing in the Pac-12 and being able to get ready every
night. Washington sell-outs, Stanford sell-outs, on and on and on. So I think
it really helped this young group toughen up a little bit, and say, you know
what, that's part of basketball; you made your shot, I'm going to make mine on
the other end, and that's important right now for us to continue to build that
confidence.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION

## March 26, 2017

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Kathleen Doyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33245)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Washington State - 74, Iowa - 66  
  
LISA BLUDER: First of all, I want to thank the crowd. They were great. They
came out. They supported us today. They were loud. They were engaged. You
know, we didn't give them a whole lot to cheer about after the first quarter.
The first quarter was really nice, and then after that, their defense really
disrupted us. We really had trouble boxing out. We gave up too many O-boards
for them, too many second chance shots for them.  
  
But you know, we didn't shoot well from the three-point line or from the free-
throw line today, and obviously those things hurt us. But in saying that, it's
been a great year.  
  
You know, I'm really, really proud of this team. We lost Tania, could have
buckled then. We have three freshmen in the starting lineup. We could make
excuses for everything, and these guys never did.  
  
We had great seniors on this team. Ally Disterhoft, Lex Kastanek and Hailey
Schneden were three fabulous seniors, and we're sorry to see them go, but they
should go out of here holding their heads high. They had great careers. They
are tremendous women as well as just basketball players, so they have nothing
to be ashamed about. They really tried to lead our team this year, and all of
them did a great job with that.  
  
I'm really excited about the future. Megan gets her 18th double-double,
Kathleen has a career-high eight assists. I think the future looks incredibly
bright.  
  
Q. Megan, was that one of the toughest defensive match-ups that you've
had all season?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I wouldn't say that. We've faced a lot of bigger challenges
in the Big Ten, but they did a nice job. They came out really intensely right
from the get-go, and I think we handled it a little bit better in the second
half, but we kept fighting each possession. So we'll just get better, and
we'll see from here.  
  
Q. Ally, what particularly were they doing from the second quarter on
that bothered you guys?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I mean, like Coach said, I think they turned up their
defensive intensity a little bit. They got a lot of offensive rebounds, and
when a team is offensive rebounding like that and we're struggling to hit some
of our shots that we normally do, it's kind of tough. We tried to buckle down
a little bit in the second half, but they're just a very physical team, and
they stuck with it.  
  
Q. It was kind of hard to get an open shot, wasn't it, on the perimeter?
You'd think with them doubling down on Megan most of the time that it would
have been easy, but they really were racing around, weren't they?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I thought they rotated really well in both their player
and zone defenses. They were really focused on that on-ball pressure, but
yeah, I think even when we did get kick-outs from the post, they did a pretty
good job of scrambling in those situations. Just one of those games you have
to credit them for their defensive effort.  
  
Q. Did it feel like they were answering everything well? I thought
especially in the second half, the fourth quarter, whenever you guys would put
together a run to get close, they would answer and kind of quiet the crowd.  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I feel like they hit a lot of big shots, so credit to
them.  
  
Q. Megan and Kathleen, even with the new guard with the old guard, I
guess kind of the emotions in seeing the seniors graduate?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's tough. They're pretty amazing people, being able
to be with them on the court, on and off.  
  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I agree. They all had great careers and did a lot for
this program, so we just want to make sure that they know how grateful we are
for their efforts.  
  
Q. Ally, that was your last time walking off the court. Do you want to
take us through what you're feeling right now?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, it's tough. The program has given me so much these past
four years. I've said it before, but these coaches are incredible, and the
younger girls on this team are going to go on and do some really great things.
Lex and I were talking about that, we can't wait to come back and watch them
do that.  
  
Obviously I'm going to really miss it. I'm always going to be a Hawkeye,
though, whether I'm wearing that jersey or not. Very, very thankful for the
opportunities that I had when I was here.  
  
Q. It looked like Makenzie Meyer couldn't get a shot. It was really
tough to even find an open shot.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I thought they were really physical, and we didn't adjust
well to that. It's not like we haven't seen physical basketball, but I think
it was a combination of their length and being physical that kind of hurt us a
little bit.  
  
They're just aggressive, and we just really kind of struggled with that. We
had 16 turnovers, which isn't terrible, but it was more like what you said. We
just really didn't get into an offensive flow because they really disrupted us
so much.  
  
Q. Did you think that it was one of the tougher match-ups for Megan all
year?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think they did a good job of doubling her when she got
the basketball, and there was some good size in there, as well. So I thought
they did a nice job really defending her. They had more paint points than us.
That's something that we always pride ourselves on, that we need more paint
points than the other team, and they got more than us today, and a lot of
that, I think, though, was the boards, us not boxing out and giving up those
easy twos.  
  
Q. From your perspective on the bench, how hard is it to kind of keep
mounting comeback after comeback when they do makes those big shots?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they did, they really did. Every time we'd get it down to
three, then they'd make a basket, and it was hard. If we could have just
caught up maybe one time, but again, our fans were really trying to do their
best of trying to support us and trying to give us energy out there. Thanks to
them. But it's a good team. They're a good team. They've had some great wins.
They beat Oregon who's in the Elite 8 right now. They've had some injuries and
had to come back from injuries throughout the year, and they're playing pretty
well right now.  
  
Q. What has Ally brought to the team?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I mean, the record book speaks for itself, but more than
that, it's the academic accolades, it's everything that she's done in our
community, the role model that she is. I mean, you'd be hard fought to find a
better role model in women's athletics, and I'm not saying we don't have a
bunch of them here. We do. But boy, she just does it all. She does everything
for us, whether it's on the floor, off the floor, in the classroom, going to
watch high school games in the community. I mean, she just is so active in the
community, and she loves it. She loves this community. She loves Iowa.  
  
It's going to be hard to replace her, but at the same time, this is what we
do, right? Every four years we have to do this. Every year I guess we have to
do this.  
  
Q. So next year you do have to replace that; what are you looking
forward to about this team next year?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, what I'm looking forward to is that we got some great play
for our freshmen in the last couple of weeks. I think that's exciting. When
you look at Megan and Kathleen, I mean, you guys know, you see how good our
freshmen are and our sophomore classes. If Tania can come back healthy, that
would be pretty important for us. We're bringing in a really nice player in
Jinaya Houston. She's going to do well for us. You know, the future looks
incredibly bright for our team.  
  
Q. The biggest thing you want the girls to work on in the off-season?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, right now I want to say box-outs. Three-point shooting,
that will be another one. But we'll sit down as a coaching staff and really
identify every player, a development plan for every player, and start working
on those. Give them about a week or two off and then we'll start doing that in
April with them, toward the end of April, and start working on their
individual skills.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=WOMEN%27S+NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 23, 2017

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Haley Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28332)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 80, Colorado - 62  
  
JR PAYNE: I would like to thank the people of Iowa, the University of Iowa.
Every single person we've come into contact with in this arena over the last
two days has been unbelievably welcoming, respectful of our coaching staff,
our players, and we really appreciate the way we've been treated by everyone
here, and just congratulations to Coach. That's an incredible number of wins,
and their team played unbelievably hard and a great effort.  
  
I'm very proud of our team tonight, as well. The outcome certainly wasn't what
we wanted, but I'm very proud of our effort and our tenacity, our willingness.
We're shorthanded, or whatever the circumstances are, our team never quit
against a very, very good Iowa team, and I think that's to be commended, not
just for Haley, one of our star seniors, but our entire team.  
  
Q. Gustafson obviously had a huge game in the previous round. Did you
really try to focus on slowing her down, and did that kind of open things
up?  
JR PAYNE: I don't know what opened things up on the perimeter, but they were
certainly open, that's for sure. But no, you can see the numbers. Megan is a
great interior player, and yeah, there was a focus on being able to contain
her. We didn't expect to stop her, but working to contain her, and obviously
that opened up the shooters more.  
  
Q. It seemed like Iowa made two big runs in the first and second
quarters, and at first they were able to get to the basket, penetrate real
easily, and then all of a sudden the threes came. Was that sort of a result of
the penetration do you think?  
JR PAYNE: Honestly, they were fantastic, and it seemed like everything they
tried to do offensively -- I thought we were not particularly good defensively
because we were giving up penetration and we were losing shooters. I think the
combination of them playing really, really well and us not playing well
defensively made things open up like that.  
  
Q. Haley, you did talk in the locker room about overachieving; can you
expand on that a little bit?  
HALEY SMITH: Yeah, after the season we had last year, I know as far as what
people thought outside of the team and what we would accomplish this year, I
think we did a really great job of meeting that challenge and stepping up, and
I think that in the preseason, during the Pac-12 season and then going into
the postseason, we'd really done well to step up and face adversity and fight
and really reestablish kind of the Colorado name and the Colorado brand of
basketball.  
  
Obviously, this was my last game, and I won't be playing anymore. I'm
confident in where the program is being left, and I'm really happy to have had
the new coaches come in, and I'm excited to see where the program goes, and I
know it's only going up from here.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys got pretty good shots? Were they just not
falling today?  
HALEY SMITH: I think we got some good shots. And I think things were falling
for parts of the game. But we just weren't really being really aggressive
throughout the whole game, at least in the first half, and not really getting
to the rim. We were settling for more outside shots, which were falling, but
when they're not, then we've got to make sure we get to the basket, get to the
free-throw line, which we didn't do in the first half. We changed that around
the second half. We just weren't being as aggressive on the offensive side.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=WOMEN%27S+NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 23, 2017

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Alexa Kastanek](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33288)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 80, Colorado - 62  
  
Q. Alexa, did the basket just look big tonight?  
ALEXA KASTANEK: Actually it did, yeah, just throwing things up there and
hoping they go in. That's how I play most of my games. No, my teammates just
got me open shots. When Ally passed me my first one it was open, my feet were
set, and when that first one falls and you get the lid off the rim. I think
that's when, as a shooter, know your percentages and just keep shooting.  
  
Q. Did you feel especially good going into this game during warm-ups?
Were the shots falling?  
ALEXA KASTANEK: Not any more than usual, kind of just was having an upbeat
warmup, kind of just staying light with things, trying to keep my teammates
light, just knowing that every game, even thought there's the added pressure
of, okay, now we're the only eight left and then we'll be the only four and
then the only two, just knowing that keeping my teammates light is going to be
huge for the rest of us and the rest of our journey.  
  
Q. Alexa, they've talked about how this postseason really benefits the
younger players. For you as a senior, what does it mean to you to keep
advancing?  
ALEXA KASTANEK: Just one more game. I mean, for us, it's going to be the last
time we play basketball, so just knowing that each of these games is
potentially our last and just going out with that mentality, and then, like
you said, getting our younger people some more experience with. They throw on
that press, now what do we do. We were up 20, so it was good that we got to
play with it a little bit, and just getting the experience for the younger
girls and just knowing them, knowing that we can pass on the information that
we've had from the players ahead of us, as well.  
  
Q. Were you guys looking to drive, penetrate? In the first quarter it
looked like you guys were at the basket all the time.  
ALEXA KASTANEK: I think we kind of just took what they were giving us really
well in the first half. We drove, kicked out for wide-open threes, and then
when they started to hedge more towards our three-point shooters, the basket
was wide open. So I think we just really took what they were giving us.  
  
Q. Ally, what was going right in that 17-0 run in the second quarter
when the crowd is getting into it? Just seemed like every single shot was
falling. What's going through your guys' head at that point?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I think we were taking really good shots. I think we were
sharing the ball. We were looking to make the extra pass. People were shooting
up good shots for even better shots, and I think that shooting can be
contagious sometimes, especially from the three-point line. So like Lex said,
to see a couple of those early ones go down was big, and then we kept feeding
people who were hot.  
  
Q. Megan, I don't know how many people have played basketball here in
the last 40 years, but you're one of four people now that has scored 600
points in a season. What's the significance of that to you?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I just have to credit my teammates again. They always do a
great job of setting me up. Game after game, my coaches and my teammates
believe in me, in practice every day. So my goal every day in practice and
every game is just to work as hard as I can for them.  
  
Q. Did you feel like they were really concentrating on you after the
terrific game the other day?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, a little bit. I think that's when it came into the
inside-out game. They were collapsing, I was able to hit it to our shooters,
and credit to our shooters tonight; they did a phenomenal job.  
  
Q. Ally, I think this is eight straight home wins; how much more
confident are you guys when you set foot out here?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I mean, we love playing at Carver, especially with the fan
support that we have. Fans don't know it, but the energy that they bring
really influences the game, and I know that our team collectively gets so
excited to just put the uniform on and go out and play in front of our awesome
fans. We definitely use that home-court advantage per se. Every game we talk
about defending our home court. That's really important to us and to our
coaching staff, and so it's definitely something we lean on and we really
enjoy.  
  
Q. Ally, is it safe to say you guys are playing your best basketball
right now, and what does that feel like to be playing so well at this time of
year?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I think we are playing really good basketball. I think
we're really developing our inside and outside game. We're getting better at
reading the shots that we should be taking, setting people up who are hot,
like you mentioned a little bit ago. But you want to be clicking at this time
in the postseason, and so it feels good to kind of be on a little bit of a
run, and hopefully we can keep that going forward.  
  
Q. What would it mean to be part of win 700 on Sunday?  
ALEXA KASTANEK: It's just special knowing that being a part of that, adding to
a legacy that's known for excellence. So I know for us, it's just been a
tremendous experience, and we're just grateful to continue to add to it.  
  
Q. Megan, are you okay? You took some falls that were --  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I think that was their game plan coming into it, just
to be a little bit more physical than usual. I was able to kick it out to our
shooters again, because they were collapsing inside. So I was just trying to
do my best to be physical right back, and it worked out tonight.  
  
LISA BLUDER: Well, again, thanking our fans for coming out tonight. It was
loud. It was fun. And just want to reiterate what Ally said. It means so much
to us when people come out and help give us energy and enjoy the game with us.
When people are getting excited and we can bring some happiness, it's really
fun. I thought our team came out tonight and played loose, they played
focused, and it was really fun to see. It just felt great on the floor all the
time, and to never not have the lead, to win the first three quarters, we
valued the ball, we took care of the ball, and then of course you shoot like
that.  
  
I'm so happy for Lex. Her senior year, having a game like that, it's perfect.
It's absolutely perfect for her. I'm so happy for her. It's a season high for
points for her, but I love our balanced scoring. We have almost five people in
double figures tonight. That was terrific to see. I thought we did a good job
defensively on Leonard.  
  
Q. What specifically were you trying to do against Leonard?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, we were mixing up our defenses. She's a sophomore point
guard, which sounds old compared to ours, but she's still a sophomore, right?
She's still a little bit more inexperienced, so we wanted to mix up our
defenses and try to really make her think out there, not get into a rhythm,
really identify where she was in the zone. But you know, I think we just tried
to really make her work hard for her points and wear her out a little bit.  
  
Q. How were you able to get the ball to the basket? They have two
gigantic post players.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think they were so focused on Megan coming into this game
that it opened up the threes, and wow, isn't that a perfect time for us to hit
our threes, when they are really -- because we were getting some pretty wide-
open threes. Sometimes our dribble-drive action creates threes, though, for
us. We're looking for rim or threes, so again, I think their concentration on
Megan -- and Megan does, she has two assists out here tonight, so she did find
her shooters out there, too.  
  
Q. All week you talked about keeping their three-point shooting in
check; is this kind of what you expected out of that, or were you happy with
--  
LISA BLUDER: You know they shot 33 percent. I'd like to have been a little bit
lower than that. But our focus was, okay, let's take away threes and make them
take hard twos. And I think we made them take hard twos. I mean, their overall
shooting percentage was 38 percent, so if you take out the threes, the twos
weren't that great. So I think we succeeded in making them take some hard
twos.  
  
Q. How quick does win No. 1 to No. 699 feel?  
LISA BLUDER: Actually it does seem like a while ago. When I think back to it,
it was a long time ago. Yeah, it's been a while.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=WOMEN%27S+NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 18, 2017

  

### [Dawn Plitzuweit](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33237)

### [Bridget Arens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33238)

### [Allison Arens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33239)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 78, South Dakota - 73  
  
Q. You went against Iowa toe-to-toe right until the very end; at least
your effort was there.  
BRIDGET ARENS: Yeah, I think it's disappointing to end that way, but I really
think that every girl on the roster really bought into what we were trying to
accomplish today. We may not have come out on top, but I think everybody gave
their best effort, and we hope to do that every time we step foot on the
floor.  
  
Q. What about going against Megan Gustafson? She's kind of a load down
there.  
BRIDGET ARENS: Yeah, she's a good player. She made us pay, but she's a good
player.  
  
Q. What makes her so good down there? Se was 15-of-16; everything was
going in.  
BRIDGET ARENS: She's got some size. She gets deep position, and when she's got
that size, she can finish over a lot. Her teammates did a great job of making
passes, and it was probably a team effort on their part.  
  
Q. Great 3-point shooting. Have you guys been doing that all year pretty
much?  
ALLISON ARENS: Well, we try to.  
  
Q. They got off to a fast start. What enabled you guys to get back so
quick in that second quarter?  
BRIDGET ARENS: Poise, getting in a flow. J.C. Bradley stepped up and made some
huge shots. She's a great shooter. She has a lot of confidence, so we knew
when the ball went in her hand that she was probably going to make them, but
just getting in the flow of the game was big.  
  
DAWN PLITZUWEIT: I was proud of how our kids competed throughout the course of
the game, and certainly dug ourselves a little bit of a hole early, and to
weather that storm and come back and be tied at halftime, even having an
opportunity going into the fourth quarter, I think the score was tied at that
point in time, and then one shot, one rebound, something goes our way, it can
be a different outcome.  
  
But it wasn't, and I thought Iowa did a really good job continuing to attack
our low post kids, and when we tried to double, then they dumped it down for a
lay-up opportunity. So tried a couple different ways to guard it, went into a
zone to try to guard it. Gustafson got a huge rebound at the end of the game,
and not because our kids weren't trying, she's just a little bit better than
our kids in that position at that time and that possession.  
  
Iowa has a really good chance to go on and continue being successful in the
WNIT, but really excited to watch them grow because they've got a bunch of
young kids, too. I think they do a really good job, and just really excited
about our kids and the way that they handled themselves with a lot of
composure and a lot of poise and played good basketball. It was a fun game to
be a part of.  
  
Q. You mentioned the double-team. Did you think going in you'd be able
to play that double-team more than you were able to?  
DAWN PLITZUWEIT: We did. We thought we could potentially get to it, but they
took advantage of it early so we tried to get into different ways to guard.
Bridget was doing a decent job for a little while just making catches a little
bit tougher, making the possessions go a little bit longer, but they continued
to find a way to get the ball in to Gustafson, and her size and her ability to
score. I thought our kids at times were doing as good of a job as they could
defending her, and she still made shots against us. She really played a great
basketball game.  
  
Q. What was your scouting report against Iowa? Was it what you expected,
inside game and outside shooters and balance and things like that?  
DAWN PLITZUWEIT: I think they're a team that scores the ball very efficiently,
and they did that tonight. They average 76 points a game, they score at a 47
clip, so you try to find different ways to slow them down, whether it means
try to turn them over, whether it means try to outscore them, and I thought in
stretches we got some things in transition, too. But they're a team that's
really hard to hold down because of the way that they can continue to score.  
  
Q. When you shoot free throws as well as you do, it's a nice luxury
because you're able to take the ball on the bounce and then when they collapse
you kick it out?  
DAWN PLITZUWEIT: Well, we've been fortunate during the course of the last few
weeks, maybe the last month of the season, we've been able to attack the post
and score inside, but that was a struggle for us tonight, so we had to find
another way to continue to attack the rim, and we did it off the dribble a lot
with Allison tonight, some with Ciara, some with Madison McKeever, and I
thought our kids did a really good job getting to the rim, and obviously got
to the free-throw line, and you're right, having an opportunity to finish and
make shots at the free-throw line gives you an opportunity to continue staying
in the game.  
  
Q. With how new this team was heading into this, new staff, new system,
new everything, and you guys end up with 23 wins, in the second round of the
WNIT and just looking how young your roster is and how many girls stepped up,
how encouraging is that looking towards the future?  
DAWN PLITZUWEIT: Well, it's really exciting for us, and we just talked to our
kids in the locker room just about the way that they approached the season.
They very easily could have come in and said, well, we've had success and
we've done it a very different way, and so we're not really sure, but they
never did that. They were always kids that bought in. They worked really hard.
They were incredibly coachable. They gave great, great effort, and they
continued to grow.  
  
I'm really proud of our seniors. Jasmine Trimboli, who should be back with us
next year after having a season-ending injury; Caitlin Duffy, who we hope can
get a sixth year, we'll have to kind of wait and see if that happens; and then
Abigail Fogg, and Bridget Arens, and those two kids played a ton of minutes
for us.  
  
Abby is a kid that last year shot one arc shot, and I think she made one
tonight. She's shot about 70 on the season so far, or close to 70 on the
season. So the development that she has had has been incredible. And Bridget,
too; Bridget hit some big shots. They went into it was either a box-and-one or
a triangle-and-two, and Bridget was left unguarded and hit some big shots. So
our seniors have done a great job of being great leaders for us this year, and
our younger kids have gotten some very valuable minutes, so the fact that
during the course of the game today we've had really four underclassmen,
freshmen and sophomores, actually five, Taylor did a great job when she came
in, a lot of young kids playing, really gets us excited about the future of
the program.

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 78, South Dakota - 73  
  
Q. Megan, you seem to get beat up about every game. Are you getting used
to that? You're stronger this year and you seem to really finish well. Is that
just part of playing center for Iowa and in the Big Ten and all that?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I'm pretty used to it by now. I know in practice our
post players are always going against each other and doing a really good job
of making each other better all the time, every day, and so I think that
really translates into games for sure.  
  
Q. You've had games where you're clicking offensively this year, but it
seemed like today was a different level?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I guess so. I know my teammates did a really good job of
setting me up. If they were collapsing I was able to hit them, and so I think
it just really worked well tonight.  
  
Q. Hannah, 5 for 6, you had 10 last game. You just really seem
comfortable down low right now with the ball?  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, I've told a lot of people this, but when you get to go
up against Megan Gustafson every day in practice, you're pretty prepared for
the posts that you go up against.  
  
Q. For either Megan or Hannah, the two of you and Chase and Hailey knew
something before the game, you guys kind of huddled up, the posts. What is
said during that and what is --  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, every game we kind of get in the huddle. We're kind of
pretty much just pumping each other up, trying to -- you know, we want these
four right here for our big post girls, and we can go against anyone, so just
kind of getting each other ready for the game.  
  
Q. Megan, kind of a weird question, but do you recall the shot you
missed about three minutes into the game, a little too hard off the glass? Do
you remember it?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: No, honestly, I don't remember it.  
  
Q. Ally, you lead in rebounds, you led in assists, points in the paint,
double figures. That's pretty much Iowa basketball, isn't it?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I think that that's what we always pride ourselves in.
Obviously the game plan, at least in the second half, was to get paint points,
to get paint touches. We felt like we had a huge mismatch there, so I think
that we did a really good job of sticking to that game plan, getting the ball
inside when we could, and then just -- they went on a run in that second
quarter, we came in at halftime, really tried to shore up the defensive end a
little bit. Obviously they went on a few more runs, but that's basketball for
you, but all in all, really glad that we responded the way that we did.  
  
Q. Kathleen, you set a school record for freshmen for assists. How many
of those would have gone to Megan or Hannah --  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Well, they're very good at finishing, though. It makes my job
really easy.  
  
Q. I didn't actually look at how many the number was, but did you feel
like you had an abnormal number of blocks today? Are we going to have to
change Iowa City to Block City?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Block City, Jock City, I don't know. No, I think we just did
a good job of getting out on shooters, rotating pretty well, especially when
we were in those scramble situations. So a few of those are kind of lucky, we
just jumped at the right time, especially on some of those three-point shots,
but that's always fun. I know Chase got a really big one in the first half,
and it's just always fun to get pumped up with your teammates about those
things.  
  
Q. Hannah, how would you say you've changed or improved as a player
since last year and maybe even since earlier this year?  
HANNAH STEWART: I think confidence is a big thing. You know, with experience
and with being on the court and just learning more of the 5 at Iowa and going
up against some Big Ten posts with time has really just built my confidence
up.  
  
Q. Megan, you guys were protecting a two-point lead late. Do you
remember the offensive rebound you got? Do you remember anything about that
play?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Oh, yes, I remember that one, and no, I was just there at the
right time, and so that was kind of a little bit of luck there, but I knew
that I had to get it, and I was kind of in the mode of I needed to get every
single rebound to get it to my teammates if I couldn't put it up myself.  
  
Q. Ally, you were so emotional that last game. I don't know if a letdown
would be the right word, but tough to reach that exact plateau because you
were sky high for that, obviously you got the record and stuff, but you seemed
pretty decent today.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I think it was just a different dynamic with this game.
Obviously we have different game plans each game, and obviously individually
the shots weren't falling this game, but we had advantages in a lot of other
areas, which I think that's what we look to do is take advantage of that.  
  
You know, we'll take that win any single day.  
  
Q. Coach said you were going to embrace this tournament. Do you feel
like you really have? It looks like you're having fun. I know it's not the
NCAA, but you're the last team in Iowa standing now.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I love being in this tournament. We treat it as our own NCAA
Tournament, so we're going to go and play our hardest, play together, and play
as long as we can.  
  
Q. Megan, did you think at some point, I haven't missed a shot in a
while? Did you think of that at all?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I mean, a little bit. My teammates have done such a
good job of looking for it, tapping in, or if they're on the high side,
getting it into me, and I know Kathleen had a couple amazing passes to me and
she dished, so I have to credit my teammates for sure.  
  
Q. Have you guys kind of stopped to think how special those numbers
Kathleen is putting up, and she only took over the point guard spot three
quarters of the way through the season? When Tania comes back next year, how
will the flow of the game be next year with all you guys on the floor?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I think we do a good job of finding each other and just
not playing one-on-one basketball more, just looking for our teammates, and
it's a lot more fun to play that way.  
  
Q. Megan, would you say this is your best game you've ever had?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It's kind of hard to compare to high school just because that
was a little bit different level of competition, but I mean, I was just there
to win. That was kind of my only goal, and so, again, my teammates and my
coaches, they knew, and I was able to get open, and if I wasn't open I was
able to get to my teammates.  
  
LISA BLUDER: First of all, I want to thank the crowd again for coming out to
support us today. I thought they were loud. They were engaged. Obviously home
court is really important during this tournament. It's the one national
tournament you get to play on your home court, so you might as well take
advantage of it and use it, and I think that we're doing a good job of using
our fans, and I think our fans are just tremendous at supporting our
basketball team. A big thank-you to them.  
  
With our team, I don't know what to even say about Megan anymore. I mean,
amazing. She just is an incredible -- I think you get a feel for her, she's an
incredible human being, too. She's fun to be around. She's always positive.
But the numbers that she put up today, a career high 33 points, 15 for 16, we
teased her after the game, what's wrong with you missing that shot. But just
an amazing number.  
  
And then Kathleen, we really need to note that, that she took the freshman
assist record away from Sam Logic. When you think of Sam Logic and who she
was, a first-round WNBA pick, and she's taking that record away, that shows
you what the potential is for Kathleen Doyle. Lex coming in, I'm really happy
for her as a senior, converting those free throws at the end.  
  
It was a really fun game to be a part of. Again, just really excited to keep
playing again because this is a good South Dakota team. This is a team that
won the whole tournament last year. They're well-coached. They're very
balanced. That's what scared me going into this game is they're such a
balanced basketball team.  
  
Q. Start of the third quarter, the first 13 points were all by the post
players. Megan got the first nine, then Hannah got a couple baskets. That was
the strategy?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, again, when you've got posts like that, why wouldn't you? I
thought that South Dakota did a pretty good job of trying to take that away
from us, sagging off of our perimeters, and you know, again, credit those
guys. 23 assists, so we got them the ball, even though I thought South Dakota
was really trying to pack it in on them.  
  
Q. Would you say you're moving the ball as well as you have all year the
last couple games or maybe just today?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I thought we started out the game doing a good job of
that. The second quarter, I thought we got a little stagnant. I think that was
part of our problem the second quarter. We had five field goals. We were doing
a little bit too much one-on-one, where we're more of a pass-and-distribute
team, and we want to be that type of team, and we got away from our identity a
little bit in that second quarter, but I think we got it back as the game went
on.  
  
Q. Is that just Bre at the end, she's not to give up an easy basket?  
LISA BLUDER: I mean, that's why she's in. We have a defensive team at the end,
we have a free throw team at the end, and Bre is definitely on the defensive
team. We've got to get her to quit fouling a little bit, but she's young and
she's learning, and I'm glad she's a Hawkeye.  
  
Q. Three-point defense, is it just a matter of South Dakota is just such
a good three-point shooting team?  
LISA BLUDER: They are a very good three-point team, and we actually said that
was one of our top keys was three-point defense, and we obviously didn't do a
very good job of that, especially against J.C. Bradley. She had four threes in
the second quarter, so the second quarter, we weren't offensively doing as
well as we were capable of. But also we gave up threes in that second quarter,
and I thought that gave them a lot of momentum going into the locker room.  
  
But I was pretty happy with the other three quarters.  
  
Q. Would you agree that of the 13 rebounds Megan had, the last one was
probably the most important because you were up two, missed a three, and you
called a time-out right away, ran a play, and she saw the clock and she
scored?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, and I thought our team -- I thought they did a great job of
focusing on timeouts and really executing. For example, on that one, we called
a time-out, we were able to check what type of defense they were in, we were
able to call a play, we were able to use the clock in that situation, so I
thought that was really good. I thought our team did a good job in those
situations -- when they were trying to foul us, the free throw situations. So
I was happy with the way we managed that at the end. I thought the team really
focused and did a good job of that.  
  
Q. How has Hannah evolved into a contributor for you?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, I think we were putting -- is it a round circle
in a square peg? What's the one? What do you say? Or is it vice versa? I think
we were trying to do that a little bit last year with her. We were trying to
have her play more of a 4 position all summer long she worked on it, and you
know, she just felt she was undersized to play the 5. She's not. She can play
the 5, and I think this year she's just embraced it, understood that that's
the best place for her on the floor, and she is such an important part of our
offense and defense as a 5 on the floor. And I love to see her confidence
growing. I absolutely love that.  
  
You know, and I talked to her a couple weeks ago about this is a tough
situation. You're playing behind one of the best posts really, I think, in the
Midwest. You're playing behind her, so it does limit your minutes, but the
minutes that you're in are so vitally important to us, and when you go in, we
have a lot of confidence in her, and I just love it that she's playing that
way.  
  
Q. What's it like to watch her and Megan go at it in practice?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, they battle. But you know who I feel sorry for is our
gray squad, our practice guys. They really take a beating in there with those
two.  
  
Q. Is there a way to get them both on the floor do you think at the same
time?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, there is a way to get them on the floor. I don't know
that it's the best for us. I mean, I don't know that we're best offensively
with both of them on the floor. You know, I kind of go with Chase and Megan a
little bit more or Chase and Hannah on the floor together. But when Megan is
in there, I kind of really like to isolate her. But there's always
possibilities of that.  
  
Q. What do you think is going to happen next round? Do you think maybe
South Dakota State -- if it's South Dakota State, do you think maybe they've
earned a home game since they beat you during the regular season, or what do
you think is going to happen?  
LISA BLUDER: I don't think any of that matters. I think what matters is money
and attendance, and unfortunately that's the way it is with the WNIT, and so
we'll have to wait until after tomorrow's game to see our opponent and where
the game will be.  
  
If we had our druthers, we'd probably like to play on Thursday. I know our men
are playing at home next week, so if we have the option to choose, that's what
we would choose. But we have to wait and see what happens with that game
tomorrow and then who they decide will be the host.  
  
Q. Chase didn't score, but she had five rebounds, three assists and
three blocked shots.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah. You know, and I had a hard time getting her in at the end
because when they have five guards basically on the floor, it's hard to have
two posts in there at the same time. And so it was hard for me to get Chase in
toward that end in that fourth quarter, end of the third quarter, just because
of matching up against them.  
  
Q. Nine blocks and five steals, so active hands on defense I guess you
could say, a handful led to transition buckets.  
LISA BLUDER: I like the blocks. The blocks to me are kind of -- they're kind
of powerful, right? They kind of make you stand up a little straighter. The
crowd loves it, so those are fun. So it was really fun to see us get a couple
of key blocks.

# [WOMEN'S NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2017&title=WOMEN%27S+NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Kellie Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30789)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 95, Missouri State - 74  
  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, for us it's a season-ending game and it's never easy and
never fun. So proud of our team and our effort and our fight. Congratulations
to Iowa for the win and for advancing. They obviously were really good
offensively today. When your first quarter shooting percentage is 50 something
and it's the lowest of the game, then you're on to something. So we just had a
hard time guarding them from a lot of different areas.  
  
Q. Talk about that hard time guarding them, especially inside, how much
did their size give you trouble?  
KELLIE HARPER: I think their size did, but also I think their first step on
the perimeter gave us some problems. They were really aggressive offensively
getting to the paint off the dribble, but they had pretty good balance with
getting it to the paint off the pass as well. So, we tried pressure, we tried
sagging, we tried a little bit of everything, we just couldn't find anything
that would work.  
  
Q. How would you evaluate Ally Disterhoft? She ended up as the Iowa
career scoring leader.  
KELLIE HARPER: I've seen Ally play many years now, even before she got to
Iowa. So I've always been a fan, I've always enjoyed watching her play. She's
so fundamentally sound and skilled and is very aggressive, but on the flip
side is unselfish. It crossed my mind, in the first half, there was a fast
break opportunity, I thought she should have gotten to the basket, and she
dished. And I'm thinking, this kid's going to try to break a record and she's
passing the ball. So I've always had a lot of respect for her game.

## March 16, 2017

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 95, Missouri State - 74  
  
LISA BLUDER: I really want to thank the crowd that came out tonight. Really
appreciate their support in the WNIT and coming out and supporting us over
Spring Break. Hopefully, they will all come back, plus more, on Saturday at 3
p.m. But, obviously, Ally becoming the all-time leading scorer here, that's a
record that stood for about 35 years, that's an amazing accomplishment and
quite fitting I thought that she tied it on a layup and then got the record
off of a driving drive as well. Just really, really proud of her. To come in
here and to accomplish something like that is amazing. Really happy that I got
to be a part of it. Happy that all of us coaches just got to see this happen
and be a part of it. But really happy for her. Another record that fell
tonight? Megan set a single season rebounding record. And again, when you
think of the players that have come here, the athletes that have come here,
when you go back to that Final Four year, that is an amazing accomplishment.
So I'm really happy for Megan. She had her 16th double double tonight. But
overall, this was a really good team victory. I know there was some individual
records set tonight, but what a great team victory. I loved our bench play
tonight, I liked our paint play.  
  
Q. Ally, you got fouled on the record breaking shot. I thought I saw you
take kind of an extra moment on the ground kneeling down when the crowd was
going crazy. Kind of what's going through your head when you set the record?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Honestly, I just have to give it all up to the big man
upstairs. But relief was probably the biggest emotion at that time. We haven't
made it a focal point in our conversation within the team room or with the
coaches, but it's definitely been a topic of conversation outside Carver. And
Haley came up to me before the game in shoot around and said, Ally, just don't
put too much pressure on yourself. And I think I just needed to hear that from
her. To go out there, to obviously play aggressive, take the shots when they
were there, but just continue to play team basketball. And it's hard not to
get emotional because I've had so many people support me along the way, my
coaches have been incredible, my teammates, my family. So, relief, but happy
with that.  
  
Q. How tough is it not to look up at the score and foul chart and see
okay I got 12 points to go, I got 10 points to go.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: It was a little difficult, just because it's so big with all
these renovations now. But like I said, I think I've always played my best
basketball when I've taken the focus off myself and I think that that can be
said for anyone on our team, because our style of basketball is you pass up a
good shot for a great shot, you work to get your teammates involved. And like
I said before, when you focus on the team, those individual successes will
fall in line. Just like how Megan has gotten her rebounding record. She's
never focused on herself, it's always, how can I help the team, and I try to
do the same.  
  
Q. Coach told a story about being on a poster as a nine-year-old, but to
be on that poster and to be the all-time career scoring leader, it almost like
a Cinderella story, isn't it?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, it's a really cool story and I'm so appreciative and
grateful for all of the opportunities that have been given along the way.
Obviously, the hard work has gone into it, but a lot of kids work hard and
they don't get these opportunities given to them and the coaches have believed
in me since I was a freshman, they set me up to succeed out on the floor as
well as off the floor. My teammates have done the same. So I'm just incredibly
appreciative, grateful, thankful for all of the staff helping me get here, for
sure.  
  
Q. Was it relief going through your head, too?  
LISA BLUDER: I was excited. I got a little emotional because I was so happy
for Ally to get this record. But I think it shows that I can identify talent
at eight years old.  
  
Q. Megan, your thought about your record tonight.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I think that I love rebounding, that's something that I'm
kind of meant to do here. I kind of think of it as whenever I get a rebound
it's not my rebound, it's Iowa's rebound. So, again, like Ally said about her
record, I would have to say the same thing, it's all my teammates that helped
me throughout this time , and coaches have always believed in me in
rebounding, so I'm really happy about it.  
  
Q. Ally, what did you think about the crowd reaction? It was clear that
everybody knew what was at stake.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I know. I missed them a few times too. I knew it, because I
would miss and they would go, "oh" and I was like, sorry, guys, we'll get the
next one, I promise. But the crowd, our fan support in my four years here has
been incredible. There's nothing like being an Iowa Hawkeye, running out of
that tunnel, hearing the fans cheering you on. And their support over the fast
four years has been incredible. So, really appreciative for them, grateful for
tonight, hoping we can get something similar against South Dakota on Saturday.  
  
Q. How do you feel about having to come out and play again in a mere 42
hours?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Ready to go. I think we're going to get some good night
sleep, rest, and get ready to have a good practice tomorrow and some film,
too.  
  
Q. Ally, does it feel like this pressure is now off you? Do you think
now, okay, let's see what we can do the rest of the way?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I think that it's always kind of been in the back of my
mind that this was possible. And just because it's been in the conversation,
like I said, outside of Carver, it has been weighing a little bit on me, I
think, subconsciously. Even though, like I said, coaches, teammates have done
a great job of taking that pressure off. But yeah, hopefully now we can just
go out there and just compete really hard and try to make good things happen
for the team.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel like you were a little bit rusty in the first
quarter, that it was just sort of some early turnovers, because you haven't
played a game for forever.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I think that that's just sometimes how basketball goes.
They go on some of their runs, we go on some of ours. We have been practicing
really hard over the course of the past week and a half, two weeks, so can't
really blame it on that, because we have really been getting after it in
practice. But I think once you start getting into the flow of things a little
bit more that you could really tell that.  
  
Q. Hannah had 10 points, just bam, bam, bam. Can you talk about that.  
LISA BLUDER: We just felt like we had an inside height advantage and talent
advantage. I felt like we had both. And we needed to take advantage of it. It
was one of our keys is to push the ball and get the ball inside. If you've
never gone against Megan and Hannah, it's pretty tough in that first time it
happens to you.  
  
Q. Following up on that, 15 points in the paint that's a pretty high
number.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, and what I was happy about is when they went to zone we
were still able to get it into the paint and that's where Hannah really got
some of hers was against the zone. So that was nice to see. We talked to our
team a lot about stressing a good shot from a not such a good shot. And
tonight I think we set a WNIT record for field goal percentage in a game. We
shot over 60 percent, I believe, from the field. And we had 23 assists too, so
I thought that was really great team basketball.  
  
Q. Nice to see Christina out there. When did she kind of get back to
game readiness?  
LISA BLUDER: She was completely -- she was healed of her concussion, but when
you're out that long, you got to get your legs back. And it was nice to see
her. I thought off of the bench we had a lot of really good performances off
the bench. And we only played 21 minutes for Ally and for Mak. Those are our
leading minutes, and that bodes well for Saturday, when you do have a quicker
turn around.  
  
Q. Ally tied the record and there was a point where she came over and
you two, you said something to her. Was that to do with the record or
something completely opposite.  
LISA BLUDER: I said, do you want to get it tonight or do you want to get it on
Saturday. And she said, tonight. And I said, okay, we're going to leave her in
then. So we had a significant lead and I could have taken her out, definitely.
I thought it might have been kind of fun to tie it today and break it on
Saturday, but I think she just wanted it over with and so I was going to
listen to what she said.  
  
Q. Why has it taken so long for someone to break that record that is a
lot of points but...  
LISA BLUDER: It's a lot of points, yeah, you score over 2,000 points and it
has to be the perfect storm. Like you have to come in and you really have to
stay healthy and you have to start all four years in order to accomplish a
goal like that. And not all the time does all that happen, right? And then you
have to be pretty good scorer on top of it. So, Ally just, obviously, had a
good opportunity, she stayed healthy, and she was a very good basketball
player.  
  
Q. It's not out of the realm of possibility it could be broken in two
years.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, that's the goal that's really what we would like to see
happen is this, to Megan to add on to it and then somebody else add on to it
after that.  
  
Q. Talk about the start of the second half. You had a 10-0 run, a couple
3s. How important was that?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, it was fun coming out of the locker room and we hit I think
four straight shots, one 3 for sure in there. It was clicking. And it was, it
felt good. Again, I just thought this was such a great team win and those are
the fun wins, when everybody can contribute and feel good about their play.  
  
Q. Do you know anything about South Dakota?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they are the defending WNIT champ, so that makes it kind of
interesting, going against them in the second round. Obviously, they have been
here before. They do have a new coach this year. But I know Dawn, she was an
assistant at Michigan for awhile. She's done a great job. But Coach Jensen has
the scout and she's watched three or four games on them already, so when I go
upstairs we'll watch the game tonight and then prepare the scout for tomorrow
and at 12:30 tomorrow we'll meet with our team and present it to them at that
time.
